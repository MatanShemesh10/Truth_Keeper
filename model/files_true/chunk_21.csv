Pacific nations crack down on North Korean ships as Fiji probes more than 20 vessels,"WELLINGTON (Reuters) - South Pacific island nations are scouring shipping records for vessels with links to North Korea after Fiji said it had identified 20 falsely flagged ships it suspects the isolated regime is using to evade United Nations sanctions. Fiji, along with Interpol and the Singapore-based regional shipping regulator Tokyo MoU, are investigating the vessels for links to North Korea, a spokesman for the country s Maritime Safety Authority (MSAF) told Reuters on Friday. Interpol and Tokyo MoU did not immediately respond to requests for comment on their investigations. The 18 members of the Pacific Islands Forum this month agreed to launch an audit of every ship registered in the Pacific to search for any links to North Korea. New Zealand Foreign Affairs Minister Gerry Brownlee said Pacific countries, including his own, were concerned North Korea was using falsely flagged cargo ships as one avenue to trade goods in spite of sanctions.  What we do know is that declared North Korean GDP (gross domestic product) is not big enough to support the nuclear program that they re running so there has to be significant black market or offbook revenue going into the country,  Brownlee told Reuters in a phone interview this week. The move came as the UN on Monday ramped up sanctions on North Korea, including tightening up oversight of vessels on the high seas. Authorities will now be allowed to check suspected vessels for prohibited cargo with the authority of the flag country.  UN sanctions introduced in August banned North Korean exports of seafood as part of efforts to curtail the regime s access to foreign funds. North Korea had been expected to earn an estimated $295 million from seafood in 2017, one U.N. diplomat said. In Fiji s case, the North Korean-linked ships had adopted the island nation s flag without formally registering, the MSAF said. It was not known in what way the possibly more-than 20 vessels were linked to North Korea or what their suspected activities or locations were. The MSAF declined to provide details due to the ongoing investigation. In addition to the fraudulent use of flags, Pacific governments were concerned North Korean vessels could be quietly registering in nations that allow international ships to use their flags.     If it s not clear why they re on that register, in other words, they re not regular callers into Pacific ports, then further investigation is needed to untangle the ship owner,  said Brownlee. The review would take place over the next couple of months, Brownlee said, and Australia and New Zealand would provide intelligence to help the small island nations check any North Korean connections.

Three suspected al Qaeda militants killed in Yemen drone strike,"ADEN, Yemen (Reuters) - Three suspected al Qaeda militants were killed in a drone strike in southern Yemen late on Thursday, a local security official and residents said. The strike in Mudiyah district in Abyan province on the Arabian Sea coast had targeted a motorcycle which the suspected militants were riding, the official said. Abyan is one of several provinces in central and southern Yemen where Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and its local affiliate Ansar al-Sharia operate. AQAP has taken advantage of a more than two-year civil war between the Iran-aligned Houthi group and President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi s Saudi-backed government to strengthen its position in the impoverished country. The United States has repeatedly attacked AQAP with aircraft and unmanned drones in what U.S. officials say is a campaign to wear down the group s ability to coordinate attacks abroad. The Saudi-led coalition supporting Hadi has also launched thousands of air strikes against the Houthis which control Yemen s capital and much of the country s north. The Houthis have in turn fired rockets towards Saudi cities and villages. They say their attacks are in response to Saudi strikes on Yemeni cities and villages. The coalition spokesman said on Thursday that a Saudi pilot had died a day earlier when his plane crashed in the southern province of Abyan due to  technical failure , the Saudi news agency SPA said. The war has killed more than 10,000 people. ",worldnews,"September 15, 2017 ",1
Chinese academics prod Beijing to consider North Korea contingencies,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese academics are publicly broaching the idea that China and the United States should share plans on how to deal with a  potential conflict on the Korean Peninsula, a sign some say of how North Korea s weapons test may be making Beijing more open to the once taboo subject. Chinese officials have rebuffed top U.S. military brass for years in their efforts to share contingencies for war or regime collapse in Pyongyang, suspicious over Washington s intentions and fearful that such engagement could further alienate North Korea, their once steadfast wartime ally. Jia Qingguo, the dean of the School of International Studies at China s elite Peking University and a respected advisor to Chinese leaders, said in an article this week that with the chances of war increasing daily, it might be time for China to  prepare for the worst .  When war becomes a real possibility, China must be prepared. And, with this in mind, China must be more willing to consider talks with concerned countries on contingency plans,  Jia wrote in an article first published on the online East Asia Forum run out of Australian National University. Given recent developments,  Beijing may have no better choice than to start talking with Washington and Seoul , Jia said. Ties between China and North Korea have deteriorated sharply in recent years, to the point some diplomats and experts fear Beijing may become, like Washington, a target of its neighbor s ire. Jia s comments, at the forefront of what is still a sensitive debate in China, were made before North Korea on Friday fired a missile that flew over Japan s northern Hokkaido far out into the Pacific Ocean.  That test came after the U.N. Security Council s latest round of sanctions on Monday banning North Korea s textile exports and capping fuel supplies in response to Pyongyang s accelerated effort to target the United States with a powerful, nuclear-tipped missile. Xie Tao, associate dean at the School of English and International Studies at Beijing Foreign Studies University, said Chinese academics in years past would typically only express their opinions on whether China should be sharing plans with Washington behind closed doors.  Now you can get all sorts of people from the left and right and they are allowed to make their views public,  Xie told Reuters.  You could interpret that as a signal that the Chinese government is perhaps willing now to consider, if not actually join up to, contingency plans,  Xie said.  My sense is that there must be some in-depth discussion about what could potentially happen if there is a collapse or internal chaos   how Beijing and Washington should respond to this.  During a trip to China in August, Joseph Dunford, Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, attended Chinese military drills at China s Northern Theater Command in the city of Shenyang, which covers China s border with North Korea.  Some analysts perceived that as China opening a crack in the door to its own preparations, but neither side are showing their cards to the public. Dunford said in Beijing during that visit that despite Washington s urgings the  conditions aren t set for such a detailed conversation  between the two militaries.  U.S. military officials have privately voiced frustration that previous channels established for direct military communications line are essentially unstaffed on the Chinese side. Dunford said creating a round-the-clock  responsive  communications link that could be used in a crisis was a top priority for military ties.

Swedish PM survives vote of no-confidence,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven easily survived a parliamentary vote of no confidence brought on Friday by the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats over a botched IT outsourcing project that may have led to the leak of sensitive information. Only 43 of the parliament s 349 members supported the motion. Had Lofven lost, the government would have resigned, just a year before a general election. Two ministers have resigned over the potential leak of sensitive data as a result of a deal under which IBM Sweden took over some IT functions of the Swedish Transport Agency. During the last 37 years, only eight votes of no-confidence have been tabled in parliament. None has been successful. ",worldnews,"September 15, 2017 ",1

Peru's Congress ousts cabinet as political crisis deepens,"LIMA (Reuters) - Peru s opposition-controlled Congress ousted center-right President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski s cabinet in a vote of no-confidence early on Friday, pitching the copper-producing Andean country into its worst political crisis in years. In a gamble that will likely force him to scrap his plans to travel abroad later in the day, Kuczynski had dared Congress on Wednesday to revoke its confidence in his cabinet if it insisted on forcing out his second education minister. Under Peru s constitution, if Congress does not deliver a president a vote of confidence for his cabinets twice, the president can summon new legislative elections. But the rightwing populist opposition party Popular Force, led by Kuczynski s defeated electoral rival, Keiko Fujimori, answered Prime Minister Fernando Zavala s request on Thursday to back his cabinet with a resounding  no.  Peru s single-chamber Congress, where Popular Force has an absolute majority, voted 77-22 to dismiss Zavala s cabinet. Kuczynski now has 72 hours to swear in a new cabinet. While he cannot name Zavala as prime minister again, Kuczynski can reappoint other ministers in his cabinet. Going forward, Kuczynski might have a freer hand to govern in the remaining four years of his term if the opposition steers clear of a fresh confrontation out of fear of losing its majority. But several opposition lawmakers said they would welcome taking the battle to the ballot box.  If they close Congress, we re not afraid,  said Hector Becerril, a hard-line Popular Force lawmaker.  We re willing to seek the people s support again. And it won t be 13 seats we win, or 73. There ll be 100 of us!  The vote came on the eve of Kuczynski s 8-day trip abroad, which includes plans for dinner with U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday, a speech before the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday and a meeting with Pope Francis in the Vatican. Kuczynski, a 78-year-old former Wall Street banker who has vowed to modernize Peru and revive economic growth, took office a year ago with one of the weakest mandates of any president, having beat Fujimori by a razor-thin margin while his party only secured a small portion of seats in Congress. In a plenary debate that stretched on for more than seven hours, opposition lawmakers portrayed Kuczynski as an out-of-touch lobbyist who lacks authority and poses a danger to Peru. Congress has forced Kuczynski s former education and finance ministers to resign amid allegations of ethical breaches, while a third minister quit to avoid being censured. Popular Force announced this week that it planned to propose censuring Education Minister Marilu Martens over her handling of a teachers  2-month strike, which her supporters alleged was fueled by an alliance between Popular Force and extremists.  We can t deliver the head of a minister as a trophy,  Zavala told lawmakers after walking to Congress with the rest of the cabinet in a show of union.  It s clear to us that the country can t make progress like this.  ",worldnews,"September 15, 2017 ",1
Taiwan jails mainland Chinese man on national security charge,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - A Taiwan court on Friday jailed a mainland Chinese man for 14 months for breaching national security laws, following months of strained relations over China s detention of a national from the self-ruled island. China, which sees Taiwan as a wayward province to be taken back by force, if necessary, severed official communications last year to pressure President Tsai Ing-wen, whose party traditionally favors independence, to concede its position.  Zhou Hongxu, formerly a student in Taiwan, was charged for seeking to arrange meetings between a Taiwan government official and a Chinese Communist party official outside Taiwan, in return for payment to the Taiwan official, a court document showed. Zhou  intentionally  jeopardized national security, though the attempt was unsuccessful, the court said in the document released after the verdict.    Zhou, who had met the Chinese official at a 2014 event in  Shanghai in 2014, did not plead guilty, his lawyer said, despite a confession during the trial that he later described as having  been made in improper circumstances.  He appeared in court on Friday in a calm mood and dressed in dark colors.  The court reduced his sentence, taking into account his confession, and the failure of the bid to breach national security, it said in its statement. On Monday, a Taiwanese activist, Li Ming-che, confessed in a Chinese court to attempting to subvert the Beijing government,  videos of his hearing released by Chinese authorities showed, although his wife refused to recognize the court s authority. Li, a community college teacher known for his pro-democracy and rights activism, had gone missing on a trip to mainland China in March. ",worldnews,"September 15, 2017 ",1
"Philippines orders retraining, reassignment of 1,200 police after alleged abuses","MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippine capital s police chief ordered that the entire 1,200-member police force in one of Manila s biggest areas be relieved of duty and retrained on Friday in response to a series of controversies, including the killing of two teenagers. Metro Manila s top officer Oscar Albayalde said all police personnel in the Caloocan area of the capital would undergo retraining and reorientation before being reassigned to other police units, not necessarily in Manila.  We will start with the city s police precincts 2 and 7,  Albayalde said. All personnel in Caloocan s headquarters and seven precincts would be temporarily replaced by the regional public safety battalion, a combat-trained unit.  This will be done in batches,  he said. Albayalde did not say how long the retraining would last and how long it would take for the entire police force in Caloocan to be replaced. It is the first time an entire city police unit has been relieved of its duties since President Rodrigo Duterte unleashed his bloody crackdown against illegal drugs 15 months ago, a campaign that has killed thousands of Filipinos. The move comes amid intense scrutiny of police activities in Caloocan in the wake of the killing of 17-year old Kian Loyd Delos Santos last month in what police said was an anti-drugs operation. His lawyers and family say he was murdered in cold blood. Three officers involved in his killing say he fired at them and they acted in self-defense. Duterte, known for his frequent speeches that call for drug dealers to be killed, ordered a thorough investigation into the Delos Santos killing and warned police he would not tolerate abuses. Another teenager, Carl Arnaiz, suffered a similar fate, accused of trying to rob a taxi driver and shooting at police who tried to arrest him. The taxi driver told reporters on Sunday he saw him alive in custody. About two dozen Caloocan residents, holding placards saying  Stop the Killings , held a noisy protest outside the precinct s police headquarters. Dozens of police trainees stood in front and watched the protest. Friday s order came only a day after Philippine media reported members of the Caloocan precinct 4 raided an elderly woman s home and reportedly stole money in an incident captured on closed circuit television cameras. Reuters could not confirm the report independently. Activists accuse police of executing suspected users and dealers systematically during anti-drugs operations and say official reports that say victims violently resisted arrest are implausible, and contrary to witness accounts. Police reject those allegations and Duterte has been furious at critics and political opponents who say he has a  kill policy . The video of the alleged robbery was uploaded on social media sites and went viral, which angered senior police generals. Albayalde immediately issued the orders to relieve the Caloocan precincts.  From what we have seen this has been done or will continue to be done by others so it is best to implement this preemptive measure to avoid similar incidents,  Albayalde told reporters. He warned other districts in Manila could face similar sanctions if they did not shape up. ",worldnews,"September 15, 2017 ",1
South Korea's Moon says North Korea provocations will result in more isolation,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean President Moon Jae-in said on Friday North Korea s latest launch of a missile over Japan will only result in further diplomatic and economic isolation for the North, and officials said Moon had also warned of possible new threats.  President Moon ordered officials to closely analyze and prepare for new possible North Korean threats like EMP (electro-magnetic pulse) and biochemical attacks,  Moon s spokesman Park Su-hyun told a briefing. North Korea said earlier this month it was developing a hydrogen bomb that can carry out an EMP attack. Experts disagree on whether the North would have the capability to mount such an attack, which would involve setting off a bomb in the atmosphere that could cause major damage to power grids and other infrastructure.

Cambodia PM calls on U.S. to withdraw Peace Corps volunteers,"PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen called on the United States on Friday to withdraw Peace Corps volunteers in an escalating row over accusations that U.S. agents conspired with an opposition leader to plot treason. Hun Sen was responding after the U.S. embassy in Phnom Penh issued a travel warning that urged citizens to show caution amid  anti-American rhetoric by officials .  Are you scaring Cambodians?  Hun Sen said of the United States in an address to garment workers at factories which export much of their production to the United States.  Are you prepared to invade Cambodia and that s why you told Americans to be careful? It s good if you pull out the Peace Corps,  Hun Sen said. The U.S. embassy declined to comment. It has previously dismissed the accusations of collusion with opposition leader Kem Sokha and called for his release. On Friday, the embassy was swearing in 71 new volunteers from the Peace Corps, which sends Americans abroad to help with local projects with the stated goal of promoting mutual understanding. Hun Sen said on Friday that he had ordered an investigation into whether any Americans were involved with Kem Sokha. Opponents of Hun Sen accuse him of arresting Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) leader Kem Sokha and cracking down on independent media and other critics ahead of a general election next year. The evidence presented against Kem Sokha is a video recorded in 2013 in which he discusses a strategy to win power with the help of unspecified Americans. Hun Sen, a close ally of China, has taken a series of measures against U.S. interests this year from ending joint military exercises to expelling a naval aid unit to forcing a U.S.-funded pro-democracy group to leave. On Thursday, Hun Sen said he was suspending cooperation with Washington to find the remains of Americans killed in the Vietnam War. According to the U.S Embassy, more than 500 Peace Corps volunteers have served and worked in Cambodia since 2006, providing English teaching and teacher training as well as community health education.  U.S. President John F. Kennedy established the Peace Corps in 1961 to promote world peace and friendship. ",worldnews,"September 15, 2017 ",1
Australia to move 200 asylum seekers to new PNG detention center,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Approximately two hundred men held in a remote Australian-run detention center will be moved to a new facility within weeks, the country s immigration minister said. Peter Dutton, Australia s immigration minister, said those men who have their refugee applications denied, ruling them ineligible for resettlement to the United States, and who are from countries such as Iran which precludes forced deportations, will be transferred to a new detention facility within Papua New Guinea (PNG) after Oct. 31.  Those people, who total about 200, who have been found not to be refugees are to be moved into an alternative place of detention away from the regional processing center,  Dutton told Australia s parliament. Dutton s comments mark the first insight into how Australia plans to manage the end of its policy of detaining asylum seekers in PNG, where 800 men are held, many of whom for four years. Canberra s hardline immigration policy requires asylum seekers intercepted at sea trying to reach Australia to be sent for processing at camps on PNG s Manus Island and on Nauru. They are told they will never be settled in Australia. Question marks remain, however, about the fate of the remaining men on Manus as a refugee swap deal with the United States stalls. Former U.S. President Barack Obama late last year agreed to resettle up to 1,250 asylum seekers held in Australian immigration centers in PNG and Nauru. In exchange, Australia agreed to take Central American refugees. Australia had hoped the men would have been resettled by Oct. 31 but with the swap deal stalling under President Trump after the U.S. hit it annual intake cap, Canberra is left seeking a solution. Australia s security contract with Spanish company Ferrovial SA will expire on Oct. 31, forcing the closure of the camp that has been subject to violence from locals.  PNG officials have sought to transfer the men to a transit center nearby but nearly all, citing fears of violence, have refused despite threats that it may rule them out of U.S. resettlement.  We are not willing to move from the center unless we are leaving for a country that is safe,  said one, who declined to be identified because of the fear it would jeopardize his application for U.S. resettlement.

Brazil's Temer faces new graft charges over JBS testimony,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President Michel Temer was charged with obstruction of justice and racketeering on Thursday, according to a statement posted on the prosecutor general s office website, threatening to delay the government s economic reform agenda in Congress.    It is the second set of criminal charges filed against the president based on the plea-bargain testimony of the owners of the world s largest meatpacker, JBS SA. They accused Temer of taking bribes in return for political favors and of conspiring to buy the silence of a witness who could implicate the leader.  In a statement on Thursday, Temer strongly rejected all allegations of wrongdoing.  Temer s earlier corruption charge, that he took bribes from JBS officials, was blocked in August by Temer s allies in the lower house of Congress, which has the power to decide whether a president should stand trial by the Supreme Court. Despite the lower house s move to block the charges, they remain valid and can be pursued by prosecutors once Temer leaves office. His term ends on Jan. 1, 2019. Brazil s top public prosecutor Rodrigo Janot has also filed charges against Joesley Batista, the billionaire former chairman of JBS who implicated Temer. Batista was arrested on Sunday for concealing other crimes in his plea bargain deal. Batista s lawyer Antonio Carlos Kakay rejected the charges brought by Janot, arguing in a statement that the prosecutor had violated the rules of plea bargains by using his client s testimony to incriminate him. On Wednesday, Batista s brother Wesley, the chief executive officer of JBS SA, was also arrested for alleged insider trading to avoid hefty losses related to the May plea deal. Late on Thursday, Supreme Court Justice Edson Fachin converted Joesley and executive Ricardo Saud s temporary detentions into preventative detention and gave them 10 days to respond before ruling on Janot s request to withdraw their plea deal.   The arrests of the Batista brothers have improved Temer s prospects of surviving the new charges and serving out his term through 2018. Temer and his allies expect the new charges to be voted in the lower house next month with wider support than he obtained in the 263-227 vote last month blocking a trial. Fachin heeded a request from Temer s defense not to deliver the accusation to the lower house until after a supreme court plenary vote on the matter. The vote should be held before Wednesday. The allegations are part of Brazil s sprawling corruption probes that have resulted in ex-President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva s conviction and four pending trials; investigations and charges implicating three former presidents and dozens of members of Congress; and guilty verdicts against well over 100 powerful business and political figures.      Most of the schemes involve political kickbacks in return for contracts at government-run enterprises or cheap loans from Brazil s state development bank.     The racketeering charge against Temer was based on the plea bargain testimony of L cio Funaro, a businessman who accused the president and his closest aides in the ruling PMDB party of operating a criminal organization to collect bribes in exchange for political influence.     The obstruction of justice charge was based on testimony by Joesley Batista that Temer endorsed payments of hush money to try to keep Funaro from talking.     A short legislative agenda ahead of an election year, the absence of public pressure to oust Temer and the lack of any convincing replacement for him are also likely to weigh in the president s favor.      Given the short timetable, the general public apathy and lack of a viable alternative, it is quite possible that Brasilia will continue to punt this down the road,  said Matthew Taylor, a professor at the American University in Washington.

"Saviors or profiteers? Bangladesh fishermen rescue Rohingya, for a price","SHAMLAPUR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - For tens of thousands of Rohingya Muslims, an informal fleet of small wooden fishing boats has meant deliverance from what they say is an indiscriminate assault on their villages by the Myanmar army. Deliverance, however, comes at a price. Some refugees told Reuters they paid as much as 10,000 taka ($122) per adult to boatmen to make the five-hour crossing from Myanmar s coast to ports in southern Bangladesh. While the fishermen say they have a moral obligation to help desperate fellow Muslims escaping persecution, Bangladeshi officials accuse them of profiteering. Ordered to stamp out what they call human trafficking, they have made arrests and even set fire to fishing boats.  Of course we want to keep going back to rescue more people. Our Muslim brothers and sisters are in a bad situation, so I have to go and bring them,  said Mohammed Alom, 25, a fisherman in the Bangladeshi village of Shamlapur. Around 400,000 Rohingya have arrived in Bangladesh in less than three weeks and people are still coming, by land as well as by sea, after attacks by Rohingya militants sparked a fierce counteroffensive by Myanmar s army. Senior United Nations officials have described the violence as  ethnic cleansing . The influx is placing huge strain on authorities in southern Bangladesh, one of the poorest parts of a poor country.  Don t say rescuers. The rescuers should be going and they should rescue people, not in terms of money,  said Lieutenant Colonel Ariful Islam, Border Guards Bangladesh commander in Teknaf on the country s southern tip, referring to the fishermen bringing refugees ashore.  These people are very poor, it s just extorting from them whatever they have. We are helping those who arrived, but we re trying to insist that no human trafficking should take place.  Reuters interviewed three Rohingya fishermen and two Bangladeshi boat owner-operators, all of whom had made at least two visits to Myanmar in recent weeks. The men didn t believe the profits they made detracted from what they saw as a rescue mission. Shaif Ullah, 34, a Bangladeshi, who co-owns a fishing boat, said he made 100,000 taka ($1,220) rescuing the family of a Rohingya in Malaysia who paid him via BKash, a popular mobile money service, after he returned to Bangladeshi shores.  People from Malaysia and Saudi Arabia call me and tell me to go there to get their family,  he said.  They are crying for my help. I take money from them, yes, but it s also a humanitarian act.   Two refugees have told Reuters their family members were detained by fishermen or brokers in Bangladesh when they could not pay for the journey. Several also complained they had to hand over gold and other jewelry to boat operators.  We had no chance to negotiate with the boatmen,  said Ali Johar, 75, an elder from his village in southern Maungdaw, just across the Naf river that forms the border between Myanmar and Bangladesh, now staying in Shamlapur. He handed over his wife s gold necklace and a gold ring, in addition to 7,000 taka for the rescue of him and about 30 members of his extended family, including young children, he said.  But we are grateful to the fishermen for bringing us here,  he said.  There were so many people trying to get here. If they didn t bring us, we would be stuck.  Pronay Chakma says it was a  stroke of fate  that thrust him into a key role in Bangladesh s response to the crisis. The 31-year-old administrator arrived in Teknaf to start a new job as sub-district assistant commissioner for land on Aug. 23, two days before northwestern Myanmar exploded into violence.  The thing is that, yes, the fishermen can go there, no problem, but if they demand money from the pain of stricken people, is it humanitarian? No,  he said. Chakma - a Buddhist member of the Chakma tribe who live scattered throughout South Asia - is an executive magistrate, which means he can hand down jail terms in simple criminal cases. He interrupted an interview with Reuters to sentence a man to three months for possession of five methamphetamine tablets. Chakma and another local official have sentenced at least 100 people to terms of up to six months for continuing to charge Rohingya refugees for ferrying them to safety.  Each and every time we are warning them,  he said.  Yes, you can do that, but not in exchange of money.  He pointed to the deaths of women and children who, unable to swim, have died after their boats capsized near Bangladeshi shores. Fishermen and local residents told Reuters that authorities have also broadcast messages in their villages by loudspeaker ordering them not to pick up Rohingyas. At least five boats caught bringing refugees in exchange for money have been set on fire on the beach by officials. The boatmen Reuters spoke to said they were cautious about operating in bad weather and rejected allegations of coercion or detaining refugees. Tens of thousands of people may still be waiting to cross the mouth of the Naf river, according to estimates by refugees, fishermen and rights groups.  I would like to go back to bring these people, because Muslims are suffering,  said Bangladeshi boat owner Moni Ullah, 38.  For me, it s hard to sit here and not go there, because I have seen so many people crying on the beach.  ($1 = 81.9300 taka) ",worldnews,"September 15, 2017 ",1
U.S. nuclear commander says assuming North Korea tested hydrogen bomb,"OFFUTT AIR FORCE BASE, Neb. (Reuters) - The U.S. general who oversees America s nuclear forces said on Thursday he was making the assumption that North Korea did in fact test a hydrogen bomb on Sept. 3, crossing a key threshold in its weapons development efforts.  Although Pyongyang immediately claimed it successfully tested a hydrogen bomb, the United States had previously declined to characterize it.  Air Force General John Hyten, head of the U.S. military s Strategic Command, however, said he had a responsibility, as a military officer responsible for responding to the test, to assume that it was a hydrogen bomb, based on the size of the blast.  I m assuming it was a hydrogen bomb. I have to make that assumption as a military officer,  Hyten told a small group of reporters who were accompanying Defense Secretary Jim Mattie on a trip to Hyten s headquarters in Nebraska.  I m not a nuclear scientist, so I can t tell you this is how it worked, this is what the bomb was. ... But I can tell you the size that we observed and saw tends to me to indicate that it was a hydrogen bomb and I have to figure out what the right response is with our allies as to that kind of event.  The North Korean nuclear test, its sixth and by far most powerful, prompted the U.N. Security Council to step up sanctions. It followed a series of North Korean missile tests, including one that flew over Japan and another that the U.S. assessed to be an inter-continental ballistic missile (ICBM). South Korea s military said shortly after Hyten s remarks that North Korea fired an unidentified missile eastward from the Sunan district in its capital, Pyongyang. A hydrogen bomb usually uses a primary atomic bomb to trigger a secondary, much larger explosion. Such a weapon, with the first stage based on nuclear fission - splitting atoms - and the second on nuclear fusion, produces a blast that is much more power than traditional atomic bombs, or  pure fission  devices.  The sheer destruction and damage that you can create with a weapon that size is significantly of a concern,  Hyten said. Hyten said that despite the nuclear and missile tests, North Korea still had not demonstrated that it had a reliable ICBM that could deliver a nuclear warhead.  But he noted it was only a matter of time before its scientists achieved that, given the pace of testing.  It s just a matter of when, not if,  he said, adding it could be months or years. Experts doubt that President Donald Trump, like his predecessors, will be able to force North Korea to abandon its nuclear program through economic or diplomatic pressure. Current and former U.S. officials have declined to comment on operational planning but acknowledge that no existing plan for a preemptive strike could promise to prevent a brutal counterattack by North Korea, which has thousands of artillery pieces and rockets trained on Seoul. That raises the question of whether the United States might be able to live with a nuclear-armed threat from North Korea. A senior Trump administration official, speaking to reporters last week on condition of anonymity, said it was unclear whether the Cold War-era deterrence model that Washington used with the Soviet Union could be applied to a rogue state like North Korea, adding:  I don t think the president wants to take that chance.  Hyten, who would command U.S. forces in a nuclear war, expressed confidence in the U.S. nuclear deterrent.  Do we have the ability to deter North Korea from developing capabilities that could potentially threaten us? That s a different question,  he said.  But do I, U.S. Strategic Command, have the ability for the United States to deter an adversary from attacking the United States with nuclear weapons? Yes. Because they know the response is going to be the destruction of their entire nation.  ",worldnews,"September 14, 2017 ",1

U.N. seeks 'massive' help for Rohingya fleeing Myanmar 'ethnic cleansing',"DHAKA/YANGON (Reuters) - The United Nations appealed on Thursday for massive help for nearly 400,000 Muslims from Myanmar who have fled to Bangladesh, with concern growing that the number could keep rising, unless Myanmar ends what critics denounce as  ethnic cleansing . The Rohingya are fleeing from a Myanmar military offensive in the western state of Rakhine that began after a series of guerrilla attacks on Aug. 25 on security posts and an army camp in which about a dozen people were killed.  We urge the international community to step up humanitarian support and come up with help,  Mohammed Abdiker, director of operations and emergencies for the International Organisation for Migration, told a news conference in the Bangladeshi capital. The need was  massive , he added. The violence in Rakhine and the exodus of refugees is the most pressing problem Nobel Peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has faced since becoming national leader last year. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday urged Myanmar to end the violence, which he said was best described as ethnic cleansing.       The government of Buddhist-majority Myanmar rejects such accusations, saying it is targeting  terrorists . Numerous Rohingya villages in the north of Rakhine have been torched but authorities have denied that security forces or Buddhist civilians set the fires. They blame the insurgents, and say 30,000 non-Muslim villagers were also displaced. Smoke was rising from at least five places on the Myanmar side of the border on Thursday, a Reuters reporter in Bangladesh said. It was not clear what was burning or who set the fires.  Ethnic cleansing  is not recognized as an independent crime under international law, the U.N. Office on Genocide Prevention says, but it has been used in U.N. resolutions and acknowledged in judgments and indictments of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. A U.N. panel of experts defined it as  rendering an area ethnically homogeneous by using force or intimidation to remove persons of given groups .       The crisis has raised questions about Suu Kyi s commitment to human rights, and could strain relations with Western backers supporting her leadership of Myanmar s transition from decades of strict military rule and economic isolation. Critics have called for her to be stripped of her Nobel prize for failing to do more to halt the strife, though national security remains firmly in the hands of the military. Suu Kyi is due to address the nation on Tuesday. U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Thursday he had spoken with Suu Kyi and that she said she was working to get aid to areas affected by violence. U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Patrick Murphy had what one U.S. official called a  tough conversation  with Myanmar s ambassador to the United States on Wednesday ahead of Murphy s trip to Yangon this weekend. Murphy will be meeting with Myanmar government officials next week to voice concern about the state of the Rohingya people and to press for greater access for humanitarian workers and reporters, the State Department said. China, which competes with the United States for influence in Myanmar, endorses the offensive against the insurgents and deemed it an  internal affair , Myanmar state media said.  The counterattacks of Myanmar security forces against extremist terrorists and the government s undertakings to provide assistance to the people are strongly welcomed,  the Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper quoted China s ambassador, Hong Liang, as telling government officials. But at the United Nations in New York, China set a different tone, joining a Security Council expression of concern about reports of violence and urging steps to end it. The council met on Wednesday to discuss the crisis and later  expressed concern about reports of excessive violence ... and called for immediate steps to end the violence in Rakhine, de-escalate the situation, re-establish law and order, ensure the protection of civilians ... and resolve the refugee problem . This week, the Trump administration called for protection of civilians. Bangladesh says the refugees will have to go home and has called for safe zones in Myanmar. Myanmar says safe zones are unacceptable. The IOM s Abdiker declined to say how many refugees he thought might end up in Bangladesh.  The number may rise to 600,000, 700,000, even one million if the situation in Myanmar does not improve,  he said. The most important thing was that the refugees be able to go home safely, said George William Okoth-Obbo, assistant high commissioner for operations at the U.N. refugee agency.  The international community has to support to ensure their return ... peacefully and with safety,  he told the news conference. On Wednesday, the Myanmar government said 45 places had been burned. It did not provide details, but a spokesman said out of 471 villages in the north of Rakhine, 176 had been deserted and at least some people had left 34 more. The spokesman, Zaw Htay, said the people going to Bangladesh were either linked to the insurgents, or women and children fleeing conflict. Government figures show 432 people have been killed, most of them insurgents, since Aug. 25. ",worldnews,"September 14, 2017 ",1
"Hurricane Max downgraded to tropical storm, moves inland over Mexico","MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Hurricane Max was downgraded to a tropical storm on Thursday evening, bearing down on a region with the popular tourist resorts of Acapulco, Zihuatanejo and Ixtapa.  Max s maximum sustained winds decreased to 70 miles per hour (113 km per hour) on Thursday evening, and the storm was about 80 miles (129 km) east of Acapulco, the National Hurricane Center in Florida said. The storm is expected to continue weakening dramatically as it moves inland over Southern Mexico, and it will likely be downgraded to a tropical depression on Thursday evening.  Nevertheless, the center warned of heavy rains and flooding in the coastal states of Guerrero and Oaxaca.  In the state of Guerrero, home to some of Mexico s major tourist resorts, Max could dump as much as 20 inches (51 cm) of rain in coastal areas, the NHC said, potentially triggering flash floods and mudslides.  The storm is bad news for Acapulco as tourists prepare to travel to the city to celebrate Mexico s Independence Day this weekend.  Meanwhile, tropical storm Norma formed in the Pacific on Thursday, according to the NHC. The storm, which is currently 360 miles (579 km) south of Cabo San Lucas, on the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula, could become a hurricane by late Friday.  Max arrives a week after a powerful 8.1-magnitude quake shook southern Mexico, destroying thousands of buildings in the state of Oaxaca and killing at least 98 people nationwide.

Western powers press Iraq Kurd leaders to shelve 'very risky' independence vote,"ERBIL/KIRKUK, Iraq (Reuters) - The United States and Western allies pressed Iraqi Kurdish leaders to ditch a  very risky  independence vote on Thursday, presenting an alternative plan in an attempt to avoid conflict between the oil rich region and central government in Baghdad. The referendum, slated for Sept. 25, has become a potential flashpoint in the region, with Western powers concerned it could ignite conflict with Baghdad and divert attention from the war against Islamic State militants.  Heading into a referendum for Sept. 25, there is no prospect for international legitimacy,  Brett McGurk, a U.S. special envoy, told reporters after a delegation also including the U.N. and Britain met Kurdish President Massoud Barzani.  This is a very risky process.  McGurk said he was encouraged that Kurdish leaders could embrace an alternative plan focusing on dialogue between the Kurdistan region and Baghdad and a delay in the referendum. He refused to give details.  The Kurdish presidency said the autonomous region s political leaders would study the proposal, without giving details. But Barzani himself was later quoted by local media as telling a pro-independence rally the vote would go ahead on Sept. 25 as planned. The move came after Iraq s parliament voted to remove the governor of Kirkuk, a staunch supporter of Kurdish independence. Kirkuk Governor Najmaddin Kareem said he had no intention of following Baghdad s dismissal order, issued at the behest of Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi.  I will stay in office,  he told Reuters.  The referendum will go on as planned...The prime minister does not have the power to ask parliament to remove me.  Iraqi lawmakers authorized Abadi this week to  take all measures  to preserve national unity before the independence referendum.   Baghdad and Iraq s neighbors are opposed to the vote.      Iraqi lawmakers say it will consolidate Kurdish control over several disputed areas, including oil-rich Kirkuk. Turkey has the region s largest Kurdish population and fears a  Yes  vote could fuel separatism in its southeast where Kurdish militants have waged an insurgency for three decades in which more than 40,000 people have been killed. Iran and Syria also oppose the vote, fearing it could fan separatism among their own Kurdish populations. Iraqi lawmakers say the referendum will consolidate Kurdish control over several disputed areas, including oil-rich Kirkuk. Kirkuk province is claimed by both the central government in Baghdad and Barzani s semi-autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq. Kareem is a vocal supporter of the referendum and campaigned for the vote also to be held in Kirkuk. Kurds have long claimed Kirkuk and its huge oil reserves. They regard the city, just outside their Kurdistan region in northern Iraq, as their historical capital.  But the ethnically mixed city also has Arab and Turkmen populations. Kareem has long riled the federal government. Last spring, Kirkuk s governorate voted to raise the Kurdish flag over state buildings, despite Baghdad s insistence that only Iraq s national flag should fly in the multi-ethnic city.    He (Kareem) is an elected governor of the council of Kirkuk,  said Hoshyar Zebari, a close adviser to President Barzani.  That is the only body that can remove him.   The escalating tactics this week by the Iraqis are causing a large public backlash, and will strengthen the Kurdish referendum enormously,  Zebari said.  Kurdish MPs in Iraq s parliament boycotted Thursday s vote, which produced a majority for the governor s removal, lawmaker Husham al-Suhail told Reuters. Asked whether parliament had the right to dismiss Kareem, Suhail referred to an article of Iraq s provincial law, which  parliament used as the legal basis for the vote and which stipulates the prime minister s authority to remove a regional governor. Suhail gave no details about what Kareem was accused of and Kareem himself said he had not been informed.  This is unlawful ... I have the support of the government council, I have the support of the people, we are here and we will continue,  he said. ",worldnews,"September 14, 2017 ",1

Catalan independence campaign kicks off as Barcelona gives backing,"TARRAGONA, Spain (Reuters) - The Catalonian government on Thursday launched its official campaign for an independence referendum, which Madrid has declared illegal, buoyed by the support of the capital  Barcelona. Crowds filled a bull ring in the northeastern city of Tarragona, applauding and shouting  We will vote!  as regional president Carles Puigdemont arrived to rally support for the Oct. 1 vote. In a boost for the credibility of the referendum, the mayor of Barcelona said earlier on Thursday that the vote would go ahead in the city, having previously expressed concern that civil servants involved may lose their jobs. A town hall spokesman was unable to comment further or explain how civil servants could be protected.      Puigdemont himself is facing criminal charges of misuse of public money, disobedience and abuse of office for organizing the referendum, and prosecutors have summoned hundreds of the region s mayors for questioning.    Police raided a newspaper office and a printing press last week, looking for signs of preparation, and the regional court has ordered Civil Guard agents to shut down web pages providing information about the referendum.  Regional home affairs councillor Joaquim Forn said there was a bigger than usual presence of national police in Catalonia.  They are moving throughout the region. They must be looking for ballot boxes,  he told RAC1 radio. A majority of Catalonia s 5.5 million voters want to have their say on the northeastern region s relationship with Spain, but the independence cause has lost support in recent years and surveys indicate less than 50 percent of the population would choose full self-rule.

"North Korea threatens to 'sink' Japan, reduce U.S. to 'ashes and darkness'","SEOUL/TOKYO (Reuters) - A North Korean state agency threatened on Thursday to use nuclear weapons to  sink  Japan and reduce the United States to  ashes and darkness  for supporting a U.N. Security Council resolution and sanctions over its latest nuclear test. The Korea Asia-Pacific Peace Committee, which handles the North s external ties and propaganda, also called for the breakup of the Security Council, which it called  a tool of evil  made up of  money-bribed  countries that move at the order of the United States.  The four islands of the archipelago should be sunken into the sea by the nuclear bomb of Juche. Japan is no longer needed to exist near us,  the committee said in a statement carried by the North s official KCNA news agency.   Juche is the North s ruling ideology that mixes Marxism and an extreme form of go-it-alone nationalism preached by state founder Kim Il Sung, the grandfather of the current leader, Kim Jong Un. Regional tension has risen markedly since the reclusive North conducted its sixth, and by far its most powerful, nuclear test on Sept. 3, following a series of missile tests, including one that flew over Japan. The 15-member Security Council voted unanimously on a U.S.-drafted resolution and a new round of sanctions on Monday in response, banning North Korea s textile exports that are the second largest only to coal and mineral, and capping fuel supplies. The North reacted to the latest action by the Security Council, which had the backing of veto-holding China and Russia, by reiterating threats to destroy the United States, Japan and South Korea.  Let s reduce the U.S. mainland into ashes and darkness. Let s vent our spite with mobilization of all retaliation means which have been prepared till now,  the statement said. Japan s Nikkei stock index and dollar/yen currency pared gains, although traders said that was more because of several Chinese economic indicators released on Thursday rather than a reaction to the North s latest statement. South Korea s won also edged down around the same time over domestic financial concerns. Despite the North s threats, South Korean President Moon Jae-in said he was against having nuclear weapons in his country, either by developing its own arsenal or bringing back U.S. tactical nuclear weapons that were withdrawn in the early 1990s.  To respond to North Korea by having our own nuclear weapons will not maintain peace on the Korean peninsula and could lead to a nuclear arms race in northeast Asia,  Moon said in an interview with CNN. South Korea s Unification Ministry also said it planned to provide $8 million through the U.N. World Food Programme and UNICEF to help infants and pregnant women in the North. The move marks Seoul s first humanitarian assistance for the North since its fourth nuclear test in January 2016 and is based on a longstanding policy of separating humanitarian aid from politics, the ministry said. The North s latest threats also singled out Japan for  dancing to the tune  of the United States, saying it should never be pardoned for not offering a sincere apology for its  never-to-be-condoned crimes against our people , an apparent reference to Japan s wartime aggression. It also referred to South Korea as  traitors and dogs  of the United States. Japan criticized the North s statement harshly.  This announcement is extremely provocative and egregious. It is something that markedly heightens regional tension and is absolutely unacceptable,  Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, visiting India, called for strict enforcement of the U.N. resolution, saying the world must force a change. The 15-member Security Council voted unanimously on a U.S.-drafted resolution and a new round of sanctions against North Korea on Monday in response to its latest and most powerful test, banning North Korea s textile exports that are the second largest only to coal and mineral, and capping fuel supplies. North Korea had already rejected the Security Council resolution, vowing to press ahead with its nuclear and missile programs. A tougher initial U.S. draft of Monday s resolution was weakened to win the support of China, the North s lone major ally, and Russia. Significantly, it stopped short of imposing a full embargo on oil exports to North Korea, most of which come from China. The latest sanctions also make it illegal for foreign firms to form commercial joint ventures with North Korean entities. U.S. President Donald Trump has vowed that North Korea will never be allowed to threaten the United States with a nuclear-tipped missile, but has also asked China to do more to rein in its neighbor. China in turn favors an international response to the problem. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the international community had reached a  high consensus  on trying to realize a peaceful solution.  We urge the relevant directly involved parties to seize the opportunity and have the political nerve to make the correct political choice as soon as possible,  Hua told a regular press briefing. The North accuses the United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, of planning to invade and regularly threatens to destroy it and its Asian allies. The United States and South Korea are technically still at war with North Korea because the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce and not a peace treaty.

Mexico accepts Israeli offer to help develop Central America,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico President Enrique Pena Nieto said on Thursday that his country had accepted Israel s offer to help it and the United States develop Central America, as Israel and Mexico seek to deepen business ties. Speaking at a news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Pena Nieto added that the two nations had agreed to update their free trade agreement, which was signed in 2000.  We have agreed to establish and begin the ... negotiations to look over this agreement so that the commercial relationship between both nations intensifies and grows,  he said. Netanyahu was joined by a business delegation including representatives from communications firm AudioCodes Ltd, cyber security firm Verint Systems Inc and Mer Group, which specializes in telecommunications and cyber security. In Central America, Pena Nieto said Israel s assistance could bolster the United States and Mexico s efforts in the region, particularly in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. He noted that Israel brings experience from carrying out development projects in Africa. The United States and Mexico have been seeking to encourage investment in infrastructure improvements in Central America s so-called Northern Triangle in an effort to stem migration to the United States. Netanyahu s trip marked the first visit to Mexico by a sitting Israeli prime minister, Pena Nieto said. At the close of the news conference, Netanyahu invited Pena Nieto to Jerusalem. The relationship between the nations was strained earlier this year by a tweet in which Netanyahu appeared to praise U.S. President Donald Trump s plans to build a wall on the Mexican border. Israeli President Reuven Rivlin later issued a statement apologizing for any misunderstanding. ",worldnews,"September 14, 2017 ",1
U.S. extends some Iran sanctions relief under nuclear deal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Thursday extended some sanctions relief for Iran under the 2015 nuclear deal but said it has yet to decide whether to preserve the deal itself, the State Department said. President Donald Trump, who must make a decision by mid-October that could undermine the agreement, said Iran is violating  the spirit  of the 2015 deal under which Iran got sanctions relief in return for curbing its nuclear program. In a sign of Trump s desire to put pressure on Iran, which denies violating the deal, the U.S. Treasury announced new cyber-related and other sanctions on seven Iranian individuals, two Iranian entities and two Ukraine-based entities.  We are not going to stand for what they are doing,  Trump told reporters on Air Force One. But he stopped short of saying whether he will refuse to recertify the agreement. Trump must decide in October whether to certify that Iran is complying with the agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). If he does not, Congress has 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions waived under the deal. The prospect of Washington reneging on the agreement has worried some of the key U.S. allies that helped negotiate the deal, especially as the world grapples with another nuclear crisis, North Korea s nuclear and ballistic missile development. Republican Senator Bob Corker, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and wrote the law giving Congress the right to review the Iran deal, said he and the White House were preparing in case of a change in policy. He also said he recognized the need to work with allies.  I think it s important that ... we take steps that, to the extent we can, we keep all of our allies together,  Corker told Reuters.  What you don t want to do is self-create a crisis for no reason. You want to make sure that you have an outcome here that is a good outcome for the United States and our interest.  Asked if it made sense to abandon the Iran nuclear deal given concerns about North Korea, Corker said,  I don t think you should prejudge what they re (the administration) going to do.  Separately, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson argued that the United States must consider the full threat it says Iran poses to the Middle East when formulating its new policy toward Tehran, saying Iran had breached the spirit of the deal.  We have to consider the totality of Iran s activities and not let our view be defined solely by the nuclear agreement,  he told a news conference in London. Citing the preface to the 2015 agreement, Tillerson said  in our view, Iran is clearly in default of these expectations.  He cited Iranian support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, its development of ballistic missiles and  cyber activities.  The deal s preface does not oblige Iran to promote global peace. Rather, it says the nations involved  anticipate that full implementation of this JCPOA will positively contribute to regional and international peace and security.  State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters the administration had approved waivers of some sanctions on Iran to  maintain some flexibility  as it develops its Iran policy. She did not specify which sanctions were waived. Earlier, sources said the United States will renew a waiver of the most punitive sanctions on Iran. Tucked into Section 1245 of the 2012 National Defense Authorization Act, Washington threatened to sanction the banks of Iran s main oil customers if they did not significantly cut their purchases of Iranian crude. Under the law, these sanctions can be waived for a maximum of 120 days, forcing the U.S. government to revisit the issue every four months. Even as the administration waived the oil-related sanctions, the Treasury Department announced it had sanctioned 11 entities and individuals for  engaging in support of designated Iranian actors or malicious cyber-enabled activity.  Of the 11, seven were Iranian individuals, two were Iranian entities and two were entities based in Ukraine. The Treasury alleged they either supported Iran s ballistic missile program or its Quds Force, or engaged in cyber attacks against the U.S. financial system. The action freezes any assets they may hold in the United States and generally prohibits U.S. individuals from doing business with them. ",worldnews,"September 14, 2017 ",1

"Myanmar faces 'defining moment', must stop the violence: U.S.","LONDON (Reuters) - Myanmar is facing a  defining moment  and must stop the violence against its ethnic minority Rohingya population, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Thursday.

U.S. citizen fighting for Islamic State surrenders in Syria: Pentagon,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An American citizen fighting for Islamic State in Syria surrendered to U.S-backed fighters earlier this week and has been handed over to U.S. forces, the Pentagon said on Thursday. The American surrendered to the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a U.S.-backed alliance of mostly Arab and Kurdish fighters, on or around Sept. 12.  The US citizen is being legally detained by Department of Defense personnel as a known enemy combatant,  Pentagon spokesman Major Adrian Rankine-Galloway said in a statement. It is not the first time an American citizen fighting for the group has been detained by U.S. allies. In June, a Virginia man who traveled to Syria to become a suicide bomber for Islamic State was convicted of providing material support to the militant group. Mohamad Jamal Khweis, 27, spent about 2-1/2 months in early 2016 traveling with Islamic State fighters in Syria and Iraq and participating in the group s religious training.

U.S. calls on China to use 'powerful tool' of oil to sway North Korea,"LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Thursday he was hopeful that China would come to its own decision to decide to use the  powerful tool  of oil supplies to persuade North Korea to reconsider its  current path . On a visit to London where he met British Prime Minister Theresa May and foreign minister, Boris Johnson, Tillerson said the United States had wanted to see a much stronger resolution from the United Nations which agreed a new round of sanctions on Monday.  It s clear that with respect to oil, and a complete embargo on oil from the U.N. Security Council, that s going to be very difficult,  he said.  In effect, that is directed at China alone because China supplies essentially all of North Korea s oil,  he told a joint news conference with Johnson.  I am hopeful that China, as a great country, a world power, will decide on their own, will take it upon themselves to use that very powerful tool of oil supply to persuade North Korea to reconsider its current path toward weapons development, reconsider its approach to dialogue and negotiations in the future.

Irma creates bittersweet travel bonus for luckier Caribbean islands,"(Reuters) - On Friday, a cruise ship carrying around 3,000 passengers will dock at St. John s harbor in the Caribbean island of Antigua. It will not be where the passengers expected to land when they booked, however. The Carnival Plc ship was meant to dock in Saint Martin, 100 miles (160 km) to the northwest. However, Hurricane Irma devastated the island, wrecking its port and infrastructure, and leaving it out of bounds for tourists. Antiguan officials now expect the Carnival Fascination to visit every Friday, and have gotten about 25 calls from major cruise lines such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd and Norwegian Cruise Lines looking to make stops through the end of the year. For Asot Michael, Antigua and Barbuda s minister for tourism, the unexpected arrival of thousands of tourists is a bittersweet bonus.  We are going to be benefiting. I don t want to benefit from others  misfortune after such a disaster,  Michael said.  But because the port is so damaged in Saint Martin, so damaged in Tortola in the British Virgin Islands, we re getting some of those cancellations. Those cruise lines now are making ports of call into Antigua.      Hurricane Irma left behind a stark divide in the Caribbean ahead of the winter tourism season that is the region s economic lifeblood. As travel to the region picks up again, cruise lines, hotels, airlines and other companies are directing customers to places that are able to host them, and away from the worst-hit areas.  Popular winter vacation spots such as Saint Martin, the British Virgin Islands and Saint Barthelemy that were devastated by the storm could be sidelined for weeks or months.  In 2016, 29.3 million tourists visited the Caribbean and spent $35.5 billion, both new records, according to the Caribbean Tourism Organization.   For Saint Martin and Saint Bart, the holiday season looks very compromised,  said Jean-Pierre Mas, chairman of French travel agency federation SNAV.  My sentiment is that the winter season is lost. Decisions to book for the winter season are taken right now.   Busy tourist destinations in the western Caribbean, such as Barbados and Trinidad, were well away from the path of the storm. Cozumel, on Mexico s Gulf Coast, got four additional visits this week as ships were rerouted to avoid the storm s impact, although Cozumel tourism officials said three cruises were canceled.  Florida, which was anticipating another record year for its $100 billion a year tourism industry, is expected to rebound in time for the peak winter travel months, Moody s Analytics said earlier this week. Walt Disney Co reopened its Orlando Disney World theme park on Sept. 12. The Florida Keys, however, wrestled with more severe storm damage. [nL2N1LR0N1] [nF9N1L0029] [nL2N1LS1HW] Some travel companies said they are still assessing the situation and had not made firm decisions about rerouting ships. Tour operator Virgin Holidays said that it was beginning to return to regular operations in Antigua, despite damage to some properties on the island.  Antigua wasn t as badly damaged as we feared, and we have reopened tourism there, although three resorts are currently not on sale because of the damage,  a spokesman for Virgin Atlantic said.  Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago, St. Lucia are three big tourist examples that were not impacted.  However, the small island of Saint Martin, which France shares with the Netherlands, could miss out on much of its tourism season. French President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday vowed to swiftly rebuild the islands of the French Caribbean, including Saint Martin, and a French public reinsurance body estimated a cost of at least 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion) from the damage there and in Saint Barthelemy. [nL2N1LT1SF] [nL5N1LQ09G] Hurricane Irma badly damaged many hotels on the island, such as AccorHotels Mercure hotel. A spokeswoman for Accor said that while nobody had been hurt, the hotel would be closed until Jan. 8 at least.  While 70 hotel rooms remain operational, they are being used to house military forces and other staff that are supporting the relief effort. AccorHotels is offering cancellation and reimbursement for those who had booked stays at the hotel. ",worldnews,"September 14, 2017 ",1
Irma shakes Havana's deadly crumbling buildings,"HAVANA (Reuters) - Roydis Vald s  dilapidated home on Animas Street in the densely packed center of Old Havana had been declared uninhabitable by Cuba s Communist authorities years ago, his neighbors said. After Hurricane Irma shook the Cuban capital - a crumbling architectural jewel of the Caribbean - Vald s and his brother  were found under a collapsed wall, just two of the seven people killed by falling buildings on the island. Havana s historic center, where baroque Spanish colonial-era palaces butt shoulders with sleek Art Deco apartment buildings, was already crumbling before it took a lashing from Irma - a visible reminder of the hardship caused by a 57-year U.S. trade embargo.  Residents fear the violent storm - the worst to hit the Cuban mainland since 1932 - will accelerate the city s decline. While the eye of the hurricane did not reach the capital, tropical-storm force winds and heavy rains of its outer bands, as well as a storm surge, wrought havoc on its decrepit buildings. Salty water from Irma s heavy rains that has seeped into the brick and mortar of the capital s buildings will worsen corrosion and likely cause a raft of new collapses, residents and architects warn.  Now when the sun comes out, that s when things will really start to fall apart in Havana,  said Berta Rodriguez, a 71-year-old pensioner who lives on Animas Street and knew Vald s and his brother well.  We spent years asking the state to remove them from there,  she said, crying.  The state has to answer for this.      Irma has shone an unwelcome spotlight on the Caribbean nation s housing problems at a tricky time for the government. Already dealing with a cash crunch in the wake of a steep decline in aid from its key ally, Venezuela, Cuba also faces a political transition as President Raul Castro steps down next year, symbolizing the passing of the baton from the generation that led the 1959 Revolution. Rodriguez, who evacuated to her son s sturdier home during the hurricane, says she has been asking the Communist authorities for a new home for more than 20 years, echoing the frustrations of many Havana residents. After the Revolution led by Raul Castro s elder brother Fidel, the Cuban state confiscated many of Havana s grand historic buildings and distributed them to poor and middle-class families who over the years have divided them into ever-smaller units. Maintaining those buildings in a punishing tropical climate, however, fell by the wayside as the Communist government prioritized universal healthcare and education, as well as building infrastructure in the impoverished countryside. With state salaries averaging $30 per month and credit hard to get, Cubans say they do not have the money to fix up buildings themselves.  A builder told me I need to repair the walls that are full of holes, but I couldn t find the cash,  said Rodriguez, who suffers from chronic bronchitis made worse by her badly leaking ceiling. About 4,400 cases of damage to housing were reported in the capital due to Irma, state-run media said on Thursday. Of those, authorities confirmed nearly 1,200 buildings were entirely or partially destroyed. The city is working on restoring damaged roofs and preparing two shelters for families left homeless, the newspaper Granma added. But this will solve only part of a far greater problem. The housing deficit in the nation of 11 million people rose last year by 30,000 to nearly 900,000 units, the government told parliament in July.  In Havana, it estimated a shortage of more than 200,000 homes. The state had built 316,595 homes between 1990 and 2013, an effort that the president of the Construction Commission Santiago Lajes Choy told parliament was still  insufficient.  Litza Penalver, whose sister s family lives in the building on Animas street partially destroyed by Irma, said authorities want to get residents out now.   They want to demolish it, to cover up their errors,  she said.  They want to oblige us to stay in a large shelter and wait (for a new house) but the wait can last 30 years - Cuba doesn t have the resources.  Many Havana residents say they would prefer to stay in their decrepit homes, no matter how dangerous, rather than move to large shelters that offer no privacy. Still, with the rainy season ongoing, many worry that more hurricanes could hit before it ends in November.  While Irma has exacerbated frustration with Cuba s housing problems, even dissidents say it is unlikely to fuel outright opposition to the government.  There might be more spontaneous, isolated expressions of discontent,  said Jose Daniel Ferrer, leader of the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU), one of the island s largest dissident groups.  But not organized protests with clear political aims given the high level of repression at the moment.  Rodriguez, Penalver and others on Animas Street said theirs was not a political problem and noted they were strong supporters of the Revolution that toppled right-wing dictator Fulgencio Batista in 1959 and subsequently provided free healthcare and education to ordinary Cubans.  I love my country,  said Penalver, adding she had a Spanish passport but chose to live in Cuba.  I m not looking for political problems. I m looking for solution to the housing issue.

Hostile same-sex marriage vote spurs Australia to amend anti-hate law," (In this Sept. 13 story, corrects definition of intersex in paragraph 5.) SYDNEY (Reuters) - The alarming volume of hate-speech during Australia s ballot over whether to legalize same-sex marriage spurred parliament  to pass emergency legislation on Wednesday to outlaw opponents spewing their vitriol while the vote was in progress. Australia began a non-compulsory postal vote on Tuesday that will determine whether it becomes the 25th country to legalize same-sex marriage. But with an emotionally charged campaign raising concerns about the welfare of vulnerable Australians, the government moved to strengthen laws preventing hate-speech. The opposition Labor Party supported the amendment, though it had rejected the need for a ballot on the issue. Until voting ends on November 7, anyone found guilty of intimidation, or threats to cause harm on the basis of the sexual orientation, gender identity, intersex status - people who are born with genetic, hormonal or physical sex characteristics that are not typically male or female - or the religious convictions of someone will be liable to fines of A$12,500 (over $10,000) and a court injunction.  This bill cannot stop all of the hurt, all of the prejudice that is being expressed, all of the lack of acceptance that is being communicated to LGBTI Australians, to same-sex couple families. But it provides limited protections,  said Penny Wong, leader of the opposition in the senate. ",worldnews,"September 13, 2017 ",1
U.S. must consider broader Iran threats when formulating new strategy:  Tillerson,"LONDON (Reuters) - The United States must consider the full threat it says Iran poses to the Middle East when formulating its new policy toward Tehran, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Thursday, adding that Iran had breached the spirit of a 2015 nuclear deal.  Tillerson, made the comments during a visit to Britain to see Prime Minister Theresa May and foreign minister Boris Johnson. The trip was billed as focusing on the relief effort after Hurricane Irma, how to respond to North Korea s nuclear test, and resolving the political deadlock in Libya. But he was outspoken in his criticism of Iran when asked whether he believed it was meeting the obligations of a 2015 international nuclear agreement designed to curb an Iranian nuclear program in return for lifting most Western sanctions. Tillerson cited the preface of the nuclear deal, which calls on Iran to contribute positively to regional security.   In our view, Iran is clearly in default of these expectations ... through their actions to prop up the Assad regime (in Syria), to engage in malicious activities in the region, including cyber activities, aggressively developing ballistic missiles,  he told a news conference.  We have to consider the totality of Iran s activities and not let our view be defined solely by the nuclear agreement.  He was speaking before the United States announced it had imposed sanctions on seven Iranian individuals and two entities, alleging involvement in either malicious cyber activities or enabling Tehran s ballistic missile program. U.S. President Donald Trump has previously expressed doubts about the nuclear deal, and in April his administration said it would review whether the lifting of sanctions against Iran was in the United States  national security interest. Trump is weighing a strategy that could allow more aggressive U.S. responses to Iran s forces, its Shi ite Muslim proxies in Iraq and Syria, and its support for militant groups. Earlier on Thursday, a North Korean state agency threatened to reduce the United States to  ashes and darkness  for supporting a U.N. Security Council resolution and sanctions over its latest nuclear test. Tillerson said he was hopeful that China would decide to use the  powerful tool  of oil supplies to put pressure on Pyongyang, but conceded that it would be difficult to agree an oil embargo through the United Nations Security Council. North Korea carried out its sixth and largest nuclear test earlier this month.  I am hopeful that China, as a great country, a world power, will decide on their own, will take it upon themselves to use that very powerful tool of oil supply to persuade North Korea to reconsider its current path towards weapons development, reconsider its approach to dialogue and negotiations in the future,  he said. Commenting on violence in Myanmar against the minority Rohingya population, Tillerson said the country faced a defining moment.  I think it is important that the global community speak out in support of what we all know the expectation is for the treatment of people regardless of their ethnicity,  he added.  This violence must stop, this persecution must stop.  He said he understood that Myanmar s Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel prize laureate and de facto head of the government in Myanmar, was in a power-sharing agreement with the military and it was a  complex situation  in which she found herself.

Yemen's Houthi leader says could target Saudi oil tankers if Hodeidah attacked,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Yemen s Houthi leader Abdel-Malek al-Houthi said on Thursday his group could target Saudi oil tankers should Saudi Arabia attack Yemen s main port at Hodeidah.   We could target Saudi oil tankers and we could do anything,  he said.  In a televised speech, the leader also said his group s ballistic missiles were capable of reaching the United Arab Emirates  capital of Abu Dhabi and anywhere inside Saudi Arabia.  It was unclear whether the Houthi group has the capability to carry out its threats. Abdel Malek said the Houthis had successfully fired a missile at Abu Dhabi earlier this month, meaning the United Arab Emirates was no longer safe from attack. He gave no further details and there has been no indication by the UAE of any missiles landing on their territory.  UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash said on Twitter his country was not intimidated by Houthi threats.  The Houthis  comments threatening the UAE and its capital are tangible proof of the need for the Decisive Storm (operation),  Gargash said, referring to the Saudi-led coalition intervening in Yemen.  Iran s militias have vile objectives and represent a real threat,  he added. Yemen has been devastated by more than two years of civil war in which President Abd Rabu Hadi s government, backed by the coalition, is fighting to drive the Iran-allied Houthis out of cities they seized in 2014 and 2015 in a rapid rise to national power.  Today the port of Hodeidah is being threatened and we cannot turn a blind eye to that,  Abdel-Malek said.   If the Saudi regime and with a green light from the U.S. attack Hodeidah then we have to take steps that we haven t taken before.   The United Nations had proposed that the Red Sea port of Hodeidah, where 80 percent of food imports arrive, should be handed to a neutral party, to smooth the flow of humanitarian relief and prevent the port being engulfed by Yemen s two-year-old war. The government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi accuses the Houthis of using the port to smuggle in weapons and of collecting custom duties on goods, which they use to finance the war. The Houthis deny this. ",worldnews,"September 14, 2017 ",1
Kremlin accuses West of 'whipping up hysteria' over Russian war games,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia accused the West on Thursday of  whipping up hysteria  over large-scale military exercises underway in eastern Europe and denied charges that they were being conducted with a lack of transparency. The exercises, codenamed ""Zapad"", or ""West"", started on Thursday and will last until Sept. 20. They are being conducted  on military ranges in Belarus, western Russia, Russia's exclave of Kaliningrad and in the Baltic Sea. (For graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2iIkjEU)  We reject complaints of these exercises not being transparent,  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a conference call with reporters.  We believe that whipping up hysteria around these exercises is a provocation.   It is a normal practice for any country to hold such exercises. Everything is being held in line with international law,  Peskov said. Russian President Vladimir Putin may visit one of the stages of these drills, he said.     NATO is closely watching the exercises and says they are larger than the 12,700 servicemen Moscow has publicized, actually numbering some 100,000 troops, and involve firing nuclear-capable ballistic missiles. Russia s defense ministry reiterated on Thursday that the exercises are of a purely defensive nature and are not a threat to any third country or group of countries. But NATO officials say the drills will simulate a conflict with the U.S.-led alliance intended to show Russia s ability to mass large numbers of troops at short notice in the event of a conflict. In a statement, the Pentagon said that while Russia and Belarus had taken some steps towards providing transparency, there were concerns about the official estimate of troop numbers.  We urge Russia to share information regarding its exercises and operations in NATO s vicinity to clearly convey its intentions and minimize any misunderstandings,  Lieutenant Colonel Michelle Baldanza, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said in a statement.   In response to this uncertainty, the U.S. has built a joint, persistent rotational presence of air, land, and sea presence in the region to support our Allies,  she added. Amid allegations about Moscow s aggressive ambitions from its post-communist neighbors, Russia s defense ministry has said that it does not intend to use the drills as a springboard to attack Lithuania, Poland or Ukraine. Moscow says it is the West that threatens stability in eastern Europe, because NATO has put a 4,000-strong multinational force in the Baltics and Poland. Russia s defense ministry said the current drills involve some 7,200 troops from Belarus and 5,500 from Russia, up to 70 aircraft and helicopters, up to 680 units of military hardware, including 250 tanks, up to 200 artillery pieces, multiple rocket launchers and mortars, and up to 10 warships.

Toll of U.S. staff hurt in mysterious Cuba incidents now 21: official,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. officials are aggressively investigating what caused symptoms ranging from hearing loss to mild brain injury in 21 people linked to the U.S. Embassy in Cuba, a State Department official said on Thursday. Spokeswoman Heather Nauert told a briefing that no new incidents had been reported since late August but testing continued, with 21 people saying they had been injured in what some media accounts have called an  acoustic attack.   We are, at the State Department, very deeply concerned about what has taken place and what has happened to our American personnel who have been serving at our embassy in Cuba,  Nauert said.  This has certainly turned out to be a difficult situation for some of our people.  The incidents, which began in late 2016, were first confirmed by a U.S. official in August. Nauert said at that time 16 people had been injured. Some of those had returned home for testing and treatment, Nauert said, while others had been tested in Cuba, where the embassy has a fulltime medical officer. News media have reported that Americans and Canadians working in Cuba have been diagnosed with hearing loss, nausea, headaches, balance disorders and conditions as serious as mild traumatic brain injury and damage to the central nervous system.  The investigation into all of this is still underway. It is an aggressive investigation that continues and we will continue doing this until we find out who or what is responsible for this,  Nauert said. She said U.S. diplomatic security personnel had been able to look through the rooms of some of those injured and conducted searches but still had not determined the cause of the injuries. Nauert said people were still being tested and it was possible the number of injured personnel would rise. ",worldnews,"September 14, 2017 ",1
"Fearing Russia, Sweden holds biggest war games in 20 years","GOTHENBURG, Sweden (Reuters) - Neutral Sweden has launched its biggest war games in two decades with support from NATO countries, drilling 19,000 troops after years of spending cuts that have left the country fearful of Russia s growing military strength. On the eve of Russia s biggest maneuvers since 2013, which NATO says will be greater than the 13,000 troops Moscow says are involved, Sweden will simulate an attack from the east on the Baltic island of Gotland, near the Swedish mainland.  The security situation has taken a turn for the worse,  Micael Byden, the commander of the Swedish Armed Forces, said during a presentation of the three-week-long exercise.  Sweden, like the Baltics, Poland and much of the West, has been deeply troubled by Russia s 2014 annexation of Ukraine s Black Sea peninsula Crimea and its support for rebels in eastern Ukraine.   Russia is the country that affects security in Europe right now with its actions - the annexation of the Crimea and continued battles in eastern Ukraine - so it is clear that we are watching very closely what Russia is doing,  Byden said.  Around 1,500 troops from the United States, France, Norway and other NATO allies are taking part in the exercise dubbed Aurora. Non-NATO member Sweden has decided to beef up its military after having let spending drop from over 2 percent of economic output in the early 1990s to around 1 percent, and is re-introducing conscription. The armed forces, which at one point could mobilise more than 600,000, stand at just 20,000, with 22,000 more Home Guard volunteers.   NATO generals say the Aurora exercise is not a response to Russian exercises that start on Thursday. But Byden, speaking as U.S. and French forces displayed mobile surface-to-air missile systems to be deployed during the exercise, stressed the importance of NATO for Sweden.   We are a sovereign country that takes care of and is responsible for our safety. We do this together with others, ready to both support and receive help,  he said. The United States shipped vehicles by sea from Germany, while France brought others by train. They are to be moved via a classified route to Sweden s east coast for the exercise where U.S. attack helicopters will play the enemy during Aurora.  The government is determined to stick to the country s formal neutrality. Sweden has not fought a war since it clashed with Norway in 1814. But like its non-NATO neighbor Finland, Sweden has been drawing closer to NATO, allowing closer cooperation with alliance troops, with a view to working together in the event of an armed conflict.

Trump to meet Latin American leaders with eye on Venezuela,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has invited three Latin American leaders to dine with him next week in New York as he seeks to address the Venezuela crisis and build bridges with the region after an acrimonious start with neighbor Mexico. The political and economic turmoil in Venezuela, source of 10 percent of the oil consumed by the United States, will almost certainly top the agenda when he receives the center-right presidents of Peru, Colombia and Brazil at Trump Tower on Monday evening, diplomats said.  Trump needs to show that he has good friends in the region who share a positive agenda with the United States, but I am not sure he will get what he wants,  said a Brazilian diplomat, who asked not to be named to be able to speak freely on the matter. White House officials confirmed Trump will dine with several Latin Americans leaders on Monday night with Venezuela expected to be the main topic of conversation. Cuba will also be discussed, one of the officials said.  The dinner will take place on the eve of the opening of the U.N. General Assembly in New York. Mexico s President Enrique Pena Nieto, who will leave office after elections next year, has decided not to attend.  Trump has annoyed Mexico, his country s main trading partner in Latin America, by accusing it of stealing U.S. jobs, threatening to pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement and insisting it pays for a border wall he plans to build to keep out illegal immigrants. Trump has no major initiatives under way with other Latin American countries. In fact, two of his three guests on Monday - Colombia and Peru - are members of the Trans-Pacific Partnership which the United States withdrew from shortly after he took office. On Wednesday, Trump upset Colombia, the South American nation with the closest ties to Washington, by threatening to blacklist it for failing to stop a surge in cocaine production, most of which ends up sold on the streets of U.S. cities. The two countries have long been close allies in the fight against illegal narcotics but in recent years broadened the focus of their relationship to include trade and Colombia s peace process with leftist guerrillas.        Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos  government rejected the criticism of his country s anti-drug record on Thursday.     Shared concern over how to deal with Venezuela, where at least 125 people were killed in four months of demonstrations against the Socialist government, will dominate Monday s dinner, according to Latin America expert Michael Shifter.  Trump and his team are very worried about Venezuela and they want to consult with Venezuela s neighbors Colombia and Brazil, and Peru s President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, who has taken a leading role on the Venezuelan issue in the region,  said Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based policy group. Thousands of Venezuelans have spilled over the border into Colombia and Brazil, fleeing the once-prosperous oil-producing nation that opponents of President Nicholas Maduro say has become a dictatorship. While the Latin American leaders due to meet with Trump have stepped up pressure on Maduro to free political prisoners and hold general elections, they are unlikely to agree to the tougher unilateral economic sanctions that the U.S. president favors.  Colombia and Brazil prefer a negotiated solution to the crisis and not economic sanctions that will hurt the Venezuelan people more than the government,  the Brazilian diplomat said. Meetings due this week in the Dominican Republic between the Venezuelan government and the opposition could be a start in solving the crisis, as long as Maduro is not just out to win time, the diplomat said.  The opposition, however, says it has so far only agreed to send a delegation to discuss with Dominican President Danilo Medina the conditions under which talks could begin. Peru has not objected to the financial sanctions imposed by the Trump administration on the Maduro government, Shifter said.  But if the U.S. ratchets up sanctions, like cutting off oil imports, and takes a more interventionist position on Venezuela, that could distance the United States from its Latin American neighbors,  he said.

Turkey feels betrayed over EU accession but still wants to join the club,"LONDON (Reuters) - Turkey feels betrayed by some European Union leaders who have called for the end of accession talks but still hopes eventually to join the bloc, Turkish EU Minister Omer Celik said on Thursday. The European Union has become increasingly critical of Turkey s membership drive since President Tayyip Erdogan launched a crackdown on critics - including journalists and academics - after a failed 2016 coup. Erdogan accused Berlin of  Nazi-like  tactics in March when it prevented Turkish ministers speaking at expatriate rallies in Germany. Chancellor Angela Merkel said in an election debate ten days ago it was clear Turkey should not join the EU and entry talks should end, despite it being a crucial NATO ally. Celik chided European Union leaders over statements on Turkish accession and said some, such as Merkel, were using the criticism to deflect attention away from the EU s internal problems such as Brexit, migration and reform.  They put all those aside and they stoke antagonism towards Turkey in order to cover up their vital internal problems,  Celik told Reuters in an interview.  We are indeed disappointed by Merkel and some others in the EU: at one of the hardest times in our history we were left alone by our friends and allies,  he said through a translator. When asked if Turkey felt betrayed, he said:  Yes .  The abortive coup, in which more than 260 people were killed as mutinous soldiers commandeered fighter jets, helicopters and tanks in a bid to seize power, has deepened a rift between Ankara and its Western allies. Turkish officials said some Western allies were far too slow in showing solidarity with Erdogan after the coup which they cast as a well-planned attempt to subvert Turkish democracy. Since then, some 50,000 people including journalists, opposition figures, civil servants and others have been detained. The crackdown has alarmed rights groups and some of Turkey s Western allies. Celik said that EU leaders such as Merkel had failed to keep their promises to Turkey on its EU bid which began in 1987 with an application to join what was then the European Economic Community. Turkey s accession negotiations began in 2005.  The EU has failed to keep all of its promises whereas Turkey has delivered on all of the promises it made,  Celik said.  Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said on Wednesday he saw no prospect of Turkey joining the EU in  the foreseeable future .  What has Mr Junker done, what giant strides has he made, to find solutions to bring the EU and Turkey closer? That is my question for Mr Juncker,  Celik said.   If Germany keeps giving orders to the EU institutions   such as cutting negotiations with Turkey   then it will strengthen the hand of racist groups in Europe,  he said. Formally ending Turkey s accession negotiations would require unanimity among EU states, which is lacking, though majority backing is enough to suspend them. Celik suggested that a leaders summit of the EU and Turkey be called to improve relations.  Turkey has not given up on its target to be a full member of the EU: We are eager and willing to find solutions to move forward,  he said. EU leaders will discuss Turkey at a summit in Brussels in October, though any formal decision on its future may not come before next spring.  Celik dismissed concerns that Turkey s purchase of an S-400 air missile defense system from Russia indicated the NATO member could be turning away from the West.  It is obvious on which side Turkey really is,  he said.  Turkey has made immense contributions to security and prosperity in Europe.

Italy's Northern League criticizes magistrates after bank accounts frozen,"ROME (Reuters) - The leader of one of Italy s biggest political parties, the Northern League, criticized magistrates on Thursday after the Genoa court froze several of the bloc s bank accounts. Matteo Salvini, speaking to reporters at the lower house of parliament, said five of the party s bank accounts were frozen on Thursday, following a July conviction of party founder Umberto Bossi and others of illegal use of party funds. The court in Genoa in northern Italy has accepted a request by prosecutors in the fraud case to preventively freeze the accounts, a source close to the matter told Reuters.  The magistrates are trying to outlaw a political party,  Salvini said.  They re trying to stop the advance of the League, which has reached a historic high.  Salvini said he would meet with the party s lawyers on Friday to discuss how to fight the seizure. Bossi is no longer in frontline politics, but he remains an influential figure in the party. In July, the Genoa court said Bossi had used party funds to pay for family expenses. The ruling is being appealed and is not definitive. The League would win 15 percent of the vote if an election were held now, recent polls show, which is about three times higher than it faired in the 2014 European elections.  That would make it the country s third most-popular party, and a national vote is due early next year. As hundreds of thousands of boat migrants have arrived in Italy in the past three years, the opposition Northern League has attacked the government s and the European Union s handling of the immigration crisis.  At the same time, Salvini has tried to broaden the appeal of the party, which was founded to protest Rome s funneling of taxpayer money to the under-developed south.

France calls for rapid resolution in case of journalist arrested in Turkey,"ANKARA (Reuters) - France s foreign minister called on Thursday for a rapid resolution in the case of a French journalist seized by Turkish security forces on the Iraqi border last month, so that he can return to his family. Loup Bureau was held by Turkish border guards on the frontier with Iraq in early August after he was found to have photographs and interviews with Kurdish militia fighters among his possessions.  We have asked for a swift trial so that our citizen can return to France and rejoin his family,  Jean-Yves Le Drian told a news conference with his Turkish counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu in the Turkish capital.  We have also asked for Loup Bureau s family to be granted access to visit him and you (Cavusoglu) have confirmed this to me and we have asked for an improvement in his prison conditions,  Le Drian said. Last month, French President Emmanuel Macron expressed his concerns about Bureau s detention in a telephone call with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan. Turkey considers the Kurdish YPG militia, with which Bureau is accused of having links, to be an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militant group. The PKK has fought a three-decade insurgency in southeast Turkey and is designated a terrorist organization by Ankara, the United States and European Union.  ",worldnews,"September 14, 2017 ",1
Brazilian police raid home of farm minister in graft probe,"BRASILIA/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian police raided the home of Agriculture Minister Blairo Maggi on Thursday in a corruption investigation linked to his time as a state governor, adding to the graft scandals rocking President Michel Temer s government.  Last month the Supreme Court opened a bribery probe into Maggi s role in a scheme known as  mensalinho,  a payment of a monthly stipend to lawmakers in exchange for political support in his home state of Mato Grosso. He served two terms as governor there between 2003 and 2010. According to a person with direct knowledge of the matter, the raid was linked to a plea deal by former Mato Grosso state governor Silval Barbosa, who accuses Maggi of participating in the corruption scheme.  Barbosa was Maggi s vice-governor, replacing him in the top job in 2010 when Maggi resigned to run for a seat in Brazil s Senate. Barbosa was subsequently elected to a four-year term that ended in 2014. Maggi denied any wrongdoing, claiming in a statement that Barbosa  lied  in his plea bargain testimony.  I never authorized any illegal actions while in office nor have I obstructed justice,  Maggi said.  Maggi is a billionaire who was once Brazil s largest soybean producer. His family firm Amaggi SA runs large farms in Mato Grosso and operates a commodity trading business that competes in Brazil with global firms like Archer Daniels Midland Co, Cargill Inc and Bunge Ltd. Mato Grosso, where federal police said they served search warrants in nine cities, is a major producer of grains and cattle. Raids were also conducted in S o Paulo and Bras lia, the police said in a statement. The probe marks the latest blow to Temer s administration, whose economic reform agenda has been repeatedly thwarted by graft investigations that have targeted top officials, including the president. Temer has denied any wrongdoing. ",worldnews,"September 14, 2017 ",1
"Germany should be proud of its WW2 soldiers, far-right candidate says","BERLIN (Reuters) - Germans should be proud of what their soldiers achieved during World War One and Two, the top candidate of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) said ahead of the Sept. 24 election at which his party his expected to enter parliament. The anti-immigrant AfD is on up to 12 percent in opinion polls, meaning it could become the third biggest party in Germany s lower house behind Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives and the Social Democrats (SPD).  If I look around Europe, no other people has dealt as clearly with their past wrongs as the Germans,  76-year-old Alexander Gauland said in a speech to supporters on Sept. 2 that has since been posted on YouTube. The Nazis ruled Germany from 1933 to 1945, during which time they killed 6 million Jews in the Holocaust.  People no longer need to reproach us with these 12 years - they don t relate to our identity nowadays,  Gauland said, referring to the Nazi era. He said the battle of Verdun during World War One belonged to German history, as did Erwin Rommel, the World War Two field marshal celebrated as the  Desert Fox , and army officer Claus von Stauffenberg, who led an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Hitler in July 1944 with a bomb hidden in a briefcase. Gauland said Germany needed to reclaim its history.  If the French are rightly proud of their emperor and the Britons of Nelson and Churchill, we have the right to be proud of the achievements of the German soldiers in two world wars,  Gauland said. The AfD did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In January, Bjoern Hoecke, the AfD s chief in the eastern state of Thuringia, provoked outrage for describing the Holocaust Memorial in Berlin as a  monument of shame  and for demanding a  180 degree turnaround  in the way Germany seeks to atone for Nazi crimes.

Turkish police fire tear gas at protesters outside hunger strikers' trial,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish police fired tear gas to disperse protesters outside a courthouse in Ankara on Thursday at the start of the trial of two teachers who have been on hunger strike since losing their jobs in a crackdown following last year s failed coup. Literature professor Nuriye Gulmen and primary school teacher Semih Ozakca have been surviving on liquids and supplements for six months, and doctors have described their condition as dangerously weak. They were detained in May over alleged links to the militant leftist DHKP-C group, deemed a terrorist organization by Turkey, and the court on Thursday ruled that they be remanded in custody until the next session in two weeks. Neither they nor their original lawyers were in court. The gendarmerie said the defendants might try to escape from the courtroom, despite their weakened state, and arrest warrants were issued this week for 18 of their lawyers.  Police attempted to break up the protests using tear gas, and riot police were present inside and outside the building. At least 20 protesters were detained, being dragged along the ground in the process.  The first obstacle before a fair trial was the detention of their lawyers, which also served as a veiled intimidation attempt at the judges trying them. Now they are not brought to court, in an open breach of their right to defend,  said Baris Yarkadas, a lawmaker from the main opposition Republican People s Party (CHP). At least a hundred lawyers were present at the courthouse to defend the teachers, along with CHP parliamentarians and the pro-Kurdish opposition Peoples  Democratic Party (HDP). The court refused the applications of 1,030 lawyers who wanted to represent the teachers, saying it would limit the defense s representation to three lawyers for the duration of the trial. The trial s second hearing will be held in Ankara on Sept. 28. The teachers have said their hunger strike aimed to draw attention to the plight of roughly 150,000 people suspended or sacked since last July s failed coup, which President Tayyip Erdogan blames on followers of U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen. Gulen denies any involvement. Last month, the European Court of Human Rights rejected a request by the two teachers to order Ankara to release them on health grounds. Since the failed coup attempt, some 50,000 people including journalists, opposition figures, civil servants and others have been detained in the crackdown. Rights groups and Turkey s Western allies accuse the government of using the coup as a pretext to muzzle dissent. Ankara says the purges are necessary due to the gravity of the threats it faces.

"France to make armed street patrols more random, nimble","PARIS (Reuters) - France will make the armed soldiers patrolling its streets against jihadi attacks more mobile and their deployment less predictable but will not cut their numbers, ministers said on Thursday. Some 10,000 soldiers, including 3,000 reservists, have been patrolling the streets of Paris and other French cities since the Islamic State attacks in early 2015 in what is known as  Operation Sentinelle . But although opinion polls show people are reassured by soldiers on show at home, military chiefs said the operation has overstretched the army, soldiers have become targets for militants and some critics see it as no more than a PR exercise.  There is no change in the size of the Sentinelle force,  Defence Minister Florence Parly said in a news conference.  What is changing, is the way we will organize these troops. We have to become more unpredictable,  she said. Soldiers will continue to patrol the most sensitive sites such as airports, stations and areas popular with tourists, and will intervene during specific sport or cultural events. But other patrols will become more random and reactive, ministers said. Making the soldiers less static will reduce the risks of them becoming targets and improve troops  morale, Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said.   In February last year, a French soldier who was part of Operation Sentinelle shot an Egyptian man armed with machetes who attacked him near the entrance to the Louvre museum shouting Allahu Akbar.

No country for migrant stowaways caught on ferry between Ukraine and Turkey,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Twelve migrants, apparently from North Africa, have been sailing to and fro on a Danish passenger ferry between Istanbul and Odessa for the last seven weeks locked in four cabins, with no country willing to take them. According to the Danish DFDS ferry operator, Turkey and Ukraine both refuse to accept the men, who have been violent and threatening suicide.  There has been a tendency to violence and aggressions and they have threatened to jump overboard... so there is no alternative to locking them inside the cabins,  a DFDS spokesman told Reuters on Thursday.  DFDS has hired Turkish guards and invited authorities from the United Nations aboard to question the men of which they believe at least six are Moroccans and four Algerian. The origin of the remaining two is still unknown. The Danish Foreign Ministry has opened negotiations with Turkey, Ukraine and, since the ferry is sailing under the Lithuanian flag, with Vilnius.  The problem can be solved. All it takes is a quick decision from Ankara or Kiev,  a source in the Danish Foreign Ministry with knowledge of the negotiations told Reuters.  A spokesman for the Ukrainian border service said the men wanted to go from Turkey to Romania but got on the wrong ferry and ended up in Ukraine, where they cannot be taken in because they do not have documents.  The problem is that Turkey doesn t want to take them, but Turkey should take them because they sailed from Turkey,  he said, adding that in accordance with the bilateral agreement, the country that delivered these people should take them back.  That s why they ve been cruising about on that ferry,  he said. A Turkish foreign ministry official said the case was being followed  with all related institutions .     DFDS suspected that the young men, in spite of various security measures, boarded by hiding in a trailer that was loaded onto the ferry.        According to the ferry operator, the best solution would be if Ukraine or Turkey agreed to take the migrants, or to get final confirmation as to where the men are from, so they can be sent back to these countries.  It is completely unsound that we should handle thi,  DFDS said.  This is a situation the border controls should handle, not a transportation company.   ",worldnews,"September 14, 2017 ",1
Support for German SPD slumps to lowest this year: poll,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Support for Germany s center-left Social Democrats (SPD) has slumped to its lowest level this year just 10 days before an election in which conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel looks set win a fourth term, a poll showed on Thursday.

Lawyer assisting in murdered Italian student investigation detained in Egypt,"CAIRO (Reuters) - An Egyptian lawyer who is helping investigate the case of murdered Italian student Giulio Regeni was prevented from flying to a U.N. conference and detained by a special prosecutor, his supporters and a security source said. Ibrahim Metwaly, who founded the Association of the Families of the Disappeared after his son disappeared in suspicious circumstances four years ago, himself went missing while heading for his flight to Geneva on Sunday. Members of his group said he was taken from Cairo airport by airport security and he was not heard from until Wednesday when a state security prosecutor ordered him detained for 15 days on charges of  joining a group founded illegally , judicial sources said. There was no comment from the Interior Ministry. A security source said Metwaly was legally arrested and not subjected to any violations.  Rights activists say Egyptian security forces resort to kidnapping government opponents and keeping them in secret jails where they can spend weeks, months, or years without charge. The authorities deny the accusation. Italian graduate student Giulio Regeni, who was conducting research on Egyptian trade unions, disappeared in Cairo on Jan. 25 last year. His body was discovered in a ditch on the outskirts of the Egyptian capital on Feb. 3, showing signs of extensive torture. Metwaly has been assisting lawyers working on the Regeni case as an expert on enforced disappearances, according to one of the lawyers.  I have no doubts Ibrahim s arrest was in connection to the Regeni case and his upcoming trip,  a source at the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF), a Cairo-based NGO, told Reuters. ECRF lawyers are providing legal representation for the Regeni family in Egypt. Metwaly s son Abdelmoniem Metwaly said his father was now in a Cairo jail and that he was also charged with  conducting espionage on behalf of a foreign entity , something he said referred to the U.N. Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances which he was due to address in Geneva. There was no immediate comment from the U.N. body. Regeni s murder has strained ties between Italy and Egypt, traditional Mediterranean allies with strong economic ties. Security and intelligence sources said Regeni was arrested the day he vanished and taken into custody. Egyptian officials have denied any involvement in his death. Italy recalled its ambassador in April 2016 as it sought to obtain evidence from Egypt to solve the murder. Magistrates in Rome and Cairo have met half a dozen times over the past year but no one has been charged.  A new Italian ambassador arrived in Cairo on Wednesday. Pier Antonio Panzeri, an Italian lawmaker who chairs the European Parliament s Subcommittee on Human Rights, said in a statement:  I am disturbed by alleged reports that lawyer Ibrahim Metwaly was arrested ... while he was about to fly to Geneva to address the U.N. Working Group.  ",worldnews,"September 13, 2017 ",1

"Suicide attacks on restaurants, checkpoint, kill 60 in southern Iraq","BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Three suicide attacks claimed by Islamic State killed at least 60 people in southern Iraq on Thursday, a health official and police sources said, suggesting a shift in the ultra-hardline group s tactics since it lost control of its stronghold in Mosul. Iraqi and Kurdish security officials say the Sunni militants are likely to wage a guerrilla war in Iraq after their self-proclaimed caliphate in Mosul collapsed. Islamic State is also under siege in the Syrian city of Raqqa, its operational base for attacks in the Middle East and the West. Security officials described Thursday s attacks as an attempt to send a message to Islamic State followers that the group is still strong and can operate in other parts of Iraq following its territorial losses.  After losing the war in Iraq and the shrinking of its power, Daesh returned back to its old style of an insurgency, by carrying out suicide attacks, which is a clear sign that the terrorist group is retreating,  said police intelligence colonel Murtatha al-Yassiri. IS activity is usually concentrated in western and northern Iraq. Bomb attacks in the mostly Shi ite south, where the bulk of the country s oil is produced and security forces hold a tighter grip, have so far been relatively rare. Like its predecessor in Iraq, al Qaeda, Islamic State seeks to create sectarian tensions as a way to destabilize the OPEC oil producer.  We expect more alike terrorist operations in future. Daesh is trying to desperately pretend among followers that it s still strong,  al-Yassiri said. Daesh is an Arabic acronym for Islamic State, which is also known as ISIS. Wearing security force uniforms and driving stolen army vehicles, the attackers targeted a police checkpoint and two restaurants on a highway near the city of Nassiriya, using car bombs and suicide vests, the sources said. At least 100 people were injured, the police said in a statement. Islamic State claimed responsibility in a statement on its Amaq news agency. The group said it had killed  dozens of Shi ites . The head of Nassiriya s health directorate, Jassim al-Khalidi, said the city s hospital had received 50 bodies and the death toll could rise because some of the wounded were in critical condition. Hospital sources said at least 10 Iranian pilgrims, who were visiting holy Shi ite shrines, were among the dead. The deadliest attack was at a restaurant west of Nassiriya.  One attacker blew up his suicide vest inside the crowded restaurant while a group of other gunmen started to throw grenades and fire at diners,  said police colonel Ali Abdul Hussain. Police sources said some police officers had died in the checkpoint attack, but the toll from that incident remained unclear. Security sources said forces were placed on alert in most of the southern provinces, including the oil city of Basra, in case of similar attacks. ",worldnews,"September 14, 2017 ",1
Three more cars torched in South African taxi war,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - A violent feud between South African meter taxi drivers and ride-hailing services Uber and Taxify escalated with another three vehicles torched using petrol bombs, police said on Thursday. Drivers for Uber [UBER.UL] and Estonian start-up Taxify operating in Johannesburg and capital Pretoria have faced threats and protests from regular taxi operators who accuse the app-based drivers of poaching customers with cheaper fares. One Uber vehicle and two other taxis were torched last week in the upmarket Sandton district and on Wednesday three Taxify vehicles were set alight in the Pretoria suburb of Sunnyside. Police said in one incident on Wednesday a Taxify driver responding to a pick-up request was cornered by a group of eight men who threatened him with violence just as he arrived at the location.  The vehicle was alight after he had alighted from it. Another Taxify vehicle was set on fire at a different location. One of the vehicles was burned out completely, while the second on had slight damages,  said police Captain Daniel Mavimbela. Mavimbela said the identity of the suspects had yet to be  established. More than 6,000 vehicles use the e-hailing Uber application to find customers in South Africa, where the service has grown swiftly as public transport has not kept up with the rising population in sprawling cities.

EU executive warms to Franco-German call on emergency border checks,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union s executive offered initial backing on Thursday to a Franco-German proposal to allow more permanent border checks within the bloc s free-travel zone. Five countries in the so-called Schengen travel zone - Germany, France, Denmark, Austria and Norway - restarted border controls after 2015 attacks in Paris and in an attempt to control the movement of refugees and migrants arriving in the bloc in unprecedented numbers the same year. Schengen rules allow for the reintroduction of such frontier controls for up to two years and the ones now in place expire in November.  Germany and France, aiming for an extension and the ability to reinstate them in future, asked the EU to change the system to extend the maximum duration to four years.  A joint proposal by Paris and Berlin, seen by Reuters, says that would be required  in the context of a long-term terrorist threat  after a raft of deadly Islamist attacks in Europe.  The Commission recognizes that new security challenges have appeared in the past years, as demonstrated by the recent terrorist attacks in Barcelona and Turku,  the EU s migration chief, Dimitris Avramopoulos, told journalists after talks with EU s interior ministers. He said the Brussels-based Commission would propose an update to the Schengen borders code later this month. French Interior Minister Gerard Collomb told journalists after the talks in Brussels:   We had raised this problem some time ago with my German colleague ... and from what I heard from the Commissioner he indeed wants to make the Schengen code more flexible ... to allow us to protect our borders against terrorism.

U.S.-backed forces not planning on entering Deir al-Zor city,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S.-backed militias fighting Islamic State are not planning to enter the city of Deir al-Zor in eastern Syria, a U.S. military spokesman said on Thursday, reducing the chances of the American allies coming face to face with Syrian government forces. The Syrian army and its allies recently broke an Islamic State siege of an enclave in Deir al-Zor that had lasted three years. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a U.S.-backed alliance of mostly Arab and Kurdish fighters, meanwhile have also launched a separate assault in Deir al-Zor province, which has become Islamic State s last major foothold in Syria. Earlier this week, the SDF said it had reached an industrial zone miles to the east of Deir al-Zor city. The advances bring the SDF to within 15 km (10 miles) of the Syrian army. The advances against Islamic State, another blow to its control over territory it held for years as part of a self-declared caliphate, has raised concerns that it would bring the SDF into closer proximity to the Syrian government side, which is backed by Russia and Iran.  U.S. Army Colonel Ryan Dillon, a spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State, told reporters that the battlefield was already congested and the plan was for the SDF to move down the middle Euphrates River Valley.  I ll just tell you that the plan is not to go into Deir   al-Zor city but there (are) plenty of ISIS fighters and resources and leaders that continue to have holdouts throughout the middle Euphrates River valley,  Dillon told reporters in Washington through a video briefing.

Catalonia refuses to send weekly accounts to Madrid before referendum,"MADRID (Reuters) - Catalonia will stop sending weekly financial accounts to Madrid, defying a demand by Spain s central government that the region prove it is not using public money to promote an independence drive. The decision follows a series of moves to block a Catalan referendum on self-rule, planned for Oct. 1, which Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy s government has declared illegal. In a letter dated Sept. 13, Catalan Deputy Governor Oriol Junqueras told Spanish Budget Minister Cristobal Montoro the region would no longer comply with the obligation to submit its accounts every week. He said the arrangement implied  political control that is not related to the objectives of budget stability or to the purposes of state legislation in this matter . Madrid ordered Catalonia to start providing the weekly data in July. The government warned the region would lose access to some public funds if it was found to be using state money to organize the vote. All of Spain s regions pay taxes to the central government, and are then given a quota to spend on health, education and infrastructure. Catalonia, which has one of the strongest regional economies, says the system is unfair. After the referendum was announced, Madrid warned Catalonia it risked losing access to a separate funding program, set up in 2012 when economic crisis hammered regional budgets, if it failed to provide weekly accounts.  Junqueras said in his letter that his administration was committed to financial stability and would still collaborate with Montoro s ministry, and continue to account for their spending every month.  The will of the (Catalan) government is to continue to focus on dialogue and the exercise of democracy as a way to resolve the debate on political relations between Catalonia and Spain,  the letter said.         Catalonia accounts for around 20 percent of Spain s gross domestic product and has received some 70 billion euros ($83 billion) in funding from Madrid since 2012. ",worldnews,"September 14, 2017 ",1

"EU sticks to Libya strategy on migrants, despite human rights concerns","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union is determined to go on preventing migrants setting off from the coast of Libya, interior ministers said on Thursday, despite criticism from rights advocates who say the strategy is aggravating human suffering. After more than two years struggling to stem the flow of refugees and migrants from the Middle East and Africa, the EU is now showing signs of optimism that it is finally in control. A 2016 deal with Turkey effectively closed one major migratory route and this year Italy has led the EU s efforts to curb sea crossings from Libya, supplying money, equipment and training for Libya s border and coast guard, and striking deals with local groups in control on the ground in a country still largely lawless after the 2011 death of Muammar Gaddafi. Mediterranean crossings have dropped from nearly 28,000 people in June to below 10,000 in August, according to U.N. data. Sources told Reuters late last month a new armed group on Libya s coast was stopping migrant boats from leaving.  Human rights groups decry the EU s support for Libya s Prime Minister Fayez Seraj and allied militias who run migrant detention centers they have compared to concentration camps. The top U.N. human rights official said the EU strategy was  very thin on the protection of the human rights of migrants inside Libya and on the boats, and silent on the urgent need for alternatives to the arbitrary detention of vulnerable people.     To offset that, the bloc has stepped up financing for the U.N. agencies for migration (IOM) and refugees (UNHCR) to have them try to improve conditions for migrants inside Libya.   We also need to redouble our efforts to provide assistance to the migrants stranded in Libya and .... exposed to unacceptable, inhumane treatment and human rights violations,  EU s migration chief, Dimitris Avramopoulos, told journalists. But the EU is not changing tack on keeping them there.   If we look at the flows of migrants across the Mediterranean a few months ago and now, the decrease in illegal migration has been big in numbers,  Estonia s Interior Minister Andres Anvelt said ahead of talks in Brussels with his EU peers.  We ll have a discussion about how to have this success story going on.  Avramopoulos said the bloc s executive European Commission backed a U.N. call to resettle a further 40,000 refugees from Libya, Egypt, Niger, Ethiopia and Sudan, an effort to offer legal ways into the EU instead of smuggling or trafficking.  Germany s Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere told reporters:  I m happy that the number of people sent across the Mediterranean by the smugglers to Italy has really fallen in the last two months ... These developments need to be carried on.   We really need to work to ensure that many people simply do not make the trip across the desert to Libya. The neighborhood policy with Africa is very important for a sustainable decline in migrants coming to Italy.  Struggling to come up with a plan, the EU has increasingly let Libya s former colonial power Italy take the lead. Interior Minister Marco Minniti has sponsored those efforts, curbing the sea operations of non-governmental aid groups and striking deals with Libyan mayors to fight people-trafficking, among other moves. Rome has also played a central role in training the Libyan coast guard, which has been accused of abuses, including shooting at aid workers trying to rescue migrants. The EU has denied that any of its funding goes to the militia in the coastal city of Sabratha, which has often prevented migrants from departing for Europe by locking them up. But a senior EU diplomat said the EU s strategy was complex.  It is hard to know exactly what is going on in Libya. We have increasingly entrusted Italy with doing the job there, we give them money. There would never be any proof of EU money going directly to some armed group somewhere,  the person said.  Some of the methods may seem controversial. But there is also preventing loss of life at the sea and political stability in Italy to consider. We shouldn t be too judgmental.  ",worldnews,"September 14, 2017 ",1
Mexicans' positive view of the U.S. collapses in Trump era: poll,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexicans  positive image of the United States has fallen to its lowest level since at least 2002, with about two-thirds of people viewing the country led by President Donald Trump unfavorably, according to a poll released on Thursday.  The U.S.-based Pew Research Center s findings reveal a drastic about-face in Mexicans  views of their northern neighbor. In 2015, 66 percent had a positive view of the United States. By 2017, 65 percent of people disapproved of the world s top economy, Pew said.  Unsurprisingly, few Mexicans approve of Trump s proposed border wall, with 94 percent of people opposing it. But Mexicans also fret about Trump s international footprint.   Only 5 percent have confidence in him to do the right thing regarding world affairs, Trump s lowest rating among 37 nations polled in 2017,  according to the poll. The survey is also grim reading for Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, his ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and the rest of Mexico s political class, less than a year before voters pick a new president in July. Mexicans  favorable view of Pena Nieto has steadily fallen since Pew began measuring it in 2011, dropping from 61 percent six years ago to his current level of 28 percent. An often-large majority disapproves of how Pena Nieto has handled issues like the economy, graft, crime and U.S. relations, Pew said.  The PRI was the most unfavorably viewed of the parties polled by Pew, with the conservative National Action Party enjoying the most positive views, albeit with relatively high negative perceptions. The leftist National Regeneration Movement (MORENA), led by current presidential front-runner Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, was the second most positively viewed party, and also the least badly perceived.  The vast majority - 85 percent - of Mexicans are unhappy with the way things are going in their country. Seventy percent of Mexicans believe the economy is going badly, with 35 percent saying the economy is going very badly. Mexicans  main concerns are crime, political graft and drug violence, Pew found. Anxieties over those three issues had all risen compared with the finding in 2015.  Although Mexicans harbor increasingly negative views of the United States, 55 percent said those that move north enjoy a better life, up from 2015. However, only 13 percent of people said they would live and work in the United States illegally, down from 20 percent in 2015. The survey was based on 1,000 face-to-face interviews in Mexico between March 2 and April 17, with a margin of error of 4.4 percent. ",worldnews,"September 14, 2017 ",1
Myanmar’s Suu Kyi working to get aid to Rohingya: McConnell,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Thursday he had spoken with Myanmar s Aung San Suu Kyi and that she said she was working to get aid to the Rohingya Muslim areas in the Southeast Asian nation that were affected by violence. Suu Kyi  agreed with the need for immediate and improved access of humanitarian assistance to the region, particularly by the International Red Cross, and she conveyed that she is working toward that end,  McConnell said on the Senate floor. McConnell, whose Republicans control majorities in both houses of Congress, repeated earlier criticism of a resolution introduced in the U.S. Senate urging Suu Kyi to do more for Myanmar s ethnic minority Rohingya population, and lessening the chance that any such measure could pass. McConnell has had close ties to Suu Kyi for years. He said Suu Kyi, a Nobel prize laureate and de facto head of the government in Myanmar, also known as Burma, told him when they spoke on Wednesday that violations of human rights would need to be addressed. Attacks by Rohingya militants on security posts last month triggered an army operation that has killed more than 400 people, destroyed over 6,800 houses and sent nearly 400,000 Rohingya Muslims fleeing to Bangladesh. Suu Kyi has been a target of criticism from fellow Nobel laureates and religious leaders across the world for failing to condemn human rights abuses against the Rohingya during the military s fierce response to Rohingya militant attacks. The United Nations appealed Thursday for massive help for the nearly 400,000 who fled to Bangladesh, amid concern the number could keep rising unless Myanmar ends what critics denounce as  ethnic cleansing.  McConnell said Suu Kyi s position in the government was  exceedingly difficult  and that as a civilian, she had virtually no authority over the military. He warned that weakening her could interfere with the country s transition from decades of military rule. McConnell said he expected a briefing soon from Suu Kyi s office and that she was  trying very hard to improve conditions  for the Rohingya.  Burma s path to representative government is not at all certain and is certainly not over. And attacking the single political leader who has worked to further democracy within Burma is likely to hinder the objective over the long run,  McConnell concluded.

Ryanair loses EU court battle to keep Irish law for crew abroad,"LUXEMBOURG/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Ryanair lost an EU court battle on Thursday in which the airline had sought to continue forcing cabin crew based outside Ireland to take their disputes to Irish courts, in a case with implications across the low-cost airline sector.  The European Court of Justice in Luxembourg ruled in favor of cabin crew based at the Irish carrier s Charleroi airport in Belgium on the question of which court should decide on their complaint. The employees took the airline to a local court, believing Belgian law would be more favorable to them.  Ryanair argued that Irish courts had jurisdiction over their Irish contracts. But a Belgian court in Mons had requested the ECJ s ruling on whether its own judges had jurisdiction.   The Court (of Justice) points out first of all that, as regards disputes related to employment contracts, the European rules concerning jurisdiction are aimed at protecting the weaker party,  the Luxembourg-based ECJ said in a statement.  Those rules enable inter alia an employee to sue his employer before the courts which he regards as closest to his interests.   Low-cost carriers such as Ryanair and easyJet have bases all over Europe, including in France, Spain, Italy and Germany, where both planes and crews are stationed. This means crews can return to their home base each night, allowing the airlines to avoid costs involved with overnight rest stops.  Ryanair said the ruling would not add to its costs. Its pilots are typically employed on contracts via third-party agencies, while easyJet uses local labor contracts.  The Court said the place where a cabin crew s aircraft is stationed should also be taken into account when determining which court had jurisdiction.  Philip von Schoeppenthau, Secretary General of the European Cockpit Association, called the ruling a  landmark  decision that is a  ray of light for the thousands of pilots and cabin crew across Europe who have struggled to find legal protection at the place where they actually work on a daily basis, rather than being forced to seek judicial redress in Ireland . Schoeppenthau said the Court s ruling meant all cabin crews in Europe can derive their rights and applicable law from their  Home Base  as a general rule.  Ryanair said it welcomed the ruling for recognizing that the home base of the employee should not be the sole factor in determining which court can hear disputes on labor issues.  We do not believe this  Mons  ruling will in any way alter our Irish contracts of employment or the union rights which all of our people enjoy under the protection of the Irish Constitution,  Ryanair Chief People Officer Eddie Wilson said. Michael O Leary, the company s Chief Executive, said in Berlin the ruling could give the unions more opportunity to take the airline to court or  challenge whatever kind of provisions we provided in Ireland but ultimately, they cannot and will not be changing the Irish contracts or the structure of the Irish contracts.   This won t change Ryanair s cost base by one cent,  O Leary said. The crew involved in the case had employment contracts drawn up under Irish law which said their work was to be regarded as being carried out in Ireland since they were working on Irish-registered aircraft. But Charleroi airport in southern Belgium was designated as their base, meaning they started and ended their working days there and had to reside within an hour of that airport. Ryanair said that Ireland had adopted all EU rules on employment rights and in some cases offered better protection than other EU countries. The case will now go back to the Belgian court, which will make a final decision on the matter.  ",worldnews,"September 14, 2017 ",1
Hammond says UK 'very close' to deal on EU citizens' rights,"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Britain is very close to reaching an agreement with the European Union on how to protect the rights of citizens after it leaves the bloc, British Finance Minister Philip Hammond said on Thursday. The rights of EU citizens in Britain is one of three issues the bloc wants to settle before it begins discussing the future relationship between Britain and the EU.  We have made very good progress. We have a very high degree of alignment. Not yet completely concluded, but we are very close to having agreement on how we are going to protect each other s citizens who are in our countries,  Hammond told a news conference in Budapest after meeting ministers of the Visegrad Group of eastern states.  Our desire and intention is that people who have come to the UK to work and make their lives in the UK should be able to continue to live there, carry on their lives exactly as before. That is our clear and stated intention,  he said. Hammond added however that British nationals who have moved to EU countries should be allowed to do the same.  From a reciprocal basis the objective is to make everything look exactly as it did the day before we left the EU,  he said. Hammond also said talks about Britain s departure from the EU should result in an exit roadmap.  We want to give businesses on both sides of English Channel and both sides of the Irish border the confidence that they will not face a cliff edge when we leave the EU,  he said.  That is why we are proposing a time-limited transition period so that we can provide that certainty that our borders will continue to operate smoothly and that our businesses can continue to supply their customers and our citizens carry on with their day to day lives across continental Europe.

Swedish opposition parties drops vote of no confidence in defense minister,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden s center-right opposition no longer plans to bring a vote of no confidence in Defence Minister Peter Hultqvist over a botched IT outsourcing deal, after new information came to light, the alliance said.  Losing Hultqvist, one of the government s most popular ministers, would have been a blow to Prime Minister Stefan Lofven, with Sweden due to hold elections in just a year s time. Other parties can still go ahead with a vote, but they would not get the majority necessary to oust him.  Lofven has already replaced two ministers in his minority center-left government over the IT deal, and the opposition had also demanded the removal of Hultqvist, who has maintained he has done nothing wrong.  However, the Liberals and the Center Party have now changed their minds, saying new information showed Hultqvist s involvement was not as serious as previously thought.   This new information means that we can t support a vote of no confidence,  Liberal Party Leader Jan Bjorklund told a news conference. Votes of no confidence are not common in Sweden. Since 1980, only seven have taken place and none of them has been successful.  ",worldnews,"September 14, 2017 ",1
Brazilians toil for gold in illegal Amazon mines,"CREPURIZAO, Brazil (Reuters) - Informal mining in Brazil is seen by many as a scourge polluting the Amazon rainforest, poisoning indigenous tribes and robbing the nation of its wealth.  For others it is a way of life. Brazilian garimpos, or wildcat mines, are operated by small crews of men, often caked in red-brown mud and working with rudimentary pans, shovels and sluice boxes that have been used for centuries. More sophisticated operations use water cannons and boats sucking mud from the bottoms of rivers. Regardless of the method, searching for gold and other minerals like cassiterite and niobium is dirty, dangerous and often illegal.  Looking for gold is like playing in a casino,  said a 48-year-old miner. Miners asked not to be named, saying they feared the police  as much of their work is illegal. He started in the wildcat mines as a teenager in the area around Crepurizao   a ramshackle frontier town of 5,000 with a dirt landing strip that is a gateway for informal mining in the region. Garimpos are in the spotlight as Brazil debates opening an area known as Renca in the northern Amazon forest to mining, which has met with stiff resistance from environmentalists. Mines and Energy Minister Fernando Coelho Filho argues that licensed mining will be an improvement over the estimated 1,000 people currently mining in the reserve illegally. Crepurizao lies hundreds of miles south of Renca, but gives a window into life in the garimpos caught up in the debate. Living in makeshift homes of wood and plastic, miners in the area ship some 60 kilograms (132 lbs) of gold per month, according to traders. That much pure gold is worth millions of dollars on the global market, but high costs and layers of traders in the local market leave most miners living on the brink of poverty. Basic staples can cost four or five times the price in the nearest city, an eight-hour bus ride away.  Fuel stations, a general store, a bar, an evangelical church and prostitutes vie for the income and attention of the miners, known as garimpeiros, when they aren t working or lazing in hammocks. There are 2,113 licensed garimpo sites in Brazil, according to ministry data, but environmental experts and two government officials, who asked not to be named, said far more small-scale mines skip the licensing and ignore regulations altogether. In Crepurizao, where mines often cluster close together, it was unclear which operations were licensed. The total area worked by garimpeiros in Brazil is thought to be small. But chemicals like mercury, which miners in Crepurizao dump to separate gold from grit, can leave a large footprint of contamination. In March last year, a government-backed study of indigenous villages in the northern state of Roraima revealed alarming levels of mercury. One group of villagers had more than double the level of mercury considered to be a serious health risk - such as damage to the central nervous system, kidneys, heart and reproductive process - detected in their hair. The Mining and Energy Ministry said a new oversight agency created in a decree by President Michel Temer, now pending congressional approval, would allow more effective government coordination and inspections to restrict illegal mining. Congressman Leonardo Quintao, who sits on the committee considering the new agency, said it will be able to raise more funding for oversight. He said the regulations target licensed miners, while illegal mining remains a matter for the police. Still, one Ibama enforcement officer, who was not authorized to speak to the media, said the government had left miners like those in Crepurizao in a precarious limbo.  You can t just pull them out of the garimpos and the cities that are living off gold. And the government does not offer them structure and decent conditions,  said the officer.  So they re stranded there without the minimum conditions for survival.  (Click on reut.rs/2f6E5c2 for related photo essay) ",worldnews,"September 14, 2017 ",1
Hungary's Fidesz prepares campaign against 'Soros plan' for migrants,"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary s ruling Fidesz party, preparing for elections next April, promised on Thursday to highlight what it called a plan by billionaire financier George Soros to bring millions of migrants into Europe. Fidesz asked Prime Minister Viktor Orban s government to carry out a  national consultation  about Brussels  plans to distribute asylum-seekers in the EU, a week after the EU s top court ruled against complainants Hungary and Slovakia. Previous such consultations have taken the form of sending out questionnaires to millions of voters, setting out the government s right-wing nationalist position and asking people if they agree. Soros, a Hungarian-born Jew who has spent a large part of his fortune funding pro-democracy and human rights groups, has been targeted by Orban s government repeatedly. His spokesman has described the government s portrayal of his views on immigration as  fantasy . Orban has been one of the loudest opponents of mandatory migrant resettlement quotas proposed by the EU, arguing this would undermine its sovereignty and social fabric. His stance has gone down well with voters, and Fidesz is firmly ahead in opinion polls. Lajos Kosa, a party vice chairman, said the national consultation should focus on the alleged Soros plan, something that would place migration at the center of the campaign.  The European Commission stops just short of saying that they carry out the Soros plan... but all their steps and ideas with regard to migration point in this direction,  Kosa said, adding last week s EU court defeat for Hungary had  opened the gates . Soros  spokesman Michael Vachon in July dismissed the idea that the financier and philanthropist was promoting a scheme to import millions of illegal immigrants into Europe.  Soros s actual position on migration is that the international community should provide more support to the developing countries that today host 89 percent of refugees and that Europe should accept several hundred thousand fully screened refugees through an orderly process of vetting and resettlement,  he said. He said an anti-migrant billboard campaign by the Hungarian government, showing a smiling Soros and carrying the caption  Don t let Soros have the last laugh , was  reminiscent of Europe s darkest hours . The government ended the poster campaign over the summer. ",worldnews,"September 14, 2017 ",1
Balkan police break up Turkish migrant smuggling ring,"SARAJEVO (Reuters) - Police in the Balkans have arrested 21 men suspected of smuggling close to 200 Turks to the European Union, officials said on Thursday. The suspects, including a Turkish national who is believed to be the ring leader, are accused of taking advantage of visa -free travel between Turkey and Bosnia and Montenegro to transfer migrants by plane from Istanbul to Sarajevo and Podgorica. They were then smuggled into EU member Croatia and further on to Western Europe, said police who ran a joint operation involving officers from Bosnia, Croatia and Montenegro.  The suspected smugglers, who are nationals of Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Montenegro and Serbia, charged migrants 3,500 to 5,000 euros per person to reach EU member states, said Adnan Kosovac, a Bosnian border police official. Kosovac said that as well as the arrests on Wednesday, the police also raided several houses in western Bosnia and neighboring Croatia where the gang kept illegal migrants and seized mobile phones, SIM cards and money.

"EU: spot checks show confusion, not conspiracy in Kenyan election","NAIROBI (Reuters) - Observers found some technical problems but no evidence of vote-rigging in Kenya s presidential election last month, the European Union said on Thursday, based on random checks of tallies from polling stations. The finding was announced as Kenya gears up for a re-run of the contest between President Uhuru Kenyatta and challenger Raila Odinga on Oct. 17, after the Supreme Court nullified  Kenyatta s victory citing irregularities in the tallying process. Credible elections would boost Kenya s role as East Africa s richest economy and a stable Western ally in a region roiled by conflict. But problems with the vote could spark unrest: 1,200 people died in violence after a disputed 2007 election. Bolstering the Supreme Court s findings of technical irregularities, the EU said in a statement it had examined  1,558 randomly selected scanned polling station results forms from 82 constituencies. A small percentage were unreadable, others had mathematical mistakes, and others were missing data or signatures. The country had nearly 41,000 polling stations and 290 constituencies.  Odinga alleged that the original vote was marred by fraud and is threatening to boycott the re-run unless some demands are  met, including the resignation of key election board officials.   But the EU said it did not find anything indicating deliberate manipulation of the vote in the forms it examined.  There was little variation in the patterns of anomalies ... and no obvious advantage to one camp or another.  However, the observers noted that more than a quarter of polling stations were severely late in posting their manually completed tallying sheets online. In some cases they only did so after the legal deadline for the opposition to mount court challenges to the results had passed, they noted.  The EU urged the election commission to use standardized forms with security features like serial numbers to reduce the opportunities for confusion in the upcoming polls.  It said the electoral board must do a better job of publicly explaining the processes it would follow in tallying the vote. In a separate development on Thursday, ruling party lawmaker Ngunjiri Wambugu filed a court petition seeking to have Chief Justice David Maraga removed for gross misconduct in connection with the annulment of the election.   Chief Justice Maraga needs to be censured, I believe he has participated in gross misconduct, which is unprofessional. I believe that gross misconduct is trying to influence a presidential election,  Wambugu told reporters.     ",worldnews,"September 14, 2017 ",1
"In a first, Myanmar's 'ethnic cleansing' unites Suu Kyi's party, army and public","YANGON (Reuters) - If there s one thing that unites Aung San Suu Kyi s party, the army that once tried to crush her, and the majority of people in mostly Buddhist Myanmar, it is their vehement dislike of the Rohingya Muslims, seen as a threat to national security.  We don t love the military, but we are together on this one,  said Nyan Win, a top official of Suu Kyi s National League for Democracy (NLD), who the country s former junta had detained for nearly three years.  Our sovereignty can t be violated and that is why we are united.    These people are illegal immigrants, that s for sure. But the international community never mentions that,  said Nyan Win, 75, who chairs the ruling NLD s media team and is one of the most influential members of the party. But even as the United Nations has called the army crackdown on the Rohingya  ethnic cleansing , western diplomats - from countries competing with China for influence in the Southeast Asian nation - say abandoning Suu Kyi or reimposing sanctions could risk Myanmar s democratic transition. Though Rohingya families have lived in Myanmar for generations, they are denied citizenship and access to basic civil rights such as freedom of movement, decent education and healthcare. Attacks by Rohingya militants on security posts last month triggered an army operation that has killed more than 400 people, destroyed over 6,800 houses and sent nearly 400,000 Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh. Rohingya refugees and rights groups say the army has launched a campaign aimed at driving them out. Suu Kyi, who holds the title of  State Counsellor  and is de facto head of government, has said the militant Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) is responsible for the burning of homes, civilian deaths as well as  a huge iceberg of misinformation  on the strife in Rakhine. Revered when she was under house arrest for some 15 years, the Nobel peace winner has been criticized by fellow Nobel laureates and some leaders across the world. A petition drive is under way to revoke her Nobel prize. Malala Yousafzai, a fellow Nobel Peace Prize laureate, called on her to condemn the  shameful  treatment of the Rohingya, saying  the world is waiting  for her to speak out.  Shame on you Malala! You know nothing about real situation in our country,  Myanmar Internet user Nann Wint War wrote in a tweet.  There is no Rohingya, only Bengali terrorists in Rakhine,  said the tweet, a reference to Rohingya that suggests they come from Bangladesh.     Suu Kyi s government launched a media campaign aimed at shoring up public support for the operation.  In Facebook and Twitter posts, it has shown off support for non-Muslims displaced by the violence and blamed the international community for distributing  fake news  about alleged rights abuses.  Hard Evidence Please! , Suu Kyi s spokesman, Zaw Htay, said in a tweet last week reacting to a BBC News report that Rakhine Buddhist villagers set Muslim houses on fire.  You wrote you just saw it, share your #Evidence.  Aung Shin, an NLD spokesman, said only Myanmar citizens understand the situation in Rakhine as  foreign countries made their assumption based on questionable facts they obtained.  Many in Myanmar fear the Rohingya present a threat to the Buddhist Rakhine majority in Rakhine State. Sixteen non-Muslims were killed and nearly 30,000 have also been displaced, fleeing to larger towns. The conflict in Rakhine has stoked communal tensions across the country. A mob armed with sticks and swords, threatening to attack a mosque in central Myanmar, was only dispersed on Sunday after police with riot shields fired rubber bullets. Muslims have voiced fear that other mosques will come under attack and have asked for tighter security.   Thiri Thant Mon, managing director at Yangon-based investment advisory firm Sandanila, said many in Myanmar think the international community has wrongly directed its attention to the Rohingya fleeing Myanmar, instead of the suffering of Rakhine Buddhists in one of its poorest states.  The entire population here just feel misunderstood. They feel like we are not bad people. It s not us, it s them who are killing us and why aren t you talking about it?  said Thiri Thant Mon, who herself does not identify with such views.  The Rohingya issue has put Suu Kyi in an awkward position politically, the diplomats said. The military still controls much of the state apparatus even after the 2011 transition to democracy. It portrays itself as the true guardians of nationalism and Buddhism. They say that could be a reason for Suu Kyi s reticence.  If she speaks out on such a sensitive issue, the situation will explode, making it harder for her to solve the problem in Rakhine,  said Nyan Win, the NLD executive.   We can accept them as humans but we cannot let them move around freely, which violates our sovereignty,  he said, adding the Rohingya belong in camps for displaced people in Rakhine due to security reasons.     We can t give them freedom of movement because they are not our citizens.  ",worldnews,"September 14, 2017 ",1
India calls Rohingya refugees 'threat to national security',"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The Indian government on Thursday told the Supreme Court that Rohingya refugees were  a threat to national security , pushing back against condemnation of its plans to deport them.  India s top court is hearing a challenge to Prime Minister Narendra Modi s government s decision to deport Rohingya Muslims, filed by two Rohingyas living in Delhi who fled their village in Myanmar s western Rakhine State about six years ago. The decision to deport Rohingyas comes as Myanmar s military crackdown in Rakhine has forced hundreds of thousands of Rohingyas to seek shelter in Bangladesh, in a process the U.N. has described as ethnic cleansing. Myanmar says its forces are carrying out their legitimate duty to restore order after guerrilla attacks on Aug. 25 on security posts and an army camp in which about a dozen people were killed. Close to 40,000 Rohingya Muslims live in India after fleeing Myanmar over the past decade. Nearly 15,000 have received refugee documentation, according to the United Nations, but India wants to deport them all. Rohingyas are denied citizenship in Buddhist-majority Myanmar and regarded as illegal immigrants, despite claiming roots that date back centuries. Some groups allied to Modi s Bharatiya Janata Party have stepped up calls for Rohingyas to leave, and Modi said last week that India shared Myanmar s concerns about  extremist violence  in Rakhine state.  On Thursday, a senior lawyer representing India s government told the supreme court that  the state considers that Rohingyas are a threat to national security.  Intelligence agencies suspect that Rohingya Muslim leaders in India are in touch with Pakistan-based militant groups, the lawyer said. The lawyer declined to be named because an affidavit the home ministry is preparing to file with the court has not yet been finalised. Bangladesh is also growing hostile to the Rohingya, more than 400,000 of whom live there after fleeing Myanmar since the early 1990s. From Bangladesh, some Rohingyas have crossed into India. Aid groups and human rights activists have criticized the plans to expel Rohingyas, and some lawyers say deportation would violate India s constitution. India s supreme court is expected to start hearing the case on Monday.  India this week sent 53 tonnes of relief materials to Bangladesh for Rohingyas fleeing Myanmar.

"London fire inquiry starts amid anger, despair of survivors","LONDON (Reuters) - A public inquiry into a fire that killed at least 80 people at London s Grenfell Tower will get to the truth about the tragedy, its chairman pledged on Thursday, but critics said survivors of the blaze were still being failed. The 24-storey social housing block, home to a poor, multi-ethnic community, was gutted on June 14 in an inferno that started in a fourth-floor apartment in the middle of the night and quickly engulfed the building. Grenfell Tower was part of a deprived housing estate in Kensington and Chelsea, one of the richest boroughs in London, and the disaster has prompted a national debate about social inequality and government neglect of poor communities. The inquiry started with a minute s silence to honor the victims, whose exact number remains unknown because of the devastation inside the tower.  (The inquiry) can and will provide answers to the pressing questions of how a disaster of this kind could occur in 21st century London,  its chairman, retired judge Martin Moore-Bick, said in his opening statement. He said the inquiry was not there to punish anyone or to award compensation, but to get to the truth. A separate police investigation is underway, which could result in manslaughter charges. There have been no arrests. The inquiry will examine the cause and spread of the fire, the design, construction and refurbishment of the tower, whether fire regulations relating to high-rise buildings are adequate and whether they were complied with. It will also look at the actions of the authorities before and after the tragedy. But critics warned of a disconnect between the technical, legalistic inquiry process and the ongoing ordeal of traumatized former Grenfell Tower residents still awaiting new homes. Prime Minister Theresa May pledged that all families whose homes were destroyed in the fire would be rehoused within three weeks, but three months later most still live in hotels. Just three out of 197 households that needed rehousing have moved into permanent homes, while 29 have moved into temporary accommodation.  We lost everything. It s difficult for the other people to be in our shoes,  Miguel Alves, who escaped his 13th-floor apartment in Grenfell Tower with his family, told the BBC.  Now I m without anything, I m in the hotel, I have to cope with my family. My daughter, she just started school. They need some stability and that I cannot give to my family,  he said. Emma Dent Coad, a member of parliament from the opposition Labour Party who represents the area, said the inquiry s remit was too narrow and would fail to address the blaze s deeper causes such as failings in social housing policies. She also criticized the choice of venue for Moore-Bick s opening statement, a lavishly decorated room in central London.  We were sitting in a ballroom dripping with chandeliers. I think it was the most incredibly inappropriate place to have something like that, and actually says it all about the us-and-them divide that people see,  she told the BBC. Many of those affected have also expressed disquiet about the fact that Moore-Bick and the other lawyers appointed to run the inquiry are all white and part of a perceived  establishment  far removed from their own circumstances.  The experience of many residents of that tower is that they were ignored because of their immigration status,  lawyer Jolyon Maugham, who is advising some residents, told the BBC.  We need someone on the inquiry team that can speak to that experience and at the moment on the panel we have a bunch of white privileged barristers,  he said. One of the difficulties facing the inquiry is that it needs former residents to give evidence but some fear possible deportation. The government has said it would grant a 12-month amnesty to anyone affected by the fire who was in Britain illegally. Supporters say only permanent residency rights will persuade people to come forward. ",worldnews,"September 14, 2017 ",1
All the president's women: Duterte's fiercest critics and a surly political heir,"DAVAO, Philippines/MANILA (Reuters) - Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte has a problem with women, says the woman who has known him longer than perhaps any other: his sister Jocellyn.  He s a chauvinist,  she told Reuters in a recent interview.  When he sees a woman who fights him, it really gets his ire.  Then Jocellyn ran through a list of Duterte s female critics that included his vice president, a prominent senator who is now in jail and the head of the Philippines Supreme Court.  All three have sparred with Duterte after denouncing his brutal war on drugs, which has killed thousands of people in the Asian nation since he took office in June 2016. Duterte has joked about rape, insulted the Pope and baffled friends and foes with often contradictory public statements. Neither this, nor his profanity-laden reactions to women critics, seem to have dented his popularity among Filipinos. The 72-year-old president is a self-confessed womanizer who once told a large gathering of local officials,  I can t imagine life without Viagra.  On the campaign trail last year, he joked about the gang rape of an Australian missionary who was killed in a prison riot. Speaking to Philippine troops in May, he said he would take responsibility for any rape they might commit.  But women s rights advocates also praise him for handing out free contraceptives in his hometown, Davao City, where he was mayor for 22 years, and for championing a reproductive health bill opposed by the country s influential Catholic Church. In a recent statement, even Human Rights Watch - a fervent critic of the drug war - acknowledged Duterte s  strong support  for legislation aimed at protecting and promoting women. After nearly 15 months in power, he remains highly popular with men and women alike, according to the latest survey by Manila-based pollster Social Weather Stations. While foreigners frown at Duterte s rape jokes, says Gina Lopez, a former environment secretary in Duterte s male-dominated cabinet, Filipinos judge him by his actions not his words.  When I see him dealing with women in the cabinet or whatever, he has been very above-board, very decent,  she told Reuters. She said this decency also once extended to Vice-President Leni Robredo, who has publicly fallen out with Duterte. She is from an opposition party and was elected separately.  He really liked Leni. They got along and he was always flirting,  said Lopez.  That s what men do, right?  In a statement to Reuters, the president s office called Duterte  an advocate of women s rights  who had launched a  massive campaign against gender bias  while mayor of Davao. As president, it added, he had  hand-picked the best and brightest women  for his cabinet. Three of the country s 25 cabinet secretaries or ministers are women. Duterte spends up to four days a week in his far-flung hometown Davao, ruling a nation of 100 million people not from the presidential palace in the capital, Manila, but from a modest house shaded by a jackfruit tree. Duterte was mayor of Davao for 22 years. He sleeps until lunchtime, holds cabinet meetings infrequently and sometimes announces major policies without forewarning senior officials, leaving them scrambling to catch up. Duterte s volatility has baffled Washington, which has long seen the Philippines as a bulwark against Chinese expansionism. He has courted Beijing and publicly berated the United States in rambling speeches. Much of Duterte s venom is reserved for women who oppose him. In August, he called Agnes Callamard, a U.N. special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings, a  daughter of a whore  after she condemned the police shooting of a teenage drug suspect.  He s a misogynist,  said Senator Leila de Lima, who spoke to Reuters at a police detention facility in Manila. De Lima was arrested in February on drugs charges she says were trumped up as part of a presidential vendetta.  To him, women are inferior,  she said.  It s totally insulting to him that a woman would be fighting him.  According to Jocellyn Duterte, Duterte is also fighting with the woman he hopes will cement his political legacy: his daughter Sara. Sara Duterte reluctantly replaced her father as mayor of Davao City in the southern Philippines when he became president. Father and daughter barely speak, said Jocellyn.  I know in his quiet moments he considers himself a failure as a father because of Sara fighting with him,  she said. Jocellyn said she had her own problems with her older brother but they now get along. They have two other brothers. Jocellyn, who refers to the president as  the mayor,  said Duterte still eats the same simple food their mother Soledad once cooked: cheap fish simmered in vinegar. She also traces Duterte s authoritarianism to Soledad, who punished her children with a horsewhip or made them kneel at an altar for hours.   You can see that in the mayor,  says Jocellyn.  Sometimes people perceive it as arrogance or call it close to being a dictator. But we grew up in that atmosphere.  Their father Vicente, also a politician, was often absent, and the young Duterte saw the bodyguards, police and soldiers around him as role models, his sister said. He grew up in a macho culture where wives and daughters were expected to be submissive, Jocellyn said. His daughter Sara is anything but. In 2011, during her first term as Davao s mayor, she was caught on camera punching a local official who angered her. In 2016, Sara ran as mayor again, but only because she was  pressured  by her father s supporters, she told Reuters.  If it were up to me, I would not have run,  she said. She said she now only saw her father on special occasions, such as birthdays and Christmas, but denied they had differences.  He s very busy,  she said. Duterte and his daughter have  a normal Filipino parent-child relationship which has its own share of ups and downs,  said the president s office in its statement. Like her father, Sara is blunt, down-to-earth and thronged by admirers at public appearances in Davao. She told Reuters she wanted to practice law and, once her three-year term as mayor was up, had no wish or intention to continue in politics. But in a country famous for political dynasties spanning many generations, Duterte wants his daughter to  preserve what the family has done for the city,  said Jocellyn.  He is trying to instill in Sara that it is our legacy,  she said.  Maybe she needs more time.  ",worldnews,"September 14, 2017 ",1
"A dead dictator, his rusting boat and a fight for history","RIJEKA, Croatia (Reuters) - In a Croatian port sits a boat built to carry bananas from Africa to Italy, that laid mines for Nazi Germany and was sunk by Allied planes before it was salvaged as the personal yacht of a globe-trotting communist leader. Josip Broz Tito and the state he led - Yugoslavia - have long passed into history, and the boat, the Galeb (Seagull), was left to rust in a corner of Rijeka s once mighty docks. Now, with Rijeka readying to become European Capital of Culture in 2020, city authorities have secured European Union money to restore the 117-metre (384-feet) boat as a museum, just as debate in Croatia rages over the life and deeds of the man who graced the pink mattress in the front port-side cabin. If the Galeb was a symbol of Tito s prestige on the world stage   a communist leader welcome in ports West as well as East   its restoration is part of Croatia s own tortured process of reconciliation with its 20th century history. To conservatives in Croatia, Tito   who was born in what is today Croatia to a Croat father and Slovene mother   was a totalitarian dictator: to look fondly on him means to be nostalgic for a shared federal state that denied Croats their own until they forged one in a 1991-95 war.  Liberals, however, recall his guerrilla fight against the Nazis and the relative freedom and prosperity of Yugoslavs compared to those who lived in the Soviet Union or in its shadow. They see in the disdain of conservatives a thinly veiled fondness for the World War Two Croatian state that collaborated with the Nazis but was snuffed out with Tito s Partisan victory   a sentiment that has gained a foothold in mainstream Croatian politics in recent years. It is a tug-of-war over history and identity that was encapsulated this month in the renaming by Zagreb s city council of the capital s Marshal Tito Square to Republic of Croatia square. Days later, the government ordered the removal of a plaque near the site of a World War Two concentration camp that bore a notorious slogan associated with the Nazi puppet regime in Croatia.  We live in a time when history is being reinvented retroactively,  said Ivan Sarar, who as head of culture at Rijeka s city council is in charge of its 2020 makeover.  It s interesting that just by undertaking this (restoration) we have already been declared revisionists,  he told Reuters. After years of false-starts, work on restoring the Galeb is imminent   a mammoth, multi-million-euro task to recreate the 1950s chic of Tito s floating palace, host to over 100 heads of state and some of Hollywood s finest.  Some of the furniture remains - in Tito s cabin, his turquoise-tiled bathroom and the adjacent salon with doors that open to the deck. But the ship itself is little more than a rotting hull. The Galeb was the stage for Tito s major contribution to history, said Sarar, a showcase for the non-aligned movement he helped found in answer to the East-West polarization of the Cold War. But Sarar stressed:  We won t be soft on anyone.  He noted Tito s cozy ties with dictators around the world, the exodus of Italian residents of Rijeka when he took the city as part of Yugoslavia, and his denial of democracy during 35 years of one-man rule until his death in 1980. Yugoslavia fell apart in war a decade later and some 135,000 people were killed. It was Tito s seizure of Rijeka and the Istrian peninsula that cemented his status in this part of Croatia as a liberator. Dozens of streets in Istria still bear his name, as do others in the Balkans - most notably in Serbia, once the dominant republic in Yugoslavia. Conservatives, however, struck a blow with the renaming of Zagreb s Marshal Tito Square, part of a deal struck by the mayor to secure his majority in the city assembly. The man behind the initiative, leading right-wing politician Zlatko Hasanbegovic, told Reuters that while Tito was  undeniably a significant historical figure,  so were Napoleon, Stalin and Lenin.  In all countries, streets and squares bear the names of those who embody the values with which the entire nation identifies itself,  he said, describing the restoration of the Galeb as part of an attempt to revive the cult of Tito.   Those insisting on it should ask themselves how the tens of thousands of victims of Yugoslav communism look on that kind of quasi-cultural exhibitionism.  In Rijeka, Sarar denied planning any kind of homage to Tito.  We want to create a place for dialogue, away from the current situation of extreme black, white and red truths that lead nowhere,  he said.  It s bound to be difficult.

Independent Catalonia would need to apply to join EU: Juncker,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - An independent Catalonia would have to apply to join the European Union, the president of the executive European Commission said on Thursday, adding that such a policy would apply to any new state. Catalonia s parliament has laid the ground for a referendum on independence from Madrid on Oct. 1, although Spain s Constitutional Court has suspended the vote. Judges are now considering whether the legislation contravenes Spain s constitution.  If there were to be a  yes  vote in favor of Catalan independence, then we will respect that opinion. But Catalonia will not be able to be an EU member state on the day after such a vote,  Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker said on YouTube and broadcast by Euronews. Echoing a stance made by his predecessor, Jose Manuel Barroso, Juncker said any newly independent state must follow the same EU membership procedures as all aspirants, citing Scotland and, in jest, his home country, Luxembourg.  If northern Luxembourg were to cede from the south, the same rules would apply,  Juncker said.  The EU s accession negotiations are an arduous process that involve complying with all EU standards and rules and winning the consent of all EU governments. This means that Spain would be able to block Catalonia s EU accession if it wished. Croatia was the last country to join the EU, in 2013 after first applying for membership in 2003.

Red Cross halts aid to swathe of South Sudan after staff member killed,"ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - The Red Cross has halted operations across a third of South Sudan after gunmen shot dead a staff member, in what the U.N. said on Wednesday was the biggest such suspension during the country s four-year civil war. Kennedy Laki Emmanuel, a driver for the Red Cross, died on Sept. 8 when gunmen fired on a 10-vehicle convoy delivering aid in South Sudan s restive Western Equatoria state. In response, the International Committee of the Red Cross shut down activities across Equatoria, a region roughly the size of Britain that borders Congo and Uganda and has seen some of the heaviest fighting over the last year. The suspension affected more than 22,000 people about to get aid deliveries from the Red Cross. That included more than 5,000 farmers due to receive seeds in an area teetering on the edge of famine.       The ICRC will not resume anything until we have a clear picture of exactly what happened and until we receive the necessary security guarantees,  spokeswoman Mari Mortvedt told Reuters. The security of the ICRC staff is top priority.  The U.N. s Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs  told Reuters that no aid group had shut down its operations over such a large area since South Sudan s civil war began in 2013.  The conflict began after President Salva Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, fired his deputy Riek Machar, an ethnic Nuer. The U.N. says ethnic cleansing has taken place and warned of genocide, amid reports of murder, rape, and torture of civilians. More than two million South Sudanese have now fled the country, creating Africa s biggest refugee crisis since the 1994 Rwandan genocide, and more than half of those remaining need food aid. The country s original population was 12 million.  At least 85 aid workers have been killed, according to the U.N., including 18 this year, making it the deadliest country for aid workers in the world. That number did not include a staff member for aid group World Vision, killed in the Western Equatoria town of Yambio on September 3. It was not clear whether that death was related to his work as an aid worker, so it was not included in the total, the group said.

Finland says no ransom paid for released aid worker in Kabul,"HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finland did not pay a ransom for the release of a Finnish aid worker kidnapped in Afghanistan, the Nordic country s foreign minister said on Thursday.  Finland has not paid, and will not pay ransom in the future. If we did, we would only encourage further kidnappings,  Foreign Minister Timo Soini told a news conference via videolink from Washington. The ministry confirmed earlier on Thursday that the Finnish woman, who was abducted in May and held captive for 118 days, had been released. She was working for a Swedish aid group in Kabul and during her abduction a German colleague and their Afghan guard were killed. The foreign ministry gave no further details about the kidnapping or the release, but said the woman was in Afghanistan and in  good condition in light of the circumstances . Kidnapping is a longstanding problem in Afghanistan, mainly affecting Afghans abducted for ransom. However foreigners have also regularly been targeted, either for ransom or to put pressure on their governments. ",worldnews,"September 14, 2017 ",1
"Hong Kong's 'One Country, Two Systems' framework under pressure: Britain","HONG KONG (Reuters) -  Important areas  of Hong Kong s  One Country, Two Systems  framework are coming under growing pressure, illustrated by developments such as reports of mainland security officials operating in the autonomous city, a British government report said on Thursday. The  One Country, Two Systems  principle, implemented as the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997, promises the city a high degree of autonomy, an independent judiciary and a range of freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China. The former colonial power has been issuing reports on Hong Kong every half a year since then, and the latest, which covers developments in the first six months this year, British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the guiding principle has  generally functioned well.   However, at the same time, we cannot ignore that important areas of the  One Country, Two Systems  framework are coming under increasing pressure,  Johnson wrote.  Examples include  further reports of mainland security officials operating within  Hong Kong, he said, without elaborating, as well as reports of the local Beijing representative s office heightening its influence in the city. But for the first time, the half-yearly report stopped short of raising concern over five Hong Kong booksellers who disappeared in late 2015 and later mysteriously re-emerged in mainland Chinese custody. One of the five men, Swedish citizen Gui Minhai, is still in Chinese detention. The report also touched upon the  apparent abduction  of Chinese billionaire Xiao Jianhua, who in January disappeared from his downtown Hong Kong apartment in a wheelchair with his head covered. Although Hong Kong authorities said there was no evidence to suggest mainland law enforcement agents had acted on Hong Kong soil, Johnson noted that  many in Hong Kong and internationally highlighted the numerous similarities between Xiao Jianhua s apparent abduction and the case of the Hong Kong booksellers.    He also said he looked forward to welcoming the city s newly sworn-in leader, Carrie Lam, to visit London to discuss closer co-operation between the UK and Hong Kong  as the UK prepares to leave the EU.  In response to the report, the Hong Kong government said foreign governments should not interfere in the internal affairs of the city.  Since the return to the motherland, the HKSAR (Special Administrative Region) has been exercising a high degree of autonomy ... This demonstrates the full and successful implementation of the  one country, two systems  principle, which has been widely recognized by the international community.

Cambodia suspends cooperation with U.S. in finding war remains,"PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen said on Thursday he was suspending cooperation with the United States to find the remains of Americans killed in the Vietnam War in the latest ratcheting up of tensions between the two countries. Hun Sen has accused the United States of plotting treason with opposition leader Kem Sokha, an accusation rejected by the U.S. embassy, which has called for the release of the prime minister s main rival.  The search cooperation is postponed until a number of issues are resolved between Cambodia and the United States,  Hun Sen said according to pro-government website Fresh News. Hun Sen said that a total of 80 American soldiers had gone missing in Cambodia during the war in neighboring Vietnam and that half of them had been found. Hun Sen said the suspension will be lifted after Cambodia-U.S. ties are restored. Washington announced on Wednesday that it would stop issuing some visas after Cambodia refused to accept Cambodian citizens deported from the United States after being convicted of crimes there. Hun Sen said the policy of deporting them back to Cambodia  break them up as families, as parents and children, and it s an inhumane (situation) in which some have committed suicide . The Vietnam War that ended in 1975 remains an emotive issue in Cambodia.  Hun Sen says the United States has never apologized for its role in bombing his country to try to kill Vietnamese communist guerrillas and should forgive debts built up by a pro-U.S. junta that ruled until it was ousted by the genocidal Khmer Rouge. On a separate issue, Cambodia s Foreign Affairs Ministry said it would accept deportees from the United States. The U.S. Embassy in Phnom Penh declined to comment. ",worldnews,"September 14, 2017 ",1
Ukraine gives cautious welcome to Putin's peacekeepers offer,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Ukraine on Thursday welcomed Russian President Vladimir Putin s declared openness to deployment of United Nations peacekeepers in separatist-controlled areas of eastern Ukraine, but said Russian troops must not join such an operation. Putin told German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday that UN peacekeepers might be deployed not only on the Donbass contact line separating the sides of the conflict but in other parts where inspectors of the international OSCE monitoring group operate. Kostiantyn Yeliseyev, foreign policy adviser to Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, said Putin s comments were a good sign but  the devil is in the detail.  In my view, as soon as we deploy UN peacekeeping we can speak about a real positive breakthrough in the field of the political settlement of the situation in Donbass,  he said.  Russia, which is a party to the conflict, must not take part in the future UN peacekeeping operation,  he said.  We believe this UN peacekeeping operation must be deployed along the whole occupied territory of Donbass including the uncontrolled part of the Ukrainian-Russian border.  The conflict between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists has claimed more than 10,000 lives since it erupted in 2014. Russia denies Western accusations it fomented the conflict and provided arms and fighters. Germany and France have tried to persuade both sides to implement a peace deal agreed in Minsk in 2015 but with little success. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said on Monday European sanctions imposed on Russia over its role in the Ukraine crisis should be phased out gradually if an internationally agreed ceasefire deal was implemented. But Yeliseyev said sanctions should stay in place until the Minsk peace deal is implemented in full.  That is why we want all German politicians to be vigilant and not to speculate, not to make any kind of irresponsible statements which don t stop the aggression but, on the contrary, will stimulate and motivate the aggressor country,  he said. Turning to Russian war games starting on Thursday in Belarus, the Baltic Sea, western Russia and the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, Yeliseyev said Ukraine was concerned the exercises could destabilize the region and that Moscow might keep troops and weaponry near Ukraine  for possible future offensive operations .

Britain seeks to smooth Brexit path for nuclear power,"LONDON (Reuters) - The British government said on Thursday it was in talks with the European Union to ensure a smooth transition for its nuclear industry as Britain moves away from Euratom s regulatory regime to a domestic one. The nuclear industry has raised concerns that its operations and investments could be hampered should Britain fail to replicate the regulatory regime provided by Euratom, the EU s atomic agency, in time for Brexit in March 2019. [L5N1LU4DZ]  Discussions with the European Union are ongoing. We will be exploring a number of options for smooth transition from the current Euratom regime to a domestic one,  Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Greg Clark said. The industry has said Britain not only needs its own safety regime, but also one that is approved by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). It also needs agreements signed with other countries on the transfer of equipment to guarantee power plants run smoothly.  Clark said Britain would establish a regime that would match  Euratom s standards and exceed those of the IAEA. He said the government was seeking deals with the IAEA to allow the body to inspect British nuclear facilities and verify safety standards. At a parliamentary hearing on Wednesday, Mina Golshan, the deputy chief of the Office for Nuclear Regulation which would run the safeguards regime, said the office had begun to build staff and expertise in this area. But she said specialized IT equipment, skills and people were still needed and one of the consequences of leaving Euratom was potentially the loss of access to experts residing in Europe that could help.  There are uncertainties associated with this ... The biggest risk is our ability to recruit,  she said.  ",worldnews,"September 14, 2017 ",1

"With China in mind, Japan, India agree to deepen defense","GANDHINAGAR, India (Reuters) - The leaders of India and Japan agreed on Thursday to deepen defense ties and push for more cooperation with Australia and the United States, as they seek to counter growing Chinese influence across Asia. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe arrived this week in his counterpart Narendra Modi s home state, skipping the tradition of visiting the capital of New Delhi, for the tenth meeting between two leaders since Modi came to power in 2014. Relations have deepened between Asia s second and third largest economies as Abe and Modi, who enjoy a close personal relationship, increasingly see eye-to-eye to balance China as the dominant Asian power.  Almost everything that takes place during the visit, including economic deals, will in part be done with China in mind,  Eurasia analysts said in a note.   Abe s visit comes days after New Delhi and Beijing agreed to end the longest and most serious military confrontation along their shared and contested border in decades, a dispute that had raised worries of a broader conflict between the Asian giants.  In a lengthy joint statement, India and Japan said deepening security links was paramount. This included collaboration on research into unmanned ground vehicles and robotics and the possibility of joint field exercises between their armies. There was also  renewed momentum  for cooperation with the United States and Australia. Earlier this year, India rejected an Australian request to be included in four-country naval drills for fear of angering Beijing.  Relations between India and Japan are not only a bilateral relationship but have developed into a strategic global partnership,  Abe told reporters in Gandhinagar, the capital of western Gujarat state.  We (India and Japan) will strengthen our collaboration with those countries with whom we share universal values.  Abe flew to Gujarat to lay the foundation stone of a $17 billion bullet train project, India s first, that was made possible by a huge Japanese loan.  Tokyo wants to win other high-speed rail lines India plans to build, to edge out Chinese ambitions to do the same and provide a boost for its high-end manufacturers. The visit was light on specific announcements, but India said it welcomed proposals for increased Japanese investment into infrastructure projects in its remote northeast, a region New Delhi sees as its gateway to Southeast Asia.  China claims part of India s northeast as its own territory. Japanese investment into the northeast  would give legs to our Act East policy,  Indian Foreign Secretary S. Jaishankar told reporters. Modi and Abe also said they would push for more progress on the development of industrial corridors for the growth of Asia and Africa.  Analysts say the planned $40 billion Asia-Africa Growth Corridor takes direct aim at China s Belt and Road project, envisaged as a modern-day  Silk Road  connecting China by land and sea across Asia and beyond to the Middle East, Europe and Africa.

Portugal heading for another record year for tourist arrivals,"LISBON (Reuters) - The number of foreign tourists visiting Portugal jumped around 13 percent in January-July, putting the country firmly on track for another record year for tourism, which has been a key driver of its economic recovery since a 2011-14 debt crisis. The National Statistics Institute said on Thursday in its monthly data on the hotel sector that over 7.1 million foreign visitors stayed in Portuguese hotels through July, which helped drive total hotel revenues over 17 percent higher to 1.8 billion euros ($2.14 billion). Portugal s arrivals growth outpaced those in neighboring Spain, which chalked up a 11 percent rise in the same period, according to official Spanish data. Despite a deceleration in July from June levels, both the tourist arrivals and revenues so far this year maintained the pace of growth seen in 2016, when tourist arrivals exceeded 10 million for the first time.  August is traditionally the strongest month by far for holiday-making in Portugal, which lures foreign visitors with its beaches, historic sites and some of the lowest prices for wining and dining in western Europe. Pop star Madonna has this month become the most illustrious of a growing number of foreign residents in Portugal, which was also named Europe s top destination for expatriates in a survey by social network InterNations.   Hotel revenues and all travel-related revenues account for about 10 percent of Portugal s gross domestic product. The tourism sector is also a key source of employment. Tourism has been growing since 2011, helping the heavily indebted country overcome its economic and debt crisis. Economic growth this year is expected to accelerate to over 2 percent from 1.4 percent in 2016. Portugal has opened dozens of new hotels in the past year and private entrepreneurs have redeveloped hundreds of apartment buildings in old parts of Lisbon and other areas to rent to tourists, helping the country s flagging construction sector.

Turkey says expects humanitarian aid can be delivered in Syria's Idlib,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey said on Thursday it expected humanitarian aid could be delivered to Syria s northern province of Idlib, which is under the control of a rebel alliance spearheaded by the former al Qaeda offshoot Nusra Front.  Our expectation is that Idlib, just like other de-escalation zones, becomes a region where humanitarian aid can easily be delivered,  presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin told a news conference in Ankara.  Turkey will do whatever falls upon it on this matter.  Turkey said last month it was limiting the movement of non-humanitarian aid into Idlib because the area is controlled by a  terrorist organization . ",worldnews,"September 14, 2017 ",1

Iraqi parliament 'has no right' to remove Kirkuk's governor: senior Kurdish official,"ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - Iraq s parliament  has no right  to remove Kirkuk s governor from office, a senior Kurdish official said on Thursday, after parliament voted him out following a request by Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi.  He is an elected governor of the council of Kirkuk,  said Hoshyar Zebari, a close adviser to Kurdish President Massoud Barzani.  That is the only body that can remove him.  The decision to remove the governor, Najmaddin Kareem, comes after Kirkuk - an oil-rich province claimed by both the central government in Baghdad and the autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq - voted to take part in a referendum set for Sept. 25 on Kurdish independence.

"Roadside bombs wound 20, kill soldier in Thailand's troubled south","BANGKOK (Reuters) - Roadside bombs planted by suspected Muslim insurgents in southern Thailand killed one soldier on Thursday and wounded 20 other people, most of them soldiers and police, security forces said. The blasts occurred in Yala, one of the predominantly ethnic, Malay Muslim provinces in the deep south where a separatist insurgency has dragged on for decades, with more than 6,500 people killed since 2004 alone. The first bomb did not result in any casualties, but the other two killed one soldier and wounded 18 soldiers and police and two villagers.   It is believed to be the work of violent groups already creating incidents in the area,  Pramote Prom-in, a spokesman for regional security forces, told Reuters.  As with most violence in Thailand s deep south, there was no claim of responsibility. The insurgents are fighting for secession from mostly Buddhist Thailand. Until they were annexed in 1909, Thailand s three southernmost provinces of Pattani, Yala and Narathiwat were  part of an independent Malay Muslim sultanate. ",worldnews,"September 14, 2017 ",1
Iraqi Kurdish referendum 'historic mistake': Turkey,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey on Thursday welcomed an Iraqi parliament move to reject a referendum on Kurdish independence. The parliament in Baghdad authorized the prime minister to  take all measures  to preserve Iraq s unity in response to the move to hold an independence referendum in Iraq s semi-autonomous Kurdish region on Sept. 25. Kurdish leader Massoud Barzani vowed to press ahead with the vote, calling it  a natural right .  Barzani s referendum decision is a historic mistake. Turkey will follow policies that take Iraq s territorial integrity as a basis,  Deputy Prime Minister Bekir Bozdag said.  The northern Iraq referendum must be canceled, if not it will have a cost and retribution,  he said, adding the move would erode the region s peace and bring security risks. Turkey has the region s largest Kurdish population and fears a  Yes  vote could fuel separatism in its southeast where Kurdish militants have waged an insurgency for three decades in which more than 40,000 people have been killed. Ankara has built solid ties with Barzani s administration,  founded on strong economic and energy links as well as Ankara and Erbil s shared suspicions of other Kurdish groups and Iraq s central government. Iran and Syria also oppose the vote, fearing it could fan separatism among their own Kurdish populations. Western powers worry the plebiscite - which would include the oil-producing city of Kirkuk - could ignite conflict with the central government in Baghdad and divert attention from the war against Islamic State militants. Turkey s Foreign Ministry, in a statement on Thursday, said:  We find the (Iraqi Kurdish) leadership s insistent stance regarding the referendum and its increasingly emotional statements worrying.  It should be noted that this insistence will definitely have a cost,  it added.  We call on them to act with good sense and abandon this erroneous approach immediately.

Reborn German liberals could spell trouble for Merkel,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Later this year, Angela Merkel may form a new government with a party whose leader says Greece should leave the euro, Russia can keep Crimea and refugees will have to go home. The Free Democrats (FDP), a socially liberal, pro-business party, were long seen as the natural partners of Chancellor Merkel s conservatives. They ruled in coalition with her mentor, former Chancellor Helmut Kohl, for 16 years and were junior partners in Merkel s second government, from 2009 to 2013.  But after crashing out of the German parliament four years ago, the FDP   also known as the Liberals   were forced to reinvent themselves. And the new incarnation, led by an ambitious 38-year-old who preaches an ultra-hard line on Europe, has unsettled the German political establishment, including members of Merkel s party.  Nevertheless, if her conservatives can form a government with the FDP after a Sept. 24 election, Merkel will have little choice but to link up with the party and its young leader Christian Lindner. (For a graphic on German federal elections click tmsnrt.rs/2h0NqCT)  For her center-right CDU/CSU, the prospect of reviving an alliance with the party s historic partner will be hard to resist, especially after four years of a right-left coalition with their longtime rivals, the Social Democrats (SPD).   Merkel s horror scenario is a narrow majority with the FDP,  said Frank Decker, a political scientist who was Lindner s thesis adviser at Bonn University.  She would have no choice. She would be condemned to govern with them.  Polls give Merkel s CDU/CSU bloc and the FDP a combined score of roughly 45 percent, just shy of a majority. If they do fall short, the FDP could still enter the government as part of an unwieldy three-way coalition that also includes the Greens. In 2013, after its former leader Guido Westerwelle failed to deliver on his promise of tax cuts, the party scored just 4.8 percent, the first time in the post-war era it failed to make the 5 percent threshold needed to enter parliament. Later this month, it is expected to double its score of four years ago. Lindner, with his banker suits and designer stubble, has almost single-handedly hauled the FDP back from the political wilderness. German media have likened him to French President Emmanuel Macron: the two are just a year apart in age and share a healthy self-esteem. In the FDP s highly personalized campaign posters, a brooding Lindner is shown in black and white, staring off-camera, like a model from a 1990s Calvin Klein ad. Look beneath the surface however, and there are big differences between Lindner and Macron. The French leader is promising to work with the next German government on an overhaul of the euro zone, introducing a budget and finance minister for the currency bloc. Lindner has dismissed those ideas with an aggressiveness that has surprised even some of his closest allies. If one takes Lindner and the FDP s campaign manifesto at face value, the party would introduce automatic sanctions for countries that violate EU budget rules, do away with the euro zone s bailout fund and make it easier for countries to leave the currency. Greece is a favorite target. Two weeks ago, Lindner told a banking conference in Frankfurt that a reintroduction of the drachma would be a boon for the country.  All those who vacation in Mallorca would go to the Greek islands instead,  he said. Martin Lueck, an investment strategist at Blackrock, sees a risk that the euro crisis could return, with Italian borrowing costs spiraling higher, if the FDP makes it into government. FDP officials play down such risks, pointing to moderating  influences in the party like members of the European parliament Alexander Graf Lambsdorff and Michael Theurer.  Our program is about direction. It shows what we would do if we were able to govern alone, which of course won t be possible,  one senior official said. But aides to Merkel acknowledge that she would probably be more limited in what she could achieve with Macron if the FDP were a partner, particularly if Lindner became finance minister.  He could make our European partners nostalgic for Wolfgang Schaeuble,  one aide quipped, referring to Merkel s current finance minister, who is seen as a hardliner himself. If the FDP were to end up in a three-way coalition with the Greens, its more radical ideas would surely be blunted. That is why some members of Merkel s party say she would prefer a  Jamaica  coalition   so named because the colors of the parties would match those of the green, yellow and black Jamaican flag   to a two-way alliance with the FDP. In the final stretch, Lindner has floated an array of controversial ideas in an apparent attempt to lure voters from the hard-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Last month, he recommended accepting Russia s 2014 annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine as a  permanent provisional arrangement . Last week, he said refugees should be forced to go home as soon as peace returned to the Middle East countries from which they fled.  Even FDP members say they have trouble discerning how much of this is mere pre-election posturing. As the party s identity has become intertwined with its leader Lindner, its core beliefs have become muddied. The picture may become clearer on Sunday, when the FDP is due to unveil a l0-point list of policy priorities. Expect a modern twist on classic FDP positions   tax cuts, investments in broadband and a Canada-style immigration law making it easier to bring in skilled workers   that are closer to those of other European liberals like Macron. Regardless, the FDP faces a steep learning curve if it makes the leap from outside parliament into government   a feat no party has achieved since the 1950s. Two-thirds of the FDP candidates who could win Bundestag seats have never worked there before. Only one has cabinet-level experience in Berlin.  We ll see whether they have learned the lessons of the past,  said Decker.  Westerwelle was a great opposition leader but struggled in government. Lindner must avoid the same fate.

In the weeds: How top official got tangled in Nigerian aid scandal,"WACHAKAL, Nigeria (Reuters) - When millions of people in northeast Nigeria faced hunger and attacks by Islamist militant group Boko Haram in March 2016, the government acted: it decided to spend $1.4 million cutting down weeds around the village of Wachakal in order to stop flooding. Six months later, many of the weeds had grown back and 317 million naira (at the time $1.04 million) had been transferred from the company hired to destroy them to a firm founded by the government official in charge of dispensing aid, according to a Nigerian Senate report. The report, written by a committee of lawmakers from Nigeria s upper chamber of parliament, concluded that companies that received contracts for projects including the weeding from a government body overseen by the official, Babachir Lawal, transferred a total of 500 million naira (worth around $2.2 million) to the firm he set up. The report publicly called for a criminal investigation into the payments. Central to the probe was whether Lawal was involved in a suspected kickback scheme to divert aid money intended for the volatile northeast. The committee said the scheme involved inflating the value of contracts to enrich Lawal and his associates. The report did not provide evidence to show why it believed costs had been enlarged. Lawal, 62, is an ally of President Muhammadu Buhari and one of his first appointments. In a written statement responding to Reuters  questions, Lawal denied wrongdoing and said he had been the victim of a Senate witch-hunt. The United Nations has warned that northeast Nigeria is gripped by one of the world s worst humanitarian crises. Boko Haram has burned down homes, destroyed livelihoods and killed thousands of people. Refugees living in camps complain of starvation and disease, while soldiers and police have been accused of rape. A Reuters review of the Senate report s findings shows how two pillars of Buhari s presidency - restoring stability in the northeast and fighting corruption - may have been undermined by the alleged misappropriation of aid money and food. The review draws upon documents detailing bank transfers and corporate records, visits to aid projects and interviews with senior politicians, diplomats and humanitarian workers. The final Senate report, published in May, recommended that Lawal be prosecuted for allegedly flouting procurement rules and breaking his oaths of office. He was suspended in April pending a presidential investigation launched after the Senate s findings first surfaced in an earlier draft of the report. The investigation into Lawal, ordered by Buhari, was headed by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, who delivered his findings to the president on Aug. 22.  The president has to look at the report, study it and then make his own decisions,  Osinbajo said, without saying what was in the presidential investigation report. Buhari s office referred Reuters to the vice president s comments. Despite Buhari s vows to fight corruption, no major figures have been convicted so far. Boko Haram, who have killed around 20,000 people since 2009, have been pushed back in some areas yet continue to launch attacks, while millions of people in the northeast rely on some form of aid. Shehu Sani, who chaired the Senate committee that produced the report, said overall losses to suspected corruption in various forms in the northeastern humanitarian crisis in recent years had not been determined due to the probe s specific remit and factors that restricted its scope. He said the Senate investigation was limited by the timeframe examined, as it focused on government aid spending since the current administration took office in May, 2015. Sani also said some government agencies had refused to cooperate, access to bank account details was limited and the use of international donor funds was not investigated.  We can say, conservatively, that over 10 billion naira ($33 million) of monies that were supposed to go to the IDPs (internally displaced persons) were misappropriated or unaccounted for, or misused from different segments of the Nigerian government,  Sani told Reuters. He said he was referring to all forms of corruption related to funds involving Nigerian humanitarian aid dating back around three years, and not just allegations involving Lawal. He declined to elaborate further. The humanitarian crisis began in 2014. Nigeria s then-president, Goodluck Jonathan, set up the Presidential Initiative on the Northeast (PINE) to provide emergency assistance to communities and foster economic growth in the region. PINE had problems from the outset. According to a 2014 internal PINE presentation prepared by the then-chairman for the group s committee, a pilot scheme sent 51 food trucks to Borno state and 10 to Gombe state; none arrived. After he became president in 2015, Buhari made Lawal Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) - Nigeria s top civil servant. Through PINE, Lawal oversaw millions of dollars of aid. The Senate report alleges that most aid contracts in 2016 did not help the needy. Instead, inflated contracts  were awarded to companies belonging to top government officials  cronies and close associates . It said a company called Rholavision Engineering Limited, which describes itself as  Information and Communication Technology Engineers & Consultants  and was founded by Lawal in 1990, was where money for companies that were awarded contracts by PINE came to first. In his statement, Lawal said he relinquished ties with Rholavision on Aug. 27, 2015, four days before being sworn in as SGF. But company registry records show he did not resign as a director until Sept. 8, 2016. In addition, a signed letter from Lawal to the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) dated Sept. 16, 2016 - contained in the appendices of the Senate report - said he wished to relinquish his shares in Rholavision.  That can t be true,  said Lawal in a text message when asked about the apparent discrepancy.  This is forged,  he said, when sent a picture of the letter to CAC. He declined to elaborate. Rholavision declined to comment.  In March and August 2016, PINE awarded two contracts to cut weeds and improve irrigation in riverside communities in the northeastern state of Yobe. For some 30 years, the weeds had caused farmland to flood and prevented people from fishing. The contracts, worth a combined total of 531 million naira, were granted to Josmon Technologies Ltd. The first contract,  awarded in March 2016, was for 273 million naira - at the time worth $1.4 million. The second contract was awarded to Josmon in August 2016. Nigeria s naira currency lost around a third of its value two months earlier, so the 258 million naira contract was then worth some $845,000. Rholavision, the company founded by Lawal, received a contract for a consultancy role in the weed-cutting project. The 7.1 million naira contract was awarded in March 2016 when that sum was equivalent to $36,040. Some work was done. Ali Dodo, a farmer in Wachakal, told Reuters that he and others cut weeds around the Komadugu-Yobe river over a month-long period from August 2016. He said contractors paid them 2,500 naira a day. Reuters was unable to determine how much was spent on the work in total. Bank records, however, show that Josmon Technologies paid 317 million naira to Rholavision between March and September 2016. Monday John Apeh, a Josmon director, told Reuters that  Josmon has no relationship with Mr Babachir Lawal . In a text message, he said Josmon struggled to finance the PINE contract because the company had been experiencing financial difficulties and would only be paid when the work was complete. That  led us to borrow money from Rholavision s MD , he said. Josmon said 195 million naira ($637,359) of the 317 million naira it sent to Rholavision was to repay that loan. Apeh declined to comment on what happened to the remaining 122 million naira. Lawal said in his statement:  These purely business transactions between the companies cannot be classified as bribes.  Dodo, the local farmer, said weeds started growing back within six months. Despite numerous setbacks, Nigeria s government is trying to reboot aid efforts. Buhari replaced PINE with the Presidential Committee on the Northeast Initiative last October. In June, the government promised to distribute 30,000 tonnes of grain to people displaced by Boko Haram, after saying more than half of food aid previously dispatched had gone missing. Zainab Ahmed, who heads Nigeria s Inter-Ministerial Task Force on the Humanitarian Response in the Northeast, told Reuters the deliveries would now be guarded by soldiers. Coordination between agencies  is not perfect but it has improved a great deal and is getting better,  she said. ",worldnews,"September 14, 2017 ",1
Post-election conundrum awaits Germany's Merkel," BERLIN (Reuters) - Barring an upset, the main uncertainty surrounding Europe s most important election this year is not whether Angela Merkel will continue to lead Germany after next week s vote, but who with and how long they will take to get going.  Although a surprise cannot be ruled out in the wake of any Russian interference, pollsters say they are confident about their surveys, which show Merkel s conservatives winning the most seats in the Bundestag lower house.  The far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) is set to enter parliament for the first time, and some experts have said it may gain more support than the roughly 10 percent polls suggest, an alarming prospect for many at home and abroad.  But all the other parties have ruled out joining it in a coalition - an inherent part of Germany s electoral system - and the most likely scenario is probably a repeat of Merkel s  grand coalition  with the Social Democrats (SPD).  She will start sounding out partners right after the Sept. 24 vote, but coalition building is a protracted process, which could paralyze policy for months at a time when Brexit has shaken Europe s foundations.  The process is especially complex this time as the number of parliamentary groups could rise to six from four. Informal soundings and then exploratory talks precede formal coalition negotiations and party leaders may also seek approval from their members before signing off on any deal.  Depending on the shape of the coalition, the main issues at stake are the integration of the more than 1 million migrants who have arrived in Germany in the last two years, and investment in Europe's biggest economy as well as Merkel's leading role in talks on reform of the European Union and relations with Russia and Turkey.  Here are the main scenarios:  CONSERVATIVES, SOCIAL DEMOCRATS ( GRAND COALITION )  The most likely option, according to opinion polls. Merkel s parliamentary party, made up of her Christian Democrats (CDU) and the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) has governed with the SPD for eight of the 12 years that Merkel has been chancellor, including the last four.  WHAT MAKES IT POSSIBLE: Merkel, who has steered the conservatives toward the political center ground, looks comfortable ruling with the SPD. Such a coalition would likely have a large majority, provide continuity and broadly agree on Europe, Turkey, foreign policy, migration and security issues.  HURDLES: It is a last resort for both sides, especially the SPD, which fears it will lose out as junior partner. It wants more emphasis on investment, education, tackling inequality and fair pensions while conservatives are more focused on tax cuts. The SPD is also reluctant to back planned defense spending hikes.  CONSERVATIVES, FREE DEMOCRATS ( BLACK-YELLOW )  The conservative block and pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) are traditional partners, especially on financial and economic policy, having ruled together for almost half of post-war Germany s seven decades. If they win sufficient votes, this is the most likely scenario.  WHAT MAKES IT POSSIBLE: The pro-business FDP has rebounded this year, winning enough votes in a vote in Germany s most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, in May to share power with the CDU there. A repeat at federal level would herald tax cuts and deregulation and possibly tighter laws on immigration, asylum seeking and security.  HURDLES: The FDP was wiped out of parliament in 2013 after four chaotic years ruling with Merkel. It has more radical tax reduction and privatization plans, opposes deeper EU integration and wants EU countries to be able to quit the euro zone. Party leader Christian Lindner has also suggested Germany accept Russia s 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, something Merkel has ruled out.  CONSERVATIVES, FDP, GREENS ( JAMAICA  - REFERENCE TO PARTIES  COLOURS: BLACK, YELLOW, GREEN)  As yet untested at a federal level, this combination rules in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein.  WHAT MAKES IT POSSIBLE - If Merkel s bloc can t form an alliance with the FDP or the Greens alone, it may try a three-way deal. Both smaller parties have played down this option but may be lured by the prospect of power.  HURDLES - The Greens and FDP are at opposite ends of the political spectrum. Policy clashes would be likely on tax, energy, the EU and migrants.  CONSERVATIVES, GREENS ( BLACK-GREEN )  Untested at a federal level, this has been mooted as an option under Merkel, who has pushed renewable energy. The CDU and Greens have worked together at regional level, including in a Greens-led coalition in the rich southern state of Baden-Wuerttemberg.  WHAT MAKES IT POSSIBLE: The Greens  leaders are pragmatic, worlds away from the eco-warriors who founded the party. The prospect of power may persuade them to compromise. Such a coalition would promote a strong Europe and focus on fighting climate change. The Greens would push for a phaseout of coal-fired power stations.  HURDLES: Doubtful they would win a majority. Conservatives want lower taxes while Greens want to tax the super rich. Greens have a more liberal migrant policy which could pit them against the CSU, and they oppose plans to increase defense spending. Clashes are also likely on some aspects of energy policy and auto emissions regulation following the diesel scandal.  A minority government would be a first and stability-craving Germans would not like it but may prefer it to new elections.  WHAT MAKES IT POSSIBLE: If Merkel fails to find a partner, she may feel she has a mandate to rule given her personal popularity. She would probably get support for individual policies from the FDP, SPD and Greens.  HURDLES: Merkel s natural caution coupled with Germans  fear of instability, a legacy of the fragmentation in the years that preceded the rise of Hitler s Nazi party.  SPD, LEFT, GREENS ( RED-RED-GREEN  or  R2G )  Highly unlikely. Never tested at a federal level, a tie up between the SPD and Greens, preferred partners, and the radical Left party, could be the only way for the SPD to take the chancellery. It is being tested in the state of Berlin under SPD leadership and, with a Left premier, in the state of Thuringia.  WHAT MAKES IT POSSIBLE: For the first time, the SPD has not excluded the possibility of joining the Left. Such a coalition would probably focus on boosting investment and tackling inequality and adopt a more Russia-friendly stance.  HURDLES: The Left s links with Communists in former East Germany and painful SPD memories of an exodus to the Left over deep labor market reforms more than a decade ago. While the SPD and Greens could rule together relatively easily, the Left wants a top tax rate of 75 percent, a 30-hour week and to replace NATO with an alliance including Russia.

Soldiers on Europe's streets dent NATO's defense edge,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The use of armed soldiers to patrol alongside pavement cafes and selfie-snapping tourists in European cities since jihadi attacks risks compromising deployments overseas, military leaders say. Belgium and major military power France, both active in EU and NATO missions, have cut back training to free up troops and NATO planners fear that over time armies may get better at guarding railway stations and airports than fighting wars. Some of the more than 15,000 soldiers serving at home in Europe say tramping the streets is a far cry from the foreign adventures they signed up for and that they feel powerless to defend against militants.   We are standing around like flowers pots, just waiting to be smashed,  said an officer just returned from Afghanistan for guard duty in Belgium, which, like France, has more troops deployed at home than in any single mission abroad. Security personnel have been targeted in both countries but patrols begun as a temporary measure after Islamic State attacks in 2015 have become permanent fixtures as opinion polls show that people are reassured by soldiers on show at home. Italy has had soldiers on the streets since 2008, Britain used them briefly this year and, along with Spain, is prepared for deployments if threat levels rise. Despite their painful history, Germany and Austria have debated having military patrols at home for the first time since World War Two. Across Europe, political debate is shifting from whether, to how to adapt the armed forces to a homeland role, a concern for military leaders eyeing budgets, morale and training. France s former military chief, who quit in July, said it had overstretched the army, while the head of Belgium s land forces told Reuters the domestic deployment was taking its toll.  I see a lot of people who leave our defense forces because of the operation,  General Marc Thys, the commander of Belgium s land forces, said in an interview, without giving numbers. Not everyone agrees. A defense ministry source in Italy said its domestic patrols had  absolutely no impact on overseas missions or on training . But some in NATO worry protracted domestic operations will make key members of the 29-strong transatlantic alliance less ready to deploy to Afghanistan or eastern European borders with Russia.  It is popular with the public, it is cheaper than the police,  a senior NATO source said.  But if the requirement came to send a lot of forces to reinforce our eastern allies ... would the government be willing to pull its soldiers off the street to do that, could it?  The challenge of battling Islamic State at home and abroad, squeezes resources just as NATO leaders seek to show U.S. President Donald Trump they are reliable allies, after he repeatedly questioned the alliance s worth. Given the homeland operations, some military sources and experts say politicians face a tough choice: to expand the army, summon up reserves or create a new domestic security force - a halfway between the police and military - to replace them as Belgium has chosen to do over the coming years.  It mobilizes so many people that we are having trouble deploying people abroad for U.N. and EU missions,  said a second NATO source.  The operations put 10,000 heavily armed combat troops on the streets in France and 1,800 in Belgium after Islamic State attacks in early 2015. The numbers are down to 7,000 and 1,200 respectively, but they still tie up roughly a tenth of deployable army personnel in each nation. They can also be bad for morale. The mix of schools, offices and warehouse hastily converted into barracks in Belgium  are worse than Afghanistan,  said a soldier, showing pictures of cramped rooms piled high with gear. Some 45 percent of soldiers surveyed by the Belgian military in December said they were thinking of quitting - many to the police - as being away had strained families and led to divorce. A source in the French military, which has not made polling public, said of its street patrols, known as Operation Sentinelle:  Sentinelle is a burden whose impact on soldiers  morale we ve never denied.  For now, Thys said the Belgian armed forces are not pulling back from foreign missions but have less time for training.  We take everything into account, our homeland operation and our international missions. If you go up on one side, we have to go down on the other side,  Thys told Reuters. In France, training days were cut from 90 to 59 days last year, according to a defense ministry report in October. A decline of some 30 percent began with the deployment on home soil, experts say.  The longer they do it, the less sharp as a military they are,  said General Sir Richard Barrons, Britain s former military chief.  But once you are committed to this it takes a very brave politician to turn it off.  The new head of France s armed forces, which has thousands of troops abroad fighting Islamist militants in the Sahel, Iraq, Syria and elsewhere, says something has to give.  We have to choose how to adjust our commitments, to give us back some flexibility, because who knows where the French army will have to deploy in a year,  General Francois Lecointre was cited by local media as saying earlier this month. President Emmanuel Macron has announced a strategic review of the street patrols. His new armed forces minister, Florence Parly, said on Tuesday they would not be cut but would be made more flexible. In Italy, where up to 7,000 soldiers help police, a defense ministry source said they were moved around often to keep them from being bored - an approach that France and Belgium will both now put into play. Italy has escaped militant attacks so far and troops elsewhere have disarmed or killed would-be attackers - such as a knife-wielding assailant outside the Eiffel tower last month and a suitcase bomber in Brussels in June. But their effectiveness is hard to quantify, and attacks on men in uniform like that in Paris last month - with its familiar pattern of a car plowing into its victims - has renewed fears they may draw fire or shoot in error. In France, three in four voters approve of street patrols, although nearly 40 percent doubt they are effective in combating terrorism. In Belgium, support for the military is 80 percent, up from 20 percent before the mission.  It s a PR operation: nothing more,  said Wally Struys, a professor emeritus at Belgium Royal Military Academy. But Belgium s Thys and others see no end to the operations, which give the military an extra argument against years of declining budgets.   They are part of the landscape now,  said Saad Amrani, chief commissioner and policy adviser of the Belgian Federal Police.  We depend on them.  ",worldnews,"September 14, 2017 ",1
UK terrorism arrests soar to record level after attacks this year,"LONDON (Reuters) - The number of people arrested in Britain on suspicion of terrorism offences rocketed by 68 percent in the last year to the highest figure on record during a period when the country suffered four deadly attacks, figures showed on Thursday. Statistics from the Home Office (interior ministry) showed there were 379 arrests in the year to June, up from 226 from the 12 previous months, and the most since 2001 when the data began to be collected. Britain is on its second-highest threat level,  severe , meaning an attack is highly likely and 36 people were killed in terrorist incidents in the first six months of 2017. Among the arrests, 12 came after an attack in March on London s Westminster Bridge when a man drove a car into pedestrians killing four, before he stabbed a policeman to death outside parliament. Another 23 followed a suicide bombing at a pop concert in Manchester in May, and the following month police arrested 21 suspects after three Islamist militants drove into pedestrians on London Bridge before stabbing people at nearby restaurants and bars, killing eight. One arrest followed an attack in north London when a van was driven into worshippers near a mosque which left one man dead. Britain s most senior counter-terrorism officer Mark Rowley has said police have been arresting a suspect every day. He said this week that there had been a shift in the threat level rather than an isolated spike. In the three years until March this year, police foiled 13 potential attacks but in the next 17 weeks, there were the four attacks while the authorities thwarted six others, Rowley said.  The pace has continued to be almost as challenging since then,  he told a conference in Israel. The official figures showed that among the 379 arrests, 123 people were charged with an offense, of which 105 were terrorism-related, while 189 were released without charge.

Boys 'cried from barred windows' as Islamic school blaze kills 23 in Malaysia,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - A blaze at an Islamic boarding school in the Malaysian capital killed at least 23 people on Thursday, most of them teenage boys who cried for help from barred windows, officials and witnesses said. The fire broke out at around 5.40 a.m. in a top-floor dormitory in the three-storey building, firemen said, where most of the students were sleeping in bunk beds, with many of the windows covered by metal grills. One survivor said there was just one window the boys managed to open. Two teachers were also killed in the fire at the Darul Quran Ittifaqiyah, a 15-minute drive from the iconic Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur, police said, adding that most of the victims died from smoke inhalation. The youngest was just seven, media said. The disaster has renewed calls for greater scrutiny of so-called  tahfiz  schools, where students learn to memorize the Quran. They are unregulated by the education ministry, being the responsibility of the religious department.  Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said at least 31 fires had been reported at such schools in Malaysia since 2011, adding that they must follow safety regulations.  We will continue to carry out investigations, especially through forensics, as we found that there was some security features that should have been complied with but weren t,  Zahid told reporters outside the school.   Fire department operations deputy director Soiman Jahid said the cause was likely a short circuit or a mosquito repellent coil. The dormitory had only one entrance, leaving many of the victims trapped, he said.  The building was surrounded by metal grills that could not be opened from the inside. The students, after realizing the fire and heavy smoke, tried to escape through the window,  Soiman said outside the school.  But because of the grills, they could not escape.  Soiman said the school had submitted a request for fire safety approval but no new checks had been carried out as the request was still being processed.  The pupils all got locked in and they couldn t escape and got burned,  Nadia Azalan, sister of a 13-year-old victim, told Reuters in tears as distraught family members gathered outside the building.  Safety should come first.  Mohamad Arif Mawardi, 24, who was sleeping on one of the lower floors, said he realized there was a fire only after he heard people shouting.   We wanted to help the others but we couldn t because the fire was rampant. There was nothing we could do,  he said. About 13 boys managed to open a window and escape, Arif said.   Only those 13 who had access to that open window could escape,  he said. A man identified only as Hazin, who lived next door to the school, said his son called the fire department after they heard screams and saw the flames.    The children were crying for help, but I couldn t help them as the door was already on fire,  he said.  Viewed from outside, the only tell-tale signs of disaster were the blackened upper-floor windows, otherwise the tin-roofed building appeared unscathed, with a Malaysian flag hanging limply from the yellow wall.  Only inside did the intensity of the inferno become clear. The dormitory was blackened, lined with the charred frames of bunk beds. Tahfiz schools have been under scrutiny since earlier this year when an 11-year-old boy died after reported abuse in Johor, north of Singapore. ",worldnews,"September 14, 2017 ",1
Japan's Abe says U.N. resolution must force change in North Korea,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday called for strict enforcement of a U.N. resolution against North Korea over its latest nuclear test, saying the world must force a change in Pyongyang s policies. Abe made the remarks during a visit to India aimed at deepening economic and defenses ties to balance the weight of a rising China. New Delhi stood with Tokyo in its resolve for a firm response to Pyongyang, he said.   I d like to appeal to the world, together with Prime Minister Modi, that we need to have North Korea change its policy through the thorough implementation of the newly adopted Security Council resolution by the international community.   Prime Minister Modi and I are in full agreement on this,  he said.  The 15-member Security Council voted unanimously on a U.S.-drafted resolution and a new round of sanctions against North Korea on Monday in response to its latest and most powerful test, banning North Korea s textile exports that are the second largest only to coal and mineral, and capping fuel supplies.

German court rules public should have free access to beaches,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The public should not be forced to pay to walk on Germany s beaches or swim in the sea, a federal court ruled, calling into question private beaches along the North and Baltic Sea coasts. The coastal town of Wangerland, 170 km (100 miles) west of Hamburg, was sued by two residents of neighboring towns who demanded it provide free access to its two North Sea beaches. Wangerland s tourist office has largely fenced in the beaches, added facilities, playgrounds and lifeguards, and has been charging visitors a 3-euro ($3.57) entry fee during the summer season, with the exception of residents and tourists of the town itself. Under German law, anyone is allowed to enter unused tracts of land, a provision meant to give the public access to the country s natural beauty and create opportunities for fresh-air recreation free of charge. But a court in the state of Lower Saxony last year ruled in favor of Wangerland, saying the beaches in question were not unused but had been leased by the town for commercial purposes. The federal administrative court said in its ruling published on Thursday the town could not charge visitors to go for walks on the beach or to swim in the sea, but could for using the facilities set up there.  Claims to nearly the entire beach, and not only the areas needed to operate the business, put excessive limits on general liberty,  the court said in a statement, partly overturning the lower court s ruling.

NZ kingmaker calls for inquiry over China spy report,"(Reuters) - A populist politician whose party could emerge as a kingmaker at this month s New Zealand election has called for an inquiry into whether a member of the ruling National Party government has been working for China s intelligence services.  Earlier this week the Financial Times reported that National Party member Jian Yang spent a decade at elite Chinese military academies and has been under investigation by New Zealand s national intelligence agency. Winston Peters, whose New Zealand First party is widely expected to form a ruling coalition with either the National or Labour parties, said that New Zealanders should be  very concerned .  National must act now and a full inquiry is required.  Peters said on his official Twitter account.  There must be proof Dr Yang is not a risk. Meanwhile, Dr Yang must step aside.   Yang who is 55, had lived in China until he was 32, the Financial Times said. No information about his Chinese education or military background was included in his official biographies in New Zealand or those published when he was an academic at Auckland university, it said. Yang, who has been a major fundraiser for the National Party and has pushed for closer ties with Beijing, told media that he was the victim of a  smear campaign  and denied passing on any information to China during his time in New Zealand.  I can understand people can be concerned, because they do not understand Chinese system, but once they understand the system they should be assured this is nothing really you should be concerned about,  he said according to a Newshub report. Prime Minister and National Party leader Bill English said that he was well aware of Yang s background, employment and training in China.   This is a New Zealand citizen. Dr Jian is a New Zealand citizen. The country is happy to have him as a citizen,  English told New Zealand s 1News. English said he had been aware  from early on  that Dr Yang had had  military training, including military intelligence .  He s never tried to hide that background,  English said.  Meanwhile, Labour leader and contender for the premiership Jacinda Ardern declined to comment, saying only it was an  issue for the National Party to respond to,  according to the report.

UK Foreign Secretary Johnson to hold talks with U.S.' Tillerson in London,"LONDON (Reuters) - British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson will meet with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in London on Thursday to discuss issues including Hurricane Irma, North Korea and Libya, his office said. Johnson, who this week visited the British territories of Anguilla and the British Virgin islands to see the devastation caused by Irma, will discuss the international response with Tillerson and French Political Director Nicolas de Riviere.  I ve seen firsthand the devastation Hurricane Irma has caused people in the Caribbean. Close coordination with our allies is vital for both the short-term and long-term recovery efforts,  Johnson said in a statement ahead of the meeting. The three will also discuss the situation in North Korea, which carried out its sixth and largest nuclear test earlier this month. The U.N. Security Council voted unanimously to boost sanctions on North Korea on Monday, but U.S. President Donald Trump has said they were a small step and nothing compared to what would have to happen to deal with the country s nuclear program. Johnson will also host a meeting on Libya, attended by Tillerson and other international representatives including Italian Foreign Minister Angelion Alfano, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry and U.N. Libya envoy Ghassan Salame. ",worldnews,"September 13, 2017 ",1
Vietnam seeks death penalty for embezzlement by ex-chairman of state energy firm,"HANOI (Reuters) - Prosecutors in Vietnam on Thursday said they were seeking the death sentence in an embezzlement case against a former chairman of state energy firm PetroVietnam, as the communist country steps up one of its biggest corruption crackdowns. Some high-ranking political officials have been punished as investigations widen into PetroVietnam and the banking sector, with dozens of banking and energy officials facing trial on charges such as embezzlement, mismanagement and abuse of power. In a statement, the Supreme People s Procuracy of Vietnam said it had sought a death sentence for the former chairman, Nguyen Xuan Son, on charges that include wrongdoing with serious economic consequences and abuse of power to usurp assets. It urged  an overall penalty of death , listing punishments such as a jail term of 16 to 18 years for flouting state rules on economic management and life imprisonment for abuse of power, before seeking the  death sentence for embezzlement . In 2009, PetroVietnam acquired an 800-billion-dong ($35-million) stake in Ocean Group s banking unit, Ocean Bank, which had to be completely written off in 2015, when the central bank took it over at no cost.  Son could not be reached for comment as he is on trial, and Reuters could not immediately reach his lawyer. Prosecutors also sought life imprisonment for Ocean Group s founder, tycoon Ha Van Tham on charges ranging from embezzlement to abuse of power, the statement said, adding that dozens of other Ocean Bank staff could also face years in jail. Ocean Group, which has interests in real estate, finance, hotels and infrastructure, said it had no comment on the sentence sought for Tham, who cannot be reached as he is still on trial. Police opened three new cases against state firm units, among them Russian joint venture Vietsovpetro, Vietnam s sole refinery operator Binh Son Refining and Petrochemical, and PetroVietnam Exploration Production Corp. All three cases focus on alleged abuse of power to usurp assets and are linked to violations at Ocean Bank, Vietnam s police said in a statement on their website on Thursday. Police added another accusation of abuse of power against PetroVietnam s vice general director Ninh Van Quynh, they added, following his arrest and prosecution this month for alleged wrongdoing. Quynh could not be contacted for comment on the fresh charge as he is on trial. Last week a former central bank governor was prosecuted for alleged lack of responsibility. Dinh La Thang, a former PetroVietnam chairman, was removed from the powerful politburo and last month, a vice trade minister was sacked. ",worldnews,"September 14, 2017 ",1
Support for NZ's Labour Party improves position as frontrunner in election race,"WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand s Labour Party on Thursday promised no surprise new taxes until 2020 and improved its position as frontrunner in a national election, with a poll showing its support edging up, threatening the National Party s ten-year grip on power. The result was at odds with a shock survey by another pollster this week that put the centre-right National in the lead and underscored the unusually volatile nature of the race to the vote on Sept. 23. Backing for the Labour Party rose 1 point to 44 percent, the One News-Colmar Brunton poll showed, while support for the National Party also gained 1 point, putting it at 40 percent. In another positive sign for Labour, its potential coalition partner, the Green Party, recovered, rising 2 points to 7 percent, comfortably above the 5 percent threshold needed to gain seats in Parliament.  The nationalist New Zealand First Party fell 3 points to 6 percent, making it less likely that Labour would need the populist party to form a coalition government after the election. Poll results have been swinging wildly and a separate Newshub-Reid poll on Tuesday had shown a surprise surge for National, giving it a robust lead of almost ten points. The National Party has vowed to support free trade as global protectionism rises, in particular, by championing the Trans-Pacific Partnership pact, which Labour has said it would renegotiate. An average of polls released by Radio New Zealand on Wednesday, which included the results of Newshub s shock poll, put the two parties at almost even support. Thursday s poll was published on the same day Labour moved to stem criticism of a plan to set up an expert panel to consider new levies, such as a capital gains tax.  To avoid any doubt, no one will be affected by any tax changes arising from the outcomes of the Working Group until 2021,  said Labour finance spokesman Grant Robertson, in a statement. As rivalry has heated up, Labour leader Jacinda Ardern on Wednesday called National  desperate liars  in response to an advertisement saying the centre-left party would bring in new taxes and subverting its slogan,  Let s Do This  into  Let s Tax This .  Investors have been made jittery by the uncertainty over who will govern, but currency reaction to the latest poll was muted.  The New Zealand dollar - the word s 11th most traded currency in 2016 - softened slightly to $0.7240 from $0.7250 shortly before the poll results. ",worldnews,"September 14, 2017 ",1
"Macedonia wants EU membership process, Greek talks to run in tandem","LONDON (Reuters) - Macedonia hopes it has done enough to convince the European Union to start accession talks while a quarter-of-a-century-long row with neighbouring Greece rumbles on, its foreign minister said on Wednesday. Greece has vetoed the ex-Yugoslav republic s attempts to join both the EU and NATO because it says the name Macedonia implies a territorial claim over Greece s own northerly region of Macedonia. Macedonia s suggestion last month to use the name the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as it does at other international bodies was not  immediately embraced  by Greece, Macedonia s Foreign Minister Nikola Dimitrov told Reuters. The two sides are set to meet again later this month at the U.N. General Assembly in New York. Whatever the outcome, Macedonia wants the EU to agree that accession talks - which could take years - can at least get under way.  If we have enough in terms of reform at home, we hope we will reach that stage (to start EU accession talks) and deal with the name issue in parallel,  Dimitrov said. The time it takes to go through the EU membership process might give Greece, which has previously insisted that Skopje use a compound name such as  New  or  Upper  Macedonia, enough comfort that process can be halted if needed. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker gave a boost to Macedonia s EU hopes, and those of Serbia, Albania, Montenegro, Bosnia and Kosovo, saying on Wednesday:  We must maintain a credible enlargement perspective for the Western Balkans.   Joining NATO is more clear cut, meaning that for now there is unlikely to be much leeway from Greece.  We cannot fight our way into the NATO alliance, we have to talk our way in,  Dimitrov said.  We need to be seen in Athens as an ally ... In the long run it is also in the Greek interest to have a law-governed neighbour to their northern border.  Macedonia, a small ex-Yugoslav republic of about 2 million people, declared independence in 1991 and avoided the violence that accompanied much of the breakup of Yugoslavia. It was later rocked by an insurgency among its large ethnic Albanian minority that almost tore the country apart in 2001 and it has just emerged from two years of political turmoil after a wiretapping scandal brought down the previous ruling nationalist VMRO-DPMNE party bloc in 2015. Tensions boiled over again in April when protesters stormed parliament and assaulted the country s now prime minister after his party and ethnic Albanian allies voted to elect an Albanian as parliament speaker. Macedonia s position just above Greece meant it was also on the key Syrian refugee and north African migrant transit route to northern Europe until the EU and Turkey struck a deal to stem the flow. Turkey is due in the coming months to receive a tranche of the money that came with the deal and Dimitrov said it was important the arrangement remained firm.  We think it is very important for Europe to continue to assist Turkey.   I think closing the Balkan route and the Turkish-EU (financial) deal together helped both Europe and the refugees have a more organised approach to the problem so both are very important and we need both to stay in place.

Does Myanmar violence amount to human rights crimes?,"(Reuters) - Myanmar stands accused by rights groups of ethnic cleansing and human rights violations after violence broke out in the northwestern state of Rakhine, triggering an exodus of about 400,000 Rohingya Muslims to southern Bangladesh.  At least 400 people have been killed, and thousands of homes and villages have been torched, since the military launched a counteroffensive against Rohingya insurgents in late August. Myanmar does not recognize the roughly 1.1 million Rohingyas as citizens, leaving them effectively stateless. The following are questions and answers on the violence:     The military says it is protecting Myanmar against attacks by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), which it has labeled a terrorist group and accuses of killings and destruction in Rakhine state.  Human rights monitors and fleeing Rohingya say the army and ethnic Rakhine Buddhist vigilantes have mounted a campaign of arson aimed at driving out the Rohingya. Rights groups say an independent investigation is required to determine possible abuses or violations by various parties.     Yes, according to United Nations officials and rights groups.   Top U.N. officials have said the violence in Myanmar is a case of  textbook ethnic cleansing .   The U.N. has in the past defined ethnic cleansing as  rendering an area ethnically homogeneous by using force or intimidation to remove persons of given groups from the area.        Ethnic cleansing is not recognized as a separate crime under international law. But allegations of ethnic cleansing as part of wider, systematic human rights violations have been heard in international courts against individuals - including former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, who was convicted of genocide. Phil Robertson, deputy director for Asia at Human Rights Watch (HRW), said initial investigations in Myanmar were  indicative of an ethnic cleansing campaign .  When an army is burning people out of their villages all over northern Rakhine state and using violence against civilians, it results in the kind of incredible refugee flows we re seeing,  he added. Myanmar has denied allegations of ethnic cleansing. ARE WE SEEING GENOCIDE, WAR CRIMES, CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY? Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has said the killing of hundreds of Rohingya amounted to genocide, but rights groups have so far stayed away from these labels, because all three categories are clearly defined and covered in international law. For the ongoing violence to be considered war crimes, the parties involved would have to be at war. Currently, experts say, Myanmar is not technically at war because it only has one party - the military - that is organized enough to carry out intensive fighting operations.     We have not yet been able to determine whether a  state of war  is present in Rakhine state,  said HRW s Robertson.   Crimes against humanity and genocide could be taking place even in the absence of war, but, under U.N. definitions, there would need to be proof of other conditions such as broader,  systematic attacks against the Rohingyas.         Human rights groups have accused Myanmar of laying anti-personnel mines along the border with Bangladesh to prevent Rohingya refugees from returning to Rakhine state.  Because the crisis is not currently defined as a war, this cannot be considered a war crime, according to experts.  However it would violate other international human rights laws, even though Myanmar is not party to the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty.   For nations that are not parties to the treaty, the use of anti-personnel mines violates customary international law, because the weapons are inherently indiscriminate and cause disproportionate long-term harm to civilians,  said Richard Weir, a legal expert at HRW.  A Myanmar military source told Reuters that landmines were laid along the border in the 1990s to prevent trespassing and the military had since tried to remove them, but that none had been planted recently. In international law, an individual can be held criminally responsible for when a state or military commits war crimes or crimes against humanity. Rights groups have called for an independent investigation of abuses by all parties, including ARSA. Many believe the government and the military should be held responsible.   Myanmar is systematically violating the rights of the Rohingya ... and both the government and the military now need to suffer serious consequences for this,  said HRW s Robertson. This depends on the findings of an independent investigation, if the Myanmar government allows one to take place, experts say. Rights groups have called for the U.N. Security Council to also reprimand Myanmar in other ways, for instance, by imposing sanctions such as an arms embargo. They have also urged countries, including the United States and Australia, to suspend bilateral military ties. The 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner has faced widespread international criticism for not doing enough to protect the Rohingya community. Suu Kyi has no direct control over the military, which remains powerful under Myanmar s army-written constitution. But she is Myanmar s foreign minister and de facto civilian leader and has defended the military operation.  It s premature to speculate,  said Robertson, adding that individual responsibility should be based on an impartial investigation.  The International Criminal Court (ICC), based in The Hague, Netherlands, has the jurisdiction to prosecute crimes of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.  Myanmar is among the countries, which also include the United States and China, that are not signatory to the treaty that created the ICC, so it is not obligated to cooperate. But if the U.N. Security Council were to refer a case to the court then Myanmar, being a member of the U.N., would be subject to its jurisdiction. Ad hoc tribunals and commissions have been set up in the past to hear cases of mass human rights violations. For instance, the United Nations established the International Criminal Tribunals for Yugoslavia and Rwanda to deal with crimes that took place there. Rights groups say they are protected by various U.N. human rights treaties, primarily the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which Myanmar voted for in 1948. The document includes provisions for the right to life and right to a nationality - particularly relevant to the Rohingyas, who are effectively stateless. (Story amends headline.)

Coal mine explosion kills nine workers in northern China: Xinhua,"BEIJING (Reuters) - An explosion late on Wednesday at a small coal mine in China s northern province of Heilongjiang killed nine workers, the official Xinhua News Agency said on Thursday.  The incident occurred at the Yuchen coal mine, which has 60,000 tonnes of annual production capacity, located in the city of Jixi.  The latest accident follows an announcement by China s State Council on Aug. 31 to launch a new round of safety checks at coal mines and chemical plants starting in September after injuries during an incident at a state-owned coal mine in August.

EU workers drift from Britain just as restaurateurs need them most,"LONDON (Reuters) - Business is booming for Paul Murphy s recruitment agency in northwest England. Clients are rolling in with more jobs in restaurants, bars and hotels than ever before, but finding workers to fill them has become tricky. Britain s vote to leave the EU has complicated life for Murphy. A steady stream of continental Europeans who for years have taken up hundreds of thousands of positions in the hospitality business and other industries has started to dry up.  It s definitely getting worse. The lead time to fill a chef vacancy at the moment ... could be anything between two and six months,  said Murphy, whose Knight Benton Recruitment agency is based in the small town of Cleator Moor. By contrast finding a chef last year would take two months at most, he told Reuters.  Citizens of the remaining European Union states - from Italians and Spanish to Poles and Romanians - face losing their automatic right to live in Britain when it leaves the bloc in March 2019. Murphy believes the government must produce an alternative immigration regime that ensures employers get the workers they need.  Without a proper plan in place, they could crash the economy,  he said.  The hospitality sector, like farming and construction, has relied heavily on Europeans, and particularly on people from the poorer ex-communist states which began joining the EU in 2003. Citizens of other EU countries could make up as much as a quarter of the 3 million workers in hospitality, according to a KPMG report based on a survey of British Hospitality Association (BHA) members. That includes 75 percent of waiting staff, 37 percent of housekeepers and 25 percent of chefs. Last June s referendum has affected both the supply of labor and demand for it. European workers are starting to leave Britain or having second thoughts about coming in the first place, worried about their uncertain status after Brexit.  On top of this, the pound has fallen more than 15 percent against the euro and about 21 percent against the Polish zloty since the referendum. That means Europeans  sterling pay does not stretch nearly so far when they send money home, encouraging them to seek work elsewhere. But Murphy s clients need more staff. Cleator Moor lies on the edge of the Lake District national park, a top tourist draw. The weak pound has encouraged many Britons to holiday at home and attracted growing numbers of foreign visitors to places like the Lake District. They need feeding and accommodating. Smaller firms are particularly affected. Some are paying agencies to recruit for roles they used to fill easily themselves, raising salaries and offering more part-time hours.    At a national level, big brands like the Pret a Manger sandwich chain and pizza restaurant group Franco Manca have warned about the impact on their businesses.  Hospitality alone accounts for around 4.3 percent of the British economy, the BHA estimates, but the problem is wider.   Numerous recruitment and sentiment surveys have suggested that firms across the economy are struggling to fill vacancies. Prime Minister Theresa May s government has to balance these concerns with those of the many Britons who say they voted for Brexit primarily to clamp down on migration from the EU. The government wants to keep the right of Irish citizens to work in Britain, an arrangement which long pre-dates the EU. But a leaked document last week showed it is considering restricting migration from other EU states to all but the highest skilled workers. The government has said only that it would set out its proposals later this year. Employers fear too hard a line will make matters worse. Already they raised salaries at the fastest pace for two years in August as the fall in EU migration aggravates the labor shortage, according to a survey by the Recruitment and Employment Confederation.  Hospitality needs to recruit 200,000 people every year to make up for natural staff turnover and power its growth, according to the BHA. Without any new EU migration or an increase in applications from Britons, it estimates the industry could face a shortfall of more than 60,000 jobs every year. Since 2003 the number of people born in other EU states living in Britain has jumped from 1.26 million to 3.68 million in 2017, according to Oxford University s Migration Observatory. Eastern Europeans accounted for almost all the increase. But that trend has slowed sharply. In the 12 months to March, net migration from all countries was 246,000, down 81,000 from the previous year, official data show. More than half that drop was due to EU citizens leaving and fewer arriving since the Brexit vote. The biggest fall was among citizens of eight eastern European countries. Up-market fast food chain Leon, which runs 52 restaurants mostly in London and southeast England, is feeling the consequences.  What we ve seen this year, particularly in the last quarter, is a significant drop in applications from EU nationals,  said Marco Reick, the firm s people director. With staff from other EU states making up around 60 percent of Leon s 1,000-strong workforce, the firm has responded by splitting full-time roles into part-time positions. While more expensive initially, this makes them more attractive to British candidates who tend to want more casual work.  Indian fine-dining restaurant group MW Eat says job  applications from EU nationals are down around 80 percent since the referendum.  We ve had to increase wages by in excess of 10 percent,  said chairman Ranjit Mathrani. Even then, the group is taking on less qualified candidates, raising training costs. As a result, it is having to increase menu prices.  Finding British replacements isn t easy. Mathrani said MW Eat would prefer to hire more locally-born workers, but many see hospitality as an unattractive career choice. On top of that unemployment is its lowest in decades, at 1.46 million people or 4.3 percent of the workforce in the three months to July. Peter Gowers, chief executive of the Travelodge budget hotel group, says there simply aren t enough available Britons.  Even if the hotel industry recruited virtually every person on the unemployment register there wouldn t be enough people to fill all the roles needed in the 10 years following Brexit,  he told the Mail on Sunday newspaper. Gowers called on the government to consider a guest worker program to avoid price rises and investment cuts. Other large firms say they have avoided the impact so far. One such is the Gordon Ramsay Group, which operates restaurants under the name of one of Britain s most outspoken celebrity chefs. CEO Stuart Gillies said that with two thirds of its workforce from other EU states, the firm has brought forward steps to retain staff including offering more flexible shifts.   The government s ambition is to cut annual net migration to  the tens of thousands . For some employers, the prospect of further falls in migration is unsettling.

German wage talks to include new focus: reduced working hours,"FRANKFURT/BERLIN (Reuters) - The trade union powerhouse that won the 35-hour work week for Germans more than two decades ago is mobilizing for a new campaign to reduce working hours at annual wage negotiations about to kick off nationwide. IG Metall, Germany s biggest union with 2.3 million workers mainly in the car and manufacturing industries, says shorter hours will help shift workers and those who need to care for children or elderly relatives, with wide implications for how German society evolves in the 21st century. If the union s gambit is successful, economists counting on strong wage rises will be watching to see if there are deflationary effects as domestic consumption overtakes exports as the driver of the euro zone s biggest economy. The union begins internal discussions at the local level on Thursday, just as campaigning in Germany s parliamentary election enters its final phase, with issues of work and family high on the agenda.  The timing could have been made to order for a wage round in which our issues will have great support from society,  IG Metall President Joerg Hofmann told a union conference in late June, as he launched the initiative.  The value of time and the value of money will carry equal weight,  Hofmann told journalists last week. IG Metall will release its national list of demands at the end of October. Negotiations with employers begin in November. Buoyed by record employment, a shortage of skilled labor and a strong economy, it is in its strongest bargaining position for years.  Employers are rattled.  Working time is our number one concern,  Oliver Zander, chief executive of the Gesamtmetall umbrella association of employers that mirrors IG Metall, told reporters last week.  We need more hours to be worked.   Reducing working hours now could be problematic, particularly for small companies, he said, and argued productivity gains were not keeping up with unit labor costs.  We have a very tough wage round ahead of us.  IG Metall, whose members work at giants like Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and Siemens as well as thousands of smaller firms, is trying to wrest back control of working conditions as employers demand ever more flexibility. According to the plan laid out in June, the union wants to establish that workers can reduce weekly hours to 28 for up to two years with a right to return to full-time work. In the cases of low-paid workers who need the extra time to care for relatives, employers would help make up the pay shortfall.  A poll of nearly 700,000 workers at its plants earlier this year found that many shift workers in particular were dissatisfied with their influence over working patterns. One in three of those surveyed worked shifts. IG Metall acknowledges there may have to be a trade-off with the headline pay rise.  Where big sums are involved, such as compensation for the shortfall, the employers will certainly want their payback,  Hofmann told Germany s Deutschlandfunk radio last week. Bundesbank Chief Economist Jens Ulbrich said IG Metall s ideas about working time autonomy and partial compensation for reductions were uncharted territory.  It s quite difficult to assess what the implications of the wage round will be on working time arrangements and wage growth,  he told Reuters. Both the Bundesbank and the European Central Bank are keeping a close eye on the negotiations for any sign that wage growth is picking up, potentially lifting inflation and allowing the ECB to start winding down its massive stimulus program. Despite robust growth across the euro zone, wages have barely risen for years, likely reflecting hidden slack in the labor market - the shortfall between the work people want and the amount available. This is putting the ECB in a tight spot as it has missed its price growth target for nearly five years. The Bundesbank s latest forecast, for 1.4 percent German inflation in 2018, assumes actual wage rises of 2.9 percent, up from 2.4 percent in 2017 and 2.5 percent in 2016. It s not the first time the German work week has been cut. A decade ago, Germans voluntarily cut their hours to share the available work more equally during the global economic crisis.  But where that was a crisis measure, this could be the beginning of a social trend, experts say. Employers got a hint of the mood this year, when most of the more than 100,000 employees at national rail operator Deutsche Bahn [DBN.UL] were given a choice of more money or more holidays and chose the extra days off.  I do believe the trend will go in the direction of shorter working hours,  said Anke Hassel, academic director of the Institute of Economic and Social Research (WSI) of the trade union-affiliated Hans Boeckler Foundation.  IG Metall is the pioneer.   Germans already work fewer than any other nation in the OECD - 1,363 hours a year on average - partly due to large numbers of women working part-time. Jon Messenger, working time specialist at the International Labour Organisation, said the fall in working hours could be seen as a natural evolution of working life, especially in the face of enormous technological change.  That type of working hours reduction is not something I see much of, although I think it would be a good thing,  he said.  It seems to me like it would be a very logical response to increasing automation of production, for example.  Willem Adema, senior economist at the social policy division of the Organisation of the Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), agreed, especially when a reduction was coupled with the right to return to full-time work.  Long hours are not necessarily more productive,  he said. IG Metall s wage settlement will affect as many as 3.9 million workers, including members at plants not directly covered by the pact, and will have a strong influence on other agreements among the 44.4 million workers throughout Germany.  If IG Metall goes a step further with working time, it will certainly send out signals in many areas,  said Thorsten Schulten, wage expert at the WSI.  I can well imagine that we will experience this as a broader issue perhaps already in the next wage rounds, and also in future rounds,  he said. ",worldnews,"September 14, 2017 ",1
Austria's leaders reject Juncker's vision for euro expansion,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria s Social Democrat Chancellor Christian Kern and conservative Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz on Thursday rejected European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker s vision to expand eastward the euro and a border control free zone. In his annual State of the European Union speech, Juncker sketched out a vision of a post-2019 EU where some 30 countries would be using the euro, with an EU finance minister running key budgets to help states in trouble. French, German and eastern European officials have made positive comments about the speech. Kern, who is running against Kurz in parliamentary elections on Oct. 15, told ORF radio there was no point in expanding the euro and Schengen zone as long as tax fraud, the practice of contracting out work to lower-cost eastern European firms and breaches of limits for government debt had not been vanquished.  It simply makes no sense to enlarge the euro zone before this has not been dealt with, because (otherwise) problems would get bigger,  Kern said, pointing to Greece s struggle for years on the verge of bankruptcy as a prime example of such problems.  If you like this is an expansion of the problems at the end of the day and not a plus in European cooperation. I think this concept is not thought through.  Kurz also pointed to Greece as a bad example of including countries which do not fulfil the conditions for public finances the EU has set for itself.  The euro and the Schengen zone is open for everybody, but only for those that fulfill the criteria... We must avoid another situation like the one in Greece,  Kurz said.

East Timor President says to swear in Mari Alkatiri as PM,"DILI (Reuters) - East Timor is set to swear in Mari Alkatiri for a second stint as prime minister, the country s president said on Thursday, with Asia s youngest democracy facing stiff challenges to boost a flagging economy heavily reliant on oil and gas.  Alkatiri, the secretary general of the Fretilin party, was East Timor s first prime minister after independence from Indonesia in 2002. He stood down in 2006 after a wave of unrest sparked by the sacking of 600 soldiers.  Today I announce to all the people that the president of the republic ... has nominated Dr. Mari Alkatiri to become the prime minister,  President Francisco  Lu Olo  Guterres told a news conference. Guterres called for people to remain calm and said Alkatiri would form a minority government. He expected Alkatiri s  swearing-in to be held either later on Thursday or on Friday.  The most important thing is the politicians need to think about how to maintain government stability in the future and ensure peace,  he said. Fretilin, or the Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor, won the most votes in July s election but failed to get an outright majority. It intends to form a coalition with the small Democratic Party. It had been in a de facto coalition since 2015 with the National Congress for Timorese Reconstruction, a party founded by former independence fighter Xanana Gusmao.  Alkatiri, who is a Muslim in the predominantly Roman Catholic nation, spent several decades living in exile in Mozambique during East Timor s struggle for independence. The next prime minister will face pressure to lift flagging oil production in the tiny nation of 1.3 million people, where unemployment and poverty remain high.  Dwindling output from existing oil and gas fields, compounded by the slumping prices of the commodities, have hit the government s budget and crimped its ambition to develop manufacturing as an engine for economic growth.  Australia and East Timor reached a breakthrough agreement earlier this month on a maritime border, ending a decade-old row that has stalled a $40 billion offshore gas project. The long-running dispute has led the owners of the Greater Sunrise fields - Woodside Petroleum, ConocoPhillips, Royal Dutch Shell and Japan s Osaka Gas - to shelve the project.

Japan refueling U.S. missile defense ships keeping watch on North Korean threat: source,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan s navy is supplying fuel to U.S. ballistic missile defense (BMD) ships in the Sea of Japan, in a sign of deepening co-operation between the allies amid the growing threat from North Korea, a source said. By providing fuel to the U.S. Aegis destroyers as well as its own BMD ships, Japan hopes to ensure patrols can be maintained without unnecessary gaps, said the source, who has knowledge of the operation. The refueling began in April, the Nikkei financial daily reported earlier. North Korea threatened on Thursday to sink Japan with nuclear weapons for  dancing to the tune  of the United States for backing a U.N. Security Council resolution that imposed fresh sanctions on Pyongyang. The U.S. Navy s Seventh Fleet usually has around six Aegis ships assigned to BMD operations around Japan. Japan operates four ships of its own. They are armed with interceptors designed to shoot down warheads in space before they plunge to their targets. Around half of the ships would normally be at sea at any one time. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s administration in 2015 won lawmaker approval to expand the role of the nation s Self Defence Forces (SDF) under the pacifist constitution to allow them to take on a bigger role in the alliance with Washington, including resupplying and defending U.S. ships. Japan has delivered fuel to U.S. ships in the past under ad hoc legislation, including vessels deployed to support military operations in Afghanistan a decade ago. But this is the first time it has been undertaken under the new security law. Japan s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga at his regular morning press briefing on Thursday said that this kind of co-operation would be undertaken by the allies. He declined to comment on the Aegis ship fuel shipments saying  it could reveal details of SDF and U.S. Navy operations.  ",worldnews,"September 14, 2017 ",1
13 killed in gang battles in two Mexican states,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - At least 13 people were killed in battles between rival gangs in two states in central and western Mexico, officials said on Wednesday, as murders climb to record levels this year. Five people were gunned down in a bar on Tuesday night in the capital of central Guanajuato state while seven people were found dead in two different places in the western state of Michoacan, according to officials at state prosecutors offices. Three dismembered bodies, including a woman s, were found in the community of Angahuan near the drug-gang hotbed of Uruapan, the Michoacan prosecutors  office said. Michoacan has been one of the bloodiest states in Mexico because of battles between rival gangs involved in drug trafficking, kidnapping, extortion of local businesses as well as mineral theft and illegal logging. Neighboring Guanajuato state has seen a spike in violence. Murders were up 37 percent in Guanajuato in the first seven months of the year compared to the same period last year. The murder rate has already risen above levels seen in 2011, which was the deadliest year under former president Felipe Calderon who sent the army out to battle drug gangs. Nationally, there were 14,190 murder investigations in the first seven months of the year, the highest total through July for any year in records going back to 1997. The increase in violence has hit the popularity of President Enrique Pena Nieto and his Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) ahead of next year s presidential election.

China's big money trumps U.S. influence in Cambodia," (Story corrects to million from billion in paragraph 12 of September 11th version.) By Prak Chan Thul and Matthew Tostevin PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Accused of plotting treason with Cambodia s detained opposition leader, the U.S. embassy posted a picture of a red herring on its Facebook page. The cryptic suggestion that the accusations were false - a mystifying reference for many Cambodians - was followed by further posts on Monday showing how U.S. aid was helping to preserve temples and forests. Those posts also underscored the big difference between aid from the United States and aid from China, whose greater support for big ticket projects has helped allow Prime Minister Hun Sen to brush off criticism over the arrest of election rival Kem Sokha. Not only is China vastly outspending the United States in a country once destroyed by Cold War superpower rivalry, but its money goes on highly visible infrastructure projects and with no demands for political reform. U.S. aid goes more towards social projects and trying to build democracy - unwanted interference for the government of a prime minister who has ruled for over 30 years.  Taking aid doesn t mean they can order us to do what they want. We aren t their ally. We aren t their slave,  government spokesman Phay Siphan told Reuters.  The Chinese always support us in economic growth and they never interfere in our decisions.  The U.S. embassy made no immediate comment. Cambodia has dismissed U.S. and Western criticism of the Sept. 3 arrest of opposition leader Kem Sokha. China has backed Hun Sen.  To ensure the security of Cambodia, China will cooperate with Cambodia in all circumstances,  Wang Jiarui, vice chairman of China s national assembly, said in Phnom Penh last week, according to the official Cambodian record. The support doesn t only run one way. China relies on Cambodia in Southeast Asian meetings on issues such as its claims in the South China Sea. In Cambodia, China s military has also gained a strategic foothold. Figures from Cambodia s overseas development aid database show how important China has become. It accounted for nearly 36 percent of $732 million listed in bilateral aid for 2016 - nearly four times as much as from the United States. Most of the rest is from other Western countries, whose protests have also been dismissed. The disparity is even starker in investment. China provided nearly 30 percent of investment capital in Cambodia last year - more than Cambodians themselves. The United States accounted for only just over three percent. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump s proposed aid cuts have pointed to a possible 70 percent reduction in U.S. assistance to Cambodia from 2018, according to a draft proposal. What Cambodia gets from the United States and China is very different. Chinese projects include roads, bridges, irrigation systems, electrical transmission infrastructure and dams. The list of U.S. projects is much longer, but they are much smaller: in education, health, conservation as well as efforts to build democracy which grate on the government. The U.S. funded National Democratic Institute (NDI) pro-democracy group was expelled last month and accused of conspiring to help bring down Hun Sen - a charge rejected by the NDI and the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP).  The fact the government has been criticized by Western donors over the recent crackdown just means Cambodia is becoming more dependent on China,  said Ou Virak of the Future Forum think tank. The United States is a much bigger export market than China, particularly for Cambodia s garment factories, but the United States has not publicly suggested it could use trade to bring pressure for democratic change. Kem Sokha s deputy, Mu Sochua, said aid that did not include conditions on human rights did not serve Cambodia well.  Cambodia needs China, it needs America, it needs democracy to pull it out of many years of poverty,  she told Reuters. But Cambodia depends much less on aid than it did. This year will mark the seventh year of near 7 percent growth or above - a fact Hun Sen often points to in a country he took over after the devastating  killing fields  genocide committed by the Khmer Rouge, in which he was once a commander. World Bank figures show overseas development assistance fell from over 120 percent of central government expenditure in 2002 to barely 32 percent in 2015. Per capita gross domestic product rose from less than $340 in 2002 to nearly $1,300 last year. Dismissing U.S. interference in a speech on Monday, Hun Sen threatened a possible ban on the opposition party.  Then he took a plane for Beijing where he said he would seek money for the health sector - an area dominated by Western donors until now. ",worldnews,"September 11, 2017 ",1
Peru's Kuczynski dares Congress to dismiss entire Cabinet,"LIMA (Reuters) - The government of Peru s President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski told opposition lawmakers on Wednesday that they would have to dismiss the entire Cabinet - and move closer to facing removal themselves - if they try to oust a second education minister. Kuczynski accused the opposition-ruled Congress of trying to sabotage his education reforms as the right-wing Popular Force party prepared a motion to censure Education Minister Marilu Martens over her handling of a teachers strike that dragged on for two months. The president said ousting Martens would be  completely unfair.   It would be the second education minister censured and purely over political preferences,  Kuczynski said. By turning the censure vote on Martens into a vote of confidence on his whole Cabinet, Kuczynski hopes to check Popular Force s ability to threaten his ministers. The president can dissolve Congress if it dismisses the Cabinet twice. Congress has already forced Kuczynski s former education and finance ministers to resign, while his ex-transportation minister quit to avoid a censure vote.     Popular Force lawmakers said they would study the request for a vote of confidence on the Cabinet and noted they had not yet formally presented the censure motion for Martens - a sign they might back off.  They re putting the governability of the country at risk over one minister?  said Luz Salgado, an influential lawmaker with Popular Force, which controls Congress.  It s completely irresponsible.  The gamble could force Kuczynski, a former Wall Street banker, to appoint 19 new ministers as he tries to revive the economy and his slipping popularity in opinion polls. However, it might also give him a freer hand to govern during the remaining four years of his term. A prime minister has not challenged Congress to renew its confidence in a cabinet in decades, said political analyst Fernando Tuesta, underscoring how rapidly relations between the executive branch and Congress have deteriorated in Kuczynski s year-old government. Kuczynski took office last year after narrowly beating  long-time favorite Keiko Fujimori, the eldest daughter of jailed former leader Alberto Fujimori. Kuczynski s party won less than 15 percent of congressional seats while Fujimori s party, Popular Force, won an absolute majority. ",worldnews,"September 13, 2017 ",1
Florida deaths in sweltering nursing home show post-disaster perils,"HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (Reuters) - Inside a sweltering nursing home, a crisis unfolded on Wednesday as 150 centers across Florida still lacked power days after Hurricane Irma ravaged the state. Firefighters and medics responding to an emergency call in Hollywood north of Miami found three people dead inside a building whose second floor the police chief later described as  extremely hot.  Altogether, city officials said eight people between the ages of 71 and 99 had died, but the causes were not yet determined. An investigation of possible criminal negligence has begun, Hollywood Police Chief Tomas Sanchez told reporters. Attempts by Reuters to reach an official of the for-profit Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills home by phone and email were unsuccessful. While Sanchez declined to say what the temperatures were on the second floor of the building, the deaths illustrate the perils that can persist and even increase in the aftermath of a major disaster for the elderly and medically fragile.  Heat is a top killer after hurricanes and disasters cause power outages, said Dr. Thomas Kirsch, director of the National Center for Disaster Medicine and Public Health. Kirsch noted that hundreds of elderly people died in the 1995 Chicago heat wave and when Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans in 2005. The temperatures in Broward County north of Miami have reached 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius) in the three days since Irma smashed into Florida on Sunday.    We often see that injuries and deaths after disaster in the United States are more common than those actually caused by the disaster itself,  Kirsch said. After losing its full air conditioning on Sunday, the facility placed eight portable air coolers throughout the building and fans in the halls, state officials said in an emergency order late on Wednesday. Officials also contacted the power provider, the state said. Efforts to prevent such disasters in nursing facilities have improved in recent years, public health experts said, and that new federal regulations require facilities to have sufficient backup power to maintain reasonable temperatures.  Such capacity is now being tested in Florida, home to among the highest concentrations of senior citizens in the United States with more than 1.6 million people ages 75 years or older, according to the 2015 U.S. Census. The U.S. Senate Aging Committee, citing the Florida deaths, on Wednesday said it would have a hearing next week on disaster planning for the elderly.  At a housing community for senior citizens in Immokalee, Florida, some residents told a Reuters reporter on Tuesday they had nothing to eat in their small apartments that were without power. An office assistant was hunting for bottled water and ice for residents without running water. Among the state s nearly 700 nursing facilities, about 150 lacked power as of Wednesday morning, said the Florida Health Care Association, which represents most of the homes. Early on Wednesday, several calls were placed to emergency services from the Hollywood nursing home. More than 150 people were evacuated, many suffering from respiratory issues, dehydration and heat-related problems, according to Memorial Regional Hospital spokesman Randy Katz. As recently as Tuesday afternoon, the home had told state health officials it had power and access to fans and spot coolers, Florida Governor Rick Scott noted in a statement. An assisted living center that went without power for nearly three days said that its efforts to run fans and keep breezes flowing between open windows could only go so far. Inside temperatures climbed to 88 degrees Fahrenheit (31 Celsius), nearing a critical point.  A day you can survive, two days ok,  said Dan Nelson, chief operating officer for Cape Coral Shores assisted living, adding  that after that  things like what happened over in Hollywood unfortunately could happen somewhere else.   The Hollywood center where the deaths occurred had earned a  below average  mark of two out of five stars from the nursing home rating system for Medicare, the U.S. health insurance program for the elderly and disabled, Medicare records showed. Elder care in disaster poses challenges even in the best circumstances, said Kathryn Hyer, a professor in the School of Aging Studies at the University of South Florida in Tampa, whose research shows that evacuations can be deadly for the medically frail who are dependant on equipment and medications.  While sheltering in place can be preferable at times, she said, doing so requires planning to survive the aftermath.  It s just hard,  Hyer said, noting at least nursing centers offered some protections.  I really worry about the people who are in the community alone and how they are doing.

Guatemala lawmakers curb penalties for illegal election financing,"GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - Guatemala s Congress on Wednesday approved a  national emergency  decree to curb penalties for illegal election financing after the country s president was linked to suspected irregularities during his 2015 election campaign. The change eliminates criminal responsibility for  authorizing  electoral funds that prove to be illegal and makes party accountants responsible for irregularities rather than party leaders. The reform, approved by a vote of 105-19, also reduces the penalty for illegal election financing from a maximum of 12 years to 10 and allows for paying a fine in order to avoid jail time. The decree was the latest blow to the prosecutor s office and the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) after Congress this week voted to preserve President Jimmy Morales  immunity from prosecution.  Prosecutors had sought to remove Morales  immunity to investigate him over some $800,000 in allegedly unexplained campaign funds when he was the head of his party. Prosecutors are also investigating Guatemala s other major parties.        Under the leadership of Ivan Velasquez, a veteran Colombian prosecutor, the CICIG has caused problems for Morales, first investigating his son and brother, and then seeking to prosecute him over the allegedly unexplained campaign funds.       The U.S. ambassador to Guatemala, Todd Robinson, expressed his disappointment in a message on Twitter.  Years of malnutrition, insecurity, crime, corruption. Congress? No action. Amazing how fast they act to protect selves from prosecution,  he said in a post.  Really? National emergency? What a shame!  ",worldnews,"September 14, 2017 ",1
Canadian teens tried to use Christmas lights for bomb: prosecutor,"MONTREAL (Reuters) - A young Montreal couple tried to use Christmas lights and sandpaper to make a homemade bomb, a prosecutor told a Canadian court on Wednesday in opening statements in the terrorism trial of the former college students. The items and a handwritten bomb-making recipe copied from a propaganda magazine published by al Qaeda militants were found after the Royal Canadian Mounted Police searched a condo rented by El Mahdi Jamali and Sabrine Djermane in 2015, prosecutor Lyne Decarie said in Quebec Superior Court in Montreal.  It is not clear how the lights would have been used to make a bomb.  Jamali, 20, and Djermane, 21, have pleaded not guilty to charges of trying to leave Canada to join a terrorist group, possessing an explosive substance, facilitating a terrorist activity, and committing an offense for a terrorist group.   The 2015 arrest of the couple, teenagers at the time, came at a time when international security forces reported that waves of young people, including college students from Montreal, were heading to Syria to join Islamic State militants.  Decarie said investigators found other materials, jihadist propaganda and evidence that the couple had watched a video by a Canadian fighter for the Islamic State. New luggage and clothes, along with passport applications were discovered during the search. The pair reiterated their not-guilty pleas before Decarie began her remarks and then listened from a high-security prisoners  box that was enclosed in thick glass. RCMP began investigating the couple after receiving a tip, Decarie said, and arrested them days later. The prosecutor said she would call family and friends of the accused as well as police experts in terrorism and explosives as witnesses in the trial, which is expected to last 10 weeks.

Brazil's PSD party floats Meirelles' 2018 presidential bid,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Congressmen from Brazil s Social Democratic Party (PSD) on Wednesday invited Finance Minister Henrique Meirelles to run for president in 2018, growing the list of potential contenders from within President Michel Temer s fragmented coalition. Meirelles, after meeting with PSD lawmakers at his house in Brasilia, wrote on Twitter that he felt honored but was not a candidate. The PSD leader in the lower house of Congress, Marcos Montes, nevertheless said Meirelles received the invitation with  enthusiasm  but would not respond immediately. Reuters reported late in August, citing a source close to Meirelles, that he wanted to run for president on the PSD ticket, but knew he would have a strong chance only if the economy improved substantially. Meirelles, in his Twitter post, said that he was focusing his energies on helping Brazil obtain  sustainable growth  after emerging from its worst recorded recession.  Under Brazilian rules, ministers who wish to run in the October 2018 election will need to leave their posts by April, although a formal register would only happen in August. Other potential contenders being floated by ruling parties include Sao Paulo state governor Geraldo Alckmin and Sao Paulo city mayor Jo o Doria Jr., both from the PSDB party.  A civil engineer by training, Meirelles is the former chairman of now defunct BankBoston Corp and former president of Brazil s central bank. ",worldnews,"September 13, 2017 ",1
Risks to Brazil's Temer subside after bungled JBS plea bargain,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - The arrest on Sunday of Joesley Batista, a billionaire meatpacker who implicated President Michel Temer in a corruption scandal, has actually improved the Brazilian leader s prospects of surviving graft allegations and serving out his term through 2018.    But the three-month political crisis triggered by the plea bargain allegations by Batista, formerly chairman of meatpacker JBS SA (JBSS3.SA), has consumed precious time that Temer has to pass legislation to overhaul Brazil s costly pension system and avoid a fiscal crisis in Latin America s largest nation. Temer and his coalition allies in Congress are confident they can block a second corruption charge that Brazil s top prosecutor, Rodrigo Janot, is expected to file against the president by the end of the week. A Supreme Court judge on Tuesday authorized a new probe of Temer for suspected corruption involving a decree regulating ports, a day after a separate police probe into Temer s allies kept pressure on the president. Yet as long as Temer is in office, any charges against the president must be approved by the lower house of Congress in which he has retained enough backing to avoid trial by the Supreme Court.  Temer s political standing in Congress has improved a lot, because the economy is starting to grow again and the pressure of another corruption charge is falling,  said the government s deputy whip in the lower house, Beto Mansur.  The prosecutor s case has been weakened and the next charge will arrive here with little credibility,  he told Reuters. A new poll by Arko Advice consultancy, however, shows that most lawmakers do not expect pension reform to clear Congress until 2018, and passing the unpopular measure in the run-up to next year s elections may be an uphill struggle. A proposed overhaul of the pension system, the main contributor to Brazil s record budget deficit, was headed for approval in the lower house of Congress until accusations against Temer in May derailed his plans. In a bombshell plea bargain agreement in May, Batista confessed to bribing hundreds of politicians and gave prosecutors a taped conversation of the president. The recording appeared to show Temer condoning hush money payments to silence a witness in a sprawling corruption scandal. Just two weeks ago, however, another tape inadvertently submitted to prosecutors by Batista with other documents appeared to show he had been helped by a close aide to Janot in crafting the deal. The Supreme Court revoked his immunity and ordered his arrest for concealing other crimes. Beyond the embarrassment to Janot in his last days in office - he steps down as top prosecutor on Sunday - the revelation has given Temer s lawyers an opening to try to dismiss evidence provided by Batista, while strengthening the president s hand in Congress to fight any further charges. The credibility of Temer s accuser was further undermined on Wednesday by the arrest of Batista s brother Wesley, the chief executive officer of JBS SA, for alleged insider trading to avoid hefty losses related to the May plea bargain. Temer mustered enough support to block Janot s initial corruption charge from putting him on trial, in a 263-227 vote in the lower house on Aug. 2. That margin is expected to widen if a second charge comes before the house.  There is no motivation in Congress to remove president Temer. Many of the politicians who will vote are being investigated, so why would they empower the public prosecutors at this time?  said Lucas de Arag o, a political scientist and partner at Arko Advice. Still, Arag o said fighting the next charge will cost Temer more pork barrel and patronage for lawmakers and at least a 30-day delay for pension reform, leaving the Senate with little time to pass the bill in 2017. No less than 83 percent of lawmakers believe pension reform will not be passed this year, according to an Arko poll of 201 Congressmen last week. Temer has ordered his minister to restart the pension reform debate in Congress immediately so that it can be put to the vote in the house my mid-October.  The country lost 90 days. The economy could be recovering faster and growth would have been more robust if it had not been for this artificial crisis,  said a Temer aide who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. Speaker Rodrigo Maia is expected to expedite the pension bill after Temer signed off on a bailout for his bankrupt state of Rio de Janeiro, a source on the economic team said.

Juncker: grab Brexit chance to forge a tighter EU,"STRASBOURG (Reuters) - European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker urged European Union governments on Wednesday to use economic recovery and Brexit as springboards toward a closer union, built on an expanded euro zone and a pivotal role in world trade. In his annual State of the European Union speech, Juncker  sketched out a vision of a post-2019 EU where some 30 countries would be using the euro, with an EU finance minister running key budgets to help states in trouble. Tax and welfare standards would converge and Europe, not the United States, would be the hub of a free-trading world. The EU chief executive stressed his wish to heal divisions between eastern and western states. He sees that as vital to countering a drive, including by founding powers France and Germany, to set up new structures within the bloc that would exclude some poorer, ex-communist members in the east.  The wind is back in Europe s sails,  Junker told the European Parliament, citing economic growth and the easing of a succession of crises   Greek debt, refugee inflows, the rise of eurokcepticism reflected in Brexit - that seemed to threaten the EU s survival.  Now we have a window of opportunity, but it will not stay open for ever,  he said, emphasizing a need to move on from and even profit from the British vote to leave the bloc in 2019.  We will keep moving on because Brexit isn t everything, it is not the future of Europe,  he said in a speech that Brexit supporters said showed they were right to take Britain out of a bloc set on creating more powerful, central institutions French, German and eastern European officials made positive comments, but several said Juncker would face stiff opposition.  In a carefully balanced, hour-long discourse in Strasbourg, he called on nationalist eastern leaders   though not by name   to stop defying EU courts over civil rights, and on westerners to drop attempts to keep out cheaper eastern workers or palm off inferior food in poorer national markets. But his core proposal for countering what is known as a  multispeed Europe  by encouraging all states to join the euro and other EU structures faces resistance in both non-euro zone countries and potentially in Paris and Berlin, where the newly elected President Emmanuel Macron and about-to-be-re-elected  Chancellor Angela Merkel are readying their own plans. Macron plans to present his ideas for reforming the 19-nation euro zone on Sept. 26, two days after the German election, a French diplomatic source said. EU officials hope leaders may discuss the issues at a dinner on Sept. 28 before a summit in Estonia.  If we want the euro to unite rather than divide our continent, then it should be more than the currency of a select group of countries,  Juncker said.  The euro is meant to be the single currency of the European Union as a whole.  He noted that only long-standing EU members Britain and Denmark have a legal right not to adopt the euro. EU officials say that with Britain leaving, and the eight remaining non-euro states accounting for only 15 percent of EU GDP, Juncker sees it as natural for EU and euro zone policy to operate in unison. For that reason, he rejected proposals, led by France, for a special euro zone budget, finance minister and parliament. These functions, he said, should be filled instead by a vice president of the Commission, chairing the Eurogroup of 19 euro zone finance ministers and managing a euro zone budget that would be part of the budget for the whole EU, overseen by Parliament. While Denmark in fact pegs its crown closely to the euro, a drive to push the likes of Poland and Sweden into the euro would be a hard sell in those countries, while Germany, France and others have been skeptical about letting poorer states join yet. Juncker proposed EU funding and technical help to encourage non-euro members to get themselves into a position to join. For Juncker, officials say, the departure of Britain, for all the difficulties it brings, means goodbye to the major power that has continually sought opt-outs from new integration projects, and offers an opportunity to end the habit for good.  Everyone should be in everything,  one senior official said. An aide to Macron said Juncker had made  many ambitious proposals  in line with French ideas and played down divergence on euro zone reform, noting Juncker would offer final ideas only in December. In Germany, government officials were restrained. But Beate Merk, a regional minister in Bavaria allied to Merkel, said expanding the euro to the whole EU would be  a risky experiment that would greatly heighten Europe s problems . Euroskeptics responded critically to the Commission president s speech. Ryszard Legutko, an EU lawmaker from Poland s right-wing ruling party, warned against responding to problems with  the same old  more Europe, more Europe  arguments.  That is not the answer,  he said.  We need to get the EU s house in order before there can even be a discussion on centralizing even further.  Nigel Farage of the UK Independence Party said:  All I can say is, thank God we re leaving.  Farage s allies cheered when Juncker finally mentioned Brexit near the end of his speech and said the British would come to regret their  tragic  referendum decision to leave. Looking ahead to March 30, 2019, the day when Britain will be out of the EU, Juncker said he had proposed that Romania, which will then hold its rotating presidency, should host a summit in the formerly German-speaking Transylvanian city of Sibiu. There leaders should set out plans for a more united Union, two months before voters elect a new European Parliament. ",worldnews,"September 13, 2017 ",1
Juncker's EU plan is largely in line with Germany's vision: Schaeuble,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said on Wednesday that European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker s plan to build a closer European Union based on an expanded euro zone was largely in line with Germany s vision for the bloc. Schaeuble said that Juncker had discussed with Chancellor Angela Merkel his annual State of the EU speech in which he spoke of a vision of a post-2019 EU where some 30 countries would be using the euro. The plan also includes appointing an EU finance minister running key budgets to help states in trouble.  It is good that he is putting pressure (to expand the euro zone) but the preconditions (for joining the euro zone) must be fulfilled,  Schaeuble told the ARD broadcaster in an interview.   It is in fact so that EU countries who fulfill the preconditions become members of the euro under the Lisbon Treaty . He added that EU countries wishing to adopt the single currency should not do so before their public finances and economies are sound enough as they could face the fate of Greece, which had to be bailed out by the EU and IMF in 2010.

Region must do more to pressure South Sudan leaders to end conflict: U.S. diplomat,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - African countries should do more to pile pressure on South Sudan s political leaders, who seem incapable of resolving the country s four-year civil war, a top U.S. diplomat said on Wednesday.  We think there is more our African colleagues can and should be doing at this point, especially in terms of focusing on leadership, that from our point of view is behaving in a way that is very irresponsible,  Tom Shannon, U.S. under-secretary for political affairs at the State Department, told reporters. Shannon, speaking on the sidelines of a U.S-African Partnerships event at the U.S. Institute of Peace, said Washington had grown  intolerant  of South Sudan s leaders and the challenge was to work with African countries which are interested in seeing an end to the conflict.  This is a manmade conflict of horrific dimensions, which is about political leaders measuring each other through force at the cost of their populations,  said Shannon. His remarks come after the new USAID administrator, Mark Green, traveled to Juba on Sept. 2 to meet with South Sudan s President Salva Kiir and deliver a message from Washington that the United States was reviewing its relationship with his government.  The Trump administration last week imposed sanctions on two senior South Sudanese officials and the former army chief for their role in the conflict, atrocities against civilians and  attacks against international missions in South Sudan.  South Sudan became the world s newest nation when it gained independence from Sudan in 2011. War broke out in late 2013 and more than a quarter of its population of 12 million have fled their homes.  A confidential report by the United Nations last week said competing efforts to end South Sudan s civil war were allowing Kiir s government to exploit divisions among the international brokers. East African leaders said in June they want the warring sides to recommit to a peace deal they abandoned more than a year ago. . Among the international bodies trying to end the conflict are regional block IGAD, the U.N. Security Council, a troika of South Sudan s main Western backers prior to independence and an African Union panel. ",worldnews,"September 13, 2017 ",1
North Korea defiant over U.N. sanctions as Trump says tougher steps needed,"SEOUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - North Korea displayed trademark defiance on Wednesday over new United Nations sanctions imposed after its sixth and largest-ever nuclear test, vowing to redouble efforts to fight off what it said was the threat of a U.S. invasion. U.S. President Donald Trump said the sanctions, unanimously agreed on Monday by the 15-member U.N. Security Council, were just a small step toward what is ultimately needed to rein in Pyongyang over its nuclear and missile programs. North Korea s Foreign Ministry said the resolutions were an infringement on its legitimate right to self-defense and aimed at  completely suffocating its state and people through full-scale economic blockade .  The DPRK will redouble the efforts to increase its strength to safeguard the country s sovereignty and right to existence and to preserve peace and security of the region by establishing the practical equilibrium with the U.S.,  it said in a statement carried by the official KCNA news agency. The Democratic People s Republic of Korea (DPRK) is North Korea s official name. The statement echoed comments on Tuesday by DPRK s Ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, Han Tae Song, who said Pyongyang was  ready to use a form of ultimate means .  The forthcoming measures ... will make the U.S. suffer the greatest pain it ever experienced in its history,  Han said. The North s Rodong Sinmun newspaper also accused South Korea of being Washington s  puppet , criticizing Seoul s agreement with the United States to amend an existing bilateral guideline that will now allow the South to use unlimited warhead payloads on its missiles. The U.N. Security Council agreed to tighten sanctions on North Korea, banning its textile exports and capping fuel supplies, and making it illegal for foreign firms to form commercial joint ventures with North Korean entities. The U.N. resolution was triggered by North Korea s test of what it said was a hydrogen bomb. Damage to mountainous terrain at the North s nuclear test site in Punggye-ri seen in satellite imagery taken after the latest test was more extensive than anything seen after the five previous tests, said 38 North, a Washington-based project which monitors North Korea. There was also activity at another location in the Mount Mantap site involving large vehicles and mining equipment that suggests  onsite work could now be changing focus to further prepare those other portals for future underground nuclear testing , 38 North said. The North accuses the United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War, of continual plans for invasion. North Korea has also tested a missile capable of reaching the United States, but experts say it is likely to be at least a year before it can field an operational nuclear missile that could threaten the U.S. mainland. A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said intelligence agencies had observed North Korea moving a mobile missile launcher in the past 48 hours which could potentially indicate a possible missile launch by the North in the coming days. The official did not comment on the location or the type of missile, but emphasized that while a launch was possible, North Korea could simply be moving the launcher. Trump has vowed not to allow that to happen. A tougher initial U.S. draft resolution was weakened to win the support of China and Russia, both of which hold veto power on the U.N. Security Council. Significantly, it stopped short of imposing a full embargo on oil exports to North Korea, most of which come from China.  We think it s just another very small step, not a big deal,  Trump told reporters at the start of a Tuesday meeting with Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak.  I don t know if it has any impact, but certainly it was nice to get a 15-to-nothing vote, but those sanctions are nothing compared to what ultimately will have to happen.  U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also warned China, North Korea s main ally and trading partner, that Washington would  put additional sanctions on them and prevent them from accessing the U.S. and international dollar system  if it did not follow through on the new measures. Another senior administration official told Reuters that any such  secondary sanctions  on Chinese banks and other companies were on hold for now to give Beijing time to show it was prepared to fully enforce the latest and previous rounds of sanctions. Washington has so far mostly held off on new sanctions against Chinese banks and other companies doing business with North Korea, given fears of retaliation by Beijing and possibly far-reaching effects on the world economy. Russia and China both say they respect U.N. sanctions and have called on the United States to return to negotiations with North Korea. They have also said they could kick-start talks with North Korea if the United States halts joint military drills with South Korea, which Washington has rejected. An article carried on the front page of the People s Daily, the official paper of China s ruling Communist Party, said the Korean Peninsula had reached the  moment of choice  where the United States and North Korea must break from the cycle of nuclear tests and sanctions.   All parties involved in the peninsula have their own strategic considerations, but not being able to see beyond this vicious cycle is not in anyone s interest,  the article said. Asked about the North Korean and U.S. rhetoric, China s Foreign Ministry reiterated a call for restraint and a return to dialogue.   We hope all relevant parties can be rational and maintain restraint and not take actions that could further increase tensions on the peninsula , ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a regular briefing.  In another show of force, South Korea s Air Force conducted its first live-fire exercise of Taurus long-range, air-to-surface missiles on Tuesday, the Defence Ministry said, as practice for precision bombing North Korean facilities. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said the new sanctions could eventually starve North Korea of an additional $500 million or more in annual revenue. The United States has said that a previous round of sanctions agreed in August was aimed at cutting North Korea s $3 billion in exports by a third. ",worldnews,"September 10, 2017 ",1
"Evacuated Islamic State fighters reach Syria's Deir al-Zor, pro-Damascus commander says","BEIRUT (Reuters) - Buses carrying evacuated Islamic State fighters reached Syria s Deir al-Zor on Wednesday in return for releasing a Hezbollah prisoner, a commander in the pro-Damascus alliance told Reuters.  Damascus and Hezbollah allowed nearly 300 lightly armed militants and 300 relatives to leave the Syria-Lebanon border in a surrender deal, after an offensive there last month.      The transfer marked the first time Islamic State publicly agreed to such an evacuation from territory it held. A U.S.-led coalition had stopped the 17 buses from reaching Deir al-Zor for weeks and the convoy split in two. It was not immediately clear if all the buses arrived in Islamic State territory in the eastern Syrian province on Wednesday.  The deal has been completed,  said the commander in the military alliance fighting in support of the Damascus government. The buses took the route between the town of al-Sukhna and Deir al-Zor, a main road that the Syrian army and allied forces captured in recent days, the commander said. Along the route, the combatants swapped the evacuees for a Hezbollah prisoner who had been in Islamic State captivity, the non-Syrian commander added.          Under the evacuation deal in August, Islamic State militants left their border foothold after a week-long battle in return for safe passage to Deir al-Zor province in Syria.      Iran-backed Hezbollah has played a major role in fighting Sunni militants along the border. Since early in the six-year Syrian conflict, it has sent thousands of fighters to support President Bashar al-Assad s government.  Lebanon s Shi ite Hezbollah retrieved the remains of some of its forces killed in Syria as part of the swap, and was meant to get back one of its fighters that Islamic State held captive.  The deal included recovering the bodies of nine Lebanese soldiers that Islamic State captured in 2014. The transfer ended any insurgent presence from the Syrian war on the frontier, where the Lebanese army also fought the militants in a separate offensive on its side.  But the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State blocked the convoy from entering IS territory in east Syria, near the border with Iraq, by cratering roads and destroying bridges. The convoy split in two, with 11 buses remaining in the open desert and others retreating into government territory.  Last week, the U.S. coalition said its surveillance aircraft moved away from the buses in the no-man s land after pro-Syrian government forces  advanced past  the convoy. Damascus was responsible for the evacuees, it said.  The Syrian army and its allies reached Deir al-Zor city, breaking an Islamic State siege of an enclave there that had lasted three years.  U.S.-backed Syrian militias have also launched a separate assault in another part of Deir al-Zor province, which has become Islamic State s last major foothold in Syria.

UK PM May to make Brexit speech in Italy on Sept. 22: spokesman,"LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May will make a speech on Britain s future relationship with the European Union on Sept. 22 in the Italian city of Florence, her spokesman said on Wednesday. The speech will focus on what kind of ties Britain wants to have with the EU after it leaves the bloc in March 2019 - something British negotiators have been keen to discuss with a so-far reluctant Brussels.   The prime minister wanted to give a speech on the UK s future relationship with Europe in its historical heart,  May s spokesman told reporters.  She will underline the government s wish for a deep and special partnership with the European Union once the UK leaves the EU.  Negotiations on the terms of the divorce with the EU have made limited progress since May started a two-year countdown to Brexit. That has prompted warnings from the EU that discussions on the future relationship between the two could be pushed back from their intended start time of October. The September round of Brexit talks has been pushed back by a week until the end of the month, in what EU diplomats said was a move designed to allow May to make her speech. Britain said the rescheduling was to allow both sides more time to make progress. May s speech could add weight to the British push to move talks forward, which ministers say is a crucial step in providing certainty for businesses worried about how Brexit will affect their ability to trade across borders. Her choice of venue - a city celebrated as the birthplace of the Renaissance period and made wealthy by international trade and banking - is a nod to the kind of free-trading relationship Britain wants to maintain with Europe and develop globally. Sceptics have said the British approach amounts to cherry picking the benefits of EU membership without paying for them.  The UK has had deep cultural and economic ties spanning centuries with Florence - a city known for its historical trading power,  the spokesman said.   As the UK leaves the EU we will retain those close ties. As the prime minister has said many times, we are leaving the EU, not Europe.  ",worldnews,"September 13, 2017 ",1
Mauritius attorney general steps down amid money laundering probe,"PORT LOUIS (Reuters) - The attorney general of the island nation of Mauritius stepped down on Wednesday after allegations he had helped launder gambling money.  Prime Minister Pravind Kumar Jugnauth told reporters he wanted an investigation into Ravi Yerrigadoo to be conducted transparently. The Indian Ocean island markets itself as a link between Africa and Asia and is striving to move from an economy mostly based on sugar, textiles and tourism toward offshore banking, business outsourcing, luxury real estate and medical tourism. A scandal could hurt its burgeoning financial services industry.  If Ravi Yerrigadoo is cleared he will be able to resume office,  Jugnauth said. Mauritius-based L Express newspaper reported on Wednesday that an affidavit had been filed before the Supreme Court accusing Yerrigadoo of trying to facilitate the transfer of gambling money through a financial structure. It was not clear who had filed the affidavit.  In a statement, Yerrigadoo denied the allegations and said he had quit to avoid the perception of a conflict of interest while the investigation was in progress.   In March 2016, the environment minister was also forced to resign over corruption allegations. ",worldnews,"September 13, 2017 ",1
"U.N. chief, Security Council call on Myanmar to end violence","UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday urged Myanmar authorities to end violence against the majority-Buddhist country s Rohingya Muslims that has forced some 400,000 people to flee to Bangladesh. Guterres said the situation in Myanmar s western state of Rakhine was best described as ethnic cleansing.  When one-third of the Rohingya population had to flee the country, could you find a better word to describe it?  he told a news conference.   I call on the Myanmar authorities to suspend military action, end the violence, uphold the rule of law, and recognize the right of return of all those who had to leave the country,  said Guterres, adding that he had spoken several times with Myanmar s national leader, Aung San Suu Kyi. The exodus of refugees, sparked by the security forces  fierce response to a series of Rohingya militant attacks on Aug. 25, is the most pressing problem Suu Kyi has faced since becoming leader last year. The government says it is targeting  terrorists,  while refugees say the offensive aims to push Rohingya out of Myanmar. The 15-member Security Council met behind closed doors on Wednesday, at the request of Sweden and Britain, to discuss the crisis for the second time since it began and agreed to publicly condemn the situation.  The council  expressed concern about reports of excessive violence during the security operations and called for immediate steps to end the violence in Rakhine, de-escalate the situation, re-establish law and order, ensure the protection of civilians ... and resolve the refugee problem.  British U.N. Ambassador Matthew Rycroft said it was the first statement from the Security Council on Myanmar in nine years. Such statements have to be agreed by consensus and Russia and China have traditionally protected Myanmar from any action. Myanmar said last week it was negotiating with Russia and China to ensure they blocked any censure by the Security Council over the violence in Rakhine state.  The United Nations  top human rights official earlier this week denounced Myanmar for conducting a  cruel military operation  against the Rohingya, branding it  a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.  Suu Kyi has canceled a trip to the U.N. General Assembly in New York next week to deal with the crisis. Rycroft said two high-level meetings on Myanmar were due to be held during the gathering of world leaders at the United Nations.  The humanitarian situation is catastrophic,  Guterres said.  This is a dramatic tragedy. People are dying and suffering in horrible numbers and we need to stop it.  ",worldnews,"September 13, 2017 ",1
Wife of ex-Uruguay President Mujica becomes vice president,"MONTEVIDEO (Reuters) - Lucia Topolansky, a Uruguay senator and wife of former President  Jose Mujica, became vice president on Wednesday following the resignation of Raul Sendic last weekend over concerns of misuse of public funds. Topolansky, 72, who is the first woman to serve as Uruguay s vice president, was named vice president under provisions of Uruguay s constitution. She said she would aim to liaise between leftist President Tabare Vazquez s administration and Congress.  Like Mujica, Topolansky was a member of the Tupamaros Marxist guerrilla movement in her youth.  The change was expected to have little impact on policy. Since 2005, Uruguay has been ruled by the left-wing Frente Amplio (FA) party, which has mixed progressive social policy, such as legalizing marijuana, with market-friendly regulations. The FA s ethics committee had ruled that Sendic, who headed state oil company Ancap from 2008 to 2009 and from 2010 to 2013, used his company credit card to buy personal items. Uruguay s constitution says Sendic should be replaced by the senator who received the most votes in the last elections, who was Mujica. But Uruguayan law bans presidents from serving a consecutive term as president or vice president. As the senator with the second-biggest number of votes, Topolansky was next in line.

Tunisia parliament approves controversial amnesty for Ben Ali-era corruption,"TUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisia s parliament on Wednesday approved a controversial law granting amnesty to officials accused of corruption during the rule of autocrat Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, triggering angry protests from the opposition and activists outside. Opposition lawmakers sang the national anthem and shouted slogans before the session was temporarily suspended. Outside,  dozens of demonstrators chanted  This law will not pass  and  Whitewash corruption . The law was approved by 117 deputies. The opposition withdrew from the session in protest against the insistence of the ruling coalition on passing the law in an extraordinary session.  I congratulate you on the return of the dictatorial state and reconciliation with the corrupt,  Ahmed Seddik a deputy of the Popular Front said.   Tunisians will not forgive you , he added. After months of protests, the bill was amended from an original draft which would have also granted amnesty to corrupt businessmen. As it stands, they will be liable to prosecution for crimes committed during Ben Ali s 24-year rule. Witnesses said police beat protesters who had shouted slogans against the President and the ruling parties Ennahda and Nidaa Tounes which supported the law.  The opposition no longer has a pretext, they resorted to  unacceptable methods. They rejected democracy , Sofian Toubel a lawmaker of Nidaa Tounes said. Critics of the so-called  Economic Reconciliation  Law say it is a step back from the spirit of Tunisia s 2011 revolution to oust Ben Ali, who fled after weeks of protests against  corruption and inequality.  This law is an advanced stage of counter-revolution,  opposition lawmaker Ammar Amroussia said. But government officials say the law helps to turn the page on the past, improves the climate for investment and gives confidence to the administration and officials.  The time has come to stop the isolation of those officials who could contribute to the building of the new Tunisia,  said  Mohamed Souf of the governing Nidaa Tounes party.  We must reconcile, as happened in South Africa and Rwanda.  The bill was proposed by President Beji Caid Essebsi, himself a former Ben Ali official, and sent to parliament in 2015. But debate was postponed after criticism that the original bill benefited business elites tied to the government. At Wednesday s session, tensions flared between the ruling coalition and the opposition lawmakers, who said the Supreme Judicial Council had not yet given its answer after being consulted by the parliament on the legality of the bill. Despite the consensus between secular and Islamist parties that helped the country s transition toward democracy, the bill has divided Tunisians between those who want to draw a line under the past and those who say they must deal with past graft.  Since the 2011 uprising, Tunisia has been held up by Western partners as a model of democracy for the region. Economic progress has lagged, though, and corruption remains a major problem in the North African state. ",worldnews,"September 13, 2017 ",1
Spain calls Catalan mayors for questioning on independence vote,"MADRID (Reuters) - Spain s state prosecutor has summoned more than 700 Catalan mayors who have backed an independence referendum, in an escalation of Madrid s efforts to block the vote that it has declared illegal.  Officials engaging in any preparations for the vote could be charged with civil disobedience, abuse of office and misuse of public funds, the prosecutor said in a letter delivered to local authorities on Wednesday.  If the mayors do not answer the summons, police should arrest them, it added. One mayor said the legal move was unprecedented.  We don t think any European country has ever tried to make more than 700 mayors testify,  said Neus Lloveras, mayor of Vilanova i la Geltru near Barcelona, head of the Association of Municipalities for Independence (AMI).   We have nothing to hide. When we have to go and testify, we will say everything we have been saying for days, that we owe it to our people to keep working to make sure they can freely express themselves at the ballot box,  he told reporters. But the small, anti-capitalist CUP group, which governs 19 Catalan municipalities, said it would not answer the summons, and called on other political forces to do the same.      Catalonia s regional parliament passed laws last week to prepare for a referendum on Oct. 1. Spain s Constitutional Court suspended the vote after Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy challenged it in the courts.  Judges are now considering whether the legislation contravenes Spain s constitution, which states that the country is indivisible. So far, 712 of a total 948 municipal leaders have said they would allow public spaces to be used for the referendum, according to AMI. The mayor of Barcelona - the region s most populous area - has yet to take a definitive position, and has asked for reassurances that civil servants involved in the process will not risk losing their jobs. The website set up by the Catalan government to give information on the vote, referendum.cat, stopped working on Wednesday evening, with Spanish media reporting that the regional prosecutor had ordered all websites promoting the referendum to be shut down. Civil Guard police confirmed that they had gone to deliver a warrant at the website s offices, but declined to say if judges had ordered it to be closed. Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont quickly posted two new web addresses on Twitter linking to a page with information on the referendum. Polls show a minority of Catalans want self-rule, although a majority want the chance to vote on the issue. Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets of Barcelona this week to show support for independence.  In a separate order, the Constitutional Court told regional government officials on Wednesday they had 48 hours to show how they were preventing the vote from going ahead.

Factbox: About 4.2 million still without power in U.S. Southeast after Irma,"(Reuters) - Some 4.2 million homes and businesses, or about 9 million people, were without power Wednesday afternoon in Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas after Hurricane Irma battered the region, down from a peak of more than 7.8 million customers on Monday, local utilities said. Most of the remaining outages were in Florida Power & Light s service area in the southern and eastern parts of the state. FPL, the state s biggest power company, said about 1.9 million had no power on Wednesday, down from more than 3.6 million on Monday. NextEra Energy Inc-owned FPL, which serves nearly 5 million homes and businesses, expects to restore essentially all its customers in the eastern portion of Florida by the weekend and the harder-hit western portion of the state by Sept. 22. It will take longer to restore those with tornado damage or severe flooding, FPL said. Outages at Duke Energy Corp, which serves the northern and central parts of Florida, fell to 922,000 on Wednesday, down from a peak of about 1.2 million on Monday, according to the company s website. Irma hit southwestern Florida on Sunday morning as a Category 4 storm, the second most severe on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale. On Monday it weakened to a tropical depression. In Georgia, utilities reported that outages declined to about 550,000 on Wednesday, down from a peak of around 1.3 million on Monday. Other big power utilities in Florida are units of Emera Inc and Southern Co, which also operates the biggest electric companies in Georgia and Alabama. ",worldnews,"September 13, 2017 ",1
Angola's opposition loses appeal to annul election result,"LUANDA (Reuters) - Angola s Constitutional Court rejected on Wednesday an appeal by the largest opposition party to annul the results of last month s election, which gave a landslide victory to the ruling MPLA party. In a 38 page court document, the Constitutional Court said the evidence presented by The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) did not prove there were any irregularities or biases in the electoral process. The ruling is final and cannot be appealed. A spokesperson for UNITA said the party did not have any immediate comment. The People s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) won the Aug 23 vote with 61 percent, with UNITA second on 27 percent. UNITA had argued that in multiple provinces the results presented by the National Electoral Commission differed considerably from their own tally, alleging the results were not the product of local vote counting but were instead centrally engineered. The Constitutional Court dismissed this argument, saying the polling station tallies presented by UNITA did not show any bias against the party.  ",worldnews,"September 13, 2017 ",1
"Niger, Mali leaders seek funding for new anti-jihadist force","NIAMEY (Reuters) - Mali and Niger, two of the West African nations worst affected by jihadist violence, appealed on Wednesday for international funding for a regional force they have set up to counter Islamist insurgencies. Mali s President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita and Niger s Mahamadou Issoufou said the force assembled by the G5 Sahel bloc   Mali, Mauritania, Burkina Faso, Niger and Chad   was crucial to fighting a threat that went well beyong their borders.  We bring this combat against terrorism not only to protect our own people and countries but for the whole world,  Issoufou told a news conference in Niger s capital Niamey.   For terrorism knows no border. It will go to Europe, it will go to the United States,  he said.  The world has to be mobilized.  The idea of the G5 force was first dreamed up in 2015, but only in July last year did the countries set it up. It is expected to comprise around 5,000 troops. French President Emmanuel Macron has said he expects it to be operational by the autumn. Islamist groups, some with links to al Qaeda, seized Mali s desert north in 2012. French-led forces scattered them the following year but they still attack peacekeepers, soldiers and civilian targets in Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso and Ivory Coast.  Issoufou said a multinational force in the Lake Chad region, including soldiers from Niger, Nigeria, Chad and Cameroon, had had some success against Islamist Boko Haram militants, but that this was financed by Africa s biggest economy, Nigeria, whereas no country in the G5 had sufficient resources.  It is important that the international community takes note of this and gets together to give us resources to ensure our mission can be accomplished,  he said. Analysts see the G5 force as the basis of an eventual exit strategy for around 4,000 French troops deployed to the region on counter-insurgency missions, mostly in Mali.  We have only limited means, but if we mutualize our power, our sovereign elements will have more force, more vitality than we imagine,  Malian President Keita said. Issoufou said the force would be divided into three deployments across the Sahel region: an eastern one consisting of Chadian and Nigerien forces, a central one with forces from Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso, and a Western one with troops from Mali and Mauritania.

"Kurds will find it hard to implement independence, says Iraqi foreign minister","CAIRO (Reuters) - Iraqi Kurdish leaders must be prepared to face the consequences if they unilaterally declare independence and find implementation more difficult than they expected, Iraqi Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari said on Wednesday. Jaafari was in Cairo for an Arab League summit where the closing statement included a resolution calling a Kurdish independence referendum this month unconstitutional, mirroring the stance of Iraq s central government and national parliament. Jaafari told Reuters in an interview Kurdish leaders should think carefully before going ahead with any independence move.  Those who make such a declaration should bear the responsibility for it. It is easy to declare whatever you want but it is not that easy to actualize it,  he said in his Cairo hotel room.  We are depending on dialogue and also Arab, and non-Arab advocacy. As we saw yesterday, the Arab diplomatic mobilization was attained by Arab foreign ministers,  he said. The Kurdish area of northern Iraq has enjoyed broad autonomy since the first Gulf War in 1991. Since the 2003 U.S-led invasion and the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, it has been largely stable while the rest of Iraq has suffered insurgency. Kurds are set to hold the referendum on Sept. 25 but Baghdad opposes it, with lawmakers voting to reject it. Iraq s neighbors   Turkey, Iran and Syria    also oppose the referendum, fearing it could fan separatism among their own ethnic Kurdish populations. Western powers are concerned a plebiscite in Iraq s semi-autonomous Kurdish region - including the oil-rich city of Kirkuk - could divert attention from the war against Islamic State militants. Kurds have sought an independent state since at least the end of World War One, when colonial powers divided up the Middle East after the collapse of the multi-ethnic Ottoman Empire. Iraq is in the final throws of a U.S.-backed campaign to oust the Sunni militant groups which seized vast swathes of the country back in 2014. Iraqi forces took back its second largest city, Mosul in July, and Tal Afar last month. Jaafari said the international community must offer financial and other support to Iraq for the rebuilding of Mosul and other cities retaken from Islamic State.  It is well known that nations who have emerged from war and destruction suffer great losses especially if the opposing party is implementing a scorched earth policy. (They) never surrendered land except after destroying it,  he said.  Homes, institutions, hospitals mosques, markets and worship places, all were destroyed. The money needed is not little, a great sum is required.  ",worldnews,"September 13, 2017 ",1
Pakistan kicks out medical charity MSF from country's tribal region,"PESHAWAR/ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (Reuters) - Pakistan on Wednesday told medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres  (MSF) to stop work and leave its impoverished tribal areas that border Afghanistan, the health organization said, ending its 14 year stay in the volatile region. MSF works out of two health facilities in the Kurram district of Pakistan s Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) region, which has been plagued by militancy over the past decade and was the location of many U.S. drone strikes targeting commanders from al Qaeda and other militant groups. Though security has improved in FATA in recent years, sectarian militant attacks, primarily targeting Shi ite Muslims, still occur. Twin blasts in the Kurram s most populous town, Parachinar killed more than 75 people in June.  Local officials say MSF provides essential healthcare facilities in FATA, an area with some of Pakistan s poorest healthcare and lowest literacy rates.  We have been asked to close our medical activities in Kurram Agency,  MSF said in a statement to the media, adding that Pakistan had refused to issue a No Objection Certificate (NOC) for the charity to work in the tribal areas.   MSF is saddened by the decision from the authorities responsible for NGOs working in Kurram Agency. The closure brings to and end 14 years of MSF working with the FATA Health Services in Kurram Agency,  country representative Catherine Moody said in the statement.   Foreign nationals and organizations working in Pakistan require NOCs to operate in certain areas. Pakistani NGOs and journalists also face restrictions when working in the tribal areas.  MSF provides diagnosis and treatment facilities to the community for Leishmaniasis, immunization for children, as well ... responding to emergencies, disease outbreaks and mass casualties,  the organization said.  The region s health directorate did not respond to requests for comment but Dr. Mohammad Ishaq, who works there, said MSF was asked to leave because they did not have a valid NOC.   I personally think MSF was doing a great job for the patients in FATA,  he said, adding that he did not know why its license to work there was revoked.   We have been working in FATA since 2004. We were never denied an NOC in  the past. This will affect many patients in the area,  one MSF employee said, asking not to be identified. He added that the organization had 70 staff members working at the two health facilities.  The official who notified MSF that their operations would need to be shut down added:  I did what I was directed to by my bosses in Peshawar but really don t know the reason behind MSF being stopped.

In a statement, the 15-member council  expressed concern about reports of excessive violence during the security operations and called for immediate steps to end the violence in Rakhine, de-escalate the situation, re-establish law and order, ensure the protection of civilians.

"Canada stalls on Mali mission, could hit Security Council bid","ST. JOHN S, Newfoundland (Reuters) - Canada on Wednesday indicated it would again put off a decision on contributing troops to a U.N. peace operation in Mali, upsetting allies who said the new delay could undermine Canada s effort to obtain a seat on the Security Council. The Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last year said it would consider sending troops to Mali but has taken months longer than predicted to make up its mind amid fears soldiers would die. Allies had expected an announcement before Canada hosts a peacekeeping conference in November but in a Toronto Star  interview published on Wednesday, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan said the decision would not be made by then. Unhappy diplomatic sources from three nations said the delay could harm Canada s efforts to expand its influence in the United Nations, a body that the previous Conservative government treated with suspicion.  If you want a seat on the Security Council, not being active at the U.N. isn t helpful,  said one of the sources, who declined to be identified given the sensitivity of the situation. The United Nations has deployed some 10,000 peacekeepers to Mali to help deal with Islamist militants. Officials say sending Canadian troops to Mali would inevitably result in casualties, which could prove politically unpopular. Canada lost 158 troops in a 10-year stint in Afghanistan - more per capita than any other nation.  Being a serious player at the United Nations means not always choosing the safe option,  said a second diplomatic source. Trudeau came to power in 2015 and declared  Canada is back,  stressing the need for a more progressive foreign policy. As part of the effort to rebuild ties at the United Nations, Canada said it would commit up to 600 soldiers for possible U.N. deployment, and pressed for one of the Security Council s 10 non-permanent seats. Trudeau said on Wednesday that several hundred Canadian troops were taking part in international operations in Latvia, Iraq and Ukraine.   We are serious about re-engaging with United Nations peace operations but ... we need to make sure we re doing it right,  he told reporters. Trudeau, who spoke on the margins of a Cabinet retreat in St. John s, Newfoundland, is due to go to the United Nations next week and address the General Assembly.  Canada is there to help, as always, and that is the message I will be bringing,  he said when asked whether the Security Council bid would suffer. ",worldnews,"September 13, 2017 ",1
Colombia sees peace with ELN rebels harder than FARC,"BOGOTA (Reuters) - Negotiating peace with Colombia s largest active rebel group, the ELN, will be tougher than the recent successful talks with FARC guerrillas due to the ELN s diffuse chain of command and radical ideology, the chief government negotiator said.  President Juan Manuel Santos  administration and the National Liberation Army (ELN) in February began negotiations in neighboring Ecuador that seek to end the role the group has played in a five-decade conflict that has left over 220,000 dead and millions displaced.  Even though both sides have agreed to begin a three-month bilateral ceasefire from October, the road to a definitive peace accord will be long and complex, Santos  negotiator, Juan Camilo Restrepo, told Reuters late on Tuesday.   It s a highly radical, ideological group that totally lacks the pragmatism to negotiate that the FARC had,  Restrepo, a 70-year-old former minister, said in the study of his Bogota apartment. The Santos government signed a peace deal with the larger Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) in 2016 after negotiations in Havana, Cuba that lasted four years.  Restrepo, a former finance minister, said the ELN s fractured chains of command, plus its greater urban support, were further complications.  All those reasons indicate the negotiation with the ELN is more difficult,  he said.  Inspired by the Cuban revolution and the Liberation Theology of the Catholic priests that founded it in the 1960s, the 2,000-strong ELN has sought peace before, holding talks in Cuba and Venezuela between 2002 and 2007. Both collapsed with little progress.  The ELN is considered a terrorist group by the United States and European Union for engaging in kidnapping, assassinations, drug trafficking, attacks on economic infrastructure and extortion of oil and mining multinationals. Pablo Beltran, the ELN s chief negotiator in Ecuador, has denied there is a weak chain of command and told Reuters last month that the group is united.  During the ceasefire planned from Oct. 1, the ELN has pledged to suspend hostage taking, attacks on roads and oil installations, the use of landmines and the recruitment of minors. In turn, the government agreed to improve protection for community leaders and conditions for about 450 jailed rebels.  There s optimism but not overflowing optimism,  said Restrepo, who returns to the negotiating table in Ecuadorean capital Quito in the next few weeks.  The official warned that although Colombia s military will avoid confrontations with the ELN during the ceasefire, it will go after the group if it engages in criminal activities like illegal mining and drug trafficking.  Such behavior will be repressed with all the strength of the armed forces,  he said. ",worldnews,"September 13, 2017 ",1
Utilities in U.S. Southeast restore power to nearly half hit by Irma,"(Reuters) - Utilities in the U.S. Southeast returned power to almost half of the homes and businesses knocked out by Hurricane Irma, leaving about 4.3 million customers in the dark as of midday Wednesday, in one of the biggest restoration efforts in U.S. history.   The total number of customers still out, representing about 9 million people in Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas, dipped from a peak of more than 7.8 million customers, or over 16 million people, on Monday. Major utilities in Florida - including NextEra Energy Inc s Florida Power & Light (FPL), Duke Energy Corp and Emera Inc s Tampa Electric - have mobilized tens of thousands of workers to deal with the outages after Irma landed early Sunday and carved a destructive path up Florida, which has a population of about 20.6 million. FPL, the state s largest utility, said its outages dropped to around 1.9 million customers on Wednesday from a peak of more than 3.6 million on Monday. Some Florida utilities, including FPL, warned customers it could take weeks to restore power in the hardest hit areas. FPL said on Tuesday it planned to restore power to eastern Florida by this weekend and to western Florida by Sept. 22. Irma, categorized as one of the most powerful Atlantic storms on record when it rampaged through the Caribbean, has killed at least 77 people, including 36 in the United States, officials said. FPL said on Wednesday it had provided power to some parts of a nursing home where people died after the facility lost electricity during Irma and that the home was not on a list   critical facilities  prioritized for emergency power restoration.  Parts of the facility itself were energized by FPL, I can t give you anything more specific than that at this point,  FPL spokesman Rob Gould told a news conference. Two elderly residents were found dead at the Rehabilitation Center of Hollywood Hills and three later died at a hospital. FPL, like other utilities, follows a plan to restore power to the largest number of customers as quickly as possible. FPL said after repairing any damage to its power plants and the lines that carry electricity from the generating facilities, the company next restores  critical facilities,  like hospitals, police and fire stations, communication facilities, water treatment plants, transportation providers and shelters. About 150 of Florida s nearly 700 nursing facilities do not have power restored, according to the Florida Health Care Association, an advocacy group representing facilities statewide. Locations without power have been flagged to the state to help utilities prioritize their work, the group said in a statement.  The loss of these individuals is a profound tragedy within the larger tragedy of Hurricane Irma,  the association said in a statement. Irma hit southwestern Florida on Sunday morning as a Category 4 storm, the second most severe on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale. It had weakened to a tropical depression on Monday. More than 60,000 workers from across the United States and Canada were involved in the restoration efforts, including those from the affected companies and other utilities, according to the Edison Electric Institute, an industry trade group.

Florida nursing home where deaths occurred was not on priority list: utility,"(Reuters) - Florida Power & Light said on Wednesday it had provided power to part of a nursing home that housed six residents who died after the facility lost electricity due to Hurricane Irma, adding that it was not on a county priority list for emergency power restoration.    Parts of the facility itself were energized by FPL, I can t give you anything more specific than that at this point,  FPL spokesman Rob Gould told a news conference, referring to the  Rehabilitation Center of Hollywood Hills.  Two elderly residents were found dead at the nursing home, and four later died at a hospital. Police opened a criminal investigation at the nursing home in Broward County, which is north of Miami.  Some residents were evacuated on early Sunday morning and some woke up feeling sick at the center, which had been without air conditioning, Broward County Mayor Barbara Sharief said.  Gould said FPL met with Broward County officials in March before the storm season to discuss what facilities would be prioritized for power restoration this year.   They identified which facilities were to be critical top infrastructure facilities, this was not one of them,  he said about the Hollywood Hills center.  Broward County officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  FPL, a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Inc, has said earlier this week that the company prioritizes restoring power to critical facilities such as hospitals, police and fire stations, communications centers, water treatment plants, transportation and shelter.   Gould said the incident at Hollywood Hills emphasizes that all facilities need to have backup plans in case power is lost during storms.  Memorial Regional Hospital, a facility across from the nursing home, was identified as a top priority by the county and had power, Gould said. Florida has more than 680 nursing homes that house about 73,000 residents, the Florida Health Care Association said.    ",worldnews,"September 13, 2017 ",1

Suicide bomb near cricket stadium in Afghan capital kills at least three,"KABUL (Reuters) - A suicide bomber blew himself up at a checkpoint near the main cricket stadium in the Afghan capital Kabul on Wednesday, killing at least three people as a tournament was under way, officials said. Interior Ministry spokesman Najib Danesh said two police and one civilian were killed and five people wounded. Local Tolo News Television quoted the Afghan Cricket Board as saying all players were safe. The blast outside Kabul International Cricket Stadium took place during a match in Afghanistan s Shpageeza Cricket League, a T20 franchise tournament on the lines of the Indian Premier League and similar 20-over tournaments. A statement in Bosnian on Islamic State s Amaq news agency said a suicide attack had been carried out on members of the Afghan security forces in Kabul ,  although it was not immediately clear whether the statement referred to the same incident. The Shpageeza tournament, now in its fifth season, is one of a small number of Western-style sports competitions along with Afghan Premier League football that have grown up since a U.S.-led campaign toppled the Taliban in 2001. A small number of foreign players are also taking part in the competition. Cricket, which spread from refugee camps in Pakistan, has become one of Afghanistan s most popular sports and the national team has become increasingly successful, raising the profile of the game.

"Guinean forces kill one, wound several in bauxite mining town riot","CONAKRY (Reuters) - At least one person was killed and several wounded when Guinean security forces opened fire to break up a riot in the bauxite mining hub of Boke, witnesses said on Wednesday. Boke has suffered waves of rioting rooted in a perceived failure of mining to raise living standards, despite 15 million tonnes of aluminum ore being extracted annually by the West African nation s largest mining companies Societe Miniere de Boke (SMB) and Companie Bauxite de Guinee (CBG). Rioters on Wednesday pillaged a gendarmerie post and set fire to a security forces vehicle, before Guinean forces opened fire to push them back. They also blocked streets to prevent mine workers from going to work, although SMB said its basic operations were still in order.  We feel the tension has increased somewhat,  Frederic Bouzigues, general manager of SMB, told Reuters.  Many of our employees have not been able to get back to work and this affects us even if our essential operations are not blocked.    Guinea sits on about a third of the world s bauxite, but it remains one of the world s poorest countries, and unemployment around mining sites is not significantly lower than in other places. Residents of Boke protested this week over electricity shortages, another major gripe of residents. The government said calm had now been restored, after two days of demonstrations.  I saw one person dead at the hospital,  witness Mamadou Diallo told Reuters by telephone.  It was a young man of 25 years. I saw about twenty people wounded,  he added. Similar riots at the end of April paralyzed Boke, and youths trashed several government buildings before being pushed back by security forces firing live rounds, also killing at least one protester.  It was a difficult situation but we took steps to restore calm,  government spokesman Damantang Albert Camara said by telephone. Boke residents complain that while seeing none of the wealth from mining, they still suffer associated problems such as pollution from dust blowing off the back of trucks.

Transylvanian dream: Juncker's antidote to 'Brexit nightmare',"STRASBOURG (Reuters) - Transylvania may not seem everyone s idea of a fun weekend away to get over a painful break-up but that is Jean-Claude Juncker s prescription for EU leaders to cope with the blues on the day Britain walks out. Sibiu, the picturesque historic home of Romania s ethnic Germans, will be just the place for the other 27 national leaders to make a public show of unity on Saturday, March 30, 2019, the European Commission president told EU lawmakers on Wednesday in his annual State of the European Union address. His proposals for a more united bloc without Britain face scepticism from many governments. But the EU s chief executive has, officials said, calculated that expanding the euro zone and deepening its cooperation can win support from Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron, leaders of the founding powers France and Germany, and heal rifts with newer, poorer members in the east. His mention of Brexit brought cheers from UK Independence Party members in Strasbourg. They scoffed at Juncker s warning that Britons would soon regret leaving and said UKIP would look forward to that weekend 18 months hence to celebrate Britain s  liberation  from what they call EU diktat from Brussels. But aides say Juncker believes many of the 440 million other Europeans will only truly wake up to the fact the second-ranked economy is leaving pretty much around when it actually happens.  And to reassure them at what Juncker said would be  a very sad and tragic moment , their leaders should plan a get-together in Romania, one of the newest, and poorest member states, which just happens to be the rotating chair of the EU in early 2019. A rich cultural heritage   Juncker noted that German-speakers like himself know it as Hermannstadt, capital of Transylvania s centuries-old Saxon community   makes Sibiu a good spot to celebrate the Union of Europe s diverse peoples.  The whole idea on that day is to focus on...matters to come for the Union, not on the ones who are leaving,  one senior EU official said of the Sibiu summit, which was welcomed by Romanian President Klaus Ioannis, a former mayor of the city. And if hostile British commentators might be tempted to link the Transylvanian venue to a view of the EU as a bloodsucking vampire on the British taxpayer, Romanian locals insist their town has little to do with the region s Dracula legend. Aside from altering the atmospherics of what will certainly be a historic weekend for the European Union, the success of Juncker s vision for Sibiu in 2019 will depend on how national leaders respond to the proposals he sketched out on Wednesday. Most strikingly, the former Luxembourg premier who will step down in autumn 2019, wants to use the departure of the Union s opter-out-in-chief, Britain, to end a culture of states picking and choosing which bits of integration they want - for themselves and others - and to bring all 27 or more nations in to the euro currency zone, Schengen travel area and bank union. In a speech that carefully balanced indirect criticisms and praise for different leaders across the bloc, he slapped down Macron s embryonic proposals for a separate euro zone budget and plans to push ahead with deeper integration that could leave non-euro countries, especially in the east, on the EU s fringes. The German government, preparing for an election in two weeks that should hand Merkel a fourth term, is skeptical of Macron s plans but is also likely to be wary of the ambition of Juncker s proposals. Its initial reaction was restrained. EU officials, however, play down the idea that Juncker is making for a head-on confrontation with Merkel and Macron when he sets his face against a  multispeed Europe  that the veteran EU dealmaker believes bears the seeds of the EU s unraveling. Rather, Juncker sees his idea of a euro zone covering the whole EU, with its budget part of the overall EU budget and run from the existing Commission, as a practical application of the kind of suggestions Macron and Merkel seem to support but on which their administrations have offered little concrete detail. At the same time, EU officials argue, past attempts by Paris and Berlin to force a lead on integration, such as by Merkel and then president Nicolas Sarkozy at the height of the euro zone crisis in 2011, failed to gain traction. Juncker, they say, will try to persuade them that his broader approach is more viable. Nonetheless, his suggestion that the likes of Poland and Hungary, run by deeply eurosceptic governments, should join the strictures of the euro zone is unlikely to win rapid support in Warsaw or Budapest. Juncker s argument is, however, that if they refuse offers and pressure to join, they cannot then complain about being treated as  second class  members of the Union. Juncker, 62, said he had despaired of the EU at times but wants Sibiu to offer EU voters something other than Brexit to wake up to, two months before a European Parliament election. The biggest challenge to achieving his long list of ambitions by then will be overcoming entrenched national interests:  Democracy is about compromise,  he said in a blunt warning to the squabbling leaders he wants to come together in Transylvania.  Europe cannot function without compromise.  ",worldnews,"September 13, 2017 ",1
Central African Republic defense minister sacked amid growing violence," ((This Sept. 12 story corrects name of sacked minister in paragraph 2)) BANGUI (Reuters) - Central African Republic president Faustin-Archange Touadera sacked his defense minister on Tuesday evening, according to a state radio broadcast, amid growing violence that threatens to spin the country out of control. The dismissal of Joseph Yakete was part of a wider Cabinet reshuffle. The statement did not say if his dismissal was related directly to growing violence.  Thousands have died and a fifth of Central Africans have fled a conflict that broke out after mainly Muslim Seleka rebels ousted President Francois Bozize in 2013, provoking a backlash from Christian anti-balaka militias. Although unrest has since subsided, fighting has spiked this year and the United Nations warned this month that ethnic fighting could descend again into a much larger conflict if combatants are not disarmed. National security forces are too weak to tackle armed groups and counter the spillover from conflicts in neighboring countries, said the United Nations. In a sign of the deteriorating security situation, six Red Cross volunteers were killed in an attack on a health center in southeastern Central African Republic on Aug. 3, the aid organization said last month.

"Facing potential wheat crisis, Egypt plays down poppy seed risk","CAIRO (Reuters) - Poppy seeds found in two cargoes of imported wheat halted by Egyptian authorities are  not very dangerous , Agriculture Minister Abdel Moneim Al-Banna told Reuters on Wednesday, in comments that could avert a trade row. Al-Banna said the cargoes from France and Romania would be sieved before a decision was taken on whether to allow them into the country.   The world s biggest wheat buyer has panicked global suppliers in recent weeks by referring the two cargoes to its public prosecutor for containing what it said were drug-producing poppy seeds. The prosecutor has yet to issue a final decision on whether the wheat should be re-exported. Supplier Transgrain France and the French embassy in Cairo sent letters to state-buyer GASC arguing that the strand of poppy, papaver rhoeas, in the wheat was a harmless variety not used in opium production and commonly found in wheat fields. Banna s comments are the first by an Egyptian official to take a similar view. He said the seeds were  not very dangerous , and that  there is still a study that has not been completed to determine whether to re-export it to the country of origin or use it after the sieving.  GASC later said it had determined that the seeds present in the Romanian cargo were not harmful as per an agriculture quarantine report and that it would be sieved.  The poppy seeds found on the Romanian vessel according to a report that was signed by the head of the agriculture quarantine are not of the harmful opiate kind. The procedure therefore is sieving,  GASC Vice Chairman Ahmed Youssef told Reuters. Traders are watching closely, and have said that any rejection could lead them to boycott the state s massive tenders, protesting what they describe as excessive inspection measures that have made doing business increasingly risky.  All suppliers will wait and see what will happen,  said one Cairo-based trader. In a similar trade row last year, Egypt temporarily banned any trace of ergot, a common grain fungus, in cargoes. That move halted the country s billion-dollar grain trade after suppliers said the zero-tolerance level was impossible to guarantee. GASC expects to buy about 7 million tonnes of wheat in the fiscal year that began last July in order to supply a bread subsidy program relied on by tens of millions of Egyptians. Inspectors from Egypt s agriculture quarantine service have slammed a food inspection system launched this year that was intended to streamline trade following the ergot dispute. They say the new system, which ends the process of sending Egyptian inspectors abroad to check on grain, has allowed harmful contaminants to enter the country. They successfully challenged the system in court, but a verdict to suspend it has not been implemented and is being appealed.  We are being exposed to the biggest campaign to enter the largest quantities possible of poor quality wheat into Egypt and to make it the wastebasket of the world,  a quarantine inspector said.

"U.N.'s Guterres calls on Myanmar to end violence, urges aid","UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Wednesday called on authorities in Myanmar to end violence against the majority-Buddhist country s Rohingya Muslims and acknowledged the situation there is best described as ethnic cleansing. The humanitarian situation in Myanmar was  catastrophic,  Guterres said, and called on all countries to do what they could to supply aid.  I call on the Myanmar authorities to suspend military action, end the violence, uphold the rule of law and recognize the right of return of all those who had to leave the country,  Guterres said at a news conference. Pressure has been mounting on Myanmar to end violence that has sent about 370,000 Rohingya Muslims fleeing to Bangladesh, with the United States calling for protection of civilians and Bangladesh urging safe zones to enable refugees to go home. Asked if the situation could be described as ethnic cleansing, Guterres replied:  Well I would answer your question with another question: When one-third of the Rohingya population had to flee the country, could you find a better word to describe it?    The secretary-general also said he has spoken to Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar s national leader, several times.  This is a dramatic tragedy. People are dying and suffering at horrible numbers and we need to stop it. That is my main concern,  he said. Suu Kyi canceled a trip to the upcoming U.N. General Assembly to deal with the crisis, her office said on Wednesday. The U.N. Security Council is to meet on Wednesday behind closed doors for the second time since the crisis erupted. British U.N. Ambassador Matthew Rycroft said he hoped there would be a public statement agreed by the council. The government of Myanmar, also known as Burma, says its security forces are fighting Rohingya militants behind a surge of violence in Rakhine state that began on Aug. 25, and they are doing all they can to avoid harming civilians. The government says about 400 people have been killed in the fighting, the latest in the western state. The U.N. s top human rights official earlier this week denounced Myanmar for conducting a  cruel military operation  against the Rohingya, branding it  a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.

Rape cases fuel anti-migrant angst in Italy ahead of election,"ROME (Reuters) - Rape allegations leveled against foreigners are fuelling anti-immigrant sentiment in Italy ahead of elections due early next year, when migration is likely to top the political agenda. Anti-immigration politicians have leapt on the crimes to ram home their message that the center-left government has been lax on border controls, allowing more than 600,000 migrants, mainly Africans, to enter the country over the past four years.  There are too many of them. I will send quite a few home,  Matteo Salvini, the head of the rightist Northern League, wrote on Twitter this week after police said a Bangladeshi man had been arrested in Rome on suspicion of raping a Finnish au pair. The Rome case came two weeks after a young Polish tourist said she was gang raped by four Africans, three of them aged under 18, on a beach in the Adriatic resort of Rimini. The woman s partner was badly beaten by the youths and a Peruvian transsexual said she was raped and assaulted by the same quartet later the same night. The leader of the gang was named as a Congolese asylum-seeker who had been allowed to stay in Italy on humanitarian grounds. The other three were Moroccan brothers aged 15 and 17, who were born in Italy, and a 16-year-old Nigerian.  A gang of Maghreb worms,  said Georgia Meloni, head of the rightist Brothers of Italy party, which is expected to be allied with the Northern League and Silvio Berlusconi s Forza Italia (Go Italy!) party at the election. An opinion poll in la Repubblica newspaper on Wednesday showed 46 percent of Italians thought migrants represented a threat to their personal safety and to public order against 40 percent in the last such survey in February. Five years ago the figure stood at just 26 percent. Opposition parties say the government cannot ignore the issue, pointing to official data showing that in the first seven months of the year 1,534 Italians were arrested or accused of rape compared with 904 foreigners suspected of the same crime.  Some 40 percent of rapes are being committed by foreigners who make up 8 percent of the population. You can t sweep this under a carpet,  said Deborah Bergamini, a lawmaker with Forza Italia.  The influx of migrants is having major consequences.  Though Italy was a colonial power in Africa in the 19th and 20th centuries and migrants have come to Italy for decades, the country mainly served as a transit route for the rest of Europe and so remains an overwhelmingly white country. However, EU migration policy means that increasing numbers of would-be asylum seekers are having to stay to secure residency permits, meaning many more Africans and refugees from the Middle East are trying to make Italy their home. Rising public concern over the inflows is starting to affect government policy-making, with the ruling center-left Democratic Party on Tuesday freezing a long-promised bill that would have granted citizenship to the children of immigrants. Some 70 percent of Italians backed the measure earlier this year, but support has now plummeted to just 52 percent, according to the la Repubblica survey. Interior Minister Marco Minniti has also intervened to stem the flow of migrants.  I feared for democracy in this country,  Minniti said last month, explaining why, after months of a de-facto, open-door policy, the government finally introduced measures aimed at preventing people from leaving Libya for Italy. Over the past 2-1/2 months, the number of migrants reaching Italy has fallen 70 percent from the same period a year ago to some 16,500, but the rape cases have ensured that media headlines have remained highly negative about the newcomers.     German media were accused last year of initially ignoring allegations of sex assaults by migrants at New Year festivities in Cologne in order not to fuel anti-foreigner sentiment. The Italian media has no such hesitancy.  First poverty, now they bring us disease,  a front page headline in Libero daily said this month when an Italian child died of malaria just days after she had shared a hospital ward with two African children suffering the same illness. Malaria is transmitted by mosquitoes and cannot be passed person-to-person. It was eradicated from Italy in 1970 and doctors do not know how the girl, who had never been abroad, caught the disease. Cecile Kashetu Kyenge, a Congolese-born European parliamentarian with the ruling Democratic Party, says those sorts of headlines show how racism is on the rise.  The newspapers turn migrants into the enemies of Italy and people start to believe this nonsense,  said Kyenge, a former minister who receives regular racist abuse on social media.  Racism is used as a political weapon and the situation is getting worse. The problem is we are living in a perpetual election campaign and politicians play on peoples  fears.  The Northern League has led the anti-migrant charge with its leader, Salvini, regularly denouncing migrants on Facebook. The party has been rewarded by a jump in support from 6 percent in 2014 to more than 15 percent today, making it the third largest political force in Italy in many opinion polls.  The rise of the Northern League can be put down to the party s anti-migrant stance and Salvini s undoubted ability to play the populist card,  said pollster Renato Mannheimer. He predicted that the issue would continue to predominate.  The economy is a much more important issue, but sadly I think it will take a back seat to immigration in the coming election campaign,  he said. ",worldnews,"September 13, 2017 ",1
Rights groups ask China to stop detaining its critics,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Human rights activists called on China on Wednesday to stop detaining lawyers and critics, voicing concern for their health and fate in custody after the death of jailed Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo attracted international attention in July. China said the concerns had no basis in fact. The activists highlighted the case of Jiang Tianyong, a prominent human rights lawyer disbarred in 2009, who disappeared last November and was held incommunicado for six months.  Jiang s verdict is pending on charges of subversion, to which he confessed at a trial last month, saying he had been inspired to overthrow China s political system by workshops he attended overseas.  The trial can be reasonably called neither fair nor impartial. In just the most obvious violation of due process, Mr Jiang was shown in a televised confession on state media in March 2017,  Sarah Brooks of International Service for Human Rights told the United Nations Human Rights Council.  Jiang s physical and psychological health are a subject of great concern, given the real risks of abuse in places of detention,  she said. A Chinese diplomat told the Council that China firmly objected to the accusations about its legal handling of Jiang s and other cases, and said the NGOs should respect Chinese law and give up  outrageous tactics .  Jiang Tianyong is suspected of provoking trouble illegally, holding state secret documents, inciting subversion of the state and other criminal activities. He pleaded guilty,  the diplomat said.  China s treatment of dissidents stirred an outcry this year when Liu Xiaobo, serving an 11-year sentence for  citing subversion of state power , died after being denied permission to leave the country for treatment for late-stage liver cancer. His wife, Liu Xia, has been under house arrest for six years and her whereabouts and condition since his death are unknown, Brooks said.  Ms Liu Xia currently has personal freedom,  the Chinese diplomat told the Council, adding that China had picked the most qualified medical experts to treat Liu Xiaobo and given him medical parole.   Brooks also highlighted the case of Ilham Tohti, declared a case of arbitrary detention by a U.N. panel in 2014, who is serving a life sentence for  separatism . The Chinese diplomat said Ilham s crime was clear.   Ilham s case has nothing to do with human rights. He was trying to justify the acts of terror, divide the country and incite hatred, which no country could tolerate,  she said.  Zhang Qing, the wife of activist Guo Feixiong, told an NGO event in Geneva on Monday that he has suffered after being sentenced to six years in prison in late 2015. He conducted a 101-day hunger strike in 2016 to protest conditions.  Guo has encountered a wide range of brutal and evil torture in jail, such as 13 days and nights of sleep deprivation, high-voltage taser to his private parts to extract a confession,  she said. Guo was a  veteran political prisoner  whose voice had been silenced for demanding reforms, said Zhang, who lives in the United States. Human Rights Watch said this week that Beijing is waging a campaign of harassment against Chinese activists who seek to testify at the U.N. about repression, which it called the worst since the Tiananmen Square democracy movement was crushed. China s foreign ministry dismissed the accusations. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra ad al-Hussein, addressing the Geneva forum on Monday, said that China was drafting its first national law on detention centres, with the aim of improving treatment, oversight and accountability.  Zeid urged the government  to ensure that the law grants access to independent legal counsel and family members, as well as addressing the ill-treatment in detention and deaths in custody .

Turkey will take its own security measures after Russia defense deal: Erdogan,"ANKARA (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday dismissed NATO allies  concern over Turkey s deal to buy a missile defense system from Russia and said Ankara would continue to take the security measures it thought right. Turkey, whose relations with its allies have frayed in recent months, said it opted for the S-400 because Western companies had offered no  financially effective  alternative. But NATO officials have voiced disquiet over the purchase of missiles incompatible with alliance systems.  They went crazy because we made the S-400 agreement. What were we supposed to do, wait for you? We are taking and will take all our measures on the security front,  Erdogan said in a speech in Ankara. Western firms which had bid for the contract included U.S. firm Raytheon (RTN.N), which put in an offer with its Patriot missile defense system. Franco-Italian group Eurosam, owned by the multinational European missile maker MBDA and France s Thales TCFP.PA, came second in the tender. Turkey, with the second-largest army in the alliance, has enormous strategic importance for NATO, abutting as it does Syria, Iraq and Iran. But the relationship has become fractious. Erdogan has been infuriated by Washington s support for  Kurdish YPG fighters in the battle against Islamic State in Syria. Turkey sees the YPG as an extension of the militant Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged a three-decade insurgency in Turkey s largely Kurdish southeast. The U.S. Pentagon said it had expressed concerns to Ankara about the Russian purchase.  A NATO interoperable missile defense system remains the best option to defend Turkey from the full range of threats in its region,  spokesman Johnny Michael said in a statement. France, however, said Turkey s decision was a sovereign choice which did not require comment from NATO allies. France s foreign minister is due to visit Turkey on Thursday. Germany has said it would restrict some arms sales to Turkey, reflecting the diplomatic strain over a security crackdown in Turkey following a failed military coup last year. Berlin had originally sought to freeze major arms sales, but scaled that back after Turkey said that would harm the joint fight against Islamic State. Berlin has criticized mass arrests that followed the failed coup and demanded the release of around a dozen German or Turkish-German citizens arrested in recent months. Turkey originally awarded a $3.4 billion contract for the defense system to China in 2013, but canceled that two years later, saying it would concentrate on developing a system domestically. Turkey later began talks with Russia, and in July Erdogan said the deal had been signed, although negotiations appear to have been drawn out over financing.  Turkish media quoted Erdogan this week as saying he and Russian President Vladimir Putin were determined that the agreement should proceed. ",worldnews,"September 13, 2017 ",1
France says Turkish-Russia missile deal a sovereign decision,"PARIS (Reuters) - France said on Wednesday Turkey s decision to buy a missile defense system from Russia was not cause for comment by NATO allies, remarks that were in contrast to other members that have raised concerns over the deal.   Turkey, whose relations with its allies have frayed in recent months, said it opted for the S-400 because Western companies had offered no  financially effective  alternative. But NATO officials have voiced disquiet over the purchase of missiles incompatible with alliance systems.   The purchase of military equipment by Turkey is a sovereign choice which does not need to be commented (upon) by members of the Atlantic alliance,  Foreign ministry spokeswoman Agnes Romatet-Espagne said in response to a question on whether this was a blow to the alliance. The French comments come a day before the country s foreign minister begins a two-day visit to Turkey, where he will discuss regional issues, promoting support for a new peace initiative on Syria. He will also broach the subject of the arrest of French journalist Loup Bureau, who was seized by Turkish border guards on the frontier with Iraq in early August.  ",worldnews,"September 13, 2017 ",1
Juncker announces new code of conduct for EU executive members,"STRASBOURG, France (Reuters) - Members of the European Commission will have to wait two years before taking up new employment after they quit the EU executive under a new ethical code of conduct proposed by the President of the Commission on Wednesday. Seeking to bolster the public s trust in the EU institutions, Jean-Claude Juncker called for more enforced ethical standards and greater transparency in the Commission. The code of conduct will be enforced from Feb. 1, 2018, and will apply to all current members. This comes after Juncker s predecessor Jose Manuel Barroso caused public uproar after joining U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs to advise it on Brexit, and former Commissioner Neelie Kroes was reprimanded for not declaring income that would effectively have reduced her pension. The  cooling off period  between a Commission term and the start of new employment was extended from 18 months to two years for members and three years for the president.     The code also requires members to declare investments above 10,000 euro ($11,900) and establishes an Independent Ethical Committee to advise on all ethical issues.

German parties fret about Turkish voters as Erdogan makes mark," BERLIN (Reuters) - Nihan Sen s grandmother came to Germany in the 1960s but still speaks no German. By contrast, Nihan herself is a star of German youth culture, with 783,000 followers for her YouTube channel. Yet she acknowledges:  I really do like a bit of Turkish television.   She is not alone. Turkish broadcasters have an 84 percent market share among Germany s three million people of Turkish background, and 40 percent of them watch no German television at all, according to market researcher Data4U.  As a captive audience of television broadcast from Ankara, Germany s Turkish citizens are caught in a tug-of-war for their loyalty ahead of a German national election on Sept. 24.  Turkey s president, Tayyip Erdogan, has called on German voters of Turkish background to reject Germany s mainstream political parties, saying they are  unfriendly to Turkey .  The parties worry that Erdogan has more access to Turkish-speaking German voters than they do.  Green Party co-leader Cem Ozdemir, the most prominent German politician of Turkish descent, has called for Germany s public media to start broadcasting a Turkish channel for the benefit of Turks, both in Germany and in Turkey.   We need a German-Turkish broadcaster,  he told the Rheinische Post newspaper in March.  For years we ve neglected to help people from Turkey find a new political homeland, also politically, and now we re seeing the fruits of that.   Traditionally, Turks in Germany have voted mainly for the Social Democrats or the Greens, the main center-left parties, which are known for being friendly to immigrants. But Erdogan has repeatedly urged them instead to reject both those parties, as well as Merkel s ruling conservatives.  ""The majority, because they only watch Turkish TV, are informed very one-sidedly,"" said Joachim Schulte, head of Data 4U, which specializes in polling Germany's Turks. Schulte believes Erdogan's call could sway 300,000 votes -- a quarter of the Germans of Turkish descent who are eligible to vote.  For now, voters of Turkish descent who turn away from the Social Democrats and Greens have few other choices. Schulte said those who become disaffected are more likely to stay home than back rival parties. But that could still affect the outcome in an election that is likely to be hard fought for every vote.  A change in Germany s citizenship law in 2000 means the number of ethnic Turks with the right to vote has nearly doubled over the past decade, increasing their importance as a bloc. Polls show most Turks in Germany backed Erdogan when voting as expatriates in Turkish elections.  For Erdogan, having influence over voters in Germany provides a chance to settle scores with German politicians he sees as enemies, while burnishing his credentials at home as a defender of Turks everywhere.  Germany s mainstream parties have been outspoken critics of Turkey s crackdown since a failed coup last year, in which thousands of Turks have been jailed, including around a dozen who hold German citizenship. Turkey also demands that Germany hand over asylum seekers it accuses of involvement in the coup.  For the Social Democrats and Greens, losing the Turkish vote poses a real risk: even a small swing could weaken them in potential talks with the conservatives about setting up a government after the vote.  In recent weeks, a new party, the Alliance of German Democrats, led by ethnic Turks, has campaigned with a poster of Erdogan.  Friends of Turkey,  it reads.  Stand with them!   So far the new party is polling below one percent nationally and fielding candidates only in North Rhine-Westphalia, the big Western state home to more than a fifth of Germany s population.  The national prospects for a minority ethnic party may be limited in a country with a 5 percent threshold to win seats, but a party appealing directly to Turks could undermine the bigger parties.   Our poster was a quote from Erdogan: he was criticizing German politics and saying we should vote for parties that are our friends,  said party spokesman Ertan Toker.  Unlike the other German parties that are always negative about Erdogan, we are not. We saw this as him encouraging us to vote.   Among the causes the new party has taken up: making it easier for ethnic Turks in Germany, most of whom still don t have the right to vote, to gain it. That struck a chord for Rascha, a 17-year-old Turkish girl in Duisburg, North Rhine-Westphalia.   I was born here and I still don t have a German passport,  she said.  The process for getting one is long and bureaucratic. There s a new party that wants to give all permanent residents voting rights.   Turkish community leaders from the big political parties say Erdogan s interventions into German politics are undoing decades of work on promoting integration.   The political climate is poisoned by this,  said Cansel Kiziltepe, Social Democrat parliamentary candidate in Berlin s multi-ethnic Kreuzberg district, where the Social Democrats, Greens and conservatives are all fielding candidates with Turkish roots.  President Erdogan has torn down what we have built up over decades.    We get threats, e-mails as ethnic Turkish lawmakers saying we aren t sufficiently loyal as  Turks ,  Kiziltepe said.  But I am a German politician and I do politics for Germany and for all people who live here.   Timur Husein of Merkel s Christian Democratic Union was categorical about his loyalties:  I am German, only German,  said the son of a Turkish father and a Croatian mother.  For YouTube personality Nihan, who confessed her passion for Turkish TV during an interview with Social Democrat leader Martin Schulz, the worry was that some Turks would end up alienated from wider German society.   What can we do to stop parallel societies from emerging?  she asked Schulz.  Schulz was reassuring. ""It's not bad, or even hard, to have two identities. Why should you deny your roots?""

Family of Australian woman fatally shot wants Minnesota cop charged,"(Reuters) - The family of an Australian woman who was fatally shot wants the Minneapolis policeman involved charged, their attorney said on Tuesday, the same day investigators sent the evidence collected to the local prosecutor. State investigators did not release their findings in the July 15 shooting of Sydney native Justine Damond, 40, who died from a single gunshot fired by Officer Mohamed Noor. The policeman was in a patrol car with Officer Matthew Harrity.  Damond had called police about a possible sexual assault near her house and had approached the police after their arrival, authorities previously said. Damond was living in Minneapolis and engaged to be married. The shooting sparked outrage in Minnesota as well as in Australia, where Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull called the incident  shocking  and  inexplicable.  Minneapolis  police chief resigned after city officials said procedures had been violated during the incident and Damond  didn t have to die.  The attorney for Damond s family, Bob Bennett, said her family believes the officer should be held accountable.   They certainly believe charges are merited,  he said in a telephone interview. The most likely charges may be second-degree manslaughter, which carries a sentence of up to 10 years, Bennett said.     Attorneys for the officers could not be reached. Noor previously expressed condolences to the Damond family in a statement, but declined to discuss the shooting. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman will review the case file to determine what, if any, charges might be brought after the findings were submitted Tuesday, according to a statement. A decision is expected by the end of the year, his office said. Harrity told investigators he was startled by a loud sound near the patrol car shortly before Noor fired through the open driver s-side window, striking Damond. Court documents said a woman slapped the back of the car before the shooting. Noor was put on paid leave after the shooting. Neither officer had their body cameras activated, police have said. Damond s family has not yet filed a civil lawsuit, Bennett said. He is the same lawyer who reached a nearly $3 million settlement for the family of black motorist Philando Castile who was shot and killed by Minnesota police in July 2016 during a traffic stop. Because of past criticism over a lack of transparency when grand juries consider possible charges in police shootings, Freeman plans to decide on charges himself, his spokesman said. Freeman s office said in a statement it might ask for additional investigation into the matter. ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1
Saudi calls for social media informants decried as 'Orwellian',"(Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has urged its people to report subversive comments spotted on social media via a phone app, a move denounced by a human rights watchdog as  Orwellian . The appeal, announced on a Twitter account run by the interior ministry late on Tuesday, coincides with an apparent crackdown on potential government critics and a call by exiled opposition figures for demonstrations.  When you notice any account on social networks publishing terrorist or extremist ideas, please report it immediately via the application #We re_all_security , it said, referring to a mobile phone app launched last year to enable civilians to report traffic violations and burglaries. Hours later, the public prosecutor tweeted a section of the kingdom s terrorism law which states:  Endangering national unity, obstructing the Basic Law of governance or some of its articles, and harming the state s reputation or status are terrorist crimes.  Exiled Saudi critics have called for demonstrations on Friday to galvanize opposition to the royal family and prominent clerics, intellectuals and activists, including prominent Islamist cleric Sheikh Salman al-Awdah, have been detained this week, activists say. Activists circulated lists of people detained on social media showing the number had risen to around 30 on Wednesday, including some with no clear links to Islamist activity or obvious history of opposition. Protests are banned in Saudi Arabia, as are political parties. Unions are illegal, the press is controlled and criticism of the royal family can lead to prison.  Riyadh says it does not have political prisoners, but senior officials have said monitoring activists is needed to maintain social stability. The detentions reported by activists follow widespread speculation, denied by officials, that King Salman intends to abdicate to his son, Crown Prince Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who dominates economic, diplomatic and domestic policy. There are also growing tensions with Qatar over its alleged support of Islamists, including the Muslim Brotherhood which is listed by Riyadh as a terrorist organization. Some Twitter users expressed support for the government s approach, using the  We re all Security  hashtag.  No flattery, no silence whether for a relative or friend in securing the homeland,  said one.  Defend your security. Chaos starts with slogans of freedom and reform. Do not believe them.  Another user called on people to photograph any  low-lifes  protesting on Friday and upload them to the app. Human Rights Watch, a New York-based watchdog, condemned the government dragnet, saying it called into question the authorities  commitment to free speech and the rule of law.  Saudi Arabia is reaching a new level of Orwellian reality when it goes beyond security services  repression and outsources monitoring of citizens  online comments to other citizens,  said Middle East director Sarah Leah Whitson, referring to English writer George Orwell s dystopian novel  Nineteen Eighty-Four .  Saudi Arabia s new leadership is quickly showing it has no tolerance for critical thought or speech and is marshalling Saudi society to enforce red lines by spying on itself.  The government has not clearly acknowledged this week s detentions or responded to requests for comment. But state news agency SPA said on Tuesday authorities had uncovered  intelligence activities for the benefit of foreign parties  by a group of people it did not identify. A Saudi security source told Reuters the suspects were accused of  espionage activities and having contacts with external entities including the Muslim Brotherhood , which Riyadh has classified as a terrorist organization. The government toughened its stance on dissent following the Arab Spring in 2011 after it averted unrest by offering billions of dollars in handouts and state spending. But the Brotherhood, which represents an ideological threat to Riyadh s dynastic system of rule, has gained power elsewhere in the region. Since the kingdom s founding, the ruling Al Saud family has enjoyed a close alliance with clerics of the ultra-conservative Wahhabi school of Islam. In return, the clerics have espoused a political philosophy that demands obedience to the ruler. By contrast the Muslim Brotherhood advances an active political doctrine urging revolutionary action, which flies in the face of Wahhabi teaching. The Brotherhood-inspired Sahwa movement in the 1990s agitated to bring democracy to Saudi Arabia and criticized the ruling family for corruption, social liberalization and working with the West, including allowing U.S. troops into the kingdom during the 1991 Iraq war.  The Sahwa were largely undermined by a mixture of repression and co-optation but remain active. The al-Saud family has always regarded Islamist groups as the biggest internal threat to its rule over a country in which appeals to religious sentiment cannot be lightly dismissed and an al Qaeda campaign a decade ago killed hundreds. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and transport links with Qatar in June over its alleged support for Islamist militants, a charge that Doha denies.

Girl strapped with bomb kills five in Cameroon mosque,"YAOUNDE (Reuters) - A girl with a bomb strapped to her walked into a mosque in northern Cameroon where it exploded, killing five worshippers in an attack bearing the hallmarks of Islamist militant group Boko Haram, authorities said. The girl of 12 or 13 years old arrived at the Sanda-Wadjiri mosque in remote Kolofata at the first call to prayer at between five and six a.m., the governor of Cameroon s Far North region Midjiyawa Bakary told Reuters by telephone.  The men were bowed in prayer when she came,  Bakary said.  Five of the worshippers were killed and the bomber also.  He did not name any suspects, but Boko Haram has repeatedly used suicide bombers as well as strapping children with explosives to strike at civilian and military targets.  The Nigerian jihadist group, which is now split into at least two factions, has been fighting for almost a decade to revive a medieval Islamic caliphate in the Lake Chad region, where Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger and Chad meet. Allied forces from the four countries have routed it in much of the territory it once controlled, but the group has responded by scattering and stepping up attacks on civilians. Amnesty International said last week that Boko Haram had killed 381 civilians in Nigeria and Cameroon since the beginning of April, more than double that for the preceding five months. Of those, 158 of the deaths were in Cameroon, which the rights group linked to a rise in suicide bombings, the deadliest of which killed 16 people in Waza in July.

"Five militants, two soldiers, killed in Egypt's Sinai","CAIRO (Reuters) - Five militants and two soldiers were killed on Wednesday in clashes that followed a failed attack on a security checkpoint in Egypt s strife-torn North Sinai province, a military spokesman said. Troops were seeking some of the militants who fled the scene during the clashes, the spokesman said in a statement.   One of the militants, wearing an explosive vest, attempted to raid one of the security checkpoints and due to the vigilance of the security forces the terrorist was killed while the rest of the militants were dealt with,  he said.  Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, with its news agency Amaq saying one of its militants had set off a suicide vest at a security checkpoint. An Islamist insurgency in North Sinai has gathered pace since mid-2013 when the military ousted Islamist president Mohamed Mursi after mass protests against his rule and the group leading it pledged allegiance to Islamic State a year later. Hundreds of soldiers and police have been killed since and in recent months the attacks extended to Coptic Christians, who make up 10 percent of Egypt s 90 million population.

Buildings evacuated in Moscow after bomb threats: RIA,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian authorities evacuated people from dozens of buildings in Moscow on Wednesday after a flurry of anonymous phone calls asserting the locations had been mined, RIA news agency reported. Three of Moscow s main train stations were being checked on Wednesday, along with the city s famous GUM department store near Red Square, and more than 20 other buildings, the news agency said. GUM said on its website it was temporarily closed  for technical reasons.  A Reuters TV cameraman said he saw police with sniffer dogs checking the building. Russia has this week experienced a wave of hoax bomb threats.   Citing an unnamed source in the emergency services, RIA said the hoaxes had so far affected more than 20 Russian towns and cities. All of the calls had so far turned out to be false alarms. When asked about the matter, a Kremlin spokesman referred reporters to the police. RIA cited its source as saying that many of the hoax calls may have been made from Ukraine.

Russia's Zapad war games unnerve the West,"TALLINN/VILNIUS (Reuters) - From planes, radars and ships in the Baltics, NATO officials say they are watching Russia s biggest war games since 2013 with  calm and confidence , but many are unnerved about what they see as Moscow testing its ability to wage war against the West. NATO believes the exercises, officially starting on Thursday in Belarus, the Baltic Sea, western Russia and the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, are already underway. It says they are larger than Moscow has publicized, numbering some 100,000 troops, and involve firing nuclear-capable ballistic missiles. Codenamed Zapad or  West , NATO officials say the drills will simulate a conflict with the U.S.-led alliance intended to show Russia s ability to mass large numbers of troops at very short notice in the event of a conflict.  NATO remains calm and vigilant,  NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said last week during a visit to an Estonian army base where British troops have been stationed since March. But Lithuania s Defense Minister Raimundas Karoblis was less sanguine, voicing widely-felt fears that the drills risk triggering an accidental conflict or could allow Moscow to leave troops in neighboring Belarus.  We can t be totally calm. There is a large foreign army massed next to Lithuanian territory,  he told Reuters. Some Western officials including the head of the U.S. Army in Europe, Gen. Ben Hodges, have raised concerns that Russia might use the drills as a  Trojan horse  to make incursions into Poland and Russian-speaking regions in the Baltics. The Kremlin firmly rejects any such plans. Russia says some 13,000 troops from Russia and Belarus will be involved in the Sept. 14-20 drills, below an international threshold that requires large numbers of outside observers. NATO will send three experts to so-called  visitor days  during the exercises, but a NATO official said these were no substitute for meeting internationally-agreed norms at such exercises that include talking to soldiers and briefings. Moscow says it is the West that threatens stability in eastern Europe because the U.S.-led NATO alliance has put a 4,000-strong multinational force in the Baltics and Poland. Wrong-footed by Moscow in the recent past, with Russia s seizure of Crimea in 2014 and its intervention in Syria s war in 2015, NATO is distrustful of the Kremlin s public message. In Crimea, Moscow proved a master of  hybrid warfare , with its mix of cyber attacks, disinformation campaigns and use of Russian and local forces without insignia.  One senior European security official said Zapad would merge manoeuvres across Russia s four western military districts in a  complex, multi-dimensional aggressive, anti-NATO exercise .  It is all smoke and mirrors,  the official said, adding that the Soviet-era Zapad exercises that were revived in 1999 had included simulated nuclear strikes on Europe. NATO officials say they have been watching Russia s preparations for months, including the use of hundreds of rail cars to carry tanks and other heavy equipment into Belarus. As a precaution, the U.S. Army has moved 600 paratroopers to the Baltics during Zapad and has taken over guardianship of the airspace of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, which lack capable air forces and air defense systems.  Russia s military show of force raises some uncomfortable questions for the alliance because NATO cannot yet mass large numbers of troops quickly, despite the United States  military might, NATO officials and diplomats said. NATO, a 29-nation defense pact created in 1949 to deter the Soviet threat, has already begun its biggest modernization since the Cold War, sending four battalions to the Baltics and Poland, setting up an agile, high-readiness spearhead force, and developing its cyberspace defenses. But NATO has deliberately taken a slowly-slowly approach to its military build-up to avoid being sucked into a new arms race, even as Russia has stationed anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles in Kaliningrad, the Black Sea and Syria.  The last thing we want is a military escalation with Russia,  said one senior NATO official involved in military planning, referring to Zapad.  In the event of any potential Russian incursion into the Baltics or Poland, NATO s new multinational forces would quickly need large reinforcements. But a 40,000-strong force agreed in 2015 is still being developed, officials say. Lithuania s Karoblis said he hoped to see progress by the next summit of NATO leaders in July 2018. Baltic politicians want more discretion given to NATO to fight any aggressor in the event of an attack, without waiting for the go-ahead from allied governments.  During Zapad, NATO is taking a low-key approach by running few exercises, including an annual sniper exercise in Lithuania. Only non-NATO member Sweden is holding a large-scale drill.

Qatari Emir to meet Turkey's Erdogan in Ankara: Turkish presidency,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Qatar s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani will hold talks in Ankara on Thursday with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, an ally of Doha in its dispute with Gulf Arab neighbors. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain cut diplomatic and trade links with Qatar three months ago, suspending air and shipping routes with the world s biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas. They say Qatar supports regional foe Iran and Islamists. Qatar denies the charges and says the economic boycott aims at neutering an independent foreign policy it says promotes peaceful regional reform and fighting terrorism. Last month Turkey held joint military exercises with Qatari forces in the Gulf state. It has said it will deploy 3,000 troops at a military base there and has increased trade with Qatar since the start of the embargo. Turkey s presidency announced Sheikh Tamim s trip in a statement on Wednesday but gave no details of the talks, which will coincide with a visit to Ankara by the prime minister of Kuwait, which has sought to mediate in the Gulf Arab dispute.

U.S. says air strikes in Somalia kill six al Shabaab fighters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. military said on Wednesday it had carried out air strikes in Somalia against an al Qaeda-allied Islamist group and killed six militants. The group, al Shabaab, is fighting to topple Somalia s Western-backed transitional federal government and impose its own rule on the Horn of Africa country. The U.S. military s Africa Command (AFRICOM) said in a statement it had carried out three air strikes on Wednesday at 2:15 a.m. local time (2315 GMT Tuesday).  The operation occurred in southern Somalia, about 260 kilometers (162 miles) south of the capital, Mogadishu,  the statement said.  Al Shabaab has lost control of most of Somalia s cities and towns since it was pushed out of Mogadishu in 2011. But it retains a strong presence in parts of the south and center and carries out gun and bomb attacks. ",worldnews,"September 13, 2017 ",1
Cambodian opposition blocked from holding memorial service,"PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodia s main opposition party was blocked from holding a memorial ceremony on Wednesday for victims of a 1997 grenade attack on a political rally, with tension running high after the arrest of its leader last week. The U.S. embassy urged its citizens to exercise caution after Prime Minister Hun Sen s government accused the United States of conspiring with opposition leader Kem Sokha, who has been charged with treason. Potentially further fanning anti-American sentiment, the embassy announced it had stopped issuing visas for some Cambodian foreign ministry officials. Kem Sokha s Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) had planned to hold a ceremony at a memorial in the capital, Phnom Penh, to mark an attack in which at least 16 people were killed at a rally on March 30, 1997 organized by former opposition leader Sam Rainsy. Similar memorials have been permitted in previous years around the Pchum Ben festival, when Cambodians pay respects to deceased ancestors.  We tried to hold the ceremony at the memorial and we were stopped,  Mu Sochua, one of the CNRP s deputy presidents, told Reuters.  We don t want to confront the authorities but we want to show that these are signs of intimidation,  she said, adding that the ceremony was then moved to a nearby pagoda. Phnom Penh s city hall spokesman Met Measpheakdey said the pagoda was the right place for the ceremony and the party s request to do it at the monument had been denied. Opponents of Hun Sen accuse him of arresting Kem Sokha and cracking down on independent media and other critics ahead of a general election next year in which he could face the toughest electoral challenge of more than 30 years in power. The United States and Western countries have called for Kem Sokha s release, drawing further anti-American rhetoric from the government. The U.S. embassy said it had no specific warnings of security issues but urged U.S. citizens to show caution. The embassy announced it had stopped issuing visas to some senior foreign ministry officials in a separate dispute over Cambodia s refusal to continue accepting Cambodian citizens the United States wants to deport China, Cambodia s biggest donor and investor by far, has stood by Hun Sen s government.   Chinese friends are like a strong back that continues to help Cambodia in every circumstance so that no foreign country can break it up,  Hun Sen said on his Facebook page on Wednesday after returning from a trip to China.

"Rights groups target police, spy chiefs globally under new U.S. law","PRAGUE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Police and spy chiefs from China to the Middle East, a Ukrainian oligarch and a former president of Panama are among the people a coalition of human rights groups wants targeted for sanctions under an expanded U.S. law aimed at curbing rights abuses and corruption worldwide. The coalition, in documents to be made public on Wednesday, submitted 15 cases to the U.S. State Department and U.S. Treasury, urging them to investigate using the law, called the  Global Magnitsky Act. The law, which then-President Barack Obama signed in December 2016, expands the scope of 2012 legislation that froze the assets of Russian officials and banned them from traveling to the United States because of their links to the 2009 death in prison of a whistleblower, Sergey Magnitsky.  The cases we have elected to highlight come from every region of the world, and involve horrific stories of torture, enforced disappearance, murder, sexual assault, extortion and bribery,  the coalition of 23 groups said in a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The groups said their information came from first-hand accounts of victims and their attorneys, investigative journalism and reports by non-governmental organizations (NGOs). (here) Police chiefs, public prosecutors and heads of security services in Bahrain, China, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Central Asian countries where prisoners were tortured, executed or died in custody are on the list compiled by the groups, which are coordinated by Washington-based Human Rights First. Among them are Chinese Deputy Minister of Public Security Fu Zhenghua and Beijing s Municipal Public Security Bureau deputy head Tao Jing. The groups accuse the two officials of bearing  command responsibility  for actions of forces under their control in the torture and 2014 death of human rights activist Cao Shunli. Cao s lawyer has said she was denied medical treatment until she was seriously ill, which the Chinese government denies.  Dmitry Firtash, a Ukrainian oligarch indicted by a U.S. court in 2013 on bribery and other charges, is on the list. He denies wrongdoing and is fighting extradition from Austria.  Lanny Davis, an attorney for Firtash, in a statement said the allegations were false and that any sanctions  cannot be justified,  adding:  The constant repetition of false accusations on the Internet doesn t make them true.      Another target is former Panamanian president Ricardo Martinelli, who is jailed in Florida facing extradition to Panama on charges he conducted illegal surveillance and stole state funds while in office. Martinelli has repeatedly denied the charges. President Donald Trump, a Republican who did not stress global human rights as a foreign policy priority during his presidential campaign or early months in office, told Congress in April that he was committed to  robust and thorough implementation  of the Magnitsky law. His administration has yet to impose sanctions or travel bans under it, but an official said the process of identifying potential targets  is both internal and external. We have received nominations from multiple sources including the United States Congress and NGOs.   Evidence permitting, our objective is to leverage the global reach of this authority and pursue geographically diverse  tranches  of targets on an ongoing basis,  said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Acting on the recommendations could pose risks for Trump if targeted governments retaliated. Washington needs Beijing s help in pressuring North Korea to halt its missile and nuclear tests, for example. The original Magnitsky legislation strained relations between Moscow and Washington. Magnitsky, a tax accountant and lawyer, was arrested in 2008 shortly after accusing Russian officials of involvement in fraud, and died in prison nearly a year later while awaiting trial. William Browder, whose Russian hedge fund employed Magnitsky as a lawyer, spearheaded an international campaign to push through the original Magnitsky Act, which now covers 44 Russians. He said travel bans and asset freezes are effective.  It creates a very devastating consequence because people who thought they could act with absolute impunity no longer have that comfort,  Browder said. The human rights coalition also hopes that pressure from politicians such as Republican Senator John McCain and Democratic Senator Ben Cardin, the authors of the original legislation and the update, will spur the Trump administration into action. McCain, in a statement to Reuters, said the role of NGOs is crucial, and envisioned under the new law.  I will continue working to ensure the administration enforces the law and utilizes this powerful tool to advance freedom and justice around the world,  he said. Rob Berschinski, a former Obama administration official who led the efforts at Human Rights First, said,  Our process is designed to assist the government, but also to remove any excuse around whether it has the ability to levy sanctions. Now the question is simply one of political will.  The Global Magnitsky Act requires the Trump administration to report to Congress by Dec. 10 on sanctions it has imposed under the law.

"China backs U.N. call for justice in Yemen, U.S. and Saudis don't","GENEVA (Reuters) - China signaled on Wednesday it was willing to back an international inquiry into atrocities in Yemen, as demanded by the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, but Saudi Arabia and the United States said they did not support the idea. For three years running U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra ad al-Hussein has asked the 47 countries in the U.N. Human Rights Council to set up an independent investigation into Yemen s war, which has killed at least 10,000, destroyed the economy, led to a cholera epidemic and pushed millions to the brink of famine.  Despite his pleas, they have twice supported a Saudi plan to let Yemen investigate by itself.    On Wednesday, the Netherlands and Canada unveiled a draft resolution to establish an international commission of inquiry (COI) to ensure that  perpetrators of violations and abuses, including those that may constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity, are held accountable . The three-page text was supported by many countries when diplomats met to discuss amendments.  We agree with the actions, including the COI, to promote the political solving of the Yemen crisis,  a Chinese delegate told the meeting, which was boycotted by the Arab group of countries supporting a rival Saudi-led resolution. Britain and the United States said they wanted to see consensus around a single resolution.      We do have concerns that a full international independent Commission of Inquiry is not likely to get us there,  U.S. diplomat Michele Roulbet told the meeting. Saudi Arabia, which leads an international coalition battling the Iran-aligned Houthi movement in Yemen, said the time was not right for an international inquiry. Although Zeid has said Yemen is not up to the job of investigating its own war, Saudi Ambassador Abdulaziz Alwasil said Yemen s national commission was in a better position to investigate for the time being.  We have no objection to the inquiry itself, we just have a discussion about the timing, whether this is the right time to establish an international commission, with the difficulties on the ground,  Alwasil told reporters. Georgette Gagnon, head of field operations at the U.N. human rights office, said Yemen s own human rights commission was  established by, is funded by and reports to a party to the conflict  and said it was way past time for an effective probe.   Not having an international inquiry would be a green light to the parties to the conflict,  said Radhya Al-Mutwakel, co-director of Yemen s Mwatana Organization for Human Rights. Zeid said on Monday there had been only  minimal  efforts at holding people to account in what the United Nations has branded the world s worst humanitarian crisis. The Saudi envoy said the international community should focus its efforts on gaining access for humanitarian personnel. The Saudi-led coalition has also has set up a team to investigate civilian casualties. On Tuesday it said it had found a series of deadly air strikes had been largely justified.

Nein danke! Merkel spurns challenger's TV duel re-run offer,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Firmly on course for re-election, Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday spurned her rival s request for a re-run of a head-to-head television debate in which he failed to dent her opinion poll lead. With voting taking place on Sept. 24, Martin Schulz s left-leaning Social Democrats (SPD) trail Merkel s conservatives by around 14 percentage points. Schulz challenged her to a second debate in a letter, arguing that they failed to address many key issues in the first encounter on Sept. 3, billed as a one-off and in which he at times rattled the chancellor. Her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party rejected the idea, with an official saying:  Angela Merkel enjoyed taking part in the a TV duel. The format worked out well. And she is leaving it at that.  The SPD s Andrea Nahles, who is Germany s labor minister, accused the conservatives of cowardice for not allowing a second debate to tackle issues like health, education and pensions that she said were barely touched on in the Sept. 3 duel.   In my view, this is weak of Mrs Merkel,  she told Reuters in a television interview. Schulz, 61, is a more natural public speaker than Merkel, 63, but he failed to land a knock-out blow during the debate   partly because the two camps agree on many policy areas. When he did try to stake out stronger positions, such as by accusing U.S. President Donald Trump of  bringing the world to the brink of crisis with his tweets , she was able to appear more considered. Deploying her credentials as a global stateswoman, Merkel said she would work with Trump to achieve a diplomatic solution to the North Korea crisis   a moderate approach that appealed to risk-averse German voters. A survey by Infratest Dimap for ARD television after the debate showed Merkel s overall performance was viewed as more convincing by 55 percent, compared to 35 percent for Schulz. In his letter to Merkel, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, Schulz argued they had not addressed voters  questions about the digital economy, the future of the labor market, pensions and education in the debate. Schulz, whose SPD has ruled as junior partner in a  grand coalition  with Merkel s conservatives for the last four years, has tried to appeal to voters with a campaign for social justice but the message has not resonated widely. Merkel, in power since 2005, has told voters not to risk allowing an untested, SPD-led left-wing alliance to take power, urging them to stick with her in  turbulent times .

Macri ally gains ground in Argentina Senate election against Fernandez,"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentine President Mauricio Macri s favored candidate is gaining ground against former populist leader Cristina Fernandez in a closely watched Senate race in the country s largest province of Buenos Aires, sources from both parties and two analysts said. Macri s former Education Minister Esteban Bullrich of his  Let s Change coalition appears to have reversed the trend since last month when Fernandez narrowly beat him by 0.08 percentage points in a nonbinding primary vote. While a second-place finish would still guarantee Fernandez a Senate seat, the number of votes she gets is being closely watched by investors who see the Oct. 22 vote as a gauge of her potential to stage a comeback in the 2019 presidential election. Analyst Ricardo Rouvier has not finished his latest poll but estimated that Bullrich was leading Fernandez by about 3 percentage points in Buenos Aires province, home to nearly 40 percent of Argentine voters.  Cristina has a large number of votes, but she is stuck there, she has a ceiling,  he said in an interview. Fernandez s 2007 to 2015 presidency saw Latin America s No. 3 economy cut off from international capital markets and several companies nationalized. Fernandez was indicted for corruption last year, though she dismisses the charges as politically motivated. A seat in Congress would give her immunity from arrest though not from trial.   We have registered our growth in the polls,  said a high-level government source who asked not to be identified. Citizen s Unity, the party Fernandez founded before launching her candidacy in June, confirmed the trend but said Bullrich had a smaller lead.   What we have is an advantage of half a percentage point (for Bullrich); we have a tied election again,  said a campaign spokesman who declined to be named. A representative for another Argentine pollster, who asked not to be identified because the firm is currently only surveying for private clients, said Bullrich has a four percentage point lead over Fernandez.  The polarized show-down between Fernandez, who says Macri s economic austerity has hurt the provincial poor, and Bullrich has largely left out other parties and moderate candidates. Fernandez broke with Peronism, Argentina  best-known political movement, for the election and her former Transportation Minister Florencio Randazzo attracted few votes in the primary.  Sergio Massa, a presidential candidate in the 2015 election against Macri, finished a distant third behind Fernandez. Seeking to unify the opposition against Bullrich, Fernandez on Monday published a letter on Facebook asking for the support of those who did not vote for her.   We hope that the Peronist voters who accompanied proposals such as Randazzo or Massa join this majority,  said Jorge Taiana, Fernandez s former foreign minister and senate candidate, in an interview. The Citizen s Unity spokesman said the party is in talks with Peronist mayors who support Randazzo to try to convince them to back Fernandez. Four have switched over and the party has high hopes for three more, he said.  No matter how many seats his coalition picks up in October - when Argentines elect one-third of the Senate and half the lower house of Congress - Macri will still lack a majority and will need to negotiate tax and other reforms he hopes to pass in the second half of his term.

"Juncker wants EU finance minister, no separate euro budget or parliament","STRASBOURG, France (Reuters) - The European Union should have a minister of economy and finance but no separate euro zone budget or parliament, the head of the European Commission said on Wednesday. Jean-Claude Juncker said such a minister should also be the chairman of all euro zone finance ministers and be accountable to the European Parliament. The minister would be in charge of economic and financial issues not only for the euro zone, but for all EU countries, Juncker said in a state of the union speech to the European Parliament. Creating a finance minister for the EU rather than for the euro zone is an attempt to prevent divisions among the 27 countries that will remain in the EU once Britain leaves in 2019, EU officials said. The idea of a euro zone finance minister has been promoted by French President Emmanuel Macron. He will offer more detailed proposals for reforms to the euro zone on Sept. 26, two days after Germany s federal election, a French diplomatic source said on Wednesday. Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel also said when she met Macron last month that she could imagine creating a combined European finance and economy minister.  We need a European minister of economy and finance: a European minister that promotes and supports structural reforms in our member states,  Juncker said.  The new minister should coordinate all EU financial instruments that can be deployed when a member state is in a recession or hit by a fundamental crisis.  He said that instead of creating a new post, the job should be given to a vice president of the European Commission   a suggestion that is bound to meet with vehement resistance from euro zone governments, especially Berlin. His comments are part of the debate on the future shape of the 19-country euro zone, which Juncker said should expand to take in all the other EU members that are not yet part of it and do not have a formal option to opt out of using the euro.  Member states that want to join the euro must be able to do so. This is why I am proposing to create a Euro-accession instrument, offering technical and even financial assistance,  Juncker said, without giving details. He said that by the time Britain leaves the EU in March 2019, euro zone membership and participation in the EU s banking union - which entails a single EU supervisor, resolution authority and deposit guarantee scheme - should be the norm for all EU members. But even though all non-euro zone countries of the EU except Denmark are legally obliged to join the euro when they meet a set of criteria, some of the biggest, like Sweden and Poland, have no plans to do so in the foreseeable future, believing their own currency gives their economies more flexibility.     Addressing French and German ideas of creating a separate budget for the euro zone, on top of the existing long-term EU budget, and a separate euro zone parliament, alongside the existing EU parliament, Juncker rejected both.  We do not need a budget for the euro area but a strong euro area budget line within the EU budget. I am also not fond of the idea of having a separate euro area parliament. The parliament of the euro area is the European Parliament,  he said. He said the euro zone bailout fund   the European Stability Mechanism (ESM)   should be transformed into a European Monetary Fund and become an EU institution, rather than an intergovernmental one as the ESM is now. The future European finance minister would be in change of the new European Monetary Fund (EMF) as well, he said. He did not give more details of the new tasks the EMF could take on, saying only the Commission would make a proposal on that, as well as the prerogatives of a European finance minister, in December. Euro zone finance ministers will open a debate on the future of the single currency area on Friday at an informal meeting in the Estonian capital of Tallinn. ",worldnews,"September 13, 2017 ",1
Germany deports failed Afghan asylum seekers,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany deported eight Afghans with criminal records after their applications for asylum were rejected, said Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere. It was the first collective deportation to Afghanistan since an attack in Kabul on May 31 that killed and injured hundreds and damaged German embassy buildings. At that time the German government canceled a flight that was due to return a group of failed Afghan asylum seekers after criticism from rights activists that Berlin was sending people to a dangerous country.  Germany had begun mass deportations of Afghans in December in an effort to show it was tackling high migrant numbers by cracking down on those who failed to qualify as refugees. Chancellor Angela Merkel has made clear that Germany deports to Afghanistan only criminals and people it considers a threat. The eight male asylum seekers who landed in Kabul on Wednesday morning and were received by Afghan authorities had all committed serious offences, said de Maiziere. Some 3,300 Afghans returned home of their own volition last year. Germany deported 67 people to Afghanistan last year and more than 100 have been sent back so far this year.

"EU to race Britain for Australia, NZ trade deals","STRASBOURG (Reuters) - The European Union wants to launch and conclude free trade negotiations with Australia and New Zealand in the next two years, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said on Wednesday, opening up a potential race with Britain. If Juncker s timeframe is achieved, the EU could nip in ahead of the UK, which is also courting both countries but cannot negotiate independent trade deals until it leaves the EU in March 2019. Juncker said there was a good chance that the EU would agree the main elements of a new free trade with the Mercosur countries of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay and of an updated trade partnership with Mexico by the end of this year.  And today, we are proposing to open trade negotiations with Australia and New Zealand,  Juncker told EU lawmakers.  I want all of these agreements to be finalised by the end of this mandate. And I want them negotiated in the fullest transparency,  he added. The current Commission s term of office runs until Oct. 31, 2019. The EU is seeking to capitalize on new trade opportunities in response to a more protectionist  America First  stance from the United States under President Donald Trump.  We will not miss any opportunity to step in. Whatever space the Americans leave behind, the Europeans will occupy,  a senior U.S. official said. Juncker said, however, that while Europe favored open commerce, it needed reciprocity from its trading partners.  We have to get what we give,  he said. The European Union was not a group of  naive free traders  and would always defend its strategic interests. The European Commission is now proposing that it should have the right to review foreign investment in important assets.  If a foreign, state-owned, company wants to purchase a European harbor, part of our energy infrastructure or a defense technology firm, this should only happen in transparency, with scrutiny and debate,  Juncker said. France, Germany and Italy jointly welcomed the proposal to give member states a tool to intervene. Juncker did not mention any country, but most EU concern over reciprocity and investment has centered on China. China s COSCO Shipping [COSCO.UL] already owns a majority stake in Greece s biggest port, Piraeus, and a share of a terminal at Europe s largest port, Rotterdam. China contributed to the European Union s Galileo satellite navigation program, which critics say led to a massive transfer of technology. ",worldnews,"September 13, 2017 ",1
Swedish opposition party to call vote of no-confidence in PM,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden s anti-immigration Sweden Democrat party on Wednesday tabled a parliamentary vote of no confidence in Prime Minister Stefan Lofven, demanding his resignation in the aftermath of a scandal over leaks of sensitive material. Lofven is almost certain to ride out the vote, which will take place on Sept. 15 at the earliest, as the main, center-right opposition bloc has said it will not give its support. But it will damage his standing just a year before the general election and ratchet up pressure on him to get rid of  Defence Minister Peter Hultqvist, who has also been targeted by the Sweden Democrats over the IT scandal.  The Prime Minister has talked about a breakdown, but he has not talked about the breakdown within his own government,  Parliament member Paula Bieler said.  If the Sweden Democrats  attempt to unseat Lofven fails, they will call for a no-confidence motion in Hultqvist. The center-right Alliance bloc has also said it will table a motion of no-confidence in Hultqvist. If Hultqvist is forced to resign, he would be the third minister to fall victim to the IT scandal. No-confidence motions are rare in Swedish politics. Since 1980, only seven have taken place and none one has succeeded.  ",worldnews,"September 13, 2017 ",1
"Juncker chides EU candidate Turkey, upbeat on Western Balkans","STRASBOURG (Reuters) - The president of the European Commission said on Wednesday he saw no prospect of Turkey joining the EU in  the foreseeable future  but he had a more optimistic message for six Western Balkan nations also seeking membership. The European Union has become increasingly critical of Turkey s decades-long membership drive after President Tayyip Erdogan launched a major crackdown on critics - including journalists and academics - after a failed 2016 coup.  Turkey has been taking giant strides away from the European Union for some time,  Jean-Claude Juncker, head of the executive Commission, said in his annual keynote speech to the European Parliament on the state of the bloc.  Accession candidates must give the rule of law, justice and fundamental rights utmost priority. This rules out EU membership for Turkey for the foreseeable future.  Juncker referred to a war of words between Berlin and Ankara, in which Erdogan accused Berlin of  Nazi-like  tactics, prompting Chancellor Angela Merkel to call for an end to Turkey s membership talks, despite it being a crucial NATO ally.  Journalists belong in newsrooms not in prisons. They belong where freedom of expression reigns,  Juncker said.  Stop insulting our member states by comparing their leaders to fascists and Nazis.  Formally ending Turkey s accession negotiations would require unanimity among EU states, which is lacking, though majority backing is enough to suspend them.  EU leaders will discuss Turkey at a summit in Brussels in October, though any formal decision may not come before next spring.  Juncker put a final stamp on the EU s recently-revived engagement in the Balkans, where Serbia, Albania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Kosovo all want to join the EU one day.   If we want more stability in our neighborhood, then we must maintain a credible enlargement perspective for the Western Balkans,  Juncker said.  The region on the EU s south-eastern edge, still scarred by the wars fought along political, ethnic and religious lines in the 1990s, is important for the bloc for issues from controlling immigration to countering security threats. Earlier this year, the EU accused Russia of seeking to destabilize the Western Balkans - which Moscow denied - and its concerns have led to a renewed engagement in the region. With Britain now scheduled to exit the EU in 2019, Juncker said he saw no new enlargement of the bloc before 2020.  But thereafter the European Union will be greater than 27 in number,  he added. EU officials say Serbia, Albania and Macedonia could be closest to joining, possibly allowing for an EU of 30 states by around 2025, though they avoid setting any firm deadlines. Juncker s comments came in a speech in which he urged the EU to  catch the wind  in its sails after years of battling crises from the euro zone to migration to Brexit.

Hungary rejects 'dead end street' of ceding powers to EU,"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary will not relinquish any of its national sovereignty to the European Union and will keep fighting against the EU s quota system for taking in asylum-seekers, Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto told Reuters. As the EU plunges into an intense debate over deeper integration after Britain departs in 2019, Szijjarto said giving up more national powers was not the way to go. His comments highlighted the resistance that proponents of a closer and deeper EU - notably French President Emmanuel Macron - are likely to face from one of the bloc s most prickly and nationalist-minded members.  I definitely do not share the approach ... that (the) less sovereignty on the level of the member states, the stronger the EU will be. I think it is a dead end street,  Szijjarto said in an interview. The right-wing government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, which currently chairs the four-nation Visegrad group of Central European states, has been the most vocal opponent of EU migration policy and what it sees as attempts by Brussels to erode member states  sovereignty. Szijjarto said one area where Hungary supported a common approach was defense, as having a European army would strengthen member states to the benefit of the entire bloc. But taxation policy, for example, should remain with member states as that was a matter of competitiveness. Hungary has one of the EU s lowest personal income tax rates at 15 percent, and a corporate tax rate of just 9 percent. When asked in the interview late on Tuesday if Hungary could accept a common finance minister and budget for the EU, Szijjarto said:  I understand if this is a scenario then first it only can be a scenario for the euro zone, and since we are not members of the euro zone, this question will be decided without asking our opinion.  On Wednesday, however, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker delivered an annual address in which he set out an economic vision including a finance minister for the whole EU. Hungary has no target date to join the euro. Szijjarto dismissed the idea that Hungary or Poland, which also has a eurosceptic government, were becoming isolated in the EU, or that Slovakia and the Czech Republic were drifting away from them within the Visegrad group known as the V4.  There are many attempts to break the V4 unity but they are going to remain unsuccessful,  he said, adding that the Visegrad states were firm in their position to reject migrant quotas after foreign ministers met in Estonia last week.  Everybody reassured the others that we are going to fight and we are not going to give up our positions regarding illegal migration and regarding the quotas.  More than 1.5 million migrants and refugees have arrived in Europe since 2015, many fleeing war in the Middle East. The EU s highest court ruled last week that member states must take in a share of refugees, dismissing a  challenge by Slovakia and Hungary.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel has urged Hungary to quickly implement the court ruling, but Szijjarto called it a  very dangerous  political decision.  This decision does not oblige Hungary to anything because this decision was not about whether Hungary has to receive migrants from tomorrow onwards,  he said.  We will always fight against obligatory quotas, we will never hide our opinion that illegal migration poses a huge threat on Europe, and this position of ours remains our position, regardless of any kind of pressure that has been put on us.

Israeli legislator quits in dispute over nephew's gay wedding,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - An ultra-Orthodox Jewish lawmaker resigned from the Israeli legislature on Wednesday after drawing rabbis  wrath for attending his gay nephew s wedding. Yigal Guetta of the Shas party said in an Israeli radio interview earlier this week that he and his family had gone to the celebration, held two years ago in Israel, because he wanted his sister s son to be happy, although gay marriage violated his own religious beliefs. A letter published on Monday by five prominent Israeli rabbis said same-sex marriage is an  abomination . Accusing Guetta of  desecrating God s will , they called on his party to fire him. Guetta made no immediate public statement after his resignation was confirmed by party officials. The newspaper Haaretz quoted a source close to the politician as saying he had refused to apologize and decided to quit, to avoid being asked to do so by Shas s own religious sages, who set party policy. Same-sex weddings held in Israel are not sanctioned by the state, and only Orthodox rabbis can issue marriage licenses. Couples may marry without a license, but the union won t be officially recognized. Israel does recognize same-sex couples who marry abroad and any other non-Orthodox weddings performed outside of the country. ",worldnews,"September 13, 2017 ",1
EU should enforce rules to prevent vetoes on tax reforms: Juncker,"STRASBOURG (Reuters) - Tax reforms in the European Union, such as higher taxation of online giants, should no longer require unanimous votes from EU ministers, the head of the European Commission said on Wednesday, urging the use of rules that limit governments  veto powers. Jean-Claude Juncker was speaking two days before EU finance ministers meet to discuss plans to introduce higher taxes on digital multinationals like Google and Amazon, which stand accused of paying too little tax in Europe. He urged EU states to adopt tax reforms with a  qualified majority  rather than by unanimity, a practice that has so far blocked major overhauls of tax legislation in the 28-country bloc. His proposal would end the ability of a single country to veto such decisions at ministerial level, although national leaders would retain veto power at EU summits. If taken up, the idea could reduce the power of smaller states, which offer some of the most favorable tax rates for multinationals, to block reforms. Juncker said it was possible under already existing rules  to switch to majority voting in certain areas, and this should be applied to decisions on  fair taxes of the digital industry .  I want decisions in the Council (of EU ministers) to be taken more often and more easily by qualified majority,  Juncker said.  In separate remarks, the commissioner in charge of tax issues, Pierre Moscovici, said on Wednesday that the EU executive will present a new  initiative  on digital taxation in the coming weeks.  The simpler decision-making should also be used to decide on legislative proposals on Value Added Tax (VAT) and on a common consolidated corporate tax base, which would harmonize national rules on tax deductions, Juncker said. He added that he also supported this solution for decisions on a European financial transactions tax, a long-running plan from which most EU states have opted out, but which remains under discussion among 10 euro zone countries.  Europe has to be able to act quicker and more decisively,  Juncker said in a speech to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, urging the use of so-called  passerelle clauses  to reduce countries  veto powers. These provisions, included in the EU treaties, allow for simplified legislative procedures if EU leaders decide so unanimously, and if national parliaments do not oppose it. EU leaders, who usually meet every three months, tend to reach overall political agreements that are later translated into legislative acts by relevant ministers.

"As North Korea girds for latest sanctions, economy already feels the squeeze","DANDONG, China (Reuters) - The United Nations may have failed to slow North Korea s weapons programs, but the country s economy is already showing signs it is feeling the squeeze from the ongoing clampdown on trade, including a curb on fuel sales by China. The latest sanctions agreed on Monday by the UN Security Council ban the export of textiles from North Korea, one of its few substantial foreign currency earners. They also capped imports of oil and refined products, without imposing the full ban the United States had sought.     Chinese traders along the border with North Korea and some regular visitors to the isolated country said scarcer and costlier fuel, as well as earlier UN sanctions banning the export of commodities such as seafood and coal, are now taking a toll.  Our factory in North Korea is about to go bankrupt,  said an ethnically-Korean Chinese businessman in Dandong who sells cars refurbished at a factory in North Korea. He declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the situation.  If they can t pay us, we re not going to give them goods for free,  he said, referring to his North Korean customers.  A trader at another auto-related businesses in Dandong said cross-border trade had been hurt over the past few years, which he attributed to sanctions and less access to petrol. Several Chinese traders told Reuters the sanctions had stymied North Korean businesses  ability to raise hard currency to trade.   Last month sales were really bad, I only sold a couple of vehicles,  said the Chinese trader who sells new trucks, vans and minibuses to North Korea.  In August last year, I sold tens of vehicles and I thought that was bad.   On top of the sanctions, some traders said Chinese officials have stepped up efforts to curb smuggling across the border, a key source of fuel in the northern parts of North Korea.  And Chinese bank branches in the northeast have curtailed doing business with North Koreans, according to branch staff.     Still, North Korea has made strides in increasing its economic independence and not all traders or observers agreed the international pressure was having a major economic impact. Many residents, long accustomed to restrictions and shortages, were most concerned about the risk of already tight fuel supplies being cut further, said Kang Mi-jin, a North Korean defector in Seoul who reports for the Daily NK website.  If the U.S. were to say they plan to bomb Pyongyang, North Koreans wouldn t care less. But if China says they are considering slashing oil exports to North Korea because of missile or nuclear tests, North Koreans would absolutely freak out,  she said. Reuters reported in late June that state-run China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) had suspended sales of gasoline and fuel to North Korea over concerns it would not get paid, and Chinese customs data showed that gasoline exports to the North had dropped 97 percent from a year earlier.  Petrol and diesel prices in North Korea surged after the cut and have almost doubled since late last year. In early September, petrol cost an average of $1.73/kg, compared with 97 cents last December, according to data from the defector-run Daily NK.  The cost of living has gone up, the price of petrol has risen and there are fewer cars on the streets,  a foreign resident of the North Korean capital told Reuters. The only thing that had become cheaper was coal, he said, after China banned North Korean coal imports earlier this year. Some of the scarcity of oil products and higher prices may have been caused by hoarding in anticipation of a clampdown on supply.  North Korea canceled an air show scheduled for this month in the coastal city of Wonsan, citing  current geopolitical circumstances . Several Chinese traders said they believed it was because the military is saving aviation fuel.  The new UN resolution imposes a ban on condensates and natural gas liquids, a cap of 2 million barrels a year on refined petroleum products, and a cap on crude oil exports to North Korea at current levels. North Korea uses far less crude than during its industrial heyday in the 1970s and 1980s, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. After cut-price supplies from China and the Soviet Union ended following the Cold War, consumption dropped from 76,000 barrels per day in 1991 to an estimated 15,000 last year, according to the EIA. The use of small-scale solar has become widespread in the North, with many apartment balconies dotted with panels providing power for cooking and lighting. China has not disclosed crude exports to North Korea for several years but industry sources say it supplies about 520,000 tonnes of crude a year to North Korea through an aging pipeline. The pipeline already operates at the minimum level for which the waxy crude from China s Daqing oil fields can flow without clogging, according to a senior oil industry source.  Chun Yung-woo, a former South Korean envoy on the North Korean nuclear issue, said the North could endure for a year or two without oil imports.  North Koreans are so used to living in harsh economic conditions that they would just get by for at least one year even if the oil ban is adopted, rationing the existing stockpile among top elites at a minimum level and replacing cars, tractors, equipment with cow wagons, human labor etc,  he said.  They would also manage to produce oil from whatever resources are available, whether it be coal, trees or plants.   ",worldnews,"September 13, 2017 ",1
Kenyan police fire tear gas after women attacked at election meeting,"KISUMU, Kenya (Reuters) - Kenyan police in the western city of Kisumu fired tear gas and bullets in the air on Wednesday to disperse young men who broke into a hotel and beat women attending an election meeting, an officer said. Kenya held presidential, legislative and local elections on Aug. 8, but three weeks later the Supreme Court nullified the presidential result, citing irregularities in the tallying process. A re-run is scheduled for Oct. 17.  Although the ruling ushered in a period of uncertainty, many hope it will restore some faith in Kenya s tarnished institutions, reducing the long-term likelihood of political violence. On Wednesday, a Christian women s organization was holding a meeting related to the election re-run when the men broke into the hotel where they were meeting, said Joseph Keitany of the  Administration Police in Kisumu County. The region is a stronghold of opposition leader Raila Odinga.   We deployed police and they fired tear gas and bullets in the air and chased the group of young boys away,  he told Reuters.  The youth started beating women and they stole their laptops and money  before police arrived. A Reuters witness said the men smashed windows and broke chairs. Another witness said young men attacked participants using the broken chairs.   I was making my presentation when the youths came in,  said pastor Alice Atieno.  They started interrogating us and beating us on claims that we were buying IDs.  Keitany said he believed the men stormed the hotel because of rumors circulating on WhatsApp that the women s meeting was intended to plan the renting of voter identification cards, a rigging tactic alleged by the opposition ahead of last month s election, where online hoaxes and fake stories were alleged from all sides. Participants in the meeting denied that was the purpose and said they were meeting to see how to encourage peaceful voting.  A Reuters witness said he saw a Red Cross ambulance taking three women to hospital. In 2007, a disputed presidential vote led to protests and ethnic violence that killed 1,200 people. Following the August election, human rights organizations reported at least 28 deaths, mostly linked to police. But the protests were quelled when the opposition decided to take its complaints to court. Kenya s vocal civil society organizations have been working hard to plan monitoring and advocacy around the new vote.  The east African nation is the region s richest economy and a stable Western ally in a region roiled by conflict.  ",worldnews,"September 13, 2017 ",1
"Exclusive: At a Russian polling station, phantom voters cast ballots for the 'Tsar'","VLADIKAVKAZ/IVNYA, Russia (Reuters) - At polling station no. 333 in the Russian city of Vladikavkaz, Reuters reporters only counted 256 voters casting their ballots in a regional election on Sunday. People were voting across Russia in what is seen as a dress rehearsal for next year s presidential vote. Kremlin candidates for regional parliaments and governorships performed strongly nationwide. When the official results for polling station no. 333 were declared, the turnout was first given as 1,331 before being revised up to 1,867 on Tuesday. That is more than seven times higher than the number of voters counted by Reuters - with 73 percent of the votes going to United Russia, the party of President Vladimir Putin. Election officials at the polling station said their tally was correct and there were no discrepancies.   Reuters reporters were there when the polls opened at 08:00 until after the official count had been completed. They saw one man, who said he was a United Russia election observer, approaching the ballot box multiple times and each time putting inside voting papers.  We must ensure 85 percent for United Russia. Otherwise, the Tsar will stop providing us with money,  the man, Sergei Lyutikov, told a reporter, in an apparent reference to Putin. Putin is the strong favorite to win re-election next year. Many voters credit him with restoring national pride. However, with the economy forecast to grow only 1 percent this year enthusiasm for Putin is not as strong as it has been. Political analysts say that could result in a weak election turnout. Reuters reporters observed the vote at six polling stations on Sunday. At all six the reporters found discrepancies, of varying sizes, between the official vote tally and the number of voters the reporters counted. The reporters were present for the entire voting day except for in one place where a reporter missed the start because they were initially not allowed in. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, responding to a Reuters request for comment, said:  On the whole, no one has any doubts about the legitimacy of the elections, not the observers, not journalists. There were some incidents, probably. After all, it s a big country.   But neither we nor journalists have the right to describe something as a violation until the central election commission describes it as such,  he said.  There were observers there. So in this case there probably should be complaints from them. So one needs to see if there were complaints from them.   Russia s central election commission, asked about the discrepancies witnessed by Reuters, did not immediately respond. Ella Pamfilova, chair of the commission, told a news conference after polls closed that the irregularities that had been reported to her commission would be investigated. United Russia s party headquarters, in a statement sent to Reuters, said it gave no orders to anyone to stuff ballots or falsify results. It said all violations would be examined by election commissions and, if the law was broken, those responsible would be punished.  The six polling stations the Reuters reporters visited were in three regions but there were thousands of polling stations operating in Russia on Sunday so the events only offer a small snapshot of what happened.   Reuters reporters are unable to assess if such practices were widespread, or whether they had a material bearing on the outcome of the election.      Opinion polls consistently show that United Russia has more support than any other Russian party. Golos, a non-governmental organization whose volunteers monitored the voting in 36 regions, said late on Monday it had received reports of 825 violations of election rules. They included multiple reports of inflated turnout figures and ballot-stuffing. However, the NGO said violations were down compared to previous elections. At polling station no. 333, located in a further education college in Vladikavkaz, capital of the North Ossetia region, voters on Sunday were electing a new regional parliament. Lyutikov was there throughout the day. He works as an aide to Vadim Suanov, a United Russia deputy in the outgoing North Ossetia regional legislature, according to the legislature s website. Suanov, who was running for re-election on Sunday, told Reuters he knew nothing about what his employee did in the polling station. Lyutikov cast his ballot in the first hours of voting but later inserted ballot papers about 10 times, according to the Reuters witnesses. Lyutikov told a Reuters reporter not to document him at the ballot box, threatening to break her mobile phone if the pictures and video footage were not deleted. At one point, he showed a reporter his passport, with his name, Sergei Ivanovich Lyutikov and his date of birth, April 17 1984. While he was approaching the ballot box, he was in sight of Yelena Khadonova, the chair of the election commission for polling station no.333. Asked about Lyutikov s actions, she said:  I have nothing to comment on. I haven t seen anything.   At a parliamentary election last September, Reuters reporters at several polling stations found cases of inflated turnout and ballot-stuffing. Russia election chiefs said they would investigate, and the police launched their own investigation. After Sunday s vote, Kremlin candidates were on track to win in all 16 regions where governors were being elected, according to preliminary results. In the six regions where parliaments were being elected, including in North Ossetia, United Russia was in comfortable first place.  United Russia was less dominant in municipal elections in parts of Moscow, where support for opposition candidates is traditionally stronger. At another location, polling station no. 618 in Belgorod region, a Reuters reporter accompanied election officials on their visits to voters  houses to administer home voting. The number of home voters was equal to about a quarter of those who voted at the polling station.     Under Russia s electoral rules, voting at home is reserved for cases where a voter has specifically requested a visit, because for health reasons they are unable to make it to a polling station. Kremlin opponents and independent monitors say home voting is open to abuse because it is not subject to the same scrutiny as voting in a polling station, where monitors from several parties, and journalists, are often present. Despite the rule that home voting is only offered on request, several of the people visited by the election officials at their homes said they had not asked to vote at home.  The election officials entered most of houses without knocking on the door. One man in his sixties was smoking a cigarette in his backyard when the election officials arrived.  First build a road and then we ll talk,  he told the officials, pointing at a bumpy path leading to his house. He denied he asked them to come, but still cast his vote. The officials said a relative or neighbor may have made the request on his behalf. Over the course of two hours, during which the reporter was with the officials at all times, they collected 14 filled ballot papers. When the officials returned to the polling station, they had 18 filled ballot papers. The officials who made the trip said the tally was correct. The head of the election commission at polling station no. 618, Lyubov Grushko, said:  The difference in numbers is a provocative issue, we won t discuss it.      ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1
Austria's conservatives want schools to make 'sufficient' German compulsory,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria s conservative People s Party wants children who do not speak  sufficient  German to take compulsory language classes as a condition for being allowed to attend school, party leader Sebastian Kurz said on Wednesday.  Tens of thousands of migrants from the Middle East, Afghanistan and Africa have arrived in Austria in the past two years. Their integration has become an important political topic and Kurz, whose party is the junior partner in a coalition government with the Social Democrats, has gained in popularity because of his hard stance on immigration. Though his proposal ostensibly applies to all children, public debate has centered around those from migrant backgrounds, most of whom are currently placed at school according to age.  They receive separate language lessons but teachers have said that this is not enough to integrate them.  One can only follow the curriculum if one s German is good enough,  Kurz said at a news conference in Salzburg, where he presented his party s education program for parliamentary elections on Oct. 15.  Who starts at school needs to understand the teaching language,  the party chief said, echoing demands from the far-right Freedom Party.  ",worldnews,"September 13, 2017 ",1
Key points in Juncker's 2017 annual EU address,"STRASBOURG (Reuters) - European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker made key proposals in his annual State of the European Union address to the European Parliament on Wednesday. For more on the speech, see: A vice president of the European Commission to chair the Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers and play the role of European Finance and Economy Minister, promoting reforms in states and deploying EU financial instruments to help states in recession or crisis. But he rejects French ideas of a separate euro zone budget and parliament, rather a  strong euro area budget line within the EU budget  and EU parliamentary scrutiny. He backs that argument by calling for all EU states to adopt the euro and offering technical and financial help for countries that need it. With non-euro Britain leaving in 2019, only eight states accounting for 15 percent of EU GDP will be outside the euro zone. However, the likes of Poland and Sweden are wary politically of being drawn into the single currency. Juncker also wants all states to join the European Banking Union, making bank supervision common across the bloc and more common standards in labor and social policies. He wants to set up a European Labour Authority and also wants governments to give up veto rights in areas such as corporate taxation and VAT harmonization efforts and a new financial transaction tax.  The Commission will propose in December ways to transform the euro zone bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) into a broader regional equivalent of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the European Union as well as the creation of a double-hatted European Minister of Economy and Finance. He also suggested making his successors as chief executives also the chairs of EU summits, fusing the roles of presidents of the European Commission and that of the European Council so as to make EU structures more comprehensible at home and abroad. Western Balkan states should have a realistic chance of joining the EU after 2019 but Turkey s abuse of fundamental rights rules out it joining in the foreseeable future. Britain s departure is  tragic  and the British too will come to regret it but it should not prevent the rest of the Union forging ahead with integration in an ambitious way, in the knowledge that favorable conditions will not last for long. Juncker made no policy statements on how Britain s exit should be handled or on plans for a new relationship. He called for an EU summit in the once German-speaking Transylvanian city of Sibiu on March 30, 2019, the first day Britain will no longer be in the Union. Romania will be chairing EU meetings then. It should agree plans for the future ahead of bloc-wide elections to the European Parliament scheduled for two months later. The EU is to launch new, transparent free trade talks with Australia and New Zealand and aim to conclude those as well as ongoing negotiations with Japan, Mexico and South American nations by the end of Juncker s mandate in late 2019. The EU is taking advantage of a cooling of the United States on free trade. Addressing unease in Europe about such deals, Juncker stressed their power to create jobs and impose EU standards in areas such as the environment on trading partners. New deals will also be stripped of controversial elements such as special business tribunals to make them easier to ratify. While being open, the EU will also introduce at Union level some of the powers which some governments have to review foreign investments in strategic assets   such as infrastructure or sensitive security or technology firms   and raise objections. A new European Cybersecurity Agency to be set up. He also wants a new European intelligence unit to coordinate sharing of information on suspected militants and to give the new European Public Prosecutor powers to investigate terrorism offences. A European Defence Union, supported by NATO, to be ready by 2025. The EU is to propose ways to increase from 36 percent the rate of failed asylum seekers being deported back to their homelands. This is seen as essential to get member states to agree new rules on asylum to share out responsibilities and give more help to genuine refugees. Juncker wants states to make good on pledges of aid to Africa to promote growth and slow emigration. Romania and Bulgaria should be brought into the Schengen passport-free zone without delay and Croatia as soon as possible   part of a strategy to push all EU member states into all the bloc s structures, including the euro and banking union. After blasting carmakers   many of them German   for deliberately misleading consumers on the emissions of diesel vehicles, Juncker proposed an Industrial Policy Strategy to help industries stay or become  world leaders in innovation, digitization and decarbonization . While pointedly demanding that EU governments respect EU law and court judgments   a barb aimed mainly at ex-communist states in the east like Poland and Hungary   Juncker stressed that the poorer east must not be treated as second class.  He proposed efforts to ensure children are vaccinated to the highest standards across the bloc, fair pay and treatment for workers backed by a new Labour Authority and stronger national powers to punish companies which offer lower quality products in the east under the same labels as better produce in the west.

EU's Juncker offers carrot and stick to eastern states,"STRASBOURG (Reuters) - European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker told the EU s eastern states on Wednesday he would fight for equal rights for their consumers, but their workers would not be allowed to unfairly undercut those in western members. Juncker extended an olive branch to the eurosceptic governments in Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic in his annual speech on the state of the European Union, where east-west divisions have driven a painful wedge.  East to west: Europe must breathe with both lungs. Otherwise our continent will struggle for air,  Junker said.  In a union of equals, there can be no second class consumers. I will not accept that in some parts of Europe, people are sold food of lower quality than in other countries, despite the packaging and branding being identical.  Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Romania have complained that food products sold by multinational producers on their markets are often of poorer quality than the same ones in the west. Juncker said national authorities would be given better legal instruments to root out such  illegal practices , an attempt to woo the reluctant easterners at a time when the EU needs unity as it negotiates over the complex terms of Britain s departure in 2019. In another gesture toward the eastern states, Juncker said it was time to let Bulgaria and Romania into the EU s Schengen zone of passport-free travel.  But he also said the bloc would go ahead with reforming its labor rules, which now allow workers from the poorer EU east to work in the wealthier west for low salaries. French President Emmanuel Macron has made ending this practice, which he says amounts to social dumping, a key priority. The eastern states are opposed, saying they should be allowed to compete in that way to catch up after decades of communist rule after World War Two. While the so-called  posted workers  only represent around one percent of the EU workforce, the issue has become sensitive. EU diplomats say the bloc will change the current rules, a plan also backed by Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, in a move that could make it easier for Macron to carry out economic reforms at home by showing he is delivering for French workers.  In a Union of equals, there can be no second class workers. Workers should earn the same pay for the same work in the same place,  Juncker said, adding he would seek to establish an EU Labour Agency  for ensuring fairness in our single market.  Juncker said he was  saddened  with the refusal by the ex-communist eastern states to take in refugees arriving in the bloc to help their western and southern peers.  More than two years of bruising battles over migration have caused a lot of bad blood in the EU, spilling over to other policy areas and reinforcing calls from the west to cut generous EU funding for the eastern states who deny help.  But Juncker reserved his most pointed criticism for Poland and Hungary, where nationalist governments have clashed with the Brussels on multiple issues, including a contested judiciary overhaul in Poland and Hungary s continued rejection of refugees despite the bloc s top court ruling that they must be taken in.   The rule of law means that law and justice are upheld by an independent judiciary,  Juncker said.  The judgments of the European Court of Justice have to be respected by all.   To undermine them, or to undermine the independence of national courts, is to strip citizens of their fundamental rights. The rule of law is not optional in the European Union. It is a must.  As the EU contemplates deeper integration after Britain s departure, the eastern states - mostly outside the euro zone - fear they will be pushed out of the decision-making core and will lose out in a  multi-speed  EU. Juncker offered some reassurances on that, saying he did not favor a separate euro zone budget, or a euro zone finance minister, but closer ties between all 27 EU states remaining after Brexit.

Northern Ireland leaders appeal to VP Pence on Bombardier challenge,"BELFAST (Reuters) - A dispute between Boeing Co (BA.N) and Canadian rival Bombardier (BBDb.TO) that risks thousands of jobs in Northern Ireland could impact peace in the region, the leaders of its two main parties warned U.S. Vice President Mike Pence.  British Prime Minister Theresa May has asked President Donald Trump to urge the world s largest aerospace company to drop its challenge against Bombardier, which could endanger a factory that employs 4,500 people in the British province. Bombardier is Northern Ireland s largest manufacturing employer and May s Conservatives are dependent on the support of the small Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) for their majority in parliament.  For a small economy such as ours, the significance of the contribution that Bombardier makes cannot be understated. The threat facing us as a result of the ongoing case is alarming, and goes much wider than it may immediately appear,  DUP leader Arlene Foster and Michelle O Neill of Sinn Fein said in letter to Pence, a copy of which was seen by Reuters.  The security of our economy has and continues to be a crucial part of our efforts in delivering peace through prosperity. At a time when we are striving to take the next steps in our work on the Peace Process, and resolve our current political difficulties, this issue creates a new and potentially critical factor.  Irish nationalists Sinn Fein and the pro-British DUP have for months tried in vain to re-establish a devolved power-sharing government, a key part of the 1998 peace deal that ended 30 years of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland. Washington played a key role in helping broker the deal. The parties confirmed that their leaders sent the letter, dated September 12.   Boeing this year asked the U.S. Commerce Department to investigate alleged subsidies and unfair pricing at Bombardier, accusing it of having sold 75 of its CSeries medium-range airliners to Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) at well below cost price. A U.S. trade court is due to give a preliminary ruling on Boeing s complaint on Sept. 25. ",worldnews,"September 13, 2017 ",1
"French PM shrugs off labor protests, truckers call strike","PARIS (Reuters) - French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe has shrugged off nationwide protests against planned reforms to France s strict labor regulations, saying on Wednesday he was  listening  but would nonetheless press ahead with the bill. In a sign that popular protest could gain momentum, truck drivers belonging to France s second and third largest unions said they would launch a rolling strike on Sept 25 to force the government into a reversal. Trucker strikes previously brought large parts of France to a halt, hurting the economy.  More than 200,000 trade unionists turned out on Tuesday for the first mass protests against the labor market reforms on Tuesday, part of a series of measures on Macron s agenda for change. Others, including reform to the unemployment benefits and pension systems, are likely to be even more contested. The government plans to adopt the decrees on Sept. 22.    I am listening and I am paying attention. But let me state that the French, when they vote, also have a right to be treated with respect,  Philippe told France 2 television.  And the reform that we are putting in place was announced by the president at the time of his election.  Labor unions have thwarted previous attempts by governments on the political right and left to weaken France s strict labor code. In a change of tack, Macron s administration spent weeks negotiating its proposals with union bosses over the summer. Last month, the government set out measures including a cap on payouts for dismissals judged unfair and greater freedom for companies to hire and fire. The reform makes no direct reference to the 35-hour week, a totem of the labor code, though it hands firms more flexibility to set pay and working conditions. Macron, a 39-year-old former banker, inadvertently fueled worker anger when he declared on a trip to Athens that he  would cede no ground to slackers, cynics and hardliners.   The Elysee Palace said his comments were aimed at political leaders who had shirked ambitious reform in the past, but union leaders and political opponents on the left accused him of treating workers with contempt. Protesters in cities across France hit back too. In Paris some carried placards reading  Slacker on Strike  while in Bordeaux demonstrators chanted:  Macron you re screwed, the slackers are in the streets.  Jerome Verite, secretary general of the CGT union s transport federation on Wednesday told Reuters the truckers  strike would  last as long as necessary.   We re headed for a social disaster. We want the government to reverse course on its decrees,  he said. ",worldnews,"September 13, 2017 ",1
Chinese sub docks at Malaysian port for second time this year,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - A Chinese submarine has docked in Malaysia, the second such visit to the Southeast Asian country this year, as western powers fret over China s expanding reach in the South China Sea. China claims nearly all the South China Sea, through which an estimated $3 trillion in international trade passes each year. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan also have claims. Tensions between China and Malaysia over their overlapping claims, however, appear to have eased after Malaysia agreed in November to buy four Chinese naval vessels and pledged with Beijing to handle South China Sea disputes bilaterally. The Royal Malaysian Navy confirmed the visit by the Chinese submarine, which docked at the Sepanggar naval base in the state of Sabah in Borneo between Friday and Monday. RMN chief Admiral Ahmad Kamarulzaman Ahmad Badaruddin said it was standard international procedure to welcome visits by foreign navy vessels,  based on each nation s request and upon diplomatic clearance .  This is part of our efforts to enhance defense diplomacy and strengthening bilateral relations,  he told Reuters. The submarine was escorted by a surface ship from the PLA Navy and was returning to China after conducting escort missions in the Gulf of Aden, according to defense magazine Jane s 360, which first reported the submarine s docking. In January, a Chinese submarine docked in Sepanggar, only the second confirmed visit of a Chinese submarine to a foreign port, according to state media. Chinese warships have also been calling at ports in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Myanmar, unnerving regional rival India. ",worldnews,"September 13, 2017 ",1
"Indonesia tightens rules to curb money laundering, terror funding","JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia has issued new regulations aimed at curbing money laundering and terror-related financing across a broader range of financial service providers, including money changers, credit card issuers and electronic money providers.   The move is part of efforts by Indonesia to bring rules up to international standards and join the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an inter-governmental body fighting money laundering.  Indonesia was taken off an FATF blacklist two years ago. The new regulations, issued by Bank Indonesia (BI), cover transactions handled by non-bank financial institutions and were made public on its website on Wednesday.  BI said the new rules balanced a need to contain the risks of money laundering and terrorism-related financial crimes and promoting economic growth. Eny V. Panggabean, BI s executive director of payment system regulation, said the rules also addressed  developments in the industry, digital economy and innovations in payments that include a more complex money changer business . The new BI regulations cover credit card issuers, electronic money providers, remittance and money transfer companies as well as fintech startups. Service providers now have to have an up-to-date list on alleged militants, radical organizations and individuals linked to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in order to cross check with customers.  They must also assess customer risks depending on the country origin of an incoming transfer or the destination of outgoing transfers, and must not engage with so-called shell banks, which don t have a physical presence in a country where they are incorporated. Companies should report anything suspicious to the financial transactions watchdog. A financial service provider that fails to follow the rules could have its license revoked and directors, commissioners or shareholders banned from the financial services business for five years. A similar regulation was introduced a few months ago by the Financial Services Authority (OJK) for financial conglomerates, banks, insurance companies and other bigger players in the industry. The OJK rules also elaborated on procedures to handle suspicious transactions. Indonesia was put on an FATF list of jurisdictions with weak measures to combat money laundering and terrorism financing in 2012. In 2015, the FATF declared Indonesia off the blacklist  due to progress in improving regulations. ",worldnews,"September 13, 2017 ",1
Exclusive: Scandal-hit Vietnam official had been cleared by previous government,"(Reuters) - A former Vietnamese official who Germany says was kidnapped in Berlin to face charges in Hanoi over financial losses at a state construction firm had been cleared of wrongdoing by the previous government, according to documents seen by Reuters. The decision to re-open the case and aggressively pursue prosecution shows the tougher stance taken by the ruling Communist Party since Vietnam s security establishment emerged stronger from a power struggle last year in which ex-Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung lost out.  The party says it wants to tackle corruption but some critics have accused Vietnam s rulers of embarking on a witch-hunt following the launch of investigations implicating increasingly senior figures. The internal crackdown drew global attention last month when Germany accused Hanoi of kidnapping Trinh Xuan Thanh, a former official with state oil firm PetroVietnam. He was accused of financial mismanagement that caused losses of $150 million at PetroVietnam Construction (PVC) during the time he served as chairman from 2009 to 2013. But according to a letter dated May 18, 2015 from then trade minister Vu Huy Hoang to then Prime Minister Dung, the official had stated his responsibility but the government had not  found negative signs  relating to his actions.  Therefore, authorized agencies and units agreed not to take disciplinary action over Thanh,  it said, noting that he had moved to a role at the trade ministry, where he had worked hard to try to resolve the problems at PetroVietnam Construction.  Corrective work and post-inspection handling of PVC were done effectively and in accordance with the prime minister s requirements,  the letter said. Responding to questions about the letter and whether there would be further prosecutions over the case, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang said the party and state were resolute in dealing with corruption or lawbreaking by any organization or individual.  Based on the results of the investigation, the functional agencies shall strictly handle those who violate the law in accordance with the provisions of Vietnamese law,  she told Reuters. Reuters was unable to contact Thanh, former trade minister Hoang or former prime minister Dung either directly or through government offices. Thanh ran PetroVietnam Construction, a subsidiary of a sprawling state enterprise that is also involved in everything from oil and gas to power generation, ship building and insurance. After his return to Vietnam, Thanh was shown on state television saying that he had decided to surrender himself in order to face justice. The government has not said how he returned home. Thanh was a relatively junior figure among those who are under investigation in relation to PetroVietnam s dealings as well as in the banking sector. The most senior political casualty so far is Dinh La Thang, a former PetroVietnam chairman who was sacked from his role in the politburo. A vice-minister who had been responsible for appointing Thanh has also been sacked. Hoang has also been symbolically stripped of his title of former trade minister for violating state and party rules. Investigations continue into PetroVietnam and the trade ministry which oversaw it as well as into the central bank. There are widespread expectations that more members of Dung s administration will be prosecuted. Dung lost out last year in the battle to secure the post of Communist Party General Secretary, Vietnam s most powerful position. The post remained in the hands of Nguyen Phu Trong, whose modest public profile contrasts with the conspicuous wealth that some members of Dung s administration displayed.  Fighting and preventing corruption, waste and negativity are no longer handled slowly and case by case. It has become a movement,  Trong said in July. According to a survey by Transparency International conducted between July 2015 and January 2017, Vietnam had become the most bribery prone country in Asia after India and a majority of Vietnamese believed corruption had worsened.

"Erdogan adviser sees recovery in Turkey ties with Germany, EU","ANKARA (Reuters) - Ankara s relations with NATO ally Germany, hit by a deepening row, are expected to improve alongside a general upturn in ties with the EU early next year, boosting Turkish export and tourism prospects, an adviser to President Tayyip Erdogan told Reuters.  I expect more calm with Germany after the Sept. 24 (German) election. I expect tensions to ease,  Cemil Ertem, Erdogan s chief economic adviser, said in an interview on Tuesday. Turkish-German ties have come under pressure since Erdogan launched a crackdown after a failed coup last year. Germany has criticized mass arrests, refused to extradite people Turkey says were involved in the putsch and demanded the release of around a dozen German citizens arrested in recent months.   Turkey s relations with the European Union will be rapidly repaired from the first quarter of 2018. I think Turkey s exports to the EU will increase further,  Ertem said. The improvement in EU relations would also lead to a  very good year  for tourism in 2018, he said. The number of European tourists visiting Turkey has declined due to security concerns over the last couple of years. The economy would grow around 5.5-6 percent this year and around 5-7 percent next year, he said. Ertem dismissed concern about the level of the lira currency after another presidential adviser, Bulent Gedikli, said a stronger lira put exports at risk and called for the central bank to take action.  Given that we implement a floating rate regime, it is wrong to say that the exchange rate is low or dangerous. The market can make a very rapid correction,  he said, adding he was fine with the lira level set by the market. Ertem said the central bank was maintaining tight monetary policy and its use of an interest rate corridor enabled it to rapidly adjust the average cost of funding, rather than just depend on changes to the policy rate.  In this sense we should leave behind debate about whether the central bank will cut rates or not,  he said.  Everyone wants low interest rates, the real sector, banks, the TCMB and the political side,  he said, but added it was a matter for the central bank to deal with the  market reality . He said Turkey would continue to make use of its Credit Guarantee Fund and may seek to focus its allocation on high-tech and intermediate goods producers. In March the government raised the size of the fund, which guarantees loans to small and medium-sized enterprises, more than tenfold to 250 billion lira ($70 billion). The government will also take measures to ease inflationist pressures caused by the immediate goods imports and may provide  serious support  to Turkish producers of such goods, he said.

UK police release new image of jogger in London bus mystery,"LONDON (Reuters) - British police released a new image on Wednesday in a fresh bid to trace a male jogger who appeared to push a woman into the path of an oncoming bus on a busy London street four months ago. Video footage of the apparently callous incident on Putney Bridge, southwest London, has been repeatedly screened on British television but the runner has yet to be found. Footage shows him jog past one man on the bridge on May 5 before knocking into the 33-year-old victim. She tumbled head-first into the path of an oncoming bus, which managed to swerve out of her way, missing her by inches. The new CCTV still was taken from the bus, and shows a white man in a gray top and dark shorts. Police said he came back the other way across the bridge 15 minutes later but did not acknowledge the victim when she tried to speak to him.  Images of this alarming incident have been circulated widely and we continue to work through the information received to identify the man responsible,  said Detective Sergeant Chris Griffith.  Two men arrested last month in connection with the incident have both been released without charge. ",worldnews,"September 13, 2017 ",1
United States stops issuing some visas in Cambodia,"PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - The United States embassy in Cambodia said on Wednesday it had stopped issuing some types of visas to Cambodians because Cambodia is not taking back citizens the United States wants to deport. The new policy comes at a time that U.S. President Donald Trump s administration is trying to crack down on immigrants who are in the United States illegally. The U.S. embassy in Phnom Penh said the visa restrictions were applied in accordance with U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security rules applying to a country that refuses to accept or is unreasonably delaying the return of its nationals.  The Secretary of State must order consular officers to suspend issuing visas until informed by the Secretary of Homeland Security that the country in question has accepted the individuals,  an announcement from the embassy said. The embassy had discontinued issuing some visas for Cambodian foreign ministry employees above the rank of director general and their families, with limited exceptions, it said. The argument over the return of Cambodians deported from the United States is only one of many between the United States and Cambodia, which has accused detained opposition leader Kem Sokha of plotting treason with U.S. support. Earlier this year, Cambodia stopped accepting the deportation of Cambodian nationals who had been convicted of crimes in the United States, saying it wanted to renegotiate a settlement agreement on human rights grounds. Reacting to the visa announcement, government spokesman Phay Siphan said it showed the United States did not recognise human rights.  Cambodia still cooperates with the U.S.,  he said.  But while the U.S. tells the world that it respects human rights, in reality they don t. They just drop bombs to kill people. ",worldnews,"September 21, 2017 ",1
"Singapore names first woman president, raising eyebrows over election process","SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore named a former speaker of parliament as the multicultural city-state s first woman president on Wednesday while critics expressed dismay that other candidates were disqualified and the election went uncontested. Aiming to strengthen a sense of inclusivity, Singapore had decreed the presidency, a largely ceremonial six-year post, would be reserved for candidates from the minority Malay community this time. The returning officer declared Halimah Yacob, 63, elected on Wednesday after nominations closed. Of the four other applicants, two were not Malays and two were not qualified to contest, the elections department said on Monday. Halimah had automatically qualified because she held a senior public post for over three years. If the election had been held, all citizens would have been eligible to vote. Several critics went online to protest against the stringent eligibility rules, which include a stipulation that a candidate from the private sector should have headed a company with paid-up capital of at least S$500 million ($370 million). The prime minister s office said it had no comment on   criticism of the election process.  It would have restored some of the lost moral authority by her winning against credible opponents through popular votes,  said opposition politician Yee Jenn Jong in a blog post.  She is, after all, a veteran in elections and has won handsomely in the four general elections she stood in.  The rights group Association of Women for Action and Research (AWARE) said it hoped  more will be done to improve access to politics for all of Singapore s women .  Unfortunately, the process that led to this outcome has not reflected our hopes,  it said in a statement posted online. Displays of dissent are rare in Singapore, one of the richest and most politically stable countries in the world. It has been ruled by the People s Action Party (PAP) since independence in 1965 and the current prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, is the son of the country s founding father Lee Kuan Yew. In the 2015 general election   held months after the death of Lee Kuan Yew   the PAP won almost 70 per cent of the popular vote and swept all but six of parliament s 89 seats. The incoming president, who is to be sworn in on Thursday, appeared unfazed by the controversy.  Although this is a reserved election, I m not a reserved president,  Halimah said in a speech at the election nominations office.  I m a president for everyone.  Whether or not there is an election or no election, my promise is to serve everyone and I will serve with great vigor, with a lot of hard work, with the same passion and commitment.

"Japan's 'Dennis Rodman', ex-wrestler Inoki, urges lower tensions over North Korea","TOKYO (Reuters) - The standoff over North Korea could lead to  nuclear war , a Japanese pro-wrestler turned lawmaker warned on Wednesday, urging nations to dial down the tension after the isolated country fired a missile over northern Japan last month. Tokyo could play a role in mediating with its neighbor, said the 74-year-old Antonio Inoki, who is known for fighting boxer Muhammad Ali four decades ago.  We are seeing a situation where each raises his fist and the situation is escalating,  Inoki, who recently returned from his 32nd visit to Pyongyang, told a news conference, wearing his signature red scarf.  It s important to see who can be the first to lower his fist and reduce the tension,  said Inoki, who, like U.S. basketball star Dennis Rodman, has made numerous visits to North Korea. Pyongyang must commit to denuclearization as a prerequisite for talks, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said in an interview with the Nikkei business daily published on Wednesday.  On Monday, the U.N. Security Council voted to tighten sanctions on the North over its sixth nuclear test. During meetings with North Korea s top diplomat Ri Su Yong and others on his visit, Inoki proposed that Japan s ruling Liberal Democratic Party send a delegation to Pyongyang, perhaps as a first step toward a visit by Abe, he added.  I did make the proposal and was told they would be happy to receive such a delegation,  said Inoki, who strode into the news conference as if entering the ring, his theme song blaring. Inoki said he sensed more LDP members were beginning to think dialogue was needed, but admitted the hurdle to an Abe visit was high.  Abe and other Japanese officials have said now was the time for pressure, not dialogue. The square-jawed, 1.9-metre- (6-foot-three-inch-) tall Inoki developed close ties with North Korea because his mentor, pro-wrestling legend Rikidozan, hailed from North Korea but could never go home. First elected to parliament s upper house in 1989 from his  Sports and Peace Party , Inoki made headlines the next year when he went to Iraq during the Gulf War and intervened on behalf of Japanese hostages, who were subsequently released. Inoki was elected again in 2013 as an independent. Like Rodman, he says it is vital to maintain lines of communication with the isolated North.   It s important to keep the door open,  Inoki said.

New Slovak education minister appointed after coalition crisis,"BRATISLAVA (Reuters) - Slovakia s president appointed on Wednesday the candidate of a junior coalition party as new education minister, defusing a month-long political crisis that had threatened the survival of the most pro-European Union government in central Europe. Martina Lubyova is the candidate of the Slovak National Party (SNS), a member of the ruling coalition that also includes Prime Minister Robert Fico s leftist Smer party and the ethnic Hungarian party Most-Hid. The SNS rattled the coalition on Aug. 7 by withdrawing its support for the government and calling for a new deal that would boost its role in decision-making. The conflict then escalated when Fico asked then-education minister Peter Plavcan of the SNS to resign after criticism from the European Commission that the ministry had chosen several companies with no history in research or innovation as recipients of EU subsidies aimed at supporting science. SNS leader Andrej Danko denied any funds had been misappropriated but agreed to replace Plavcan. Lubyova is a former director of forecasting at the Slovak Academy of Sciences. A new coalition deal struck this week also establishes regular weekly meetings and new communication rules within the coalition. They will be tested next month when the government is set to discuss a budget framework for the next three years. SNS has argued for more government investment to revitalize thermal spa resorts and wants to set up a national airline for Slovakia, a euro zone member state, but Smer says spending must not endanger the goal of reaching a balanced budget by 2019.   The government needs the votes of all three coalition parties to maintain its majority in the 150-seat parliament. ",worldnews,"September 13, 2017 ",1
"Give us some clarity on Brexit, French minister Griveaux tells UK","LONDON (Reuters) - The British government needs to provide more clarity and less ambiguity on Brexit for negotiations to succeed, French junior economy minister Benjamin Griveaux said during a visit to London on Wednesday. Asked what impact a  no-deal Brexit  scenario would have on France, Griveaux told reporters that it would be felt by the whole of Europe, but would be even worse for Britain.  If it goes wrong, it will go wrong for everyone,  he said. Griveaux, who helped President Emmanuel Macron set up the En Marche political movement that propelled him to power in May, is part of the 39-year old leader s inner circle. He was in London to meet company executives, predominantly in the financial services industry, with a view to persuading them to move some of their operations to France after Brexit. Griveaux declined to give details of any potential corporate moves, saying that it was for companies to make announcements about their own plans. Griveaux said he was confident that Paris, which has been a minor financial center dwarfed by London for decades, would be more prominent in future.  In five to 10 years, Paris will be the first financial place in continental Europe,  he said.  London will remain an important and major financial place for sure.  ",worldnews,"September 13, 2017 ",1
Former assistant accuses exiled Chinese tycoon of rape in lawsuit,"BEIJING (Reuters) - A former personal assistant to an exiled Chinese-born billionaire, who has made claims of high-level Communist Party corruption, has filed a lawsuit in New York accusing him of raping her, court documents show. In the civil complaint lodged with the New York Supreme Court on Monday, the 28-year-old woman said she was  lured  by the businessman, Guo Wengui, to New York under the guise of a one-week business trip. Instead, she was held  captive  and ultimately subjected to  repeated acts of mental cruelty and sexual violence , the suit says. She is seeking $140 million in compensation. Guo, who lives in New York, denied the accusation, describing it as  fake . The complaint says the woman is a Chinese national who was employed by one of Guo s China-based companies. She was told upon arrival in New York that she would work as one of the real estate tycoon s personal assistants, the complaint, reviewed by Reuters, says. It said Guo, also known as Miles Kwok,  forcibly took away  the woman s passport, threatened her, monitored her internet usage and restricted access to her phone and laptop computer. The woman said she was subjected to verbal and physical abuse, which soon escalated to sexual assault, before she managed to escape to the Chinese embassy in London during a business trip with Guo. After her return to China, the woman provided a statement and evidence of her allegations to police in China, the lawsuit said, without detailing the evidence. The Associated Press reported late last month that Chinese police were investigating the woman s claims. Guo refuted the accusation.  Of course it s fake,  he told Reuters. He said the  robbers of the country  engineered the allegations to  divert my attention, spread rumors and smear my reputation.  Guo, who left China in 2014, has named senior Communist Party officials in a deluge of graft accusations via Twitter posts and video blogs, attracting a loyal online following. He has provided little evidence for his claims. China calls Guo a criminal suspect, and articles in state media have accused him of crimes including bribery, fraud and embezzlement. At China s request, Interpol issued a global  red notice  for Guo s repatriation in April. Guo lodged an application for political asylum in the United States last week.

Israel endorses independent Kurdish state,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel supports the establishment of a Kurdish state, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday, as Kurds in Iraq gear up for a referendum on independence that lawmakers in Baghdad oppose. Israel has maintained discreet military, intelligence and business ties with the Kurds since the 1960s, viewing the minority ethnic group   whose indigenous population is split between Iraq, Turkey, Syria and Iran   as a buffer against shared Arab adversaries. On Tuesday, Iraq s Kurdish leader Massoud Barzani said he would press ahead with the Sept. 25 referendum despite a vote by Iraq s parliament rejecting it.  (Israel) supports the legitimate efforts of the Kurdish people to achieve their own state,  Netanyahu said, in remarks sent to foreign correspondents by his office. Western powers are concerned a plebiscite in Iraq s semi-autonomous Kurdish region - including the oil-rich city of Kirkuk - could divert attention from the war against Islamic State militants. Netanyahu said Israel does however consider the Turkey-based Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) a terrorist group, taking the same position as Turkey, the United States and the European Union. An Israeli general told a conference in Washington last week that he personally did not regard the PKK, whose militants have been fighting Turkey for more than three decades, as a terrorist group. Netanyahu, who is due to address the U.N. General Assembly on Sept. 19, voiced support for  the Kurds  aspirations for independence  in a speech in 2014, saying they deserve  political independence . His latest remarks appeared to be a more direct endorsement of the creation of a Kurdish state. But they will cut little ice in Baghdad, which has no diplomatic relations with Israel and has strong ties with Israel s arch-foe Iran. Iraq s neighbors   Turkey, Iran and Syria   oppose the referendum, fearing it could fan separatism among their own ethnic Kurdish populations. Kurds have sought an independent state since at least the end of World War One, when colonial powers divided up the Middle East after the collapse of the multi-ethnic Ottoman Empire.

U.N. seeks 'massive' aid boost amid Rohingya 'emergency within an emergency',"KUTUPALONG CAMP, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Aid agencies have to step up operations  massively  in response to the arrival in Bangladesh of about 400,000 refugees fleeing violence in Myanmar, and the amount of money needed to help them has risen sharply, a senior U.N. official said on Wednesday. The exodus of Muslim Rohingya to Bangladesh began on Aug. 25 after Rohingya militants attacked about 30 police posts and an army camp. The attacks triggered a sweeping military counter-offensive by security forces in Buddhist-majority Myanmar which the U.N. rights agency said was a  textbook example of ethnic cleansing .  We will all have to ramp up our response massively, from food to shelter,  George William Okoth-Obbo, assistant high commissioner for operations at the U.N. refugee agency, told Reuters during a visit to the Kutupalong refugee camp in Bangladesh.  The United Nations said on Tuesday 370,000 people had crossed into Bangladesh but Okoth-Obbo estimated the figure was now 400,000. He declined to speculate on how many more might come. Bangladesh was already home to about 400,000 Rohingya, who fled earlier conflict in Myanmar including a similar security crackdown in western Myanmar s Rakhine state in response to militant attacks in October. Many of the new arrivals are hungry and sick, without shelter or clean water in the middle of the rainy season.  We have an emergency within an emergency with conditions in existing camps,  he said, pointing to a mud-clogged road in the camp. Last week, the United Nations appealed for $77 million to cope with the crisis but Okoth-Obbo said that would not now be enough.  The appeal that was issued of $77 million on behalf of the aid agencies was based on the situation as it was roughly about two weeks ago,  he said.  There were only 100,000 people then. We are already four times that figure now. The funds need clearly is going to continue.  He declined to say how much he thought was needed. He also declined to say if he thought aid agencies were getting proper access to the conflict zone in Myanmar, though he said it was important to ensure that people were safe where they were.  Of course, also that access is provided to all the responders to provide humanitarian assistance,  he added. Myanmar has restricted most aid agency access to the north of Rakhine. Some officials have accused aid agencies of supporting the insurgents. Okoth-Obbo said he agreed with the Bangladeshi position that the most important solution was for the refugees to be able to return home in safety. Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said on Tuesday the refugees would all have to go home and Myanmar should set up safe zones to enable them to do so.  Under difficult circumstances this country has kept its borders open,  Okoth-Obbo said of Bangladesh.  All of us should support that and ensure that the response is strong.

Al Qaeda warns Myanmar of 'punishment' over Rohingya,"YANGON (Reuters) - Al Qaeda militants have called for support for Myanmar s Rohingya Muslims, who are facing a security crackdown that has sent about 400,000 of them fleeing to Bangladesh, warning that Myanmar would face  punishment  for its  crimes . The exodus of Muslim refugees from Buddhist-majority Myanmar was sparked by a fierce security force response to a series of Rohingya militant attacks on police and army posts in the country s west on Aug. 25. The Islamist group behind the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the Untied States issued a statement urging Muslims around the world to support their fellow Muslims in Myanmar with aid, weapons and  military support .  The savage treatment meted out to our Muslim brothers ... shall not pass without punishment,  al Qaeda said in a statement, according to the SITE monitoring group.   The government of Myanmar shall be made to taste what our Muslim brothers have tasted.  Myanmar says its security forces are engaged in a legitimate campaign against  terrorists , whom it blames for attacks on the police and army, and on civilians. The government has warned of bomb attacks in cities, and al Qaeda s call to arms is likely to compound those concerns.  We call upon all mujahid brothers in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and the Philippines to set out for Burma to help their Muslim brothers, and to make the necessary preparations   training and the like - to resist this oppression,  the group said.

South Korea confirms traces of radioactive gas from North Korea's nuclear test,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea said on Wednesday traces of radioactive xenon gas  were confirmed to be from a North Korean nuclear test earlier this month, but it was unable to conclude whether the test had been a hydrogen bomb as Pyongyang claimed. North Korea conducted its sixth nuclear test on Sept. 3, prompting the U.N. Security Council to step up sanctions with a ban on the reclusive regime s textile exports and a cap on fuel supplies.  The Nuclear Safety and Security Commission (NSSC) said its land-based xenon detector in the northeastern part of the country found traces of xenon-133 isotope on nine occasions, while its mobile equipment off the country s east coast detected traces of the isotope four times.  It was difficult to find out how powerful the nuclear test was with the amount of xenon detected, but we can say the xenon was from North Korea,  Choi Jongbae, executive commissioner, told a news conference in Seoul.  The commission could not confirm what kind of nuclear test the North conducted, he added. Xenon is a naturally occurring, colorless gas that is used in manufacturing of some sorts of lights. But the detected xenon-133 is a radioactive isotope that does not occur naturally and which has been linked to North Korea s nuclear tests in the past.  The NSSC also said the xenon traces detected had no impact on South Korea s environment and population.  (Story refiles to correct typo in last paragraph.) ",worldnews,"September 13, 2017 ",1
"Philippine president's Senate foes, allies vow to block budget cut for rights body","MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte s critics and allies in the Senate vowed on Wednesday to block a lower house move to slash the annual budget of a public-funded human rights agency opposed to his bloody war on drugs to just $20. The house, dominated by Duterte s supporters, voted on Tuesday to allocate a 2018 budget of just 1,000 pesos ($20) to the Commission on Human Rights (CHR), which has investigated hundreds of killings during the president s ferocious anti-narcotics crackdown. Vice President Leni Robredo, who was not Duterte s running mate and has locked horns with him numerous times, said the lawmakers  move effectively abolishes the CHR, a constitutional body. Duterte s signature campaign has left thousands of mostly urban poor Filipinos dead. Critics say the lawmakers are trying to retaliate against the CHR for pursuing allegations of executions by police during sting operations, which police deny.  The CHR is among the domestic and foreign rights groups that Duterte frequently admonishes, accusing them of lecturing him and disregarding Filipinos who are victims of crimes stemming from drug addiction. The upper house minority bloc, composed of six staunch critics of the president, will seek to restore the 678 million peso budget the government and a Senate sub-committee had proposed for the CHR. Senator Risa Hontiveros described the plan to cut the budget to almost nil as  a shameless rejection of the country s international and national commitments to champion human rights . Several allies of Duterte in the 24-seat chamber said they would scrutinize the house move and try to ensure the commission had a budget that would allow it to work properly. Senator Richard Gordon said the CHR had a job to do and should not be restricted.   That is their role - to expose possible abuses,  he said. Another legislator, JV Ejercito said senators would not make the CHR impotent.  The CHR is in the thick of things and very relevant nowadays and probably even next year and the years to follow because of what s happening,  he said in a statement. Duterte once threatened to abolish the CHR after its chief, Chito Gascon, sought to investigate alleged abuses by police anti-drugs units. Duterte on Tuesday appeared to distance himself from the lawmakers proposing the meager budget. He said CHR was constitutionally created and should probe whatever it wants, adding he was  not here to destroy institutions .  He had it coming. He opens his mouth in a most inappropriate way. He knows nothing,  Duterte said, referring to Gascon.  The congressmen are really angry. I have nothing against him. Give them a budget for all I care, whatever he likes to investigate.

Northern Ireland fears Brexit loss of EU peacemaking and cash,"BELFAST (Reuters) - The European Union has long aided efforts to heal the deep divisions that plague Northern Ireland, and many people on both sides of the sectarian rift fear what might happen when Brexit forces it to walk away.  Since a 1998 peace deal ended three decades of violence between Protestant pro-British unionists and Catholic Irish nationalists, in which 3,600 died, the EU has pumped about 1.5 billion euros ($1.8 billion) into projects to shore up that peace - more than any other body apart from the British state. It has enjoyed broad support and influence as a force viewed by both sides as a neutral broker separate from the British government, which is distrusted by many nationalists, and the Irish government, distrusted by many unionists. It has been able to take on projects others shy away from, such as the reintegration of former militants, both IRA and pro-union loyalists, and support for relatives of dead fighters.      Brexit is already rattling the region by raising concerns it will lead to a hard border with EU member Ireland. For some in both communities, the idea of a new, rigid frontier stirs painful memories of the British Army watchtowers and checkpoints that peppered the border during the decades of bloodshed.  It s a very fragile situation here, and in Westminster there seems to be a lack of consideration for Northern Ireland,  said Kate Clifford, director of the Rural Community Network, a community group that has received peace funding in the past.  Without a (EU) peace program behind that, without the impetus of the external force that is Europe, that honest broker, things will become very difficult,  she said.   While no one expects a return to the widespread violence of Northern Ireland s  Troubles  of the 1960s to 1990s, sectarian tensions still run high and intermittingly erupt into rioting.   Some British ministers argue that savings from leaving the bloc would allow the government to match all EU funding and last month British Prime Minister Theresa May said that her government would consider replacing that European money.  Yet London has offered no guarantees and, with Brexit negotiations between London and Brussels in their infancy, there is little certainty about how leaving the bloc will affect Britain s finances.   The British government s Northern Ireland office and the EU s Belfast office declined to comment. Since the EU s Northern Ireland PEACE program was founded in 1995, funded groups have worked with hundreds of thousands of Northern Ireland s 1.8 million citizens on conflict resolution, anti-sectarianism and supporting victims.  By the end of its latest funding drive, it will have pumped in 1.5 billion euros. This makes it by far the largest funder of organizations working on peace projects outside the British government, which has provided several billion euros worth of funds to the sector but does not provide a single figure for its investment.  For many such groups, the EU represents their largest single source of funds.  The EU has separately funded major infrastructure projects to the tune of billions of euros, including the 250-metre pedestrian bridge that links the mainly Protestant and Catholic sides of the River Foyle at Londonderry, the city where many see  The Troubles  of having first exploded in 1969.  While critics have at times questioned whether the bloc has spread its resources too thinly, its role is widely acknowledged as transformative for the region, particularly funding groups that have worked with thousands of former fighters and relatives of militants who died in the conflict.    A lot of energy was put in to supporting the process whereby these groups which were previously killing each other were working together,  said Avila Kilmurray, who managed EU PEACE funding for the reintegration of prisoners from the conflict from 1994-2014, as director of the Community Foundation for Northern Ireland.   The danger is that if there is that hiatus in terms of funding that makes it (the cooperation) much more difficult to actually maintain.   Many community workers voiced scepticism that Northern Ireland, already one of the British regions receiving the highest level of taxpayers  money, will remain a priority for the British government in the upheaval of Brexit.   In this work, I have met no one who actually believes that the Tory government care enough  to match the funding, said Kieran McEvoy, a professor at Queen s University Belfast s Institute of Conflict Transformation. At Belfast s most notorious flashpoint area - the streets between the fiercely loyalist Shankill Road and the nationalist Falls Road - former militants from both sides now work together.  Some bring children from both communities on joint holidays and contact each other during street trouble to try to calm the situation when matters start to get out of control. EU funding has been  absolutely critical  for projects that involve ex-militants, said Seanna Breathnach, a former IRA member. He works for the Coiste, which helps former fighters reintegrate into society and get jobs after leaving prison.   Activists say former prisoners have been able to influence the kind of young men who might be tempted to join dissident militants opposed to the peace deal.   The key is that young people are not sucked in - that we stop the glamorizing of violence that some people do,  Breathnach said.  Post-Brexit, activists say they will be faced with two main problems: convincing the British political establishment that Northern Ireland still needs a disproportionate level of state spending two decades after the peace; and to ensure Northern Irish politicians don t shy away from difficult projects. Kenny Donaldson is director of the South East Fermanagh Foundation, a support group for victims of militancy which gets 40-50 percent of its funding from the EU.  His fear, he said, was that many in the British political establishment did not appreciate how fragile Northern Ireland remained, with communities still harboring deep distrust of each other  We have to make that step from coexistence in isolation to meaningful integration,  he said.  While you only have coexistence you are too close to violence.   ",worldnews,"September 13, 2017 ",1
More than 50 arrested for looting in Miami during Irma: police,"MIAMI (Reuters) - Miami area police arrested more than 50 suspected looters during Hurricane Irma, including 26 people who were accused of breaking into a single Wal-Mart (WMT.N> store, authorities said on Tuesday. City officials on Tuesday lifted a local 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. curfew that had been in place since Sunday. As normality began to return, police commanders said officers will work 12-hour shifts, 24 hours a day, to discourage any more criminality.  I said we would not tolerate criminal activity or looting or anybody who takes advantage of our residents,  Deputy Chief of Police Luis Cabrera said at a news conference.  I was not joking.  The Wal-Mart incident took place on Saturday night at a store on the north side of the City of Miami, said Miami-Dade Police Department spokesman Alvaro Zabaleta. Among others suspected of looting were six men arrested on Monday and accused of breaking into stores at the Midtown Miami shopping complex, near the fashionable Wynwood district, before making off with merchandise that included shoes, bags and laptops. The looting attempts spanned the city, said Miami Mayor Tomas Regalado, from the well-heeled Brickell and downtown neighborhoods to the low-income Liberty City and Little Haiti areas. He said police will stay vigilant as the cleanup goes on. Officers have also been busy trawling roads that can be perilous for motorists because power cuts shut off traffic lights at intersections and streets have accumulated shredded vegetation spread by the storm s powerful winds.  We have never experienced, not even with Hurricane Andrew, the amount of trees that are downed in the city,  Regalado told the news conference. Hurricane Andrew hit Florida in 1992.  Since Irma began bearing down on the state late last week, authorities have been warning any would-be looters against taking advantage of the situation. Rick Maglione, the police chief of Fort Lauderdale, about 30 miles (48 km) north of Miami, told residents to stay home during the storm and look after their loved ones.  Going to prison over a pair of sneakers is a fairly bad life choice,  Maglione said in a statement. Miami police posted a photo on Facebook of several accused looters sitting in a jail cell under the caption:  Thinking about looting? Ask these guys how that turned out. #stayindoors.

"Iran arrests Islamic State member, foils attacks: Revolutionary Guards","(Reuters) - The Iranian Revolutionary Guards arrested a member of Islamic State and foiled a plan for suicide attacks, a Guards commander said on Wednesday. Col. Amin Yamini, the Guards commander for the western Tehran suburb of Shahriar, did not say when the arrest was made but said the attacks were being planned for a 10-day Shi ite religious holiday that begins next week. The Islamic State member arrested was from the Syrian branch of the militant Sunni organization and had planned to organize about 300 people to carry out suicide attacks, Yamini said, according to Basij Press, the news site for the Tehran branch of the Guards. On June 7, Islamic State attacked the parliament in Tehran and the mausoleum of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic, south of the capital, killing 18 people and wounding more than 40. Iran has blamed Saudi Arabia for being behind the deadly attacks. Riyadh has denied any involvement. The Revolutionary Guards fired several missiles at Islamic State bases in Syria on June 18 in response to that attack. According to Yamini, the Guards tracked the Islamic State organizer, who had a cell phone and satellite phone, and set up a meeting with him in the western Tehran suburb of Andisheh by posing as Islamic State members. When the person showed up, he was arrested. Valuable information has been gleaned from his cell phone, Yamini said, according to Basij Press. ",worldnews,"September 13, 2017 ",1
Britain's May presses Northern Ireland leaders to restore power-sharing government,"LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May has spoken with the leaders of Northern Ireland s two main parties to press them to restore a power-sharing government that collapsed in January. Northern Ireland s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and its nationalist rivals Sinn Fein have failed so far to agree on how to reform the devolved administration, limiting the province s influence in Brexit negotiations. A government spokeswoman said on Wednesday that May had made separate phone calls to DUP leader Arlene Foster and the leader of Sinn Fein in Northern Ireland, Michelle O Neill, to make clear  the importance of restoring a power-sharing executive to Northern Ireland as soon as possible .  They discussed key outstanding issues that remain for both parties and the prime minister encouraged both leaders to come to an agreement soon in the interests of everyone in Northern Ireland.

Turkey orders 79 school employees detained in post-coup probe: NTV,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish authorities issued detention warrants for 79 former school employees on Wednesday over alleged links to last year s failed military coup, broadcaster NTV said. They were suspected of using ByLock, an encrypted messaging app which the government says was used by the network of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom it accuses of orchestrating the abortive putsch in July 2016. The suspects worked at private schools and tutor schools which prepared students for university entrance exams, many of which used to be run by supporters of Gulen.   Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in the United States since 1999, has denied involvement and condemned the coup attempt. Since the coup attempt some 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended from jobs in the public and private sectors, including some who worked at schools founded by his supporters,  and more than 50,000 have been detained for alleged links to it. The crackdown has alarmed rights groups and some of Turkey s Western allies, who fear the government is using the coup as a pretext to quash dissent. The government, however, says Gulen s network deeply infiltrated Turkey s institutions - the army, schools and courts - and only a massive purge could neutralize the threat.

"Trump, Malaysia's Najib skirt round U.S. probe into 1MDB scandal","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump welcomed Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak to the White House on Tuesday, praising his country for investing in the United States while steering clear of an American investigation into a Malaysian corruption scandal. The visit is important for Najib, who faces elections next year and wants to signal he is still welcome at the White House despite a criminal probe by the U.S. Justice Department into a state fund called 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB). Flanked by top advisers in the Cabinet Room, Najib told Trump that Malaysia Airlines would buy 25 Boeing 737 jets and eight 787 Dreamliners, and would probably add another 25 737s in the near future - a deal he said would be worth more than $10 billion within five years.  Najib said Malaysia s Employees Provident Fund, a major pension fund, wanted to spend $3 billion to $4 billion on U.S. infrastructure development. Najib enjoyed close ties with Trump s predecessor, Barack Obama, playing golf in Hawaii in 2014, but relations cooled over human rights issues as well as the 1MDB scandal. Najib founded the fund, which is facing money laundering probes in at least six countries including the United States, Switzerland and Singapore. He denies wrongdoing.  The U.S. Justice Department has said more than $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB by high-level officials of the fund and their associates, according to dozens of civil lawsuits it filed last year.  The Justice Department sued to seize some $1.7 billion in assets it said were bought with misappropriated 1MDB funds, but asked for a stay on its civil lawsuits in August because it was conducting a related criminal probe. The White House had said it would not comment on the Justice Department investigation but a senior U.S. official acknowledged it was unusual to meet with Najib while 1MDB was under regulatory scrutiny.  It s a weird situation, no doubt,  the official said, explaining that the administration has prioritized developing relations with Southeast Asia to counter  huge gains  China has made in the region. Najib and his delegation stayed at the Trump International Hotel, according to several U.S. media reports, but the White House dismissed questions about the stay.   We certainly don t book their hotel accommodations, so I couldn t speak to the personal decision they made about where to stay here in D.C.,  White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said. In a speech to U.S. business leaders, Najib said opposition politicians had blown the 1MDB scandal out of proportion in a failed attempt to topple his government.  I know that some of you will have heard some less positive stories about the Malaysian economy, particularly about 1MDB,  Najib said.   Indeed, there was a campaign to deliberately sabotage the company   and undermine investor confidence in our economy   in a failed attempt to topple the government in-between election cycles.  He also said Malaysia s investigations into 1MDB revealed there had been some  failings . The U.S. lawsuits had alleged $681 million of the misappropriated funds from 1MDB was transferred to the account of  Malaysian Official 1 , which U.S. and Malaysian sources have previously identified as Najib. A Malaysian government investigation has cleared him of any wrongdoing. Najib s invitation to the White House was slammed by several rights groups who had urged the Trump administration to bring up Najib s record of cracking down on the media and others critics. Trump sees Malaysia, a majority Muslim nation, as an ally in its fight against Islamic militancy. It is also wants it to cut ties with North Korea.  He does not do business with North Korea any longer, and we find that to be very important,  Trump said referring to Najib. Ties between Malaysia and North Korea soured after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un s half brother was assassinated in Kuala Lumpur this year. It was also discovered that North Korea was using Malaysia as a base for its arms export and other businesses, that funneled money to Pyongyang. Before their meeting, Trump praised Najib for his tough stand on Islamic State.  He s been very, very strong on terrorism in Malaysia, and a great supporter from that standpoint.

China says futile to use trial of Taiwanese activist to attack Chinese law,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Attacks on China s legal or political system using the trial of Taiwanese activist Lee Ming-che will prove futile, China s Taiwan Affairs Office said on Wednesday after Lee s wife and supporters rejected the authority of the court that tried him. Lee, a community college teacher known for his pro-democracy and rights activism, went missing on a trip to mainland China in March. Chinese authorities later confirmed that he was being investigated on suspicion of damaging national security. Lee confessed on Monday to attempting to subvert the Beijing government, according to videos of his hearing released by Chinese authorities. His wife and supporters said the trial was not fair and that they did not recognize the court s authority. An Fengshan, a spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs office, told a regular briefing that  any attempts to use this case for political means, to influence or slander the mainland s handling of the case in accordance with the law, or to attack the mainland s political or legal systems will all be futile . The legal rights of Lee and his family had been upheld and guaranteed, he said. A meeting between Lee and his wife and mother had been arranged after the hearing at the request of his family, An said. The hearing process was broadcast by the court in videos and on social media website Weibo in what An said was an  open  trial. Activists who had traveled to Yueyang to support Lee said after the trial they had been barred from attending, saying that was proof the case was not truly open or fair. Releasing videos and transcripts of court hearings has become increasingly common in China as part of a push for greater judicial transparency and oversight. However, rights activists say that holding  open  trials in sensitive cases allows authorities to demonstrate state power as a deterrence, with statements and verdicts usually agreed in advance. Ties between Beijing and Taipei have been strained since President Tsai Ing-wen, leader of the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, took office last year. Tsai s refusal to say that Taiwan and China are part of one country has angered Beijing, as have her comments about human rights on the mainland. Beijing maintains that Taiwan is part of China and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under its control. Proudly democratic Taiwan has shown no interest in being governed by the Communist Party rulers in Beijing. ",worldnews,"September 13, 2017 ",1
"Trapped by landmines and a creek, Rohingya languish in no-man's land","COX S BAZAR, Bangladesh Reuters) - Until late last month, Syed Karim grew rice and sugarcane on a strip of unclaimed land along the international border where Myanmar ends and Bangladesh begins.  On Aug. 25, the 26-year-old Rohingya Muslim man abandoned his home in a nearby Myanmar village and moved to the no-man s land, fleeing a crackdown by the military against his community in response to militant attacks. An estimated 370,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh since that day. But Karim and thousands of his neighbors from Rohingya villages near the border face a unique predicament. They have fled to the safety of the buffer zone along the border and are now stuck. Bangladesh security forces have instructions to not let them in, said Monzurul Hassan Khan, a Bangladesh border guard officer.  Some of the Rohingya there said they are too afraid to go back to their homes but not ready to abandon them altogether and become refugees in Bangladesh.  I can see my house but can t go there,  said Karim, whose Taung Pyo Let Yar village could be seen from his shack in the no-man s land. The top U.N. human rights official has called Myanmar s operations against the Rohingya as  a textbook example of ethnic cleansing  and the Security Council is to meet behind closed doors on Wednesday to discuss the situation. The 40-acre (16.2-hectare) buffer zone, about the size of 40 soccer pitches, is strung along the border, with a barbed wire fence on the Myanmar side and a creek on the other.  Hundreds of tarpaulin bamboo shacks have come up on what used to be a paddy field, with hills in the south. Khan said 8,000 to 10,000 Rohingya had camped there. The UN refugee agency, which runs camps in Bangladesh, doesn t go there because of security reasons, said Vivian Tan, a spokeswoman for UNHCR. Tan said that they work with some NGOs to provide people in the area with plastic sheets and clothing.  Myanmar has laid landmines on its side of the border, which have wounded at least four people, Bangladesh authorities and Rohingya refugees said.     Buddhist-majority Myanmar says its security forces are fighting a legitimate campaign against  terrorists  it blames for the attacks on the security forces.        Several Bangladesh officials said they suspected that about 100 fighters from the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), the insurgents who attacked Myanmar police posts and an army base on Aug. 25, have also been spotted in the border area. Bangladeshi security officials said they learned from informers that suspected ARSA fighters were in the area early last week, after the Eid al-Adha festival.  The officials, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation, said 11 suspected fighters were also being treated in a hospital in Chittagong city, north of Cox s Bazar, which is close to the border.                         An ARSA spokesman denied that any of its fighters were using the no-man s land to launch attacks and said none of its fighters were in Bangladesh. Mostafa Kamal Uddin, Bangladesh s home secretary, said he did not have information about the presence of Rohingya militants in Bangladesh.  Karim and other Rohingya people, mostly from the border villages, said they started fleeing to the buffer zone after the Aug. 25 attacks.           Khan, the border guard officer, said their numbers swelled on Aug. 27.  We kept hearing gunshots and also saw a fire and smoke on their side of the border,  Khan said.  He pointed to two brown patches of burned trees in Taung Pyo Let Yar village from his operations base on a hilltop in Bangladesh s Gundum village near the border.  His men with automatic rifles kept watch as Rohingya children waded across the creek to fetch fresh water in aluminum pots and plastic bottles from a hand-pump on Bangladeshi soil.  A toddler, with the knee-deep waters rising to his neck, struggled with three plastic bottles, dropping one before turning around and picking it up and pressing forward. In interviews at the buffer zone, where Reuters was taken by Khan, residents of three villages - Taung Pyo Let Yar, Mee Taik and Kun Thee Pin   said they were spared in the previous big military crackdown in October last year. But things changed on Aug. 25.  Mohammed Arif, a Rohingya man from Taung Pyo Let Yar village, said he fled into the woods near the village to hide when the army came. From there, he watched a mortar shell hit his two-storey house, burning it down.  He crossed over the fence on Aug. 26 with his family. Arif said he had not seen any ARSA fighters in the no-man s land.  In our country, Buddha worshippers treat us like a virus that needs to be eliminated. We have heard them saying,  No Rohingya in Myanmar.  But we will go back,  Arif said. ",worldnews,"September 13, 2017 ",1
Average of polls puts New Zealand's ruling Nationals just ahead,"WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand s ruling National Party reclaimed a slight lead in the latest average of polls, underscoring a tight race that has unsettled investors amid uncertainty over the make-up of the next government and its trade and immigration policies. The  poll of polls  compiled by Radio New Zealand showed National s support at 41.3 percent, just ahead of Labour on 40.5 percent, giving National 51 seats in parliament and Labour 50.     Both parties would need to rely on the nationalist New Zealand First Party to form a coalition government under the country s proportional representation system as the winning party or parties need 61 of parliament s 120 seats to form government. The poll average suggests the two main parties are still neck and neck, even as individual polls point to contrasting results, with some giving a lead to Labour and others National. The uncertain outcome has thrown doubts over future policies on major issues like trade and immigration, both key drivers of New Zealand s relatively robust economic growth in recent years.  Prime Minister Bill English s National Party has vowed to support free trade as global protectionism rises, in particular, by championing the Trans-Pacific Partnership pact, which Labour has said it would renegotiate. The New Zealand dollar, the 11th most traded currency in the world, slipped to $0.7295 on Wednesday after climbing to $0.7320 overnight following a separate single poll released on Tuesday that put National well ahead of Labour.  There was a bit of a reality check this morning that this is just one poll and polls are not reliable,  said Rodrigo Catril, forex strategist at National Australia Bank.  The base case is still that whoever wins they will have to form a coalition.  The Radio New Zealand figures showed support for New Zealand First averaging 7.5 percent, while the Green Party was at 5.5 percent, giving them 9 and 7 seats respectively. New Zealand First s economic policies tend to have more in common with those of Labour, but it has formed coalitions with both major parties in the past. Polls in recent weeks have suggested widely varying outcomes from the vote. A poll on Tuesday gave the National Party a near 10-point lead over Labour, suggesting they wouldn t need NZ First to form government. Earlier polls had given Labour a sizeable lead after it gambled on a late change of leadership, installing 37-year-old Jacinda Ardern, to revive its flagging popularity.

"Israeli leader in Argentina, lauds effort to solve 1994 Jewish center bombing","BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday used the first Latin America visit of a sitting Israeli prime minister to praise President Mauricio Macri s effort to solve the bombing of a Buenos Aires Jewish center in 1994 that killed 85 people. Argentine courts have blamed the attack on Iran. But no one has been brought to trial in either that case or the deadly 1992 bombing of the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires. Iran denies playing a role in either attack.  We know without a doubt that Iran and Hezbollah initiated and backed up the attacks,  Netanyahu told reporters. Hezbollah is an Islamist militant group based in Lebanon. He praised fellow conservative Macri for jump-starting efforts to solve the crimes. Critics accuse previous Argentine leader Cristina Fernandez of trying to improve ties with Iran rather than focusing on bringing the bombers to justice.  He strengthened Argentina s position compared with what it was before. I honor his commitment and the integrity of his effort to determine what happened,  Netanyahu said. Under Fernandez, the prosecutor probing the attack on the AMIA Jewish community center was found dead in January 2015, just hours before he was to appear in Congress to outline his accusation that Fernandez had tried to clear the way for a  grains for oil  deal with Iran by whitewashing Iran s role in the truck bombing.  The prosecutor, Alberto Nisman, was discovered on the floor of his Buenos Aires apartment with a pistol by his side and a bullet in his head. The death was classified as a suicide, but Nisman s family and friends dismissed that idea as absurd. Opinion polls show most Argentines believe his death was a homicide. Macri won the presidency and succeeded Fernandez in late 2015. He has since boosted ties with the United States and Israel while trying to attract the foreign investment he says is needed to stimulate an economy damaged by the inflationary policies and heavy currency controls of the Fernandez years. Macri has met with Nisman s family and says he has made a high priority of solving his death and the AMIA bombing. Netanyahu and Macri are also  in ideological harmony  on issues like free trade, development and security, Israel s ambassador to Argentina Ilan Sztulman told local radio. Netanyahu is traveling with executives of 30 Israeli companies looking to increase trade with Latin America. They include cyber security, irrigation and other agricultural technology firms that could help Argentina reinforce its position as the world s top exporter of soymeal livestock feed and a major supplier of corn and raw soybeans. After Argentina, Netanyahu will visit Colombia and Mexico before addressing the United Nations General Assembly on Sept. 19. The diplomatic flurry might take domestic attention off two corruption investigations centering on Netanyahu in Israel. He was accompanied on the trip by his wife Sara Netanyahu. On Friday, Israel s attorney general said he was considering indicting her on suspicion of using state funds for personal dining and catering services amounting to some $100,000.

Trump likely to visit China during November Asia trip: U.S. official,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is likely to make a stop in China in November during his first official visit to Asia, a U.S. official said on Tuesday, a trip that will come amid tensions over North Korea s nuclear tests. Washington and its allies have said there is a growing urgency for China, North Korea s top ally and trading partner, to apply more pressure on its already isolated neighbor to get it to back down on its nuclear weapons and missiles programs. Chinese President Xi Jinping had invited Trump to visit China during their meeting in April in Palm Beach, Florida. The two leaders also met on the sidelines on the G20 summit in July. Trump is set to attend the U.S.-ASEAN summit and the East Asia summit in the Philippines in November, as well as the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Vietnam. China s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Trump s potential visit. Japanese public broadcaster NHK cited unnamed diplomatic sources saying that Trump was also considering visiting Japan and South Korea during his Asian tour in November. In February, Trump accepted Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s invitation to visit Japan by the end of the year.  The February agreement is still valid. We would definitely like to make it happen sometime within this year. But no specific timing has been fixed yet,  a Japanese Foreign Ministry official said. Also, the Japanese daily Yomiuri Shimbun said on Wednesday Japan, the United States and South Korea are in final stages of talks to hold a trilateral summit on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York. The newspaper, citing unnamed government sources, reported the meeting between Trump, Abe and South Korean President Moon Jae-in could take place on Sept. 21 and would focus on bolstering cooperation in response to North Korean provocation. On Monday, the U.N. Security Council unanimously voted to step up sanctions on North Korea, with its profitable textile exports now banned and fuel supplies capped. After several days of negotiations on the resolution, Washington dropped several measures to win the support of Russia and China, including a bid for an oil embargo and the blacklisting of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and the national airline. In Hong Kong, former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon told the South China Morning Post the results of a U.S.-led investigation into alleged Chinese intellectual property theft would be announced before the Beijing summit to reset bilateral trade. The far-right architect of Trump s 2016 election victory, Bannon told an investor conference, organized by a unit of China s largest brokerage, that Trump and Xi had a rapport that should enable them to work out differences, said an attendee at the meeting which was closed to the press. Bannon, who was let go by Trump last month, told a private lunch gathering in Hong Kong that he still  speaks with President Donald Trump every two to three days,  the Wall Street Journal reported.

"France says Venezuela talks to take place, warns of sanctions","PARIS (Reuters) - Venezuela s government and opposition will hold a round of talks in the Dominican Republic on Wednesday, France s foreign minister said on Tuesday, warning Caracas that it risked EU sanctions if it failed to engage in negotiations.  Venezuela was convulsed for months by demonstrations against leftist President Nicolas Maduro, accused by critics of knocking the oil-rich country into its worst-ever economic crisis and bringing it to the brink of dictatorship.  I was happy to learn that dialogue with the opposition would restart tomorrow in the Dominican Republic,  Jean-Yves Le Drian said in a statement after meeting his Venezuelan counterpart, Jorge Arreaza Montserrat, in Paris.  Venezuela s Democratic Unity Coalition said it would send a delegation to meet with Dominican President Danilo Medina to discuss the conditions under which dialogue could be held, but denied that any talks as such had begun.  The invitation by (Medina) does NOT represent the start of a formal dialogue with the government,  the coalition said in a statement.  To begin serious negotiations, we demand immediate concrete actions that show true willingness to solve problems rather than to buy time.  The statement reiterated long standing opposition demands including the release of political prisoners, respect for the opposition-run congress and measures to ease a crippling economic crisis. Le Drian said Wednesday s meeting would involve Medina and former Spanish Prime Minister Jos  Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed his full support for the talks.  The Secretary-General encourages the Venezuelan political actors to seize this opportunity to demonstrate their commitment to address the country s challenges through mediation and peaceful means,  U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement. Maduro routinely calls for dialogue with the opposition, but his adversaries see dialogue as a stalling mechanism that burnishes the government s image without producing concrete results. In a televised broadcast on Tuesday evening, he voiced renewed support for dialogue and said he was sending Socialist Party heavyweight Jorge Rodriguez to represent the government in the Dominican Republic.     A dialogue process brokered by Zapatero and backed by the Vatican in 2016 did little to advance opposition demands. Many Maduro critics believe opposition leaders were duped in that dialogue process, and have grown suspicious of Zapatero as an intermediary.  Like fellow-EU member Spain a few days earlier, Le Drian also warned Arreaza that if the situation continued there would be consequences.   I reminded him of the risk of European sanctions and the need to rapidly see evidence from Venezuela that it is ready to relaunch negotiations with the opposition and engage in a sincere and credible process,  he said.

Hardliners protest French labor reform after Macron chides 'slackers',"PARIS (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of hard-left trade unionists marched through French cities on Tuesday to protest against President Emmanuel Macron s labor law reforms, although turnout appeared lower than at demonstrations in previous years. Hitting back at Macron s pledge to give no ground to  slackers , some in Paris carried placards reading:  Slacker on Strike  while in Bordeaux demonstrators chanted:  Macron you re screwed, the slackers are in the streets.  The interior ministry said 223,000 protesters turned out across the country, compared with about 400,000 during March 2016 s demonstration. Riot police clashed with hooded youths in isolated skirmishes on the fringe of the march led by the Communist Party-linked CGT union in Paris. The union said some 400,000 had marched across France, down from its estimate for 2016 of 1.2 million. Labor unions have scuppered previous attempts to weaken France s labor code, but this time there was comfort for Macron as two other unions, including the largest, the CFDT, declined to join the protests.  We ve been passing laws which take apart the labor code for 20 years. The answer (to unemployment) doesn t lie in rolling it back further,  said Maxime Durand, a train driver on strike. After weeks of negotiation, the government last month set out measures including a cap on payouts for dismissals judged unfair and greater freedom for companies to hire and fire.  The reform makes no direct reference to the 35-hour week, a totem of the labor code, though it hands firms more flexibility to set pay and working conditions. The government plans to adopt the new measures, being implemented by decree, on Sept. 22. During a trip to Athens on Friday, Macron told the local French community:  I am fully determined and I won t cede any ground, not to slackers, nor cynics, nor hardliners.  He said the  slackers  comment was aimed at those who had failed to push through reforms in the past, although political opponents and some unions took it as an attack on the unemployed or on workers making the most of job protection.  We will make Macron back down,  far-left firebrand Jean-Luc Melenchon, who has become Macron s most vocal opponent in parliament, said on the sidelines of a protest in Marseille.  French workers have long cherished the rights enshrined in the labor code, but companies complain it has deterred investment and job creation and stymied economic growth. Unemployment has been above 9 percent for nearly a decade. Macron s reforms are being followed in Germany as a test of his resolve to reshape the euro zone s second-biggest economy, a must if he is to win Berlin s backing for broader reforms to the currency union. The CGT is France s second-biggest union, though its influence has been waning. Its leader Philippe Martinez said Tuesday s nationwide protests were the  first phase  and more would follow. He called Macron s reference to  slackers  an insult to workers.  The president should listen to the people, understand them, rather than cause divisions,  Martinez told France 2 television. CGT workers from the rail, oil and power sectors heeded the strike call but by the afternoon there was no apparent impact on power and refining production, spokespeople for utility EDF (EDF.PA) and oil major Total (TOTF.PA) said. Just over 11 percent of the workforce at EDF, which operates France s fleet of 48 nuclear reactors, took part in the strike, a spokeswoman for the state-owned utility said. Macron landed in the French Caribbean on Tuesday to survey the devastation wrought by Hurricane Irma on the territory of Saint Martin. Governments on the political left and right have been trying for decades to overhaul the 3,000-page labor code, but ended up watering down their plans in the face of street demonstrations. Macron was economy minister in the Socialist government of president Francois Hollande, whose attempt at labor reform led to weeks of protests that at their peak brought 400,000 onto the streets, and stoked a rebellion within his own party. Hollande was forced to dilute his proposals, but so far there are no signs of Macron feeling compelled to back down. An opinion poll published on Sept. 1 indicated that voters have mixed views on the reform. Nearly six in 10 said they opposed Macron s labor decrees overall. But when respondents looked at individual measures, most received majority support. With economic growth accelerating, unemployment on a downward trend and the leading unions divided in their response to the reforms, it is not clear whether the protests will gain significant momentum.

Macron may see 'slackers' become protest rallying cry in France,"PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron s remark that he will not bow to  slackers  who resist labor reforms looked set to dog the image-conscious French leader, with opponents casting him as a champion of the wealthy and big business. The Elysee Palace and government ministers have scrambled to contain the fallout, saying the 39-year-old was referring to past leaders who lacked the courage to push through unpopular changes and accusing his opponents of twisting his comments. Macron, who on Tuesday visited islands in the Caribbean damaged by Hurricane Irma, has himself shown little contrition.  I am fully determined and I won t cede any ground, not to slackers, nor cynics, nor hardliners,  he said on Friday during a trip to Greece. His opponents were quick to pounce, branding him an out-of-touch president who has put himself above the person in the street.  Fools, cynics, slackers, everyone take to the streets on Sept. 12 and 23,  Jean-Luc Melenchon, leader of the hard-left France Unbowed party, said on Twitter, referring to two days of street protests. Philippe Martinez, head of the far-left CGT trade union, called Macron s comment  scandalous .  Who is the president referring to when he says he won t give an inch to slackers? To the millions without a job or in a vulnerable position?  Macron s centrist government announced measures in August to hand more power to companies to set working conditions and adapt pay to market conditions, as well as making it easier to hire and fire employees.  The president says the measures are needed to spur job creation, boost growth and attract investment. Unions say workers  rights are being eroded and benefits undermined. Macron faced his first challenge on the streets on Tuesday when thousands of CGT trade unionists protested in cities across France.  In Bordeaux, protesters chanted:  Macron you re screwed, the slackers are in the streets  while in Paris others carried placards reading:  Slacker on strike . Asked on Monday if he regretted his comment, he replied:  We cannot move forward if we don t tell it like it is.   It s Macron s style,  said Jerome Fourquet of pollster IFOP.  He s not going to back down, make apologies. That carries a risk.   Macron is not the first French leader to offend people with a casual comment. Former president Nicolas Sarkozy caused uproar while interior minister when in 2005 he branded youths behind the worst urban violence in France in decades as  racaille  ( scum  or  rabble ). That remark entrenched Sarkozy s reputation as a bully in the suburbs blighted by crime and unemployment outside Paris. Sarkozy s successor, Francois Hollande, suffered with the publication of a tell-all book in which his former partner accused the Socialist leader of describing the poor as  toothless , undermining his efforts to portray himself as in touch with the needy. Before joining a protest in Marseille, Melenchon, who bills himself as a champion of French workers and rails against globalisation, said:  Mr Macron knows he has a battle on his hands. He picked it.  ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1
Draining the swamp: Hard-hit Everglades town mops up after Irma,"EVERGLADES CITY, Fla. (Reuters) - As Hurricane Irma raged through Everglades City, a tiny fishing village in a vast alligator-infested swamp, Howie Grimm hunkered down inside his house with his 88-year-old mother, a useless cell phone and a new job title. He had been acting mayor for less than a week. When the winds started to wane, he jumped in his truck and moved his mother to a higher perch   a trailer on stilts   because he knew a storm surge would follow the eye of the storm. He watched from the trailer as the surge swallowed his truck.  And that s how it all started, my   what do you call it?   mayorism?  he recalled with a laugh on Monday, as he leaned on a flooded forklift in front of his business, Grimm s Seafood. While most of South Florida was spared the worst of the dangerous storm, this remote hamlet of about 400 residents in the southwest part of the state, felt the full wrath of Irma s winds and waves. And yet residents here seemed to take it in stride, surveying the damage with a good humor and a shrug of the shoulders. Little help had arrived from the outside world the day after the storm, but no one here seemed to be asking for much help, either. In a town surrounded by marshlands, storms and floods are part of the deal.  The few residents that remained in this outpost for Irma s landfall on Sunday watched a surge up to eight feet high inundate roughly half of the homes and businesses - all the ones that were not up on stilts - and cake the town in gray swamp slime. Sammy Hamilton, 83, the city s mayor for 22 years until last week, lost two buildings housing tourism businesses, along with several vessels. One of his 55-foot tour boats ended up in a tree   an ornament of sorts.  That s how we decorate here for Christmas,  said Hamilton, who stepped down over his handling of the town s sewer plant, which had fallen out of compliance with state environmental regulations and faces a major overhaul.  The Florida Department of Environmental Protection sued the city in 2015, after inspectors caught the plant pumping sewage into nearby mangroves. Few residents expressed much anger with Hamilton over the sewer plant or his resignation days before a major flood.  I love the old mayor,  said Grimm, the acting mayor, who had criticized Hamilton s handling of the sewer debacle.  He s done a lot of good. He just decided he d had enough.  Everglades City is isolated geographically and culturally from the rest of South Florida by 1.5 million aces of preserved wetlands. Founded in the late 1800s, it later became the last stop on the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad. Its historic Rod and Gun Club, which has hosted a half dozen U.S. presidents, including Harry Truman when he dedicated the swampland surrounding the city as a national park in 1947. Today, the city s economy rests on three main commodities: stone crabs, alligators and airboats. The commercial catch of stone crabs once played a bigger role than tourism - which primarily involves scouting alligators on airboats - but that mix is changing, said Vicky Wells, a fifth-generation resident. Her brother was among those who happily made the switch from processing crabs to toting tourists around on airboats.  It was a lot more money for a lot easier work,  Wells said.   People here do whatever they need to do to feed their family.  And many do whatever is needed to protect their family from wind and water. Having weathered many storms, the Wells family built their home a decade ago to withstand a major hurricane. Vicky s husband, Bob Wells, 72, drove pilings 23 feet into the ground and used rebar to reinforce a concrete foundation every two feet. He encased the windows in concrete, too.  We built this thing to stay. It stayed,  Bob said.  Across the street from the Wells  home, Ricky Collins, a 68-year-old Everglades City native, washed muck from his driveway as his grandson pushed it out of his house with a broom. The flood didn t rattle him, and he didn t think it would change how his neighbors, even the newer arrivals, viewed living there.  The difference in this town now is that we have a lot of foreigners   I mean, people from out of state,  he said.  But they ll stay, too. They ll probably do better than we will, because they have better insurance and everything.  Among the newcomers is Marlene Sassaman, 69, who moved here four years ago. She stayed for the storm and spent the next day mopping the mud out of her first floor.  If you have a strong house, you re fine,  Sassaman said As for the departure of the old mayor, she said she preferred to steer clear of any controversy.  Let s just say he  retired.  I don t want to go there,  she said.  He was born and bred here, and his pappy was born and bred here   I really love this place, because it s one of the last small towns in the country.

"After Irma, a mixed journey home for Florida evacuees","ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - After fleeing homes in Hurricane Irma s path several days ago, Florida residents Lee Tinkler and Mercedes Lopez on Tuesday faced far different prospects as they departed from the Orlando hotels where they sought refuge. Tinkler, a retiree from Jupiter, Florida, said she was about to end  the best experience of my life  after waiting out the storm at a high-end convention hotel with her two daughters, their two babies and seven cats.  But at a nearby Days Inn, Lopez s spirits were low as she shared a bucket of fried chicken with four families from the Florida Keys bunking together in two cramped rooms. They were returning to salvage belongings from destroyed homes.  I don t have a house, I don t have a job,  said Lopez, 50, who works for a gas station that was also devastated.  We go back to nothing.  They are part of a complicated return home after the largest evacuation in U.S. history which saw 6.5 million people flee the storm in Florida.   After surviving what began as one of the fiercest Atlantic storms in a century, many are returning with conflicting emotions. The relief of going home is at times overwhelmed by the logistics of the trip and then putting their pre-storm lives back together. On social media, travelers traded advice on how to avoid the chaotic scenes many experienced on the way out: long lines for gasoline and traffic so bad that people slept in their cars. Hoping to avoid such congestion, Cathy Bobal, a 59-year-old retiree from Coconut Creek, Florida, decided on Tuesday to spend a fifth night in Orlando before leaving at 3 a.m.  As she arranged her check-out from the Rosen Center, which reduced rates and waived pet and parking fees for evacuees, others were checking in.  It s round two,  she said.  People are coming in because they don t have power.  Tinkler, 73, left with plans to return the next time a hurricane menaced her home.  I want to live in this world forever,  she said, envisioning disaster reunions with the other guests.  We had a party.   Across town, the group from Marathon, Florida, was ending five nights at Days Inn not knowing whether authorities would even allow them back into their homes.  It s a total disaster. Our house was destroyed. I ve seen the pictures,  said Heidi Hernandez, 23, a school teacher.  We re going down there to salvage what we can and then come back up.

Factbox: About 5.8 million without power in U.S. Southeast after Irma -  utilities,"(Reuters) - Power outages from Hurricane Irma dropped to about 5.8 million customers in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Alabama by Tuesday afternoon, down from a peak of over 7.4 million late Monday, according to utilities in the affected region. Most remaining outages were in Florida Power & Light s service area in the southern and eastern parts of the state. FPL, a unit of NextEra Energy Inc and the state s largest power company, said its total outages dipped to about 2.5 million customers by Tuesday evening from a peak of over 3.6 million early on Monday. FPL said it expects to restore essentially all of its customers in the eastern portion of the state by the weekend and the harder-hit western portion Florida by Sept. 22. The company warned, however, it would take longer to restore power to customers who suffered tornado damage or severe flooding. Outages in Florida for Duke Energy Corp, which serves the northern and central parts of the state, fell to around 1 million customers by Tuesday afternoon, down from a peak of about 1.2 million on Monday, according to the company s website. Irma hit southwestern Florida on Sunday morning as a dangerous Category 4 storm, the second-highest level on the five-notch Saffir-Simpson scale. It gradually weakened to a tropical storm and then a tropical depression on Monday. In Georgia, utilities reported over 1.1 million customers without power on Tuesday, down from a peak of around 1.3 million late Monday. Other big power utilities in Florida include units of Emera Inc and Southern Co, which also operates the biggest electric companies in Georgia and Alabama. ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1
Guatemala federal auditor to probe president's pay bonus,"GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - Guatemala s federal auditor on Tuesday said it will investigate a salary bonus the Defense Ministry gives to President Jimmy Morales that raises his earnings by more than a third, making him one of the best paid leaders in Latin America.  The federal comptroller, which audits all government spending, said in a statement it had asked for information on the previously unknown 50,000 quetzals ($7,300)  Bonus for Extraordinary Responsibility  that is not officially part of the president s salary package. Defense Minister William Mansilla on Tuesday confirmed that Morales had since December 2016 received the payment, which lifts the president s salary to $27,400 a month.   The president didn t ask for it. Instead, it was a group decision by the army,  Mansilla said in a press conference.  A technical board of auditors determined the bonus.  The revelation of the unusual salary perk comes at an awkward time for the beleaguered Morales, who managed to retain his immunity from prosecution on Monday.  Congress voted overwhelmingly to protect him after the attorney general submitted a request to investigate Morales over suspected financing irregularities during his 2015 election campaign. [nL2N1LS1EV] Last month, Guatemala s attorney general and the U.N.-backed International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) jointly sought to investigate Morales, a former comedian, over the illegal financing allegation. Two days later, Morales declared the head of the U.N. body  persona non grata.  Under the leadership of Ivan Velasquez, a veteran Colombian prosecutor, CICIG has caused problems for Morales, first investigating his son and brother then aiming at him. The Defense Ministry on Tuesday posted on its website documents, dated Jan. 1, 2016, that detailed the payment to the president and various other military officials.  The considerations (for the bonus) were due to his position and the risks and dangers that (Morales) undertakes,  Mansilla said in explaining the army s reasoning for the payment.  Former Presidents Alfonso Portillo and Alvaro Colom told Reuters they had not received such a bonus. The president s office did not respond to requests for comment.  The salary bonus means that Morales earns 70 percent more than Chilean leader Michelle Bachelet and 130 percent more than Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, two of the region s best paid top officials.  The bonus is also 90 times the $300 minimum wage in Guatemala, where 60 percent of the population lives in poverty. ",worldnews,"September 13, 2017 ",1
Brazil's top court approves new graft probe of President Temer,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - A Brazilian Supreme Court judge on Tuesday authorized an investigation of President Michel Temer for suspected corruption involving a decree regulating ports, adding to graft allegations the president has so far parried with backing from Congress. The new investigation is based on a wiretapped conversation of a former Temer aide, Rodrigo Rocha Loures, who, according to court documents, discussed shaping the decree in return for bribes channeled from a port operator to the president. In his ruling, Justice Luis Roberto Barroso said the new probe was warranted because Brazil s top prosecutor, Rodrigo Janot, had found  strong indications  of crimes, given that the decree signed by Temer answered part of the demands made by logistics firm Rodrimar SA. Temer s lawyer said in a statement sent to the Supreme Court that the allegations against the president are  contaminated by untruths and malicious distortions.  The decree was publicly debated and benefited all port operators and not just Rodrimar, it said. Rodrimar also denied that it had received any special treatment from the government. The company said the decree in question partially addressed widespread demands from Brazil s port operators. Temer has denied any role in the corruption scandals that have come to light during a sprawling three-year investigation of political bribery in Brazil. His lawyers have also challenge the plea bargain deal that yielded the wiretap of Rocha Loures, arguing that the billionaire beef tycoon who arranged the recordings was unfairly favored by a close aide to Janot. Last month, Temer s allies in Congress easily blocked a corruption charge leveled by Janot. He is also expected to beat additional charges that Janot could level this week before leaving office. The latest investigation approved by the court adds more allegations to the mix. Brazil s currency, the real, posted its biggest daily drop in nearly a month, slipping 0.8 percent against the U.S. dollar as the investigation and a separate police probe into Temer s allies kept pressure on the president. Temer s success in beating back accusations had bolstered bets that he would be able to return focus to his market-friendly proposals to overhaul Brazil s tax and social security policies, tackling a record deficit.

"Brazil police suspect Temer, aides involved in corruption","BRASILIA/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil s federal police suspect that President Michel Temer, alongside a group of close aides from his party, participated in illicit acts that rendered him up to 31.5 million reais ($10 million) in advantages and other perks. In a report on Monday, police said there were indications that Temer, 77, and the so-called  Gang of the Lower House  might have engaged in active and passive corruption acts, fraud and other crimes. The report was sent to the Federal Supreme Court, the only court with the authority to investigate a sitting president. While the report did not specify what advantages Temer might have obtained, it identified a series of transfers made from companies such as Odebrecht SA, and cash stemming from state contracts. The report gathered data from recent testimonies that incriminated Temer in the campaign financing of at least one ally. According to the police, Temer s Chief of Staff Eliseu Padilha and Wellington Moreira Franco, Temer s privatization tzar, were also named in the investigation, which started in 2015.  The report could provide additional evidence for a second formal corruption accusation against Temer in as many months. Prosecutor-General Rodrigo Janot, whose term expires at the end of this week, filed the first almost two months ago but lower house lawmakers voted to drop it, alleging lack of sufficient evidence. Temer has been a central figure in the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party for decades, helping create a solid bloc in the lower house that has participated in the past four administrations. He became Brazil s vice president in 2011 and replaced his predecessor Dilma Rousseff when she was impeached last year for doctoring budget accounts. Press representatives of Temer, who enjoys immunity from prosecution in lower-tier courts, said in a statement he  does not participate nor has ever been part of a criminal gang,  noting  he has never made use of any state structure to directly or indirectly extract any benefits from public office.  Padilha said he would only respond to the accusation when he has access to the document. Moreira Franco told Reuters he has never participated in any illicit act. The investigation also includes Eduardo Cunha, a former lower house speaker who accelerated Rousseff s ouster and is jailed for his involvement in a massive bribery scandal.

Macron vows Caribbean rebuild as anger rises against European powers,"PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron vowed to quickly rebuild the islands of the French Caribbean during a visit on Tuesday meant to dispel anger at his government s response to Hurricane Irma, which killed at least 43 people in the region.  The clutch of Caribbean islands hardest hit by the storm were mainly overseas territories belonging to Britain, France and the Netherlands, whose tens of thousands of residents are European Union citizens. The U.S. Virgin Islands were also hard hit. European countries and the United States have sent troops to deliver aid and provide security after the storm toppled homes and hospitals, but locals and tourists short of food or shelter say help was slow to arrive. Macron, who is also facing the first test at home of his resolve to reform the economy with a day of protests against his labor reforms, denied that authorities reacted too slowly. Basic services in the region were lost after Irma, weakening law and order, and looting erupted on some islands. Haiti s government said on Tuesday more than 10,000 people were in shelters after heavy rains flooded the former French colony. Britain was forced to reinforce its marines on the British Virgin Islands after more than 100  very serious  inmates escaped after a prison was breached in the storm, Alan Duncan, Britain s minister for Europe and the Americas, said on Tuesday.  It was not clear if the prisoners had been captured.  Macron was due to travel on Tuesday to St. Martin, an island France shares with the Netherlands that suffered some of the worst devastation from Irma. Most of the 10 people killed by Irma lived on French territories there.  St. Martin will be reborn, I promise,  Macron told reporters in Pointe-a-Pitre, on the French island of Guadeloupe.  I will shake up all the rules and procedures so the job is done as quickly as possible. It will be done quickly, it will be done well, and it will be done better.  Macron said 50 million euros will be made available as soon as possible, and 2,000 security forces have been deployed, including the army, roughly double the original contingent. The French government has said it would take at least three months for water distribution to normalize. The electricity supply has also been badly hit, authorities said. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson traveled on Tuesday to the Caribbean to visit British territories devastated by Irma. Among the hardest hit islands were the British Virgin Islands, Anguilla, plus Antigua and Barbuda.    He is very keen to see for himself the devastation, to reassure governors who have done a magnificent job under quite the most incredible pressure,  Duncan said. Four people died on Anguilla, up from one reported previously, Duncan said, while the death toll on the British Virgin Islands rose by one to five. Speaking on CNN, Stacey Plaskett, delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives for the U.S. Virgin Islands, said there was no real looting occurring, but rather desperate people scrambling for scarce supplies.  Our airport, the terminal looks as if grenades have been inside there and bombed the places out,  she said.  This is not anything that we could ve been prepared for.

North Korea says Peru throwing 'gas on the fire' of nuclear spat,"LIMA (Reuters) - North Korea s ambassador to Peru said Tuesday that Lima s decision to expel him was akin to  throwing gasoline on the fire  on the dispute over Pyongyang s nuclear tests that it would continue to pursue  without wavering.  Peru declared the ambassador, Kim Hak-Chol, a persona non grata on Monday to protest North Korea s refusal to heed the world s  constant calls  to end its nuclear program - giving him five days to leave the Andean country.  The bilateral and diplomatic measure taken yesterday by the Peruvian government lacks judicial and moral reasoning and doesn t further world peace and security at all,  Kim said, reading from a statement at a news conference in Lima.  To the contrary, it throws gasoline on the fire for which we express protest and regret,  Kim added before declining to take questions from reporters. Peru s decision to expel Kim followed a similar move by Mexico last week and a public call from the United States last month for Latin American countries to sever ties with North Korea. Peruvian Foreign Minister Ricardo Luna said the move was strongly rooted in international law as reflected by new U.N. sanctions against North Korea passed on Monday.  It s inappropriate to maintain relations with that country,  Luna said in broadcast comments to journalists.  Though we haven t broken off ties, by expelling him the level of diplomats in charge of relations is lowered.  North Korea has faced growing condemnation from around the world following its sixth and largest nuclear test this month which fueled fears it could spark war. U.S. President Donald Trump has described the boosted sanctions passed by the U.N. Security Council on Monday as  nothing compared to what ultimately will have to happen.  Kim condemned the sanctions as part of the hostility from the United States regarding North Korea that he said has forced Pyongyang to pursue nuclear tests as a dissuasive measure.  That s a problem between us and the United States,  Kim said.  We ll continue without wavering on the path of justice that we ve chosen despite the slander and defamation from the United States because we re certain our cause is just and will triumph.  Kim will leave Peru as requested and two diplomats will remain in charge of the embassy, an embassy representative said. Peru does not have any diplomats in North Korea. Pyongyang opened its embassy in Peru in the 1980s during the first government of former President Alan Garcia, which bought weapons from North Korea at a discount for police. Trade between the two countries is minimal. ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1
Quake pitches past into present in scarred Mexico City district,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The powerful earthquake that rocked Mexico City last week had terrifying echoes of a more deadly 1985 shock in one housing project, raising tough questions about how ready one of the world s largest cities is for a major catastrophe. At its epicenter, Thursday s 8.1 magnitude quake was stronger than the disaster three decades ago that killed at least 5,000 people in Mexico City, toppling two tower blocks in the historic central neighborhood of Tlatelolco. Mexico City has made major advances since then, with regular earthquake simulations, improved building regulations, and seismic alarms designed to sound long enough before the shock to give residents time to flee. Nearly 100 people are known to have died in the latest quake, none of them in the capital. Yet experts noted the tremor s epicenter was further from Mexico City and two times deeper than in 1985, and warned it would be wrong to assume the capital could now rest easy. Such caution was palpable in Tlatelolco. Antonio Fonseca, 66, a longtime resident who witnessed the 1985 collapse of the tower blocks in the Nuevo Leon housing complex that killed at least 200 people, said memories of the event sparked panic attacks in the neighborhood when the quake rolled through the city on Thursday.  I m quite sure that these buildings are very well reinforced,  said Fonseca, a local history expert.  But there are many people who are still wary.  When the ground began shaking in September 1985, local workers laughed it off at first, continuing with breakfast. Nobody believed Fonseca when he told them Nuevo Leon had fallen, he recalled. Later, Fonseca saw a group of children in the neighborhood s central Plaza de las Tres Culturas who had been waiting for the school bus, their uniforms caked in white dust from the building s collapse.  This time around, residents feared the worst. Streets filled across the city when the quake hit near midnight. Crying and praying, hundreds descended onto the plaza and some stayed for hours, questioning whether it was safe to return home. Minerva de la Paz Uribe, a retiree living on the plaza, was unable to evacuate with her father, who turned 104 the next day. She watched from her window as neighbors scrambled to escape.  People leave running with their dogs. They leave screaming. Are we prepared? No, no, we re not prepared,  she said, as a group of friends on the plaza murmured in agreement. Some 30 buildings in Tlatelolco were rebuilt after the 1985 disaster and a dozen were demolished. Mexico s new skyscrapers include hydraulic shock absorbers and deep foundations. But such safety features are less prevalent in much of the sprawling periphery, which is filled with cheap cinderblock homes like the buildings that collapsed on Thursday in the southern states of Oaxaca and Chiapas near the epicenter. Situated at the intersection of three tectonic plates, Mexico is one of the world s most earthquake-prone countries, and the capital is particularly vulnerable due to its location on top of an ancient lake bed.  The government s widely panned response to the 1985 quake caused upheaval in Mexico, which some credited with weakening the one-party rule of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). After 71 years, the PRI was finally voted out in 2000. Signs of government incompetence, or worse, persist. Mexican news website Animal Politico on Monday reported that thousands of seismic alarms acquired by the government of Oaxaca five years ago were never distributed, with some appearing for sale on online auction sites. A spokesman for Oaxaca s civil protection authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mistrust of government has spurred some to form community groups. Among the most famous are the Tlatelolco Topos, or moles, formed from rescue squads that dug survivors and corpses out of the rubble in 1985, and have since traveled the world offering assistance in quakes and landslides. But disasters have a habit of catching people off guard. Georgina Mendez de Schaafsma was returning from taking children to school when the 1985 temblor struck Tlatelolco. To her horror, she realized her six-year-old daughter was home alone. Racing back, Mendez retrieved the girl. But three other relatives died in the Nuevo Leon collapses. Now 70, Mendez still lives in the same building, which had a number of floors removed after the 1985 quake. She stayed indoors when the tremors began on Thursday night and believes Mexico City is better equipped today - up to a point.  In a catastrophe, I think we re never prepared,  she said.  Nature is stronger.  ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1
Violent street protests break out in Haiti over tax hikes,"PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - Protesters in Haiti damaged commercial buildings in the capital city and set cars on fire on Tuesday, angered by government tax hikes that come at a time when foreign aid is declining. The Port-au-Prince protest, called by former presidential candidate Jean-Charles Moise, took many by surprise and represents the biggest outcry against the administration of President Jovenel Moise since he took office earlier this year.  The revolution has just started. Jovenel Moise will have to retract his taxes or he will have to leave immediately,  said Jacques Menard, a 31-year-old protester.  And this is a warning because the next phase can be very violent.  Protesters took to the streets in separate groups in several districts in the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince, erecting flaming barricades, blocking traffic, and confronting riot police, who fired tear gas and warning shots in the air. Several people were arrested, the police said, but there were no reports of any deaths or serious injuries. Lawmakers last weekend approved an unpopular budget that raises taxes on products including cigarettes, alcohol and passports. At the same time, foreign aid to Haiti is slowing. The country is one of the poorest in the Americas and suffered a devastating earthquake in 2010 and the worst of hurricane Matthew last year.   If Jovenel Moise is intelligent, he should refrain from publishing the budget, otherwise he will have to face a series of street demonstrations that will further complicate the situation,  Jean-Charles Moise said on local radio.  Government officials were not immediately available for comment, but Economy and Finance Minister Jude Alix Patrick Salomon defended the budget over the weekend.  There are people who are blaming many things on the budget that are not true,  Salomon told reporters shortly after the spending plan was approved.  There are people manipulating the public opinion.

"Biafra separatists, Nigerian army disagree over siege allegations","ONITSHA, Nigeria (Reuters) - A group campaigning for the secession of a part of southeastern Nigeria, formerly known as Biafra, on Tuesday accused the army of laying siege to their leader s home, a charge the armed forces denied.  Rising tensions prompted the governor of Abia state, where the leader s residence is located, to impose a curfew.  Members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) group said soldiers had surrounded the home of leader Nnamdi Kanu. Groups have stepped up calls for secession since Kanu was released on bail in April after being detained for nearly two years on charges of criminal conspiracy and belonging to an illegal society.  There was no surrounding of Nnamdi Kanu s residence. It is not true,  said army spokesman Sani Usman.  Secessionist sentiment has simmered in the region since the Biafra separatist rebellion tipped Africa s most populous country into a civil war in 1967-70 that killed an estimated one million people. The military presence in southeastern Nigeria has increased in the last few weeks to crack down on crime. The IPOB also said that soldiers stormed Kanu s family compound on Sunday, which the army also denied.  Politicians waded into the dispute on Tuesday. Abia state governor Okezie Ikpeazu said in a statement that people were advised to observe a curfew from 6 p.m. (1700 GMT) to 6 a.m. (0500 GMT) from Sept. 12 to Sept. 14.  A caucus of southeastern lawmakers in the Senate, the upper chamber of parliament, said in a statement through its chairman Enyinnaya Abaribe that the military had sent a  strong signal that the region is under siege, which should not be so in a democracy . Renewed calls for Biafran secession prompted President Muhammadu Buhari to use his first speech after returning from three months of medical leave in Britain, in August, to say Nigeria s unity was  not negotiable . Amnesty International in 2016 accused Nigeria s security forces of killing at least 150 Biafra separatists at peaceful rallies. The military and police denied the allegations.

Lights still out for 5.8 million U.S. customers after Irma,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some 5.8 million homes and businesses in Florida and nearby states still had no power on Tuesday after the pummeling from Hurricane Irma, as utility companies scrambled to get the lights back on in one of the biggest power restoration efforts in U.S. history. The total number of customers, representing about 12 million people, dipped from a peak of more than 7.4 million customers, or about 15 million people, late on Monday. Fuel shortages in the state also eased as 37.6 percent of gas stations were without fuel statewide, down from 46 percent Monday evening, according to fuel information service GasBuddy.  Major utilities in Florida - including NextEra Energy Inc s Florida Power & Light, Duke Energy Corp and Emera Inc s Tampa Electric - have mobilized tens of thousands of workers to deal with the outages after Irma landed early Sunday and carved a destructive path up Florida, which has a population of about 20 million. FPL, the state s largest utility, said its outages dipped to around 2.5 million customers by Tuesday evening from a peak of more than 3.6 million on Monday morning, but that was still more than half of its customers.  In total about 4.5 million FPL customers were affected by the storm, with more than 1.7 million having their service restored already, mostly by automated devices.  We restored power to about 40 percent of the customers impacted by Irma in just one day,  FPL spokesman Rob Gould told a news conference on Tuesday. By comparison, only 4 percent of 3.2 million customer outages following Hurricane Wilma in 2005 were addressed in the same time.  The faster restoration time was due to $3 billion FPL spent on improvements including underground lines, concrete poles and intelligent devices to help restore power, Gould said.  More than 60,000 workers from across the United States and Canada were involved in the restoration efforts, including those from the affected companies and other utilities, said Tom Kuhn, president of the Edison Electric Institute, an industry trade group.  The industry s Irma response is one of the largest power restoration efforts in U.S. history,  Kuhn said.  Some Florida utilities, including FPL, had warned customers it could take weeks to restore power in the hardest hit areas.    However, FPL, said on Tuesday that would restore power to eastern Florida by this weekend, and to western Florida by Sept 22. The state s gas supplies were severely disrupted before and during the storm as ports were closed, cutting Florida off from waterborne deliveries the state relies on. As ports began to reopen, queues of tanker trucks waited to be refilled. Gainesville and Miami had the highest number of stations out of fuel on Tuesday afternoon, with 62 percent and 49 percent respectively, according to GasBuddy.  It was too soon to say what the power restoration would cost FPL, but in 2016, the company said it spent about $315 million to restore power after Hurricanes Hermine and Matthew, according to NextEra s federal filings. Most of those costs were related to Matthew, which caused a third as many outages as Irma did for FPL. To recover restoration costs, FPL files with state regulators and, if approved, adds a storm surcharge on the monthly bills of its nearly 5 million customers. That surcharge was capped at around $4 per month for the average residential customer, according to NextEra s 2016 annual report. The company said, however, it could request an increase if storm restoration costs exceed $800 million in any calendar year. Florida s second biggest power company, Duke, serving the northern and central parts of the state, said it still had about 1.2 million outages Tuesday morning, according to the company s website, while Duke s outages in North and South Carolina climbed to about 160,000. In Georgia, utilities reported around 1.2 million customers without power Tuesday morning, down from a peak of more than  1.4 million on Monday night. FPL said its two nuclear plants in Florida were safe. Both reactors at its Turkey Point facility, about 30 miles (48 km) south of Miami, remained shut early Tuesday, while both reactors at its St. Lucie plant, about 120 miles (190 km) north of Miami, were operating at full power.

Myanmar faces mounting pressure over Rohingya refugee exodus,"COX S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Pressure mounted on Myanmar on Tuesday to end violence that has sent about 370,000 Rohingya Muslims fleeing to Bangladesh, with the United States calling for protection of civilians and Bangladesh urging safe zones to enable refugees to go home. But China, which competes for influence in its southern neighbor with the United States, said it backed Myanmar s efforts to safeguard  development and stability . The government of Buddhist-majority Myanmar says its security forces are fighting Rohingya militants behind a surge of violence in Rakhine state that began on Aug. 25, and they are doing all they can to avoid harming civilians. The government says about 400 people have been killed in the fighting, the latest in the western state. The top U.N. human rights official denounced Myanmar on Monday for conducting a  cruel military operation  against Rohingya, branding it  a textbook example of ethnic cleansing .    The United States said the violent displacement of the Rohingya showed Myanmar s security forces were not protecting civilians. Washington has been a staunch supporter of Myanmar s transition from decades of harsh military rule that is being led by Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.  We call on Burmese security authorities to respect the rule of law, stop the violence, and end the displacement of civilians from all communities,  the White House said in a statement. Myanmar government spokesmen were not immediately available for comment but the foreign ministry said shortly before the U.S. statement was issued that Myanmar was also concerned about the suffering. Its forces were carrying out their legitimate duty to restore order in response to acts of extremism.  The government of Myanmar fully shares the concern of the international community regarding the displacement and suffering of all communities affected by the latest escalation of violence ignited by the acts of terrorism,  the ministry said in a statement. Myanmar s government regards Rohingya as illegal migrants from Bangladesh and denies them citizenship, even though many Rohingya families have lived there for generations. Attacks by a Rohingya insurgent group, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), on police posts and an army base in the north of Rakhine on Aug. 25 provoked the military counter-offensive that refugees say is aimed at pushing Rohingya out of the country. A similar but smaller wave of attacks by the same insurgents last October also sparked what critics called a heavy-handed response by the security forces that sent 87,000 Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh. Reports from refugees and rights groups paint a picture of widespread attacks on Rohingya villages in the north of Rakhine by the security forces and ethnic Rakhine Buddhists, who have put numerous Muslim villages to the torch. But Myanmar authorities have denied that the security forces, or Buddhist civilians, have been setting the fires, instead blaming the insurgents. Nearly 30,000 Buddhist villagers have also been displaced, they say. The U.N. Security Council is to meet on Wednesday behind closed doors for the second time during the crisis since Aug. 25. British U.N. Ambassador Matthew Rycroft said he hoped there would be a public statement agreed by the council on the crisis.  It is important that the Security Council plays its role in responding,  said Sweden s U.N. Ambassador Olof Skoog said on Tuesday. Britain and Sweden requested the meeting.  However, rights groups slammed the 15-member council for not holding a public meeting. Diplomats have said China and Russia would likely object to such a move and protect Myanmar if there was any push for council action to try and end the crisis.   This is ethnic cleansing on a large scale it seems, and the Security Council can t open its doors and stand in front of the cameras? It s appalling, frankly,  Human Rights Watch U.N. director Louis Charbonneau told reporters on Tuesday. Sherine Tadros, head Amnesty International in New York, said if the council doesn t act  the price is being paid.    The danger is without some sort of public proclamation by Security Council members ... the message that you re sending to the Myanmar government is deadly, and they will continue to do it,  Tadros told reporters.  The exodus to Bangladesh shows no sign of slowing with 370,000 the latest estimate, according to a U.N. refugee agency spokeswoman, up from an estimate of 313,000 on the weekend. Bangladesh was already home to about 400,000 Rohingyas. Many refugees are hungry and sick, without shelter or clean water in the middle of the rainy season. The United Nations said 200,000 children needed urgent support. Two emergency flights organized by the U.N. refugee agency arrived in Bangladesh with aid for about 25,000 refugees. More flights are planned with the aim of helping 120,000, a spokesman said. Worry is also growing about conditions inside Rakhine State, with fears a hidden humanitarian crisis may be unfolding. Myanmar has rejected a ceasefire declared by ARSA to enable the delivery of aid there, saying it did not negotiate with terrorists. But Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said Myanmar should set up safe zones to enable the refugees to go home.  Myanmar will have to take back all Rohingya refugees who entered Bangladesh,  Hasina said on a visit to the Cox s Bazar border district where she distributed aid.  Myanmar has created the problem and they will have to solve it,  she said, adding:  We want peaceful relations with our neighbors, but we can t accept any injustice.  Stop this violence against innocent people.  Myanmar has said those who can verify their citizenship can return but most Rohingya are stateless. In Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said,  The international community should support Myanmar in its efforts to safeguard development and stability.

Senate leader opposes 'lecturing' Myanmar leader Suu Kyi,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday he would not support a resolution targeting Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi over the treatment of the country s Rohingya Muslims, and said Washington should not be  lecturing  her.   I don t favor a resolution going after her,  McConnell, who has been engaged with issues related to Myanmar, also known as Burma, for years.  I think she s the greatest hope that we have to move Burma from where it has been, a military dictatorship, to where I hope it s going.  Senators John McCain, a Republican, and Richard Durbin, a Democrat, introduced a resolution last week condemning the violence and urging Suu Kyi to act. But McConnell said he did not support the resolution.  My personal view is America kind of singling her out, and lecturing her when she s in a very challenging position is not helpful. So ... I don t intend to be a part of that,  he said at a weekly news conference by the Senate s Republican leaders. McConnell did not respond to a question about whether there was any consideration of reconsidering Democratic former President Barack Obama s lifting of sanctions on Myanmar. International pressure has been mounting on Myanmar to end violence that has sent about 370,000 Rohingya Muslims fleeing to Bangladesh. The Trump administration has called for protection of civilians, and Bangladesh has urged safe zones so refugees can return home. While Washington has been a staunch supporter of Myanmar s transition from decades of harsh military rule being led by Suu Kyi, the Nobel laureate has been criticized as doing too little to stop the violence. In addition to co-sponsoring the resolution, McCain, the influential chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said on Tuesday he would seek to remove U.S. military cooperation with Myanmar from a sweeping defense policy bill now making its way through Congress. The 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, had called for expanded military cooperation.  While I had hoped the NDAA could contribute to positive reform in Burma, I can no longer support expanding military-to-military cooperation given the worsening humanitarian crisis and human rights crackdown against the Rohingya people,  McCain said in a statement.

"Barzani vows to press on with Kurdish referendum, defying Iraq parliament","BAGHDAD/ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - Iraq s Kurdish leader Massoud Barzani vowed on Tuesday to press ahead with a referendum on Kurdish independence on Sept. 25 despite a vote by Iraq s parliament to reject the move. Earlier the parliament in Baghdad authorized the prime minister to  take all measures  to preserve Iraq s unity. Kurdish lawmakers walked out of the session before the vote and issued statements rejecting the decision. Western powers fear a plebiscite in Iraq s semi-autonomous Kurdish region - including the oil-rich city of Kirkuk - could ignite conflict with the central government in Baghdad and divert attention from the war against Islamic State militants. Iraq s neighbors - Turkey, Iran and Syria - also oppose the referendum, fearing it could fan separatism among their own ethnic Kurdish populations.  The referendum will be held on time... Dialogue with Baghdad will resume after the referendum,  Barzani, president of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), said in a statement on his ruling party s official website after the vote. Barzani told a gathering of Kurds, Arabs and Turkmen in  Kirkuk that the referendum was  a natural right , according to a tweet from his aide Hemin Hawrami. Barzani also said Kirkuk should have a  special status  in a new, independent Kurdistan. Iraqi lawmakers worry that the referendum will consolidate Kurdish control over several areas claimed by both the central government in Baghdad and the autonomous KRG in northern Iraq.      This referendum lacks a constitutional basis and thus it is considered unconstitutional,  the parliamentary resolution said, without specifying what measures the central government should take to stop Kurdistan from breaking away. Mohammed al-Karbouli, a Sunni Muslim lawmaker, said:  Kurdish lawmakers walked out of (Tuesday s) session but the decision to reject the referendum was passed by a majority.  A senior Kurdish official dismissed the vote as non-binding though an Iraqi lawmaker said it would be published in the official gazette after approval from the Iraqi presidency. The KRG has said it is up to local councils of disputed regions in northern Iraq to decide whether to join the vote. Kirkuk, an ethnically mixed city, voted last month to participate in the referendum, a move that stoked tensions with its Arab and Turkmen residents, as well as with Baghdad. Kurdish peshmerga forces took control of the Kirkuk area and other areas claimed by both Baghdad and the Kurds after Islamic State militants overran about a third of Iraq in 2014 and Baghdad s local forces disintegrated. At a news conference on Tuesday, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said the Kurds were continuing to  illegally export  Kirkuk s oil, and he called for urgent talks.  I call upon the Kurdish leadership to come to Baghdad and conclude a dialogue,  Abadi said. A Kurdish delegation met officials in Baghdad for a first round of talks in August concerning the referendum. An Iraqi delegation was expected to visit the Kurdish capital of Erbil in early September for a second round of talks, but the visit has yet to happen with less than two weeks before the vote. Kurds have sought an independent state since at least the end of World War One, when colonial powers divided up the Middle East after the collapse of the multi-ethnic Ottoman Empire and left Kurdish-populated territory split between Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria.

"Hezbollah declares Syria victory, Russia says much of country won back","BEIRUT/MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Lebanese Shi ite group Hezbollah has declared victory in the Syrian war while Russia said government forces had driven militants from much of the country where President Bashar al-Assad s rule seemed in danger two years ago. The comments from two Syrian government allies mark the most confident assessments yet of Assad s position in the war, though significant parts of the country remain outside the government s control. Russia s assertion that the army had won back 85 percent of Syria was dismissed by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. It said the government held 48 percent of Syria. On Tuesday, Russia s defense minister met with Assad in Damascus to discuss joint military efforts and the fight against Islamic State. The government s most recent advances have recovered swathes of territory in eastern Syria from Islamic State, which is being targeted in the same region by U.S.-backed Kurdish and Arab militias. Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, whose group has sent thousands of fighters to Syria, dismissed the fighting left to be done in Syria as  scattered battles .  We have won in the war (in Syria),  he said in comments reported by the Lebanese newspaper al-Akhbar. Referring to Assad s opponents, Nasrallah said  the path of the other project has failed and wants to negotiate for some gains . The comments, made at a religious gathering, were confirmed to Reuters by a source familiar with the speech. Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed in the conflict, which has fractured Syria into a patchwork of areas and generated a refugee crisis of historic proportions, forcing millions of people into neighboring states and Europe. Military backing from Iran and Russia has proven critical to Assad in the war with insurgents including rebels who have been backed by Gulf Arab states, Turkey and the United States, which has decided to end a program of covert support to rebels. Rebel groups were making steady advances against Assad as recently as 2015, when the deployment of the Russian air force to Syria turned the tide in his favor.  Over the past year, Assad has crushed numerous pockets of rebel-held territory in the cities of Aleppo, Homs and Damascus, brokering local deals by which thousands of his opponents have been moved to remaining rebel-held enclaves of the country. Ceasefire deals brokered by Russia, Turkey, Iran and the United States in remaining rebel-held areas of western Syria have freed up manpower on the government side, helping its advance east into the oil-rich province of Deir al-Zor. Russian defense minister Sergei Shoigu visited Assad on Tuesday on the orders of President Vladimir Putin, the ministry said. The meeting focused on plans to recapture Deir al-Zor city and to  strengthen efforts to combat terrorism in all Syrian territory until its utter annihilation,  Assad s office said. Shoigu and Assad discussed the de-escalation deals in parts of Syria that have  sped up the victories of the Syrian army and its allies in fighting terrorism in other areas , it said. Government forces last week reached Deir al-Zor city, the provincial capital on the Euphrates River, breaking an Islamic State siege of a government-held pocket and a nearby air base.  To date, 85 percent of Syria s territory has been cleared of the militants of illegal armed groups,  the RIA news agency cited Alexander Lapin, chief of staff of the Russian military contingent in Syria, as saying. Lapin made no reference to a swathe of territory held in northern Syria by an alliance of U.S.-backed militias - the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) which is led by the Kurdish YPG and is not at war with Assad. The Observatory said SDF-held territory amounts to 23 percent of Syria.  Lapin said Islamic State fighters are still in control of around 27,000 square km of Syria s territory.  The liberation of (Deir al-Zor) city is proceeding,  Lapin said.  Syrian troops are finalizing the defeat of the ISIL group blocking the northern and southern districts of Deir al-Zor,  he said. He said the assault was being led by General Suheil al-Hassan, a Syrian officer who has risen to prominence in the war.           Referring to the Russian figure of 85 percent, a Western diplomat said:  Other numbers tell a darker story: over 400,000 killed; half the population displaced; millions of refugees.   The harder question for Russia to answer is whether any of its vaunted 85 percent is stable. The Assad state is a thin veneer stretched over a patchwork of fiefdoms.  The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said air strikes likely to have been carried out by Russian warplanes killed 69 people since Sunday near the Euphrates River in Deir al-Zor. The Russian Defence Ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Tuesday s report by the Britain-based monitoring group. The Observatory, which identified the victims as civilians, said the air strikes had hit encampments on the western bank of the river and vessels crossing to the eastern side. Syrian state television separately reported the army was conducting artillery and machine gun attacks on rafts carrying Islamic State militants to the eastern side of the river from their last positions in Deir al-Zor city.  Their only escape route out of the city is through rafts on the river, and god willing, we will target them in the water before they get away,  a commander said in a televised interview. Aside from the territory held by the SDF and Islamic State, rebels still control a corner of the northwest, a corner of the southwest, an area near Damascus, and an area north of the city of Homs. Syrian government attacks in the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta region near Damascus suggest Assad may yet try to recapture the remaining rebel-held areas of the west, including enclaves at the borders with Turkey, Jordan and Israel. A major general in the Syrian Republican Guard interviewed by a state-run TV station from Deir al-Zor on Monday warned Syrians who had  run away or escaped from Syria to any other country  not to return. Major General Issam Zahreddine, head of the 104 Brigade which was under IS-siege for three years in Deir al-Zor, later issued a clarification on his Facebook page, saying his warning had been directed only at people who had taken up arms.

"In Mexican town, women and 'muxes' take charge after massive quake","JUCHITAN, Mexico (Reuters) - Destruction wrought by Mexico s massive earthquake has put a spotlight on the quasi-matriarchal indigenous traditions of the worst affected town, with women and third-gender  muxes  playing a leading role in the aftermath of the disaster.  Located in Mexico s narrow isthmus region, about 400 miles (644 km) southeast of capital Mexico City, Juchitan bore the brunt of the 8.1 magnitude earthquake that flattened thousands of buildings in the humid market town in a matter of seconds and took at least 98 lives nationwide. In vivid contrast to Mexico s macho, male-dominated society, travelers have noted since at least the 1800s the relative equality of Juchitan s mainly Zapotec men and women, as well as the prominence of muxes, Zapotecs born biologically male who mix gay and feminine identity. After the earth shook violently just before midnight on Thursday, women, muxes and men all leapt into action, in many cases pulling away rubble with their bare hands.  I carried my mother out as I left the house, and then my brother and I went to rescue my aunt who was trapped,  Peregrina Vera, a tall, 26-year-old muxe, said in a sing-song voice, her long hair tied in a bun.  She then helped pull up rubble to free her grandmother after hearing shouts for help, Vera said, sitting in an outdoor patio just beyond the collapsed walls of her house, where two aggressive pet ducks snapped brightly colored bills at visitors. Locals say there is a muxe in every Juchitan family. They are widely accepted despite an ingrained Roman Catholic heritage and known for dedication to family, especially for taking care of mothers as other siblings move out. Among the severely damaged buildings was the downtown market, the most important for miles around and the heart of Zapotec women s economic power for more than a century. Slated for demolition due to the quake damage, its loss is a blow to Juchitan s women. Irma Lopez, 44, who sold traditional indigenous clothing, was proud that 80 percent of market vendors were women but said it meant they were particularly hard hit by the destruction.   We are the ones who have lost the most,  Lopez said, standing just outside the market as a light rain fell. She was waiting for relatives to help remove her last boxes of merchandise, as trucks pulled up to haul away her and other women s goods. In an 1859 account, French traveler and historian Brasseur de Bourbourg appreciatively described the sprawling marketplace as run by strong, unrestrained women who  openly made fun of their men ... with a shamelessness hardly equaled.  Roughly eight in 10 residents of Juchitan are indigenous, mostly Zapotec. Women are typically also in charge of family finances, said Felina Santiago, a muxe and beauty shop owner, speaking outside her badly damaged home.   Many say Juchitan is the ultimate matriarchy. It s a city of women who fight, who work hard,  Santiago said.  Now more than ever, we re going to work to get back on our feet,  she said, just as a structure on her block loudly collapsed, causing a sudden stir as neighbors rushed to the spot. No one was hurt. In Juchitan s Seventh Division residential neighborhood, Margarita Lopez, a 56-year-old domestic worker, craned her head as she stood in a crowd of women waiting for a promised delivery of government aid, which turned out to be mostly canned food.  Yes, we have our husbands, and we don t leave them behind. But we women matter more. We take decisions, more than the men do,  she said, as others nearby nodded in agreement. Lopez spoke of how it is common in the city of about 100,000 people for husbands to help with household chores like cooking and washing dishes, in a country where such tasks are traditionally seen as the preserve of women. Men find the division of labor in the area  natural,  said male Juchitan surgeon Ovidio Pineda. Women and men  share the decisions, share the responsibilities,  he added. Martha Toledo, whose bar housed in a 200-year-old building collapsed in the quake, killing three clients, said the disaster would not crush Juchitan s spirit, as another aftershock sent her and others running to safety.      Women stand out here, in terms of work and intelligence and experience,  she said, wearing a traditional huipil top and standing near the pile of rubble that was once the bar.  We have to rebuild and rise like the phoenix,  she said, breaking out into a song in the Zapotec language with the chorus  I want to shout, I am alive!  ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1
Italian parliament votes to toughen laws against fascist propaganda,"ROME (Reuters) - Italy s lower house of parliament approved on Tuesday a bill aimed at curbing fascist propaganda, more than 70 years after the death of wartime dictator Benito Mussolini. The draft law, proposed by the ruling Democratic Party (PD), follows a politically charged summer, with human rights groups warning of growing racism in Italy in the face of mass immigration across the Mediterranean from Africa. Under existing laws, pro-fascist propaganda is only penalized if it is seen to be part of an effort to revive the old Fascist Party. The new bill raises the stakes by outlawing the stiff-armed Roman salute as well as the distribution of fascist or Nazi party imagery and gadgets. Offenders risk up to two years in jail, with sentences raised by a further eight months if the fascist imagery is distributed over the Internet. The legislation now passes to the upper house Senate for further approval. Opposition parties, including the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the center-right Forza Italia (Go Italy) party of former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, said the bill posed a threat to freedom of speech. But Emanuele Fiano, a PD lawmaker who drew up the legislation, dismissed such concerns.  This bill does not attack personal freedoms but will act as a brake on neo-fascist regurgitation and a return of extreme right-wing ideology,  he said. Mussolini ruled over Italy from 1922 until 1943. He took Italy into World War Two on Adolf Hitler s side and passed race laws under which thousands of Jews were persecuted.  Italy was routed by the allied forces and Mussolini, also known as  Il Duce , was executed in 1945. ANTI-IMMIGRANT SENTIMENT Mussolini is still admired by a hard core of supporters on the far-right and posters using fascist imagery regularly appear on city billboards   most recently in a stylized picture of a white woman being assaulted by a muscular black man.  Defend her from the new invaders,  said the poster, put up by a fringe party called Forza Nuova (New Force). The group was referring to a high-profile rape case last month when four foreigners were accused of gang-raping a Polish tourist. More than 600,000 migrants, mainly Africans, have come to Italy over the past four years, boosting anti-immigration sentiment in the country and pushing up support for rightist and far-right parties that demand rigid border controls. Given the political climate, the ruling PD was forced on Tuesday to delay its push to approve a contested law that would grant citizenship to the children of immigrants. Opposition parties said the law would encourage migrants to try to come to Italy and claimed victory when the PD announced it was dropping the bill from the Senate schedule this month.  To approve this bill we need a majority, but we don t have one right now in the Senate,  said Luigi Zanda, head of the PD in the upper house of parliament.  ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1
U.S. lawmakers want 'supercharged' response to North Korea nuclear tests,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Frustrated U.S. lawmakers called on Tuesday for a high-powered response to North Korea s nuclear tests, saying Washington should act alone if necessary to stiffen sanctions on companies from China, Russia and any country doing business with Pyongyang.  I believe the response from the United States and our allies should be supercharged,  said Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee.  We need to use every ounce of leverage ... to put maximum pressure on this rogue regime,  the Republican congressman told a hearing on North Korea.  Time is running out.  The U.N. Security Council stepped up sanctions on Monday following Pyongyang s sixth nuclear test on Sept. 3, imposing a ban on textile exports and capping oil imports.  It was the ninth sanctions resolution unanimously adopted by the council since 2006 over North Korea s ballistic missile and nuclear programs. To win Chinese and Russian support, Washington dropped demands including a bid for an oil embargo. At the hearing, U.S. officials released American intelligence findings on how North Korea smuggles coal and commodities to Russia and China. Assistant Treasury Secretary Marshall Billingslea displayed slides showing ships he said picked up coal and other commodities in North Korea, illegally turning off their electronic identification systems to hide the fact that they were carrying cargo to China and Russia.  Pyongyang falsifies the identity of vessels to make it harder for governments to determine if ships docking in their ports are linked to North Korea,  Billingslea said. An Aug. 5 U.N. resolution banned North Korean exports of coal. Russia and China both say they respect U.N. sanctions. Committee members expressed frustration that previous sanctions had not deterred Pyongyang.  We ve been played by the Kims for years,  Republican Representative Ted Poe said, referring to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his predecessors. Lawmakers pressed Billingslea, and Acting Assistant Secretary of State Susan Thornton for evidence new sanctions would be more effective. They acknowledged there had not been sufficient evidence that past sanctions had worked, but insisted the administration would work for a better result this time.  We can designate Chinese banks and companies unilaterally, giving them a choice between doing business with North Korea or the United States,  said Royce, who had breakfast on Tuesday with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.  We should go after banks and companies in other countries that do business with North Korea the same way,  he said. ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1
"In first, U.S. defense chief to attend Mexican Independence Day events","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump s defense secretary plans this week to become the first Pentagon chief to travel to Mexico for its Independence Day activities, the Defense Department said on Tuesday, in a sign that defense ties are withstanding political tensions between the two countries. U.S.-Mexican relations have been strained by Trump s threats to curtail trade with Latin America s No. 2 economy as well as his demand that Mexico pay for a border wall to keep out immigrants and drug traffickers. Jim Mattis  planned trip on Friday would be only the fifth by a U.S. defense secretary to Mexico, said Pentagon spokesman Army Lieutenant Colonel Jamie Davis.   Secretary Mattis  visit to Mexico reaffirms our commitment to the bilateral defense relationship and to the North America community,  Davis said. Although Mexico s official Independence Day is on Sept. 16, most celebrations take place on Sept. 15. The event commemorates the launch of Mexico s war of independence from Spain in 1810.  The fact that Mattis would be visiting for such an important national event is itself notable.  Mexicans have a long memory of the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, which led to Mexico s loss of almost half its territory to the United States. The war has long made U.S.-Mexican military cooperation a somewhat sensitive subject in Mexico. The visit by Mattis also comes amid signs of improving U.S.-Mexican cooperation in cracking down on the heroin trade. Reuters reported in April that Mexico s army was allowing the United States and the United Nations to observe opium poppy eradication. [nL2N1HE07M] The Mexican army took U.S. military officials on helicopter tours of half a dozen sites in Sinaloa and Chihuahua, two of the three states that along with Durango make up the Golden Triangle where most Mexican opium is produced, one of the sources said at the time.

May lost the Conservatives  majority in a June election, forcing her government to rely on the support of a small Northern Irish party to pass laws. ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1
"U.N. ban on North Korean textiles will disrupt industry and ordinary lives, experts say","BEIJING/CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Nations sanctions on North Korea s important textiles industry are expected to disrupt a business largely based in China and pose compliance headaches for clothing retailers in the United States and around the world.  The U.N. security Council imposed a ban on North Korea textile exports and a ceiling on the country s imports of crude oil on Monday, ratcheting up sanctions designed to pressure North Korea into talks about its nuclear weapons and missile programs.      Retailers in the United States and other countries have intentionally limited their exposure to North Korea in recent years, as tensions over the country s nuclear program have increased. The industry has sought to strengthen control over its supply chain since a textile factory collapse in Bangladesh killed more than 1,100 people in 2013.  Larger retailers, such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), have the ability to keep North Korea-produced goods out of their stores. But smaller brands may face enforcement challenges, said Marc Wulfraat, president of supply chain consulting firm MWPVL International.  There are still hundreds and thousands of companies that are sourcing from overseas that don t have the wherewithal or the resources or people or money to chase after these issues,  Wulfraat said. Textiles were North Korea s second-biggest export after coal and other minerals in 2016, totaling $752 million, according to data from the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency. Nearly 80 percent went to China. Enforcement of the textile ban along North Korea s 1,400-km (870-mile) border with China - where goods are sometimes smuggled across, often on boats at night - could be challenging, North Korea experts say.   In the past, we have seen shows of quite convincing enforcement in the major centers, such as at Dandong,  said Chris Green, a North Korea expert at Leiden University in the Netherlands, referring to the largest trading hub on the China-North Korea border. Goods still slip through in less visible areas, he said.  Trade in non-banned goods, including food and other daily necessities, continues between China and North Korea.  Enforcement will depend a lot on China,  said Paul Tjia, an outsourcing specialist who regularly visits North Korea.  So far, a lot of the North Korean textiles trade to Europe and other places goes via China.   It will be up to Chinese companies that deal in the North Korean textile trade to take action and up to the Chinese government to ensure the Chinese companies are taking action.  On a recent visit to the Chinese border with North Korea, several Chinese traders told Reuters the Chinese government is strictly enforcing U.N. sanctions to the point that some businesses that rely on trade with North Korea have already gone bankrupt or traders have had to start trading in non-sanctioned goods.  Another challenge is that clothes can be partly made in China and partly in North Korea with a  Made in China  label attached to the finished product.  Even if a label says  Made in China,  some parts of the product are allowed to be made in North Korea and other places,  Tjia said.  For example, the buttons may come from Italy, the cotton may come from Australia or India, the labor may come from North Korea or China, the accessories may come from Bangladesh.    A spokeswoman for Target Corp (TGT.N) said the company has taken steps to keep even unfinished goods from North Korea out of its supply chain.   We re aware of the accusations and have clear guidelines and standards in place for our vendors and suppliers,  said spokeswoman Jenna Rack.  We don t source any products from North Korea or any apparel products from Dandong.  North Korea does not release statistics on the number of people involved in the textiles industry, but experts estimate  at least 100,000 people are employed at North Korean textiles factories, producing goods both for export and the domestic market.  Cheng Xiaohe, a North Korea specialist at Beijing s Renmin University, estimates the figure may be as high as 200,000 people.  Wages at textiles factories grew tenfold around 2010 when North Korea was experimenting with economic reforms, according to Green, so people suddenly went from earning 30 North Korean won to 300 won.  They were suddenly getting a reasonable wage,  said Green. Supply chain consultant Tjia said North Korea textile workers will be hit by the trade ban.  If the goal of the sanctions is to create difficulties for ordinary workers and their ability to make a livelihood, then a ban on textiles will work,  he said. ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1
More arrests in apparent Saudi campaign against critics: activists,"(Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has detained more clerics and intellectuals, activists said on social media on Tuesday, widening an apparent crackdown on potential opponents of the conservative kingdom s absolute rulers. The crackdown comes amid widespread speculation, denied by officials, that King Salman intends to abdicate in favor of his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who already dominates economic, diplomatic and domestic policy. It also comes amid a deepening rift between Saudi Arabia and its allies on one side and Qatar on the other. Exiled Saudi opposition activists have called for protests on Friday to galvanize resistance to the royal family. The al-Saud family has always regarded Islamist groups as the biggest internal threat to its rule over a country in which appeals to religious sentiment cannot be lightly dismissed and an al Qaeda campaign a decade ago killed hundreds. Prominent Islamist clerics Salman al-Awdah, Awad al-Qarni and Ali al-Omary were detained over the weekend, according to Saudi sources. On Tuesday, activists dedicated to monitoring and documenting what they describe as  prisoners of conscience  reported that at least eight other prominent figures, including clerics, academics, television anchors and a poet, had been  confirmed  detained since Monday.  ALQST, a London-based Saudi rights group, also reported more arrests, including several of the same people, although it gave no specific figure.  Al-Awdah, al-Qarni, Farhan al-Malki and Mostafa Hassan (are confirmed),  said Yahya al-Assiri, the center s head, referring to four of those reported to have been arrested.  The rest are also correct, but I don t have any specific information,  he added. Saudi officials could not be reached for comment. State news agency SPA said earlier on Tuesday that authorities had uncovered  intelligence activities for the benefit of foreign parties  by a group of people it did not identify. A Saudi security source told Reuters the suspects were accused of  espionage activities and having contacts with external entities including the Muslim Brotherhood , which Riyadh has classified as a terrorist organization. The government toughened its stance on dissent following the Arab Spring in 2011 after it averted unrest by offering billions of dollars in handouts and state spending. But the Brotherhood, which represents an ideological threat to Riyadh s dynastic system of rule, has gained power elsewhere in the region. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and transport links with Qatar in June over its alleged support for Islamists including the Brotherhood   a charge that Doha denies. Awdah reportedly was detained after he posted a message on his Twitter account welcoming a possible end to the rift between Qatar and other Arab countries which began in Egypt. Activists also suggested that poet Ziad bin Neheet may have been detained for posting a video in which he chastised journalists who had exploited the row with Qatar to heap abuse on each other.  What is happening between Qatar and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a normal thing in a political dispute, but the role which the media carried out was very, very negative,  he said. Activists have published a list of eight other people they fear may be arrested next. ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1
Egypt defends human rights position after criticism from OHCHR,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt s United Nations envoy on Tuesday criticized U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra ad al-Hussein s remarks on systemic violence in the country, saying they reflected  flawed logic , state news agency MENA reported. Ambassador Amr Ramadan was quoted as saying that he had cautioned Zeid against his office becoming a  mouthpiece for paid agencies with political and economic agendas,  and he rejected his accusations, without elaborating. At a UN Human Rights Council meeting in Geneva on Monday, Hussein said the state of emergency declared by the Egyptian government last April had been used to justify  systemic silencing of civil society.  He cited reports of waves of arrests, arbitrary detention, black-listing, travel bans, asset freezes, intimidation and other reprisals against human rights defenders, journalists, political dissidents and those affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood group. Last week Egypt came under fire from Human Rights Watch, which said in a report that there was systemic torture in the country s jails, leading Cairo to block access to HRW s website. Egypt s human rights parliamentary committee, which was critical of the report, has also developed an action plan in response, state media reported on Tuesday. The plan reportedly includes meeting with foreign diplomats in Egypt and outside the country to explain its efforts to defend human rights.

Amnesty International urges Egypt to release detained Nubian activists,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Amnesty International urged Egyptian authorities on Tuesday to release 24 Nubian activists detained last week on charges of protesting without permission as they rallied for resettlement on the banks of the Nile river. For half a century, Egypt s Nubians have lobbied the government in Cairo for a return to their homelands on the banks of the upper Nile, desperate to reclaim territory their ancestors first cultivated 3,000 years ago.  Egyptian authorities have long since marginalized Nubians, ignoring their demands to return to their historical lands and treating Nubian activism as suspicious on security grounds,  Amnesty International s North Africa Campaigns Director Najia Bounaim said in a statement.  Instead of flagrantly flouting Nubians  rights to freedom of expression and assembly by continuing to detain them over their peaceful protest, the authorities must release these 24 activists from custody immediately.  According to the statement, the activists had not marched far before they were surrounded and beaten by security officers. The activists  lawyer, Mohamed Abdel Salam, told Reuters last week they were also charged with incitement of protests and disrupting public safety. ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1
Israel's supreme court cancels conscription exemption law,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel s Supreme Court on Tuesday canceled legislation exempting Jewish religious seminary students from military service, angering ultra-Orthodox lawmakers who could destabilize Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s coalition. A panel of nine justices ruled that parts of the conscription law that exempt seminary students from service were  unreasonable and unconstitutional . It gave the government a year to resolve the matter. For decades, the exemption from military service on religious grounds for seminary students has caused friction in Israeli society, where most Jewish men and women are called up for military service when they turn 18. The ultra-Orthodox say that their study of the Torah is vital for the continued survival of the Jewish people and also fear that young men serving in the army would come into contact with women and with less pious elements in society.  Several hundred ultra-Orthodox men have, however, enlisted in special units that cater to their religious needs.  Legislation was enacted in 2014 to replace arrangements that had previously expired. It was prompted by then-coalition member Yair Lapid s secular, centrist Yesh Atid party which ran on a platform of  sharing the national burden . That legislation angered ultra-Orthodox parties who rejoined  Netanyahu s subsequent government in 2015 when Lapid s party went into opposition and they managed to effect a watering down of the law. Eight of the nine justices ruled the law should be scrapped and Supreme Court President Miriam Naor, wrote that the most recent arrangement that was made to appease the ultra-Orthodox parties  deeply harms equality in a way that damages the constitutional right to human dignity.  Since Israel s founding in 1948, ultra-Orthodox politicians have campaigned vigorously against the conscription of members of their community, who make up about 10 percent of Israel s population of 9 million.  Netanyahu s government, which controls 67 of the Knesset s 120 seats, includes both ultra-Orthodox parties, but two other influential factions oppose a further relaxation of the legislation against conscription. Interior Minister Aryeh Deri, the leader of the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, said in response to the ruling that the justices were  completely detached from our heritage and tradition and from the people.  He encouraged seminary students to continue their Bible studies and said:  Do not despair, continue to study the Torah, we will stand firm and will do everything to fix this situation.  Lapid, whom opinion polls have shown to be a possible challenger to Netanyahu in future elections, convened a news conference to praise the court s decision, saying it had  delivered a verdict that would force equality among communities.  This is why we have come to politics. Conscription for everybody, work for everybody. Benjamin Netanyahu can no longer continue to wriggle out all the time. Military conscription is for everybody, not only for the suckers who don t have a party in his coalition,  Lapid added. ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1
Opposition stays away as Kenyatta warns against 'destructive division',"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta opened parliament on Tuesday by warning against divisive and destructive politics, while opposition lawmakers boycotted the legislature and rallied to demand the resignation of election officials. Kenya held parliamentary, presidential and local elections on Aug. 8, but the Supreme Court nullified the presidential  results three weeks later, citing irregularities in the tallying process. New elections are scheduled for Oct. 17. While calling for unity and respect for the constitution, Kenyatta delivered a thinly veiled warning to the opposition lawmakers who had chosen to stay away from parliament.  My government will not tolerate anyone intent on disrupting our hard-won peace and stability. Under no circumstances must Kenyans ever allow our free competitive processes to become a threat to the peace and security of our nation,  he said, to foot-stamping and cheering from ruling party legislators.    We shall continue to encourage vibrant democratic competition, we shall not allow destructive division.  As he spoke, opposition leaders held a rally in Kibera, the capital s largest slum, rejecting the Oct. 17 date unless officials on the election board, whom they blame for mishandling the polls, resign.   Now we are putting it squarely to you that the Supreme Court of this country has found you incompetent,  said Kalonzo Musyoka, running mate of Kenyatta s presidential rival Raila Odinga. The surprise election annulment initially raised fears of short-term political turmoil in Kenya, the region s richest nation and a staunch Western ally in a region roiled by conflict.  But it also raised hopes among frustrated opposition supporters, who believe the last three elections have been stolen from them, that the east African nation s tarnished courts could deliver them justice.  That hope helped tamp down protests that threatened to spark the kind of violence that followed disputed 2007 elections, when around 1,200 people were killed in ethnic bloodletting.  In a separate development, a ruling party lawmaker and a former opposition senator appeared in a Nairobi court, charged with incitement to violence over speeches they had made in the past week. Both were freed on a 300,000 Kenya shilling ($3,000) bond.  A government body monitoring hate speech says that it has seen a spike since the Supreme Court ruling. More than three times as many incidents were reported in the week following the ruling than during the whole 10-week election campaign, it said. ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1
"Saudi coalition investigates own air strikes, clears itself","RIYADH (Reuters) - A panel set up by the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen to investigate civilian casualties found a series of deadly air strikes largely justified, citing the presence of armed militiamen at the homes, schools and clinics that were targeted. The Joint Incidents Assessment Team said on Tuesday it had discovered mistakes in only three of 15 incidents it reviewed, and maintained the coalition had acted in accordance with international humanitarian law.      Saudi Arabia and its allies have been bombing the Iran-aligned Houthi movement since the Houthis seized much of northern Yemen in 2015. The Houthis have in turn fired rockets toward Saudi cities and villages. They say their attacks are in response to Saudi strikes on Yemeni cities and villages. The war has killed more than 10,000 people. The coalition has been repeatedly criticized for civilian casualties. Human Rights Watch accused it on Tuesday of war crimes, saying air strikes that hit family homes and a grocery store were carried out either deliberately or recklessly, causing indiscriminate loss of civilian lives. The United Nations said on Monday it had verified 5,144 civilian deaths in the war, mainly from coalition bombardment, and an international investigation was urgently needed.  The minimal efforts made towards accountability over the past year are insufficient to respond to the gravity of the continuing and daily violations involved in this conflict,  U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra ad al Hussein said in Geneva. Speaking in the Saudi capital Riyadh on Tuesday, the panel s legal advisor, Mansour Ahmed al-Mansour, told journalists the coalition had made  an unintended mistake  in bombing a water well-drilling rig north of Yemen s capital Sanaa last year after confusing it with a ballistic missile launcher. The raid reportedly killed 30 people and JIAT recommended the coalition provide  appropriate humanitarian assistance , without elaborating. It urged the same for strikes in Sanaa in June and September 2015 when bombs targeting military objectives mistakenly hit civilian buildings due to  a technical malfunction in aircraft systems . Mansour denied the coalition hit a U.N. compound in Aden in June 2015, which the U.N. secretary general said at the time caused serious structural damage and one casualty. About a January 2016 attack near Saada which killed a Medecins Sans Frontieres ambulance driver and at least five other people, Mansour disputed the vehicle was clearly marked and said the coalition had legitimately targeted it and an ammunition depot it was parked beside.  The vehicle was used for military purposes due to the secondary explosion in the vehicle, which was obvious,  he said. The investigators also absolved the coalition of responsibility for attacks on a Coca-Cola factory in December 2015 and a centre for the blind the following month. ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1

"Germany softens stance on Turkish arms sales, citing security","ANKARA/BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Tuesday Germany would only restrict some arms sales to Turkey, softening an earlier announcement of a freeze on major arms sales after Ankara said that would hurt their joint fight against Islamic State. Merkel spoke a day after Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said Berlin had put all major arms exports to NATO partner Turkey on hold, citing deteriorating human rights there and strained diplomatic ties. She told broadcaster NDR that Germany would decide on arms sales requests from Turkey on a case-by-case basis, noting that Berlin cooperated with Ankara on security matters.   We also remain in a joint fight against Islamic State,  Merkel said, in an apparent rebuff of the more forceful remarks made by Gabriel, a senior member of the Social Democrats (SPD), junior partners in her ruling coalition. Turkey accused Gabriel of using the issue for political gain ahead of a Sept. 24 national election. The countries  ties through the U.S.-led military alliance have come under increased pressure since Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan started a crackdown on political opponents after a failed coup last year. Germany has criticized mass arrests in Turkey, refused to extradite people Turkey says were involved in the putsch and demanded the release of around a dozen German or Turkish-German citizens arrested in recent months. This month, Merkel went as far as saying she would seek to end Turkey s membership talks with the European Union - drawing accusations from Turkey that she was flirting with populism to build support before the election. Berlin is also considering adding Turkey to a list of countries that pose high security risks for intelligence agents, police officers and military officials, Germany s Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper and two broadcasters reported, citing a spokesman for the Interior Ministry. The list includes China, Russia, Pakistan, North Korea and 26 other countries. Merkel did not give details of what criteria Germany would use to make its case-by-case decisions on arms exports. But in a written response to a question from Greens lawmaker Ozcan Mutlu about German arms exports to Turkey, Economy Ministry state secretary Matthias Machnig said they would not be approved if Berlin suspected they could be used for repression. Machnig s response, dated Sept. 7, also showed arms sales to Turkey had declined significantly since a year earlier. He listed arms exports to Turkey approved between Jan. 1 and Aug. 31 this year - primarily bombs, torpedoes and missiles with some small arms and munitions - worth a total of about 25 million euros ($29.84 million), down from 69 million euros in the same period last year. After Merkel spoke, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said he found the chancellor s approach more  suitable  and chided Gabriel for using the issue to drum up votes. Gabriel s SPD is running 13 to 14 percent behind Merkel s conservatives in many opinion polls. Turkish EU Affairs Minister Omer Celik, speaking in London, had said Gabriel s ban on major arms deals would weaken Turkey s fight against terrorism and make Europe less secure. A NATO spokesman said the alliance has no role in commercial arms sales between member states.   It does not monitor, promote or facilitate such transactions,  the spokesman added.

FACTBOX: About 6.1 million without power in U.S. Southeast after Irma: utilities,"(Reuters) - Power outages from Hurricane Irma dropped to about 6.1 million in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Alabama by Tuesday afternoon, down from a peak over 7.4 million late Monday, according to local utilities. Most remaining outages were in Florida Power & Light s service area in the southern and eastern parts of the state. FPL, a unit of NextEra Energy Inc and the state s biggest power company, said its outages dipped below 2.8 million by Tuesday afternoon from a peak of over 3.6 million Monday morning. FPL said it expects to restore essentially all of its customers in the eastern portion of Florida by the weekend and the harder-hit western portion of the state by Sept. 22. The company, however, warned it would take longer to restore customers with tornado damage or severe flooding. Florida outages for Duke Energy Corp, which serves the northern and central parts of the state, fell to around 1 million by Tuesday afternoon, down from a peak of about 1.2 million on Monday, according to the company s website. Irma hit southwestern Florida on Sunday morning as a dangerous Category 4 storm, the second-highest level on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale. It gradually weakened to a tropical storm and then a tropical depression on Monday.

Uganda ruling party seeks to scrap age limit to extend president's rule,"KAMPALA (Reuters) - Legislators from Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni s party on Tuesday agreed to introduce a law to remove an age limit from the country s constitution, potentially allowing him to extend his rule, two lawmakers told Reuters. The East African country s existing constitution bars anyone over 75 from standing as a presidential candidate. Museveni, 73, is already one of Africa s longest-serving rulers and has been in charge for more than three decades. The next elections are due in 2021. Oil-rich Uganda is a staunch Western ally and receives substantial aid and support for its security forces, partly for sending troops to Somalia as part of an African Union peacekeeping mission. When he first came to power, Museveni was lauded for helping restore stability after two murderous dictators known to use torture and extrajudicial executions widely, and for directing the suppression of a brutal insurgency known for mutilating civilians and kidnapping children. But over the years, criticism has mounted over the suppression of the political opposition, widespread corruption and a poor human rights record. Simeo Nsubuga, a legislator from Museveni s ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM) party, told Reuters the move to amend the constitution was agreed in a special meeting of the party s House members.  We agreed that a private member should come up with a constitutional amendment bill to remove the age limit,  Nsubuga said, adding the bill would be introduced on the floor next week. In July, Uganda s deputy attorney general said cabinet was planning to introduce similar legislation. Most Ugandan laws are introduced by the government via cabinet ministers. But Kafuuzi Jackson Karugaba, another NRM legislator, told Reuters they had decided to take the option of a private member s bill because cabinet was moving  too slowly.   In 2005, NRM legislators changed the constitution and removed a limit of two five-year terms, allowing Museveni to extend his reign. Independent observers said that last year s presidential election lacked transparency and that the poll body lacked credibility. The ageing leader has himself not stated whether he intends to seek another term, and officials have said the proposed constitutional change was not specifically to benefit the incumbent but all of Uganda s future leaders.

Graveyard killing of Belgian mayor was 'revenge': media,"MOUSCRON, Belgium (Reuters) - A Belgian teenager who blamed the local mayor for his father s suicide after he was fired from a town hall job has confessed to slashing the politician s throat in a cemetery on Monday night, public broadcaster RTBF said. The murder of Alfred Gadenne, 71, the mayor of Mouscron and a former lawmaker in the regional parliament, has shocked the country, with the prime minister expressing his  horror . The public prosecutor told Reuters that a man was under arrest after giving himself up to police at the scene after dark in Mouscron, an industrial border town of 57,000 close to the French city of Lille. He declined comment on media reports. RTBF, citing sources including the suspect s lawyer, said he was 18 and told police he was avenging his father, who killed himself two years ago after losing his job as a local council employee. A box-cutter was found at the scene, where the young man had calmly called police to attend around 8 p.m. Gadenne, a conservative whose death prompted tributes from across the national political spectrum, acted as caretaker for the cemetery next to his home and was killed after going there to lock up for the night, as he did every evening. Media reporting of this spare-time occupation during his decade as mayor had allowed the suspect to find Gadenne alone, RTBF said. It added that the man waited until he reached the age of majority so his mother, also a municipal employee, could not be held liable for his actions under Belgian law. Mourners left flowers at the cemetery gates and visited the town hall to sign a book of condolence for the mayor. ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1

Air strikes kill 69 in Syrian east since Sunday: Observatory,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said air strikes likely to have been carried out by Russian warplanes have killed 69 people since Sunday near the Euphrates River in the eastern Syrian province of Deir al-Zor. The Russian defense ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Tuesday s report by the Britain-based monitoring group. The Observatory, which identified the victims as civilians, said the air strikes hit civilian encampments on the western bank of the Euphrates and vessels crossing the river to the eastern side. Separately, Syrian state television said on Tuesday Islamic State militants have been using the river to flee the city of Deir al-Zor. With heavy artillery and machineguns, the Syrian army struck rafts carrying militants and crossing the Euphrates to the eastern side, it reported. Islamic State s  only escape route out of the city is through rafts on the river, and, God willing, we will target them in the water before they get away,  a field commander in Deir al-Zor told state TV.

"Brexit talks put back a week, EU expects May speech","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Britain and the European Union postponed a new round of Brexit negotiations by a week until the end of the month in what EU diplomats said was to allow time for Prime Minister Theresa May to make a key speech in about 10 days. In confirming a delay until Sept. 25, which Brussels had been expecting, the British government said in a statement it was a joint decision taken because  more time for consultation would give negotiators the flexibility to make progress . There has been no confirmation in London that May will make any speech around Sept. 21. There was no immediate official comment from the European Commission, which is the EU executive. However, diplomats in the EU capital said they had been told on Tuesday that the negotiations had been put back  for reasons of the UK political calendar  rather than for any reason in Brussels. EU officials and diplomats expect May to make a keynote speech around Sept. 21 and believe she may use it to outline the kind of transition arrangements Britain wants once it leaves the Union in March 2019 and before a long-term treaty setting out a free trade pact can be fully negotiated and implemented. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has, like his counterpart British Brexit minister David Davis, played down the significance of the precise timing of talks in Brussels.  After the last round in late August, Barnier said the sides were far apart on the terms on which Britain will leave. That raised doubts about whether two further rounds scheduled before an EU summit on Oct. 19-20 would show enough progress to let leaders agree to launch negotiations on the post-Brexit relationship. EU sources doubt that May will be ready to give ground as early as this month on EU demands, notably that Britain pay it tens of billions of euros (dollars) on leaving. In early October she faces a tricky first Conservative party conference since she lost her parliamentary majority in an ill-advised snap election. Rather, some EU officials expect May to speak in more detail later this month on the transition. She may explain to impatient Brexit supporters that Britain may remain inside some EU structures - and pay Brussels for the privilege - for some years to avoid a  cliff-edge  disruption to trade and business. Such a policy statement by May, whose divided ministers have lately spoken more unanimously in favor of such a transition, would not in itself mean a shift in the negotiating stance on  divorce  issues, such as expatriates  rights, how much Britain will pay on leaving or land border controls with Ireland. However, delaying the Brussels talks may make it easier for the prime minister to get her message over without distraction. Britain is keen to move on to discuss the future relationship and the transition to it as soon as possible, arguing that all these issues are ultimately intertwined. The other 27 national leaders insist, however, that the divorce talks must show  sufficient progress  - a deliberately vague phrase - before they will negotiate a future trade deal.

The UK and the European Commission have today jointly agreed to start the fourth round of negotiations on September 25,  a government spokesman said in a statement.  Both sides settled on the date after discussions between senior officials in recognition that more time for consultation would give negotiators the flexibility to make progress in the September round.

Bahrain's king issues decree reorganizing National Security Agency,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Bahrain s King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa issued a decree on Tuesday reorganizing the National Security Agency and appointing Lieutenant General Adel bin Khalifa Al Fadhel as its new president, effective immediately, the state news agency said. The NSA has for decades been central to the Sunni Muslim-ruled kingdom s efforts to overcome protests and occasional violence by members of the country s Shi ite Muslim majority. The king also issued a decree appointing Sheikh Talal bin Mohammed bin Khalifa Al Khalifa as deputy interior minister.  In August, three Bahraini human rights groups accused the Gulf Arab monarchy s NSA of the systematic use of torture.  A security official said at the time it would investigate the allegations.  In 2011, Bahrain put down an uprising by pro-democracy activists, many of them Shi ites. The monarchy believes the opposition seeks to overthrow it by force and accuses Iran of aiding in deadly militant attacks on security forces. Home to the U.S. Fifth Fleet, Bahrain denies opposition claims that it marginalizes Shi ites economically and in government representation. ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1
"Qatar, neighbors trade barbs at Arab League over boycott","CAIRO (Reuters) - Diplomats from Qatar and the four states boycotting it exchanged heated words at an Arab League meeting on Tuesday. Tensions flared after Qatar s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Sultan bin Saad al-Muraikhi discussed the boycott in his opening speech despite the Gulf dispute not being on the agenda. He called the Gulf monarchy s critics  rabid dogs .  Even the animals were not spared, you sent them out savagely,  Muraikhi said, referring to the thousands of camels left stranded on the border between Qatar and Saudi Arabia after borders were closed.   Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain cut diplomatic and trade links with Qatar on June 5, suspending air and shipping routes with the world s biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas, which is home to the region s biggest U.S. military base. The nations say Doha supports regional foe Iran and Islamists. Qatar denies the charges and calls the economic boycott a  siege  aimed at neutering an independent foreign policy it says promotes peaceful regional reform and fighting terrorism. Kuwait has been trying to mediate in the dispute. During his speech, Muraikhi referred to Iran as an  honourable country  and said ties had warmed with its neighbor since the blockade.  In response, Ahmed al-Qattan, Saudi Arabia s envoy to the Arab League, said:  Congratulations to Iran and soon, God willing, you will regret it.  The exchange descended into a row during which Muraikhi and Qattan each told the other to be quiet.  Muraikhi said Saudi Arabia was looking to depose the Emir of Qatar and replace him with Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, who helped negotiate the entry of Qatari pilgrims attending the annual haj pilgrimage into Saudi Arabia.  This is an improper thing to say because the kingdom of Saudi Arabia will never resort to such cheap methods and we don t want to change the regime, but you must also know that the kingdom can do anything it wants, God willing,  Qattan said. Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said Muraikhi s comments were unacceptable.   We all know Qatar s historic support for terrorism and what has been provided for extremist factions, and money in Syria, Yemen, Libya and Egypt that have lead to the death of many of Egypt s sons,  Shoukry said. Qatar backed a Muslim Brotherhood government in Egypt before it was overthrown by the military in 2013. The Arab states have demanded Qatar sever any links with the Brotherhood and other groups they deem to be terrorist, ideological or sectarian. ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1
Germany mulls adding Turkey to list of states posing high security risk: media,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The German government is considering adding Turkey to a list of countries that pose high security risks for intelligence agents, police officers and military officials, the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper and two broadcasters reported late on Tuesday. The reports come amid heightened tensions between the two NATO partners and vows by German officials to restrict arms sales to Turkey, in a move that Ankara said would hurt their joint fight against Islamic State. The newspaper and WDR and NDR broadcasters quoted a spokesman for the Interior Ministry as saying that the list was currently being reviewed.  As part of this process, the Interior Ministry is examining whether to add Turkey to the list,  the spokesman was quoted as saying. The list now includes China, Russia, Pakistan, North Korea and 26 other countries. Germany s Interior Ministry, contacted by Reuters, was not immediately available to comment. Some German intelligence agencies argued for viewing Turkey less as a partner than an enemy and called for expanding intelligence surveillance of Turkey s activities in the fight against Islamist groups, the media outlets said. Some agencies had also warned employees in recent months about the risks of traveling to Turkey and cautioned others not to travel there on vacation, they said. German officials have been enraged by Turkey s arrest of around a dozen German citizens, including the German-Turkish journalist Deniz Yucel, who has been held for over 200 days.

Magellan Midstream probes big Texas fuel spill during Harvey floods,"(Reuters) - Magellan Midstream Partners LP said on Tuesday it was investigating the cause of a nearly 11,000-barrel gasoline spill from two above-ground fuel storage tanks at its Houston-area terminal in Texas during Hurricane Harvey. The leak at the Galena Park terminal is the biggest spill reported so far relating to the storm, which unleashed record flooding in the state in late August, destroying homes and killing scores of people.  The Environmental Protection Agency has said federal and state authorities responded to spills linked to Harvey at about a dozen industrial facilities.  The exact cause of the tank failures is now under investigation,  Magellan spokesman Bruce Heine said. He said the company believed it was related to the flooding. Magellan has cleaned up much of the spill, and recovered an undisclosed amount that escaped off the terminal s property into a nearby ditch and the Houston Ship Channel, Heine said.   Clean-up activities at the facility are continuing and we are currently removing and replacing affected soil,  he said.  The spill occurred on Aug. 31, Heine said.  Magellan had initially reported a smaller volume of gasoline spilled to state authorities, but adjusted its estimate upward after it was able to make a full assessment, he said.  It s Magellan s long-term practice to conservatively report a product release to appropriate agencies and local authorities as soon as we become aware of a potential incident,  he said, explaining the smaller initial estimate.  In other words, we do not wait until absolute confirmation, as we want to give the earliest possible notice.  Magellan has said that much of the rest of its infrastructure has returned to normal after the storm.  ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1
Italy court deals blow to 5-Star ahead of Sicily vote,"ROME (Reuters) - A court in Sicily has suspended the results of an internal primary ballot by the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, potentially disrupting its bid to win control of the island in an election in November. The Palermo court on Tuesday accepted an appeal by a 5-Star member who had been excluded from the online vote to pick its candidate for regional president, due to a dispute over 5-Star s internal code of conduct. The court will decide at a future hearing what action 5-Star must take, but its ruling is a setback for the maverick movement which hopes a victory in Sicily can pave the way to success at a national election due early next year. A victory in Sicily would give 5-Star control of its first regional government, while a defeat would be the second blow this year after it fared badly in mayoral elections in June. It is possible that 5-Star will have to repeat the online primary it held in July, which selected Giancarlo Cancelleri as its candidate for Sicilian president in the Nov. 5 election. It is not the first time court rulings have tripped up 5-Star, which is still Italy s most popular party, according to most opinion polls. In a similar case in April, a court in Genoa backed a 5-Star member who had been excluded from a primary ahead of mayoral elections in the city. That sparked a damaging split which contributed to a defeat in the home town of the party s founder, comedian Beppe Grillo. 5-Star s mayor of Rome, Virginia Raggi, has also been plagued by legal disputes involving her and her team since she was elected as the capital s first woman mayor in June 2016. 5-Star, which bases its appeal on a fight against corruption and cronyism among Italy s mainstream parties, has invested enormous political capital in the Sicily election. Its most prominent national figures spent the summer touring the island with Cancelleri before the other parties had even picked their candidates. According to opinion polls Cancelleri is running neck-and-neck with a candidate backed by a center-right coalition, with the center left s candidate lagging behind. A post on Grillo s blog, the party s mouthpiece, said it would comply with whatever the court decided and its participation in the Sicilian election was not in doubt. On Sept. 23 the party will announced its candidate for prime minister after another online vote of its members, with 31-year-old lower house deputy Luigi Di Maio widely expected to win.

Rich tycoon takes on Iraqi Kurdish leaders over independence,"SULAIMANIYA, Iraq (Reuters) - On the eve of an independence referendum in Iraq s Kurdistan region, one man is campaigning against a  Yes  vote which he fears could stoke tension in the Middle East. With the 5 million Kurds in Iraq who are eligible to vote united by dreams of statehood, the outcome of the Sept. 25 referendum in the autonomous region in northern Iraq is in no doubt. But with Baghdad making clear it opposes independence for a region that has abundant oil reserves, some voters fear now is not the time to start moves to break away from Iraq   and rich businessman Shaswar Abdulwahid Qadir has taken up their cause. Despite being branded a traitor by political enemies, he has taken on the establishment by launching a  No for now  campaign to explain the economic and political risks of a  Yes  vote.  A  No  vote is better for our people, better for Kurdistan s future,  the 39-year-old businessman told Reuters after a rally on Saturday in a soccer stadium in Sulaimaniya, Iraqi Kurdistan s second largest city. Warning against the consequences of an independence declaration, he said:  It will bring to our people an unstable situation after the referendum.  Qadir s goal is not to resist independence forever. But he fears a  Yes  vote now would unleash the wrath of governments in Iraq, Iran, Turkey and Syria which could see it as a precedent that could encourage separatist-minded Kurds in those countries. Iraq s parliament voted on Tuesday to reject the referendum and authorized the prime minister to  take all measures  to preserve Iraq s unity. Western powers want a delay because they are worried the vote will derail cooperation between Iraq and the Kurds against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. Qadir is almost alone among Kurds in raising his voice openly against the  Yes  campaign led by President Masoud Barzani and his Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP), which say independence would be preceded by dialogue with Baghdad.  But Qadir believes there are others who share his concerns. At the rally in Sulaimaniya, Qadir was welcomed into the stadium by dancers in colorful traditional dress and by a crowd chanting his name. But he delayed the start by an hour to allow the stadium he helped refurbish to fill up   and it never did. About 2,500 people attended, filling only about one third of the arena. After he began speaking, a scuffle broke out when a man in the crowd tried to throw something at Qadir during his speech. The businessman says he is undeterred by criticism and attacks which he says have affected his business.  I m ok with all of it, because I believe in another way for Kurdistan,  he said. Critics say Qadir has used his media conglomerate to advance his agenda and the fortune he made through a business empire that includes real estate, television stations and a theme park make his life very different to those he says he represents. Many Kurds have been hit by Baghdad s decision to cut   funding to Iraqi Kurdistan in 2014 in protest at its construction of a pipeline to export oil to Turkey.  Such actions by Baghdad have increased antagonism among the Kurds, who suffered under late Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, and increased their desire for independence   a desire uniting the about 30 million Kurds in Iraq, Iran, Syria and Turkey. But interviews by Reuters in several cities in Iraqi Kurdistan showed that some voters are worried about the possible fallout of the referendum even though they favor independence. Some are worried it could embolden the entrenched elite in Iraqi Kurdistan, which has long been plagued by political disunity and where Barzani has been a powerful force for more than two decades and president since 2005.  This referendum is not for the country, it s for the dictators in power,  said Ahmed Nana, a 22-year-old barista at a coffee shop in Sulaimaniya.  We all want a passport, a nationality, we want a reason to be proud, to have our own country. But right now, this referendum is a sideshow to distract from our political problems.   Parliament has not met since a coalition government broke up in 2015 and some factions support independence but not necessarily under Barzani s leadership. The regional government has called presidential and parliamentary elections for Nov. 1, but many Kurds doubt the voting will go ahead and the independence referendum has widened political divisions.   Nothing has polarized Kurdish society as much as this vote,  said Bahra Saleh, an analyst at the American University of Iraq, Sulaimani. Compounding the stalemate is the economic crisis triggered by Baghdad s decision to cut funding and compounded by low oil prices and the conflict with Islamic State.  The region is billions of dollars in debt and public salaries have been steeply cut since 2014, particularly affecting civil servants, Peshmerga fighters and teachers. Before holding the referendum, the regional government  needs to prepare the region economically for the region to sustain itself,  said Mohammad Tofiq Raheem, a leader of the Gorran party which was part of the coalition that ended in 2015. The regional economy depends partly on Turkey s goodwill to allow oil exports but also on trade with Iraq. There is also a generational split. Older Kurds hope the long struggle for statehood, dating at least to the division of the Middle East by colonial powers after World War One, will now end but younger people are driven by more than nationalism.

U.N. refugee agency urges Hungary to join EU migrant quota plan,"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - The head of the United Nations refugee agency praised the European Union s refugee quota system for member states on Tuesday and urged Hungary to drop its resistance to taking in its fair share of migrants. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is facing criticism over his continued refusal to change his anti-immigration stance despite a ruling by the European Union s top court this month upholding the bloc s quota system.  My impression is there is a very clear intention to limit the number of people coming to Hungary to seek protection,  U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said during a visit to Budapest. Grandi said the EU s quota system, introduced at the height of the migrant crisis in Europe in 2015, provided a model for other countries worldwide.  This was an EU decision... we agree with that decision,  he said.  It was a very good example of sharing that responsibility. It could be used globally... Forced displacement is a global phenomenon like climate change. You can only address it through global solutions and solidarity.  Grandi, who earlier in the day visited a camp on the Serbian border where migrants are detained while their asylum cases are pending, said razor wire fences and tough legal measures conveyed the wrong message that asylum was a crime. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose country took in the bulk of the migrants who entered the EU in 2015-16, has also urged Hungary to implement the EU court ruling. Grandi warned EU states in April not to send asylum seekers back to Hungary until Budapest amended a law that allows it to detain migrants at its border. EU rules allow member states to return refugees to the first safe country they reached on entering the 28-nation bloc. Orban has branded migrants - most of whom are Muslims from the Middle East and North Africa - a threat to Europe s historic Christian identity and a  Trojan horse for terrorism , and he has defended the asylum centers on Hungary s border. Grandi said migrants held there were not being mistreated but added that limitations on their freedom of movement while their cases are pending, especially for minors, raised problems.  Material conditions, food, medical care water, hygiene is acceptable,  he said.  The problem is the detention aspect. People are treated well but in a confined situation.

"London seeks ""deep security partnership"" with EU after Brexit","LONDON (Reuters) - Britain wants to have closer defence cooperation with the European Union after Brexit than other countries outside the union, according to a document that sets out a vision of  a deep security partnership  aimed at nudging talks forward. Stating that Britain is  unconditionally committed  to maintaining European security, the government said it wanted to contribute military assets to EU operations after it leaves the bloc and may offer to continue exchanging classified information.  The pledges were detailed in the government s sixth  future partnership paper  - part of efforts to counter criticism by EU officials that it is not prepared for negotiations to unravel more than 40 years of union. Underlining that Britain has the largest defence and development budgets in Europe, officials pressed what they consider to be one of their strongest arguments - that the government can offer defence and security support to the EU.  At a time of increased threats and international instability, the UK remains unwavering in its commitment to uphold European security,  Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said in a statement. Britain s role in the continent s defence  has never been more vital,  he said. Britain has deployed troops in some Baltic states to counter a resurgent Russia, has worked with the EU to tackle piracy off the Horn of Africa and worked on joint defence projects, such as the Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft. The EU executive said it would analyse the British proposal but stressed its policy of not opening negotiations on its future relationship with Britain until there is more progress on settling the terms of the British withdrawal from the bloc.  The EU is willing to establish partnerships with the UK in areas unrelated to trade, in particular the fight against terrorism and international crime as well as security, defence and foreign policy,  the European Commission s chief spokesman Margaritis Schinas told reporters. Pro-Brexit supporters argued before the EU referendum last year that closer defence cooperation between the bloc s member states was another sign of closer union, and on Tuesday the Veterans for Britain group said the paper was  a grave mistake . Tuesday s paper was intended as a conversation-starter rather than a concrete negotiating position, setting out areas such as information and personnel exchanges where Britain could contribute to European security, subject to negotiations. Some in Britain have suggested defence cooperation could be used as leverage in talks that so far have moved slowly, bogged down in arguments over the divorce bill. But its usefulness as leverage to push talks forward could be limited by the acknowledgement in the paper that Britain also benefits from security and intelligence sharing.  To meet our shared threats and maintain our values, continuity of areas that are at the heart of our joint foreign policy, defence and security, and development of infrastructure will be vital,  the paper said.

Merkel calls on Hungary to implement court ruling on refugee distribution,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel has urged Hungary to quickly implement a ruling by the European Union s top court that member states must take in a share of refugees who reach the continent. In its ruling last week, the court dismissed complaints by Slovakia and Hungary over the mandatory quotas introduced in 2015 to relocate asylum seekers from Greece and Italy. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Friday his government would not change its anti-immigration stance. In an interview with Berliner Zeitung newspaper to be published on Tuesday, Merkel insisted that Hungary had to implement the court ruling.  It s unacceptable that a government says a ruling of the European Court of Justice does not interest them,  Merkel said, according to a preview published by the daily late on Monday.     Asked whether this meant that Hungary had to leave the EU, Merkel said:  This means that a very fundamental question of Europe is being touched   because for me, Europe is an area of the rule of law. We will have to talk about this at the European Council in October.  During the Mediterranean migrant crisis of 2015, hundreds of thousand of refugees arrived in the Balkans, Italy and Greece. That prompted the EU to impose mandatory quotas on its member countries for relocating asylum seekers. The flow of migrants has since receded, easing pressure to force compliance on nationalist leaders like Orban, who is benefiting domestically from his tough anti-immigrant policies as elections approach in 2018. Merkel told another newspaper in an interview published over the weekend that she was optimistic that a dispute over how to distribute asylum seekers in the EU would soon be resolved.  The Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung (F.A.S.) newspaper also reported that in negotiations between member states about redistribution, a compromise was starting to emerge that would link accepting refugees to payments from the EU.

German police arrest five in raid of Nigerian 'husband' smuggling ring,"Berlin (Reuters) - Police in Germany on Tuesday arrested five people suspected of smuggling Nigerian men into the country through fake marriages, the German federal police said in a statement. Four hundred police officers raided 41 apartments and rooms believed to be linked to the gang in Berlin and other German cities, it said. The gang s suspected leaders - four women and a man, ranging in age from 46 to 65 - were arrested. Germany s newspaper Bild reported that a German federal police investigation conducted together with Portuguese authorities and Europol had found at least 70 men were brought in illegally through arranged marriages with Portuguese women. Europol, the European Union s law enforcement agency, served as a host for operational meetings between the Portuguese and German investigators, the police said. Clients had paid up to 13,000 euros ($15,550) for fake certificates, with part of the sum going to women who would fly from Portugal to join their  husbands  at the German immigration office to apply for an EU residency permit. Similar cases were detected in June when the police found that more than 700 German men in Berlin had married pregnant asylum seekers from Vietnam, Africa and Eastern Europe for money so the mothers would obtain a residency permit and for the future babies to be born as German citizens. The German Interior Ministry estimates there are about 5,000 such cases per year nationwide. ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1

Philippine Congress backs annual budget of just $20 for agency probing drugs war,"MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine lawmakers allied with President Rodrigo Duterte on Tuesday voted to allocate an annual budget of just 1,000 pesos ($20) to the Commission on Human Rights, a public body that has clashed repeatedly with Duterte over his bloody war on drugs. About four-fifths of lower house members present supported the move to cut the budget to almost nil, in what critics of the anti-drugs campaign call retaliation for the agency s efforts to investigate thousands of killings over the past 15 months. The CHR deserved a low budget for being a  useless  body and defending criminals  rights, house speaker Pantaleon Alvarez, a close ally of Duterte, said in a television interview.  If you want to protect the rights of criminals, get your budget from the criminals,  he said.  It s that simple. Why should you get budget from the government and yet you are not doing your job?  Congressman Edcel Lagman said 32 minority lawmakers opposed the measure during the debate at the second reading. He said Duterte s supporters were  virtually imposing the death penalty on a constitutionally created and mandated independent office . The CHR requested a budget of 1.72 billion pesos for 2018, but the government proposed 678 million. Congress voted to slash that to just 1,000 pesos, a huge cut from the 2017 budget of 749 million. The budget requires another vote, then Senate approval before it becomes final. Human rights monitors said the CHR was a vital institution that stands no chance of doing its job without a proper budget. Phelim Kine, deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch, said the overwhelming support for the cut was  part of the Duterte administration s attempt to prevent independent institutions to check its abuses . Agnes Callamard, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial killings, said Filipinos deserved a strong, independent rights organization that could hold the state accountable.  Instead they are getting a  war on drugs  which, by the president s own account, has failed to curtail addiction rates, while creating a climate of fear and insecurity, feeding impunity, and undermining the constitutional fabrics of the Country,  Callamard posted on her Facebook page.  If the Philippines Congress is looking for public money being wasted, damaging and hurting the Philippines society, this is it.  The CHR has long complained it lacks manpower and resources to fully investigate the killings, the majority of which activists say are of users and small-time peddlers, with few high-profile arrests. Filipinos, however, are largely supportive of the crackdown as a solution to tackling rampant crime, which Duterte says stems from drug addiction. Critics maintain police are executing suspects, and say the government has what is effectively a kill policy. Duterte has angrily rejected that and police say they kill only in self-defense. CHR head, Chito Gascon, said the measly budget was an attempt to force his resignation. He said he would take the issue to the Supreme Court if necessary.  The principal reason why I cannot resign my office is that to do so is to weaken the institution itself,  Gascon said.  Asking me to resign would lead to essentially making the institution forever at the mercy of politics.  ($1=50.8690 Philippine pesos) ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1
Norfolk Southern resumes limited trains service in Irma-hit areas,"(Reuters) - Norfolk Southern Corp said on Tuesday some rail routes closed by Hurricane Irma were being restored to service as it was safe to do so, and has started to run trains accordingly.

EBRD urges Poland to revive privatizations,"WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland should lower its  surprising  level of state control over the economy, particularly in the banking and energy sectors, and speed up privatizations, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development s president said on Tuesday. The ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, which won the 2015 parliamentary election, has called a halt to privatizations and questioned the rationale and pricing of the previous centrist government s sales.  Instead, state-run financial firms and utilities have taken over some smaller rivals from foreign investors, helping the government increase the share of domestic capital in the banking and energy sectors.   It s quite surprising, given Poland s leadership in the whole transition race, that so much of the economy is still in state hands,  Suma Chakrabarti told Reuters during a visit to Warsaw.  Since Poland overthrew communism in 1989 and started its transition to a market economy, the number of companies controlled by the state has shrunk to several hundred from more than 8,000. But Chakrabarti said the PiS government, which argues the state can better serve Poland s economic interests than foreign corporations, should do more.  Poland has pockets of poverty and it s important for the state to act,  he said.  But, what I m not in general a supporter (of) ... is when states become ... the prime economic actor in major sectors.  There is at least one state-owned enterprise in 39 out of 43 sectors in Poland, and 12 of the 20 biggest listed companies are controlled by the state, representing 77 percent of (blue chip index) WIG20. That s quite high,  he said. Since PiS came to power, Polish insurer PZU and a state-fund PFR bought a 33-percent stake in bank Pekao from Italy s UniCredit, while Poland s biggest power firm PGE has offered to buy power assets owned by France s EDF.  The process of transition toward a more market economy is actually not as fast as it was in early days, in the 90s. That has slowed down. We would love to see more privatizations in Poland,  Chakrabarti said.  The EBRD has invested 8.6 billion euro ($10.28 billion) in Poland, mostly in the private sector, since the early 1990s. The EBRD head also warned that Poland s overhaul of the judiciary and the rule of law, which raised concerns in the European Commission, are an issue for investors. [nL5N1KK08Q] [nL8N1LH28P]  Every time one talks about the EU, Brexit is one thing people always mention but the other is obviously the issues about Poland,  Chakrabarti said.   Poland is still not achieving its ... potential. And policies matter ... I think Poland could achieve a higher level of private sector investment and foreign direct investment with the right policies , he said. The EBRD sees its investment in Poland falling to about 600-650 million euros this year from 776 million in 2016.  The bank will likely invest similar amounts in the coming years as the economy is growing, Chakrabarti said, but will narrow the financing to fewer areas. Rather than invest in renewable sources of energy, which are subject to a number of unexpected legal changes, it would help private companies tap foreign markets, the president said.   For many investors the more boring a country, the better. Poland is not boring and that is the problem,  Chakrabarti said.   ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1
"In election test, ousted Pakistan PM's heir-apparent takes limelight","LAHORE (Reuters) - In campaigning for a Pakistan by-election seen as a test of support for ousted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, the most visible figure is not on the ballot: Sharif s daughter, Maryam, widely touted as his political heir-apparent. This past weekend, crowds mobbed Maryam s car and threw rose petals as she crisscrossed the eastern city of Lahore campaigning for her mother, Kulsoom, who is the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party s candidate to contest the seat Nawaz was forced to vacate by a Supreme Court ruling in July. With Kulsoom in London for cancer surgery, accompanied by Nawaz, 43-year-old Maryam has led the campaign with fiery speeches denouncing Nawaz s opponents and the Supreme Court. Her influence within the PML-N has grown in recent years, with senior party figures crediting her with Nawaz s move to embrace relatively more pro-women and liberal causes in a staunchly conservative nation of 208 million people. In a rare interview with foreign media, Maryam outlined to Reuters what drives her political ambitions as she emerges from her father s shadow to become a prominent figure in the ruling party he still controls.  I m proud to be the torch bearer of ideology which PML-N has,  Maryam said at the weekend in Punjab s provincial capital Lahore, her father s electoral power base.  I am (Nawaz s) reflection, I am his extension. I have grown up espousing his agenda, his ideology.  Maryam has framed the election as a chance for voters to protest the Supreme Court s verdict against her father and help the PML-N flex its electoral muscle.  Your vote was disrespected and disregarded, will you answer to this disrespect on Sept. 17?  Maryam asked at a recent rally. The by-election is seen as a litmus test for the PML-N s political fortunes in the wake of Nawaz s ouster, and an early indicator of voter sentiment ahead of a general election next year. Opposition leader Imran Khan, on the ascendancy after Nawaz s ouster, and eager to make inroads into the PML-N s political heartlands in Punjab, has accused Maryam of benefiting from alleged corruption swirling around her father, and cast the by-election as a plebiscite on corruption.  This election will decide where the people of Pakistan stand,  Khan, the leader of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, told crowds in Lahore last week. The PML-N made Maryam - a telegenic but inexperienced politician - the face of the campaign despite a Supreme Court-appointed panel accusing her of signing forged documents to obscure ownership of offshore companies used to buy upmarket London flats. She denies any wrongdoing but the Supreme Court has ordered the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) to launch a criminal investigation into her, Nawaz and other family members. Ahead of another rally on Sunday, Maryam hinted at military interference in Pakistani politics, a source of instability since independence in 1947, and portrayed herself as a campaigner for democracy.  Our history is marred with dictatorships and repeated attacks on democracy, so this is what I struggle for,  she told Reuters. Maryam says her father s dismissal by the Supreme Court is a conspiracy, noting his success in reinvigorating the economy - with a pro-business focus on infrastructure spending to boost development - and overall popularity  sent alarm bells ringing  for those who don t want Pakistan to have a strong leader.  This was the main reason he was being targeted,  she said, before adding:  That s all I can say.  Such coded talk is a familiar dance in Pakistan, where politicians speak between the lines to imply that the hidden hand of the powerful military is behind unfolding events. Asked if she is talking about elements of the military being involved in her father s ouster, as some senior PML-N figures have hinted, Maryam paused before saying:  It s not my place to comment . Maryam was coy when asked whether she has ambitions to be prime minister one day, saying she was not eyeing anything and was for now  happy with love and affection that I m getting . But senior PML-N officials expect her to at least become a minister in the next cabinet if the party holds on to power after the 2018 poll. Others have suggested she may become a leader soon. Maryam was more forthcoming when asked about comparisons with slain female leader Benazir Bhutto, the daughter of former premier Zulfikar Bhutto who vied for power with Nawaz during two decades of political turmoil and tussles with the military.  I have a lot of respect for the lady, but ... the only thing which is common between us is gender,  she said.     ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1
War-ravaged South Sudan may scrap expensive oil subsidies,"JUBA (Reuters) - War-ravaged South Sudan is considering scrapping state subsidies on oil because it hasn t been able to pay civil servants for four months and diplomatic staff abroad are being evicted over unpaid rent, the deputy finance minister said.  Ending the subsidies would free up desperately needed cash, Mou Ambrose Thiik told Reuters in an interview.  Nearly four years of civil war have destroyed South Sudan s economy. Inflation was at 165 percent in August, the 21st consecutive month of triple-digit growth. The government depends on oil revenues, but attacks have slashed production to less than a third of pre-war levels.  The government expects to receive $820 million from oil this year. Out of that, $453 million will go to neighboring Sudan as payment for using its infrastructure for export; $183 million on the oil subsidy; and $166 million is allocated to the budget, which has a gaping deficit.   We were thinking that we would lift subsidies on the oil and will be able to cover this (deficit) and pay our salaries more easily,  said Thiik.  But we have some resistance from the parliament.  Lawmaker Nailo Mayo, the chair of the finance committee, said parliamentarians just wanted more information on who might be affected by ending the subsidies.   The committee ... is concerned about the social cost, I mean the suffering that could accrue to the poorer section of the community, and also we are afraid of the political cost, that is stability, arising from lack of transport,  he said.  State-subsidized oil sells at 22 South Sudanese pounds (SSP) per liter, but severe shortages mean many people buy it on the black market for 300 SSP per liter. The SSP trades at about 17.5 to the dollar on the black market and 17.68 at the central bank.  The process for allocating subsidized fuel, which is purchased with government-issued coupons, is unclear. South Sudan s conflict began in 2013 after President Salva Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, fired his deputy, Riek Machar, a Nuer. The conflict degenerated into ethnic fighting marked by widespread sexual violence.  Out of an original population of 12 million, 4 million have fled their homes. More than half of those who remain in South Sudan need food aid and nearly three-quarters of children are out of school. Thiik acknowledged social services were dire and said the finance ministry was trying to save money. It wants to reduce the number of embassies by a third, he said, because it is unable to fund them.   They (embassy staff) didn t get their salary for seven months and also they have arrears in their premises,  he said.  Asked about civil servants who had not been paid for four months, he said:  it is true that we have not secured money to pay salaries.    ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1

Iran strikes deal with Syria to repair power grid,"LONDON/BEIRUT (Reuters) - Iran signed deals with Damascus on Tuesday to repair Syria s power grid, state media said, a potentially lucrative move for Tehran that points to a deepening economic role after years of fighting in the Syrian conflict. Shunned by Western powers, the Syrian government is looking to friendly states such as Iran, Russia and China to play a major role in rebuilding the country, as the war heads toward its seventh year.  Since at least 2012, Iran has provided critical military support to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad s government, helping it regain control of swathes of the country. Iran experts say Tehran is now looking to reap a financial dividend. In January, Iran s government and entities close to Iran s elite Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) signed major telecommunications and mining deals with Damascus. [nL5N1F84NX] On Tuesday, Iran and Syria signed a memorandum of understanding during a visit by Syria s electricity minister to Tehran, including building a power plant the coastal province Latakia with a capacity of 540 megawatts, Syrian state news agency SANA said.  The agreement involves restoring the main control center for Syria s electricity grid in the capital Damascus, it said. The new electricity deals could be worth millions of euros, Iranian state media said on Tuesday.  The agreement also includes rehabilitating a 90-megawatt power station in Deir al-Zor province, where the Syrian army and allied forces have made swift advances against Islamic State in recent days.  With Russian air power and Iran-backed militias, the government has driven rebels from Syria s main urban centers in western Syria and marched eastwards against Islamic State.  The Syrian government ... is working relentlessly to restore the power system,  SANA cited Syrian Electricity Minister Mohammad Zuhair Kharboutli as saying.  Iranian companies will have a role in rebuilding Syria.  Two contracts were also signed, including for Iran to supply power to Aleppo city, which the Syrian military and its allies fully regained last year in a major blow to rebels, SANA said.     We will stand by the Syrian people to rebuild this country ... We will bring light to houses of the Syrian people,  Sattar Mahmoudi, Iran s caretaker energy minister, was quoted as saying on the ministry s website. The deals will be worth hundreds of millions of euros if finalised, and Tehran is also keen to expand its cooperation to construct water and sewerage facilities in Syria, he said. More than 1,000 soldiers deployed by the Revolutionary Guards to Syria have died on the front lines of the multi-sided conflict in recent years.  Iran s Revolutionary Guards saved the Assad regime from collapsing at a heavy price for Damascus for now they own Syria,  Emanuele Ottolenghi, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies told Reuters.  I expect these to be the first in a wave of tenders won by IRGC companies, which will have the best reconstruction projects to Iran,  he added. Iranian firms are already involved in a series of electricity generation projects in Syria. Iran aims to export electricity and create the biggest power network in the Islamic world by hooking up Iran s national grid with those of Iraq and Lebanon. Iran said in August that it has exported $58 million worth of goods to Syria in the first four months of this year, marking a 100 percent increase compared with the same period a year ago.

Poles see dwindling economic benefit of living in Britain,"WARSAW (Reuters) - After Britain decided to leave the European Union, Emilia Kos, a 31-year-old mother of three from Scunthorpe in eastern England, faced a choice of her own. She could visit her family in Poland once a year, or she could take a holiday abroad. The plunge in the value of the pound after the June 2016 referendum on EU membership meant she could only afford one.  That, coupled with a fear they are no longer welcome in Scunthorpe, persuaded her to move back to Poland last month, after nine years in Britain.  A weaker pound meant we had to choose between a holiday and a visit home,  Kos said at her new home in Wroclaw.  We can afford to live in Britain, but it isn t comfortable to have to tell your family that you won t come for Christmas because you want to go to Greece.  She is not alone. Families like hers that headed to Britain after the ex-communist states of eastern Europe joined the EU in 2004 increasingly are heading back. Economics are one reason. The local economies are booming and unemployment has dropped to record lows. But it s not the only factor.  Brexit was an official statement from the Brits: we don t want you here,  said Szymon Kudzma, a 33-year-old IT specialist who lives in Rushden in Northamptonshire, England. He plans to return to Poland before the end of the year, after 14 years in Britain.  For immigrants like him, the economic benefits of living in the west no longer outweigh a sense of alienation abroad and the hostility toward migrants in Britain. The roughly 800,000 Poles living there fuelled an emotive debate over immigration that helped the  Leave  side win the Brexit vote.  We could feel Brexit in the air for a long time,  said Kos, who lived in Lincolnshire, a relatively euro-sceptic part of Britain.   We felt pressure from the English. A friend of mine wasn t able to speak Polish at work ... Clients sometimes walked out of my partner s store when they learned he was Polish.  UK statistical data showed last month that net migration fell to its lowest in three years in the 12 months to the end of March. The biggest drop came from eight eastern European countries, including Poland and Hungary, that joined the EU in 2004 [nL8N1LA2BH]. In Poland, official data show fewer than 3,000 people registered with the authorities as emigrating to Britain in 2016, down from more than 7,000 in 2014. More than 3,000 Poles registered as returning last year.  We see very clearly that more and more Poles are coming back to Poland. Our analyses show that this trend has accelerated after the Brexit vote,  said Michal Brzezinski, chief executive at a Polish moving company, Clicktrans. In the first quarter of 2017, moves to Poland from abroad recorded by Clicktrans were almost three times greater than the moves from Poland abroad. In 2014, more Poles wanted to emigrate than return.  More than 80 percent of moves organized by Clicktrans so far this year between Poland and Britain were returns. Two years ago, the same number emigrated to Britain as came back. Many of the returnees say the economic calculations don t add up anymore, even if average wages in Poland are still a fraction of pay in Britain.  The wage gap has narrowed since 2004, unemployment is down to 7 percent from more than 20 percent, and Warsaw  conservative government introduced child subsidies in 2016.  Britain s decision to leave the EU has also improved employment prospects at home. London-based banks and other financial services are looking for new bases for some operations in countries that will remain in the EU, such as Poland.  I don t think our living standards will change significantly after we return,  said Kudzma, the IT specialist in Northamptonshire.  The IT sector is well-paid in Poland. Our wages will be smaller than in Britain, but the cost of living is lower. The balance should remain the same.  For many of the returnees, the pound s decline means their savings are dwindling or the help they send to families in Poland costs more. Sterling has lost 20 percent of its value against the zloty since the Brexit vote and 35 percent since Poland joined the EU, according to Reuters data.

Exclusive: Trump to weigh more aggressive U.S. strategy on Iran - sources,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is weighing a strategy that could allow more aggressive U.S. responses to Iran s forces, its Shi ite Muslim proxies in Iraq and Syria, and its support for militant groups, according to six current and former U.S. officials. The proposal was prepared by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, national security adviser H.R. McMaster and other top officials, and presented to Trump at a National Security Council meeting on Friday, the sources said. It could be agreed and made public before the end of September, two of the sources said. All of the sources are familiar with the draft and requested anonymity because Trump has yet to act on it. In contrast to detailed instructions handed down by President Barack Obama and some of his predecessors, Trump is expected to set broad strategic objectives and goals for U.S. policy but leave it to U.S. military commanders, diplomats and other U.S. officials to implement the plan, said a senior administration official.  Whatever we end up with, we want to implement with allies to the greatest extent possible,  the official added. The White House declined to comment. The plan is intended to increase the pressure on Tehran to curb its ballistic missile programs and support for militants, several sources said.  I would call it a broad strategy for the range of Iranian malign activities: financial materials, support for terror, destabilization in the region, especially Syria and Iraq and Yemen,  said another senior administration official.    The proposal also targets cyber espionage and other activity and potentially nuclear proliferation, the official said. The administration is still debating a new stance on a 2015 agreement, sealed by Obama, to curb Iran s nuclear weapons program. The draft urges consideration of tougher economic sanctions if Iran violates the 2015 agreement. The proposal includes more aggressive U.S. interceptions of Iranian arms shipments such as those to Houthi rebels in Yemen and Palestinian groups in Gaza and Egypt s Sinai, a current official and a knowledgeable former U.S. official said. The plan also recommends the United States react more aggressively in Bahrain, whose Sunni Muslim monarchy has been suppressing majority Shi ites, who are demanding reforms, the sources said. In addition, U.S. naval forces could react more forcefully when harassed by armed speed boats operated by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Iran s paramilitary and espionage contingent, three of the sources said. U.S. ships have fired flares and warning shots to drive off IRGC boats that made what were viewed as threatening approaches after refusing to heed radio warnings in the passageway for 35 percent of the world s seaborne petroleum exports. U.S. commanders now are permitted to open fire only when they think their vessels and the lives of their crews are endangered. The sources offered no details of the proposed changes in the rules, which are classified. The plan does not include an escalation of U.S. military activity in Syria and Iraq. Trump s national security aides argued that a more muscular military response to Iranian proxies in Syria and Iraq would complicate the U.S.-led fight against Islamic State, which they argued should remain the top priority, four of the sources said. Mattis and McMaster, as well as the heads of the U.S. Central Command and U.S. Special Forces Command, have opposed allowing U.S. commanders in Syria and Iraq to react more forcefully to provocations by the IRGC, Hezbollah and other Iranian-backed Shi ite militias, the four sources said. The advisers are concerned that more permissive rules of engagement would divert U.S. forces from defeating the remnants of Islamic State, they said. Moreover, looser rules could embroil the United States in a conflict with Iran while U.S. forces remain overstretched, and Trump has authorized a small troop increase for Afghanistan, said one senior administration official. A former U.S. official said Hezbollah and Iranian-backed Shi ite militias in Iraq have been  very helpful  in recapturing vast swaths of the caliphate that Islamic State declared in Syria and Iran in 2014. U.S. troops supporting Kurdish and Sunni Arab fighters battling Islamic State in Syria have been wrestling with how to respond to hostile actions by Iranian-backed forces. In some of the most notable cases, U.S. aircraft shot down two Iranian-made drones in June. Both were justified as defensive acts narrowly tailored to halt an imminent threat on the ground. Trump s opposition to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), poses a dilemma for policymakers. Most of his national security aides favor remaining in the pact, as do U.S. allies Israel and Saudi Arabia despite their reservations about Iran s adherence to the agreement, said U.S. officials involved in the discussions.  The main issue for us was to get the president not to discard the JCPOA. But he had very strong feelings, backed by (U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations) Nikki Haley, that they should be more aggressive with Iran,  one of the two U.S. officials said.  Almost all the strategies presented to him were ones that tried to preserve the JCPOA but lean forward on these other (issues.)  ",worldnews,"September 11, 2017 ",1

Islamic State flags not flying in Bosnia: PM,"SARAJEVO (Reuters) - Islamic State flags are not flying in Bosnia, Prime Minister Denis Zvizdic said on Tuesday, dismissing allegations by some European leaders that radical Bosnian Muslims in the Balkan country were posing a terrorist threat for Europe. Bosnian Muslims generally practice a moderate form of Islam but some have adopted radical Salafi Islam from foreign fighters who came to the country during its 1992-95 war to fight alongside Muslims against Orthodox Serbs and Catholic Croats. Some joined Islamic State in Syria and Iraq but police said departures had stopped completely in the past 18 months and more than half of those who returned have been jailed under a law prohibiting people to fight in foreign countries. Czech President Milos Zeman has said there was a risk Islamic State may form its European base in Bosnia, where  ISIS (Islamic State) black flags are already flying in several towns , according to reports.  Croatian President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic has warned of  thousands of fighters returning to Bosnia from Syria and Iraq , while Croatian magazine Globus last week put the number of radicalized Bosnian Muslims at 5,000-10,000. Zvizdic said such allegations were unfounded and politically motivated and could damage Bosnia as an investment and tourism destination.   ISIS flags are not flying in Bosnia,  Zvizdic told reporters after meeting the security minister and the heads of five security and intelligence agencies.       There have been no departures to foreign war zones, we have not had any incident that could be characterized as an act of terrorism and we work to prevent the possibility of any such incident,  Zvizdic said, referring to the last two years during which several terrorist attacks took place across Europe.   Bosnia s security agencies say a total of 240 Bosnian citizens have departed to fight for Islamic State since 2012, and 116 remained there. Out of 44 who had returned to Bosnia, 23 were jailed. Security Minister Dragan Mektic said terrorism threats in Bosnia were mainly external and its agencies last month prevented a person with possible links to terrorists from entering the country.  In 2015, two Bosnian army soldiers and a policeman were killed in two separate attacks in Bosnia. No links to wider groups was found.    ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1
Buckeye targets normal operations at Bahamas oil terminal on Tuesday,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Buckeye Partners LP said it aims to resume normal operations its Bahamas crude oil and fuel terminal, also known as Borco, on Tuesday after Hurricane Irma rampaged through the Caribbean as one of the most powerful Atlantic hurricanes on record.  The terminal, located in Freeport, on Grand Bahama Island, has no reported injuries, incidents or damage and restart activities began on Monday afternoon, the company said.  While power is still out at the terminal, Buckeye expects terminal and marine operations to return to normal on Tuesday depending on weather conditions. The Borco terminal is Buckeye s largest and has the capacity to store about 26.2 million barrels of oil, fuel oil, gasoline and other products. It is also the largest fuel storage terminal in the western hemisphere, the Buckeye Global Marine Partners website said. Buckeye was forced to shut the terminal due to Irma on Sept. 7, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters last week. Irma has killed nearly 40 people in the Caribbean and at least six in Florida and Georgia and hammered energy infrastructure in those regions, even as recovery operations from storm Harvey were under way. It will likely dissipate from Tuesday evening, the National Hurricane Center said. Buckeye s terminals in Puerto Rico have returned to normal, a spokesman told Reuters in an email. The U.S.-based midstream company had closed the 4.6 million-barrel Yabucoa oil terminal in Puerto Rico last week. The company also said it aims to return some Florida terminals and pipelines to limited service on back-up power in 12-48 hours. All employees at Tampa and in the Miami area are all reported safe and accounted for, Buckeye said. Nustar Energy LP  said on Monday it had put damage assessments of its terminal on the Caribbean island of St. Eustatius on hold as it prepared for Hurricane Jose. Several tanks and other equipment at the 13.03 million-barrel crude and product storage terminal was damaged by Irma last week. The National Hurricane Center was monitoring Hurricane Jose, which was spinning in the Atlantic about 700 miles (1,130 km) west of Florida. ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1
EU tells easterners to take in refugees,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Eastern European Union states must drop their resistance and accept their share of refugees who arrived in the bloc, officials and diplomats said on Tuesday after a court ruled they must abide by the quota. The EU s highest court ruled last week that member states must take in a share of refugees who reach Europe, dismissing complaints by Slovakia and Hungary and reigniting an east-west row that has shaken the bloc s cohesion.     Brussels and other capitals hope member states will respect the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruling. Poland and Hungary are opposed to accepting anybody, their reluctance shared by ex-communist peers Slovakia and the Czech Republic, who have, however, accepted a handful of people under a 2015 EU scheme designed to move 160,000 from Italy and Greece.  All members of the EU must respect the ruling,  Manfred Weber, the head of the of the largest faction in the European Parliament, told a news conference.  The legal fight is over.   Migration is still a political wound of the political landscape all over Europe ... All the reasonable and all the responsible politicians have to go now (toward) a compromise.  EU officials and diplomats say they will make another push this autumn to try to bridge the divisions. EU interior ministers will debate the matter in Brussels on Wednesday. However, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has said he will fight on. Poland, whose nationalist government is now engulfed in spiraling feuds with the bloc, said its migration stance has not changed. Italy and Greece, where most of the people crossing the Mediterranean disembark, as well as Germany, Sweden and other wealthy EU states where refugees and migrants want to head, want a quick aid scheme for any repeat of 2015. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she hoped the dispute will soon be over after the ECJ ruling, but also made clear she saw it unacceptable for EU states to disregard the court. The bloc may eventually vote on any changes to its migration and asylum laws by majority, leaving those reluctant behind, a move that would also widen the east-west splits in the bloc.  I don t think there is anything to argue about anymore. The decision is there for member states to implement,  said a senior EU diplomat.  Struggling to control chaotic movement of people at the height of the crisis, some EU states introduced emergency border checks inside what normally is the bloc s Schengen zone of control-free travel.  They expire in November and Brussels is keen to restore the free flow of people across the EU, often hailed as a proud and tangible achievement of European integration. Also on Wednesday, EU ministers will discuss a proposal by Germany, France, Denmark, Austria and Norway - not in the EU but part of Schengen - to allow for such extraordinary border checks to continue on security grounds, rather than migration. In practice, that would mean keeping those already there in place for longer, as well as being able to apply them more easily in the future. Denmark said last May it wanted to go on with border restrictions, while Germany has said it needs the checks to combat the threat of Islamic militancy in Europe after a raft of attacks around the bloc.

"South African court ruling delivers setback to Zuma, allies","CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - South Africa s President Jacob Zuma suffered a setback on Tuesday when a court ruled that the election of a faction loyal to him in his home province two years ago was invalid. The High Court ruling highlights growing rifts within Zuma s ruling African National Congress (ANC) and could hamper his efforts to ensure his ex-wife Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma replaces him as party leader and eventually as president.     KwaZulu Natal province, situated on the east coast of South Africa, is the ancestral home of the scandal-prone president and will also command most votes at the ANC s national conference in December, when Zuma will step down as party chief. Zuma loyalists took control of the province in November 2015 at a party conference after ousting former premier Senzo Mchunu, but he filed a court case against his removal, citing procedural irregularities - an appeal upheld by Tuesday s ruling.  The eighth KwaZulu Natal provincial elective conference (in November 2015) ...  and decisions taken at that conference are declared unlawful and void,  Judge Jerome Mnguni ruled. An ANC provincial official told eNCA television channel the KwaZulu Natal ANC leadership would not leave their posts and would probably appeal against the ruling. The party s national spokesman, Zizi Kodwa, said the ANC would study the judgment before taking any further steps. The ruling could further erode Zuma s support base. Zuma, 75, survived a no-confidence vote in South Africa s parliament last month but only after some 30 ANC lawmakers broke ranks and voted with the opposition.  Whoever wins the December contest will lead the ANC, which has ruled South Africa since the end of apartheid, into national elections in 2019, when Zuma s tenure as South Africa s president expires. Tuesday s ruling could hit support for Dlamini-Zuma, a former health and foreign affairs minister, and allow her likely rival, Vice-President Cyril Ramaphosa, a trade unionist-turned-business tycoon, to make gains in the province, analysts said.  Despite court ruling Dlamini-Zuma still likely to be favored in KwaZulu-Natal... but the ruling does allow his (Ramaphosa s) campaign to make more inroads in the province,  said Darais Jonker, Eurasia Group s director for Africa, in a note. Neither Dlamini-Zuma, 67, nor Ramaphosa, 64, have yet stated an intention to enter the race to succeed Zuma in December. Analysts say Zuma s priority is to ensure his chosen candidate succeeds him as party leader so he can complete his presidential term and avoid scrutiny over corruption charges his opponents would like reinstated. The ANC s flag bearer at the national elections usually becomes the country s president, given the ANC s dominance. Daniel Silke, a political analyst, said the judgment could increase factionalism in KwaZulu Natal.  There is now the potential for confusion and disarray within the ANC in the province which could lead to a weakening of Mrs Zuma s position going forward,  Silke said.

"North Korea does not want war, world does not want regime change: U.N.","GENEVA (Reuters) - North Korea does not want to start a nuclear war and the world is not seeking to overthrow its leader Kim Jong Un, the U.N. disarmament chief said on Tuesday. Izumi Nakamitsu, U.N. High Representative for Disarmament Affairs, said there was hope for a peaceful end to the tension  caused by the nuclear ambitions of North Korea, also known as Democratic People s Republic of Korea (DPRK).  I don t think DPRK wants to start a nuclear war,  she told a news conference in Geneva. On Monday, the U.N. Security Council unanimously decided to step up sanctions on North Korea after its sixth and largest nuclear test, prompting a war of words between diplomats at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva.  Asked if the pressure on North Korea was pushing the world to the brink of nuclear war, Nakamitsu said U.N. officials were in touch with all sides and nobody - including North Korea - saw a military solution to the crisis.  That is just too catastrophic,  she said.  I think we all understand the consequences of a military escalation, a  military solution . That s why we keep saying that it would not be a solution for anyone, including DPRK.  She added:  Maybe I m missing something but as far as I hear, no one is really asking for any collapse of DPRK, quite the contrary. No one is talking about regime change, quite the contrary.  She was also hopeful that, as in the past, increased nuclear tensions might yield progress in disarmament talks.  When people say that because the international security environment is so difficult, tensions are so high, that we can t discuss disarmament, that is historically not accurate.  U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres has offered to play a role in mediating, as has Switzerland. So far no such steps have been taken, but the United Nations was prepared to get involved if asked to do so, Nakamitsu said.  We are definitely preparing ourselves, exploring scenarios as part of our normal contingency planning.  ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1

"U.S. rejects Cambodian accusations, calls for opposition leader's release","PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Washington s ambassador to Cambodia on Tuesday rejected government accusations of interference by the United States as  inaccurate, misleading and baseless  and called for the release of detained opposition leader Kem Sokha. It was the strongest U.S. response since the Sept. 3 arrest of Kem Sokha, who has been charged with treason and accused of plotting with the United States to take power from Prime Minister Hun Sen, a former Khmer Rouge commander who has ruled Cambodia for more than 30 years. Hun Sen, now one of China s closest regional allies, has stepped up rhetoric against Washington alongside a crackdown on opponents, independent media and other critics ahead of a general election next year. The U.S.-funded Radio Free Asia said on Tuesday that the pressure had forced it to stop operations in Cambodia.  On dozens of occasions over the past year, the United States has been subject to intentionally inaccurate, misleading and baseless accusations,  Ambassador William Heidt said in a statement.  All of the accusations you have heard in recent weeks about the United States - every one of them - are false.  Heidt called for the release of Kem Sokha, an end to pressure on civil society and dialogue between the government and opposition to  salvage  elections and restore ties between the two countries.  If Cambodia s national elections were held today, no credible international observer would certify them as free, fair and reflecting the will of the Cambodian people,  Heidt said. American and Western companies were feeling less welcome in Cambodia  and fewer will invest , he said. Government spokesman Phay Siphan said the evidence of American collusion came from Kem Sokha himself and that Cambodia did not see the United States as an enemy.  We just use our rights to tell the U.S. not to interfere in our domestic affairs,  he told Reuters.     On Monday, 65-year-old Hun Sen threatened that Kem Sokha s Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) would be dissolved if it continued to back him. Kem Sokha, 64, is the only serious election rival to Hun Sen, who could face his biggest electoral challenge next year. The opposition will not boycott the July 2018 general election in which it faces Hun Sen s ruling Cambodian People s Party (CPP), senior CNRP member Son Chhay told a news briefing on Tuesday. The evidence presented against Kem Sokha so far is a video recorded in 2013 in which he discusses a strategy to win power with the help of unspecified Americans. His lawyers have dismissed it as nonsense, saying he was only discussing election strategy. Complaining of a  relentless crackdown on independent voices , Washington-based Radio Free Asia said it was being forced to close its local bureau after almost 20 years in the country.   Recent developments have intensified to an unprecedented level, as Cambodia s ruling party shamelessly seeks to remove any obstacle or influence standing in its way of achieving absolute power,  said the station s president, Libby Liu. She said RFA would continue to cover Cambodia. ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1

Scottish government recommends rejection of EU withdrawal bill,"EDINBURGH (Reuters) - Scotland s devolved government has recommended that its parliament at Holyrood withhold consent for legislation to withdraw Britain from the European Union, on the grounds that it could water down their powers, a document filed by the Scottish government said on Tuesday. The approval of the devolved parliaments in Scotland and Wales does not represent a veto to the Brexit process, although it would stretch Britain s constitutional tensions yet further by forcing the UK government of Prime Minister Theresa May to ignore the expressed wish of the devolved bodies. Scotland would work with the Welsh government to propose amendments to the bill which, if agreement were reached, would allow it to recommend its passage in the devolved assemblies, the document said. The bill will end the supremacy of EU law in the UK and convert all existing EU laws into domestic ones.  Along with the Welsh government, the Scottish government cannot recommend to the parliament that it gives consent to the bill as currently drafted,  the document filed with the Scottish parliament said.  The Scottish government is also clear that the result of withdrawal from the EU should not be centralization of power in Whitehall and Westminster. However, that is what the bill proposes.   Scotland s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has been arguing that Brexit as proposed flies in the face of the devolution agreement, which up to now has allowed assemblies in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast to legislate on their own domestic policies such as health and education. Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to keep EU membership in a June 2016 referendum while England and Wales voted to leave.  It remains a matter of regret to the Scottish government that the UK plans to withdraw from the EU. The government nevertheless accepts that preparations should be made for withdrawal from the EU, including preserving a functioning legal system,  the document said.  The Scottish government s key objections to the bill as introduced relate to the provisions on the competence of the Scottish parliament and government (...) and those on powers for UK and Scottish ministers to alter domestic law,  it said. The Scottish and Welsh governments argue that returning powers now exercised by the EU to the UK government will imply restrictions on the power of Scottish and Welsh chambers. But Britain s Scotland minister, David Mundell, has said that the repeal will ultimately result in a boost in devolved parliamentary power.     ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1

"Brazil judge suspends aspects of J&F leniency, asset sales in limbo","BRASILIA (Reuters) - A Brazilian judge on Monday suspended criminal aspects of the leniency agreement of J&F Investimentos SA, a holding company run by the scandal-ridden Batista family, adding to uncertainty about billions of dollars of asset sales. Federal Judge Vallisney de Souza Oliveira held up the criminal immunity of additional J&F executives until the Supreme Court makes a final ruling on Joesley Batista s plea bargain in a corruption probe, whose benefits were revoked due to evidence he had hidden some crimes from prosecutors. Police flew Batista to Brasilia on Monday following his surrender to authorities in Sao Paulo over the weekend after he lost immunity from prosecution. Police also raided J&F s headquarters and Batista s home on orders from Supreme Court Justice Edson Fachin. Uncertainty about J&F s leniency agreement could threaten an estimated 14 billion reais ($4.5 billion) of recent asset sales  and jeopardize the future of a company that diversified from meatpacking into fashion, energy, wood pulp and banking over the past five years. J&F lawyers said Joesley Batista  did not lie or omit information  in his plea deals. A lawyer for Batista did not take calls seeking comment. JBS SA (JBSS3.SA), the world s largest meatpacker and the crown jewel of the Batistas  empire, also signed terms last week to participate in the J&F leniency agreement. On Monday, JBS agreed to sell its British poultry unit Moy Park to U.S. subsidiary Pilgrim s Pride Corp (PPC.O) for $1 billion. Civil aspects of the J&F s leniency agreement, which was signed in June and ratified by Judge Oliveira on Friday, remain in effect, according to a statement late on Monday from federal prosecutors. J&F reached a deal with prosecutors earlier this year agreeing to pay a record fine of 10.3 billion reais for its role in a corruption scandal involving the bribery of hundreds of politicians. That settlement was based on a plea bargain signed by Joesley Batista and collaborators in May to deliver evidence including a recording of his conversation with President Michel Temer, which led to a corruption charge against the leader. But additional evidence later handed to prosecutors included another tape that appeared to show that Batista had been helped by federal prosecutor Marcelo Miller in crafting the plea deal and concealing certain crimes, according to prosecutors. Police also raided Miller s Rio de Janeiro home on Monday. His lawyers said he cooperated with the search and with investigators. The scandal was the latest shock to Brazil s business and political establishment after three years of investigation into widespread political bribery and kickbacks on contracts with state-run companies. The recording of President Temer provided to prosecutors by Batista allegedly revealed him endorsing hush payments to a possible witness in the graft probe. Temer has repeatedly denied the accusations and the lower house of Congress voted against him standing trial at the Supreme Court.  ($1 = 3.10 reais) ",worldnews,"September 11, 2017 ",1
Venezuela Supreme Court has staged effective coup: jurists' group,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Venezuela s Supreme Court has progressively dismantled the rule of law, becoming an instrument of President Nicolas Maduro s government in what amounts to a coup against the constitutional order, an international human rights group said on Tuesday. The collapse of the judiciary has left victims of torture, killings and disappearances and their families without recourse to justice after months of violent street protests, the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) said. It called on the U.N. Human Rights Council to take action.  We have seen a judiciary that has essentially lost its independence and become a tool of a very authoritarian executive branch,  Sam Zarifi, ICJ Secretary-General, told a news briefing.  This breakdown of the rule of law has also severely obstructed accountability (and) essentially made it impossible to bring to justice those responsible for gross violations of human rights,  he said. The Venezuelan government did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Foreign minister Jorge Arreaza on Monday rejected as  baseless  a U.N. report that found excessive use of force by its security forces and other violations. Four months of demonstrations in which at least 125 people were killed have all but stopped due to fatigue among protesters and disillusionment at seeing the ruling Socialist Party cement vast powers despite the concerted opposition push. The ICJ said the top court had undermined human rights and infringed the Constitution through a series of rulings since December 2015. In two rulings in March 2017, the Supreme Court of Justice  effectively claimed legislative powers for itself, depriving the National Assembly of its Constitutional powers and granting sweeping arbitrary powers to the executive,  it said.  These decisions amount to a coup d tat against the Constitutional order and have ushered in a new reign of arbitrary rule,  Zarifi said. Judges on the Supreme Court are mainly from the Socialist Party or former officials of the government of Maduro or both, the Geneva-based jurists  group said.  Judges who have demonstrated independence and ruled against the executive branch have faced retaliation and punishment,  Zarifi said. Maduro denies accusations of a power grab, saying his actions, which include the creation of an alternative Constituent Assembly that has granted itself law-making powers, aim to restore peace after months of protests and violence. The new Constituent Assembly  at this point acts as a body outside of the rule of law. It is able to legislate and create law and new regulations in the country without accountability,  Zarifi said. The ICJ report,  The Supreme Court of Justice: an instrument of executive power , was issued on the sidelines of the U.N. Human Rights Council. U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra ad al-Hussein said on Monday that Venezuelan security forces may have committed crimes against humanity against protesters and called for an international investigation.  The evidence that s there, of course it is not adjudicated, but certainly suggests room for investigating crimes against humanity,  Zarifi said. Such crimes are defined as grave and systematic violations including torture, enforced disappearances, and extrajudicial killings that are part of a state s policy, he said, adding:  Those indicators are all there in Venezuela.  Carlos Ayala, a Venezuelan lawyer and ICJ commissioner based in Caracas, told the briefing:  The situation is worsening on a daily basis because of hyper-inflation (and) the lack of access for the majority of the population to medicines and health care.  More than 600 civilian students are currently being tried before military courts in Venezuela, more than 1,000 young persons, students, are in jail because of the demonstrations.

North Korean threat highlights NATO missile shield 'weak link',"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - NATO has joined world powers  diplomatic efforts to stop North Korea s missile program but it cannot yet rely on its U.S.-built shield to defend Europe, experts and diplomats said. The United States says the shield, more than a decade in the planning, is needed to protect against so-called rogue states, a term U.S. officials have used to refer to North Korea and Iran.  But with Berlin, Paris and London potentially within striking distance of North Korea s missiles from next year, officials say the U.S.-led alliance s system needs more radars and special interceptors to destroy a rocket from Pyongyang.  The NATO shield in its current state lacks the reach and early warning radars to shoot down North Korean rockets. It s a weak link,  said Michael Elleman, a missile defense analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS).  Early tracking is also difficult because North Korean missiles would be flying over Russia, where NATO obviously cannot put radars,  he added. The sort of interceptor needed to shoot down North Korean ballistic missiles could breach a Soviet-era arms control agreement between the United States and Russia because of its greater range, arms experts say. Moscow has long objected to U.S. missile shield plans, saying their real aim is to neutralize Russia s own nuclear arsenal, rather than meet the perceived threat from  rogue states . Russia s strategic concerns would, therefore, make it hard to renegotiate the 1987 Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty, something arms experts say would be required if a North Korean missile shield were to be fully effective.  Alliance planning to confront any threat from Pyongyang is in its infancy. Following North Korea s country s sixth and most powerful nuclear test on Sept. 3, two senior NATO diplomats told Reuters that protection against the North Korean threat was only beginning to be considered at NATO headquarters in Brussels. That was despite a more forceful diplomatic tone on the crisis and warnings on the scale and immediacy of the threat from U.S. President Donald Trump s new ambassador to NATO, France s defense minister and the alliance s deputy head. While analysts do not expect North Korea to have a reliable intercontinental ballistic missile until next year at the earliest, NATO s European allies could become a target as a way of threatening their closest partner, the United States, a third NATO diplomat said, stressing that was only speculation. The United States switched on its $800 million European missile defense umbrella in May last year at a site in Romania to protect against Iranian rockets.  The system, controlled from a NATO base in Germany, includes radars and interceptors stretching from eastern Europe to the Mediterranean.  A final site in Poland should be ready by late 2018, extending the European umbrella from Greenland and the Azores.    To shoot down a ballistic missile from North Korea would require a new generation of interceptor, the Block II, which is still in development. It is capable of downing ballistic rockets earlier and at a much higher altitude. However, Elleman said that U.S. missile sites in Alaska and California, as well as in Japan and South Korea, were likely to be given priority before Europe, when they are ready in 2018.  There will be a lot of competition for the assets,  he said. ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1
Brexit law passes hurdle in reprieve for British PM May,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain s parliament backed a second reading of legislation to sever ties with the European Union early on Tuesday, a reprieve for Prime Minister Theresa May who now faces demands by lawmakers for concessions before it becomes law. After more than 13 hours of speeches for and against the legislation, which May says is essential for Brexit but critics describe as a Conservative government power grab, lawmakers voted 326 to 290 in favor of moving the EU withdrawal bill, or repeal bill, to the next stage of a lengthy lawmaking process. Many fell in step with the government which said a vote against the legislation would force Britain into a chaotic exit from the EU, rather than a smooth departure, as the country would lack laws and a regulatory framework to steer the process. May, weakened by the loss of her majority in a June election, now faces a battle against politicians who want to force amendments to the bill, first in the lower house of parliament and then in Britain s unelected upper chamber.  Earlier this morning parliament took a historic decision to back the will of the British people and vote for a bill which gives certainty and clarity ahead of our withdrawal from the European Union,  May said in a statement.  Although there is more to do, this decision means we can move on with negotiations with solid foundations and we continue to encourage MPs (lawmakers) from all parts of the UK to work together in support of this vital piece of legislation.  Her justice minister urged lawmakers to back the bill and signaled that the government would listen to the concerns of lawmakers despite describing some of their criticism as being  exaggerated up to and beyond the point of hyperbole .  The bill seeks largely to  copy and paste  EU law into British legislation to ensure Britain has functioning laws and the same regulatory framework as the bloc at the moment of Brexit, to offer some reassurance for companies. But the often impassioned debate in the 650-seat parliament underlined the rifts exposed by last year s EU referendum, not only in Britain s main parties, but also in the country. The opposition Labour Party had called on its lawmakers to vote against the bill if the government failed to make concessions. But seven rebelled, with some saying they had to respect the demands of their pro-Brexit voters.  This is a deeply disappointing result,  said Labour s Brexit spokesman, Keir Starmer.  This bill is an affront to parliamentary democracy and a naked power grab by government ministers ... It will make the Brexit process more uncertain, and lead to division and chaos when we need unity and clarity.  The government has defended the bill by saying it will allow Britain to become  masters of our own laws , but it also gives ministers wide-ranging powers to amend laws to make them work domestically, often by interchanging the word  EU  for Britain. But lawmakers, both in Labour and May s governing Conservative Party, expressed fears the government would make substantial changes to legislation without consulting parliament - a charge the government has denied. Despite the victory for a government now dependent on the support of Northern Ireland s Democratic Unionist Party to secure a working majority, ministers will face attempts by both Conservative and Labour lawmakers to change the bill. Some want assurances that the government will not misuse its power, others want to make sure the protections of certain workers rights are also written into the bill before allowing it to move to the unelected upper house of parliament. The process is expected to take months to complete and both houses should agree the final wording before it can be passed.  Labour will seek to amend and remove the worst aspects from the bill as it passes through parliament,  Starmer said.  But the flaws are so fundamental it s hard to see how this bill could ever be made fit for purpose.  ",worldnews,"September 10, 2017 ",1
"Battered by cyclone, Philippines suffers flooding, landslides","MANILA (Reuters) - A cyclone dumped heavy rains in the Philippine capital, Manila, and nearby provinces on Tuesday, causing widespread flooding and landslides in some areas that killed at least two people, the national disaster agency said. Financial markets, government offices and schools were closed and port operations in some provinces were suspended, it said. Several flights were canceled. The weather bureau said cyclone Maring, which was packing winds of up to 60 kilometers per hour (37 mph), made landfall in the morning over Mauban municipality in the eastern province of Quezon. Romina Marasigan, a spokeswoman for the national disaster agency, said two teenaged brothers died from a landslide in Taytay, Rizal, 20 kilometers (12.43 miles) from Manila.  Some residents unfortunately did not heed the advice of local officials to evacuate to safer grounds,  she said in a media briefing. Marasigan warned of more flashfloods and landslides as rains were expected to continue later in the day, before the cyclone moves back over the sea early on Wednesday. Twenty-two passengers were rescued from a bus stuck in floodwaters in Pitogo town in Quezon, she said. Local officials ordered the evacuation of residents in some towns under floodwaters in Quezon, Laguna, Rizal and Batangas provinces, she said. The weather bureau said it was also keeping an eye on typhoon Talim which was packing winds of up to 120 kph (75 mph), spotted moving toward the country s northern tip and to Taiwan.

Treasury's Mnuchin: China may face new sanctions on North Korea,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Tuesday that if China doesn t follow the United Nations sanctions approved on North Korea, he will seek new financial sanctions on Beijing to cut off access to the U.S. financial system.  Mnuchin told a conference broadcast on CNBC that China agreed to  historic  sanctions on North Korea on Monday in a UN Security Council vote.  If China doesn t follow these sanctions, we will put additional sanctions on them and prevent them from accessing the U.S. and international dollar system, and that s quite meaningful,  Mnuchin said.

Spanish court blocks second law linked to Catalan referendum,"MADRID (Reuters) - A Spanish court has suspended a Catalan law that outlined a legal framework for an independent state, a court source said on Tuesday, the day after hundreds of thousands rallied in Barcelona to support secession from Madrid. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy s government is increasing the pressure to prevent an independence referendum, scheduled for Oct. 1, from going ahead. It has declared the vote illegal and challenged laws linked to the ballot in the courts. The Constitutional Court, Spain s highest authority on such matters, suspended the law while judges consider whether it is against the country s constitution. It suspended a law approving the Oct. 1 vote last week.  The Catalan parliament approved both laws on Wednesday in a move which brought a long-running tussle between the pro-independence regional government and the Madrid-based central government to a head. Rising tension between Madrid and Barcelona has prompted some investors to ditch Spanish sovereign debt. Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont, who faces criminal charges for his role in organizing the referendum, only has the power to call an election not a referendum, a government spokesman said on Tuesday.  If Puigdemont wants to consult the people, it s very simple, he should call an election,  government spokesman and Minister of Education, Culture and Sport Inigo Mendez de Vigo told Antena 3 television. Polls have shown support for independence waning in recent years with those wanting a separate state in a minority. However, a majority of Catalans want to vote on the issue. Most of Catalonia s 948 mayors have pledged to permit use of public spaces for the vote, but Ada Colau, head of the region s biggest city Barcelona, has asked for assurances that civil servants involved will not risk losing their jobs.  Justice Minister Rafael Catala on Tuesday warned the regional administration against coercing municipal leaders to take part.  I trust they will be left in peace and not be obliged to do what they cannot,  Catala told RTVE television. ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1
Brussels steps up legal case against Poland over courts overhaul,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union s executive gave Poland on Tuesday one month to address concerns over a judiciary overhaul or face a court challenge, stepping up pressure over Warsaw s reforms which critics say undermine the independence of the courts.  The Commission opened legal proceedings against the nationalist government in Warsaw over judicial reforms in July and said on Tuesday that Poland so far failed to address the points that had been raised.  It therefore moved to the second phase of the EU s infringement procedure and said it could escalate the case further if Warsaw does not address the concerns in a month.  If the Polish authorities do not take appropriate measures, the Commission may decide to refer the case to the Court of Justice of the EU,  the Commission said in a statement.

Turkey detains lawyers of hunger-striking teachers ahead of trial,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey issued detention warrants for the lawyers of two hunger-striking teachers on Tuesday, days before they are due to appear in court, lawyers representing the academics said. Nuriye Gulmen, a literature professor, and Semih Ozakca, a primary school teacher, have been on hunger strike for more than six months after they lost their jobs in a crackdown following a failed coup against President Tayyip Erdogan. Doctors say they have been surviving on liquids and supplements, but have described their condition as dangerously weak for several months. Authorities detained them in May saying they had links to the militant leftist DHKP-C group, deemed a terrorist organization by Turkey.  The warrants were issued for 18 lawyers, all members of two law offices defending the teachers.  The detention of our colleagues today is an attempt in vain to leave Gulmen and Ozakca defenseless,  a lawyer representing the pair told Reuters, adding that more than 2,000 lawyers had applied to defend them due to the case s symbolic importance. Police raided lawyers  offices in Istanbul and Ankara and detained 10 lawyers, while the search for eight others continued. On Thursday, Gulmen and Ozakca will appear in court for the first time since their arrest. So far, 150,000 state employees including civil servants, academics and security personnel have been fired since last year s coup attempt, which Erdogan blamed on followers of U.S.-based Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen. Gulen denies any involvement. Critics accuse the government of using the coup as a pretext to purge dissident voices from public institutions. Last month, the European Court of Human Rights rejected a request by the two teachers to order Ankara to release them on health grounds. ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1
Protest greets former Trump adviser Bannon at Hong Kong investor event,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Protesters outside a luxury hotel in Hong Kong shouted anti-racism slogans on Tuesday ahead of a speech by former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon at an investor conference organized by a unit of China s largest brokerage.  The far-right architect of U.S. President Donald Trump s 2016 election victory, Bannon is the latest controversial figure invited to address a forum hosted by CLSA, a subsidiary of state-backed Citic Securities. Bannon, whose views on immigration, climate and trade helped shape Trump s election campaign and his first months in office, was fired by the Republican president last month in a push to end factional fighting within the White House.   No Bannon, no racism,  chanted the group of about 15 demonstrators, who also held up a large black banner carrying the words,  Nazis are not welcome here . One protester wearing a mask of Trump held up a placard depicting the U.S. president in the shape of a chicken, with the words,  Toxic nationalist , on its belly. CLSA initially said Bannon s speech would be open to some print media but reversed its decision a day later, without citing a specific reason, although a CLSA spokeswoman said the event was meant for invited clients only.  We reserve the right to open or close sessions as we see fit,  she wrote in an emailed response to Reuters.   The CLSA Investors  Forum provides an agnostic platform for diverse views and opinions from people who influence policy, economies and markets. Mr Bannon is one of these, hence our decision to invite him.  Past speakers at the forum have ranged from actors George Clooney and Arnold Schwarzenegger to boxer Mike Tyson, who was convicted of rape, former Alaska governor Sarah Palin, and former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, who revealed secret details of U.S. surveillance programs. In a recent interview with the CBS program  60 Minutes,  Bannon predicted Republicans could lose control in the House of Representatives next year because of a looming battle over what to do about immigrants brought illegally to the United States as children.

Exclusive: Zimbabwe's Grace Mugabe says model attacked her with knife,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Zimbabwe s First Lady, Grace Mugabe, has denied assaulting South African model Gabriella Engels with an electric cable in a Johannesburg hotel suite last month, saying an  intoxicated and unhinged  Engels attacked her with a knife. In a previously unreported Aug. 17 deposition seen exclusively by Reuters, Mugabe countered 20-year-old Engels  version, portraying herself as the victim after intervening on behalf of her adult sons Chatunga and Robert Junior who were  in trouble with a drunken young woman . The statement said Grace Mugabe, 52 and a contender to replace her 93-year-old husband as Zimbabwe s president, was thinking about filing attempted murder charges. A group representing Engels dismissed the allegations as lies. According to the model, an irate Mugabe burst into the room where she was waiting with two friends to meet Chatunga on Aug. 13 and started laying into her with an electric cable. Photographs taken by Engels  mother soon after the incident showed gashes to the model s head. She also had bruising on her thighs. In her deposition, Mugabe dismissed Engels  version as  malicious allegations  and said she had been attacked after going to help her sons.  She was worried about them and went to see them at their hotel suite,  the statement said.  Upon her arrival, Ms Engels, who was intoxicated and unhinged, attacked Dr. Grace Mugabe with a knife after she was asked to leave the hotel.   Security was left with no other option but to remove Ms Engels from the hotel suite,  it continued. The statement also alleged that Engels had been in a fight with other women at Johannesburg s Taboo nightclub the previous evening and suggested that may have been the cause of her injuries. Afriforum, an Afrikaans civil society group acting on behalf of Engels, denied both accusations.  Gabriella never attacked Grace Mugabe in any way and she did not participate in the fight at Taboo,  Afriforum said.  It is clear that Grace Mugabe is desperately trying to escape responsibility for her own violent behavior by using lies to falsely portray the victim in this case as the perpetrator.  South Africa granted Grace Mugabe diplomatic immunity, allowing her to evade immediate prosecution for assault, although Engels and Afriforum have challenged that decision, saying Mugabe was not in South Africa on official business. They also argued that assault was a  grave crime  that was not covered by diplomatic immunity laws. The decision to let Grace Mugabe return home caused a row in South Africa, with the opposition Democratic Alliance also going to court to overturn the immunity.  According to Zimbabwean intelligence files seen by Reuters, Robert Mugabe lobbied his South African counterpart, Jacob Zuma, to have the issue  solved amicably  and out of court but was stymied by Engels  refusal to accept a settlement.  He is trying to avoid the embarrassment of his wife appearing before the court,  one file, dated Aug. 30, reads.  The problem he is facing is that the woman who was assaulted is refusing to accept any money and she just wants justice to be delivered upon Grace.  Afriforum lawyer Gerrie Nel - best known for prosecuting  South African track star Oscar Pistorius over the shooting of his girlfriend - said last month Engels had been approached with a cash offer but had turned it down. The intelligence report is a part of a series of hundreds of files dating back to 2009 that have come from within Zimbabwe s Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO). Reuters has not been able to establish their original author or final audience. The Aug. 30 report said Mugabe was  changing his attitude  to the case and was now backing Grace while accusing Engels of impropriety.  Mugabe wants people to stop castigating his wife and calling her all sorts of names,  it said.  Mugabe is saying that his wife acted in an angry mood like all other women who find their children being involved with sleeping with whores.  Afriforum chief executive Kallie Kriel said this allegation was an  absolute lie  and part of a deliberate attempt by Harare to undermine Engels  credibility as a witness. A spokesman for Zimbabwe s presidency, which has direct oversight of the CIO, was not immediately available for comment. Zimbabwe s ambassador to South Africa did not respond to a request for comment. Zuma has denied any hand in the affair, telling parliament on Aug. 31:  I am not a lawyer. I don t know the point of law and I was not involved in this process. How it was done, I would be lying if I speculate.  His spokesman declined to elaborate. ",worldnews,"September 11, 2017 ",1
Squeaky-clean Zurich's trash department probed for dirty dealings,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Investigators in Zurich, ranked among the world s cleanest cities, are probing alleged grubby dealings within the municipal garbage and recycling department. While trash services in the United States and Italy have  sometimes been linked with illicit dealings, the Swiss financial center appears an unlikely source of muck. Rubbish bins are ubiquitous, and a fleet of motorized street sweepers keeps boulevards nearly spotless. But so far Zurich has unearthed irregular accounting surrounding some $15 million in cost overruns on one of its marquee projects, possible nepotism and an alleged off-the-books slush fund, according to a series of reports released last week.  The garbage and recycling department in Zurich developed into a state within a state,  Filippo Leutenegger, a city council member who has overseen the Sanitation and Recycling office since 2014, told state broadcaster SRF.  We cannot allow that to happen,  he added, rejecting criticism he failed to act quickly enough to halt the problems. The department s chief, Urs Pauli, was fired in June after revelations he was driving a taxpayer-funded BMW sedan worth more than $100,000 and after a so-called  secret stash  of 215,000 Swiss francs ($226,500) was uncovered in his offices.  The city prosecutor s office seized the cash, which Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger has reported resulted from selling used department vehicles and was used to reward employees for good performance.  SWEEPING COVER-UP  According to the city s reports, the garbage department hid 15 million Swiss francs in cost overruns on a logistics center, including by booking them to unrelated accounts in a  sweeping cover-up.  A whistleblower alerted authorities in 2015, accusing Pauli s department of neglecting proper documentation as well as irregularities on no-bid construction contracts involving firms with close ties to trash department officials.   Awarding contracts without seeking bids or ensuring transparency can prompt questions about compliance when the same contractors are always chosen,  according to the city reports.  It creates fertile ground for accusations of favoritism.  Earlier this year, Leutenegger filed a criminal complaint with city prosecutors, alleging Pauli, who had led the department since 2008, had broken the law by bypassing formal approval for his BMW.  Zurich prosecutors did not immediately respond to questions on Tuesday about their investigation s status. Nobody has been charged. Pauli, who has denied wrongdoing, declined to comment this week through his attorney.  ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1
Hundreds of Afghans demonstrate against 'offensive' U.S. leaflets,"QARA BAGH, Afghanistan (Reuters) - Hundreds of demonstrators rallied near the Afghan capital on Tuesday to denounce a propaganda leaflet drop by U.S. forces last week that caused widespread offense and forced American commanders to issue an apology. The leaflet drop near Bagram Air Field, one of the biggest U.S. bases in Afghanistan, was intended to encourage people to report insurgents to the authorities and depicted a lion chasing a dog, symbolizing the Taliban. However it prompted widespread outrage as the picture of the dog, considered an unclean animal in Islam, incorporated a profession of faith from the Quran that forms part of the Taliban flag.  The Americans have insulted Muslims through this action and their beliefs and we will not sit quietly by,  said Mir Rahman, a protester at the rally in Qarabagh district near Bagram.  If the Americans and NATO continue to insult Islam, they will face the same fate that the Russians faced in Afghanistan.  U.S. commanders apologized for the leaflet and promised to hold those responsible to account but the affair has caused severe embarrassment at a time of heightened sensitivity over the separate issue of civilian casualties caused by air strikes. While the NATO-led Resolute Support coalition has generally taken pains to avoid cultural insensitivities, there have been several other examples where international forces, most of which come from non-Muslim cultures, have caused offense. In a previous incident in 2012, when copies of the Quran were mistakenly burned, a number of people died in the following protests. So far, demonstrations have been on a much smaller scale but some protesters said they might continue.     Apologies on their own will never cure any wound,  said Mehrabuddin, another protester, who like many Afghans, goes by one name.  If the Americans repeat such an insult in future we will keep up our demonstrations and, if needed, attack Bagram base,  he said. Last week, the Taliban, seeking to establish Islamic law after their 2001 ouster, claimed a suicide attack near the entrance to Bagram which it said had been launched in retaliation against the leaflets.

German court stops trial of paramedic who worked at Auschwitz,"BERLIN (Reuters) - A 96-year-old former paramedic at the Auschwitz Nazi death camp is no longer fit to stand trial due to his dementia, a spokesman for the court said on Tuesday, bringing to an end one of Germany s last prosecutions linked to the Holocaust. Hubert Zafke worked as a paramedic in Auschwitz for one month starting on Aug. 15, 1944. He stood accused of being an accessory to the murder of at least 3,681 people at the concentration and extermination camp in Nazi-occupied Poland. During his time at Auschwitz, at least 14 deportation trains arrived there from places as far away as Lyon, Vienna and Westerbork in the Netherlands.     Although Zafke was not accused of having been directly involved in any killings, the prosecution s office said he was aware of the camp s function as a facility for mass murder. The trial against Zafke began in the northeastern town of Neubrandenburg in 2016 but was repeatedly delayed due to his ill health. Germany had faced criticism for not prosecuting those who were small cogs in the Nazi machine and did not actively take part in the killing of 6 million Jews during the Holocaust. That criticism has abated thanks to many recent trials and convictions, such as the 2011 conviction of Sobibor extermination camp guard John Demjanjuk, which gave prosecutors new legal means to investigate suspects under accessory to murder charges. Former Auschwitz guard Reinhold Hanning and Oskar Groening, known as the  bookkeeper of Auschwitz , have also been convicted of complicity in mass murder in recent years. Another case against a woman who worked as a radio operator at Auschwitz was dropped last year after a court in Kiel ruled she was unfit to stand trial. ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1

Indian priest kidnapped in Yemen has been freed: Oman,"DUBAI (Reuters) - An Indian priest kidnapped by gunmen in Yemen last year has been freed, Oman s state news agency ONA said on Tuesday, posting a picture of him appearing in good health after being transferred to the Omani capital Muscat. Father Tom Uzhunnalil was abducted in March 2016 when four unidentified gunmen attacked a care home in Yemen s southern port city of Aden, killing four Indian nuns, two Yemeni female staff members, eight elderly residents and a guard. ONA said Omani authorities had coordinated with  Yemeni parties  to locate Uzhunnalil and transfer him to the sultanate. He will return home to India, it said, without mentioning which group had been holding him in Yemen.  I am happy to inform that Father Tom Uzhunnalil has been rescued,  Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj wrote on Twitter. Oman has frequently helped facilitate the release of foreign nationals detained in Yemen. The ONS picture showed the white-bearded Catholic priest standing in a palatial room in front of a portrait of Oman s ruler. Uzhunnalil was last seen appealing for help in a video recording carried by a Yemeni news website in May, saying his health was deteriorating and he needed hospitalization.

"Hiscox sees higher U.S. property insurance rates after Harvey, Irma","(Reuters) - Lloyd s of London underwriter Hiscox Ltd said the price of insuring property in the United States would rise after the states of Texas and Florida suffered billions of dollars of losses from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.    This will definitely have the impact of eliminating price reductions. I think that loss-affected areas will see price rises.

Austrian president to insist on pro-EU government after election,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen will insist that the coalition government formed after next month s parliamentary election should be pro-European, he said on Tuesday, but he stopped short of saying that ruled out the far-right. Van der Bellen, a former Greens leader, ran on a pro-European Union platform and beat an opponent from the far-right Freedom Party (FPO) in last year s presidential election. As head of state, he is mainly a figurehead but he does have the power to appoint and dismiss governments. The eurosceptic FPO initially cheered Britain s vote last year to leave the European Union but has since watered down its criticism of the bloc as polls have shown that a clear majority of Austrians want their country to remain a member.   I will ensure after the election that the new government, whatever its composition, does not lose sight of one thing: Austria should also in the future be a country at the heart of Europe, at the heart of the European Union,  Van der Bellen said in a speech to the nation ahead of the Oct. 15 vote. Van der Bellen has said he would aim to prevent FPO leader Heinz-Christian Strache from becoming chancellor if the anti-immigration party won the election. That outcome appears increasingly unlikely as polls show the conservative People s Party (OVP) led by Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz has a significant lead, with Chancellor Christian Kern s Social Democrats (SPO) or the FPO in second place. The SPO and OVP have dominated post-war politics and are in coalition together, but tensions between them have grown, making it more likely the election winner will turn to the FPO to obtain a parliamentary majority and form a government. In his address, Van der Bellen called on Austrians to inform themselves on political parties and their policies and to shun short-term thinking. He also said parties should avoid clashing so fiercely that they could not hold talks after the election. When asked after his speech if he would prevent the FPO from entering government, he did not give a direct answer.  I have always said clearly, and I stand by it and I think I have also made clear today, that I place the greatest importance on Austria having a pro-European government,  he said.

Russian Islamic State fighter sentenced to hang in Iraq,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - A Russian Islamic State fighter was sentenced to death by hanging in Iraq on Tuesday, authorities said, a rare conviction of a foreign militant on terrorism charges. The unnamed man was captured after running out of ammunition in western Mosul, a spokesman for Iraq s Supreme Judicial Council said in a statement.  The Russian was a member of Daesh operating in Mosul since 2015,  he added, using an Arabic acronym for the Sunni Muslim militant group.  Thousands of foreigners have been fighting for Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.   Security and aid officials told Reuters over the weekend that Iraqi authorities were holding 1,400 foreign wives and children of suspected militants - most from Turkey, others from former Soviet states including Tajikistan, Azerbaijan and Russia. Iraqi forces, backed by U.S.-led coalition allies and Kurds, retook Mosul in July following the group s occupation of the country s second largest city in 2014. The Sunni militant group still controls territory in Iraq and is expected to revert to more conventional insurgent tactics such as bombings as its self-proclaimed caliphate falls apart.

"North Korea warns U.S. of 'greatest pain', rejects sanctions","GENEVA (Reuters) - North Korea on Tuesday rejected a U.N. Security Council resolution imposing tougher sanctions and said the United States would soon face the  greatest pain  it had ever experienced. The Security Council unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea on Monday over the country s sixth and most powerful nuclear test, imposing a ban on its textile exports and capping imports of crude oil.  My delegation condemns in the strongest terms and categorically rejects the latest illegal and unlawful U.N. Security Council resolution,  Pyongyang s ambassador, Han Tae Song, told the U.N.-sponsored Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. Han accused the U.S. administration of being  fired up for political, economic, and military confrontation,  and of being   obsessed with the wild game of reversing the DPRK s development of nuclear force which has already reached the completion phase . North Korea was condemned globally for its latest nuclear test on Sept. 3, which it said was of an advanced hydrogen bomb. The Democratic People s Republic of Korea (DPRK) is  ready to use a form of ultimate means , Han said without elaborating.  The forthcoming measures by DPRK will make the U.S. suffer the greatest pain it ever experienced in its history,  he said. U.S. disarmament ambassador Robert Wood took the floor to say that the Security Council resolution  frankly sent a very clear and unambiguous message to the regime that the international community is tired, is no longer willing to put up provocative behavior from this regime .  My hope is the regime will hear the message loud and clear and it will choose a different path,  Wood said.  We call on all countries to vigorously implement these new sanctions and all other existing sanctions,  he added. ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1
Romania names new minister to modernize military,"BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Romania s leftist government named a new defense minister in a mini-reshuffle on Tuesday, to handle a multi-billion-dollar plan to modernize its military to NATO standards. The staunch Washington ally has promised to spend 2 percent of its gross domestic product on defense every year for the next nine years, and boost U.S.-backed defenses that have riled Russia. The ruling Social Democrats (PSD) said Economy Minister Mihai Fifor, 47, will replace Adrian Tutuianu who quit last week after his office said it could not pay defense staff wages in full, only to be contradicted hours later by the finance ministry.  This is a key position. Fifor is a responsible person, he has the advantage of being an economy minister and closely working with the defense ministry on military industry,  PSD leader Liviu Dragnea told reporters. Dragnea said the economy portfolio would go to PSD lawmaker Gheorghe Simon.  NATO member Romania hosts a U.S. ballistic missile defense station and has sent thousands of troops to operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Among the first steps in its military expansion is the purchase of $1.25 billion of mobile artillery rocket systems, with Lockheed Martin as prime contractor, a plan endorsed by the U.S. State Department last month. Russia has said it sees the U.S.-backed missile defense system in Romania and other European countries as a threat and a ploy to neutralize its nuclear arsenal. ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1
Japan's Abe to launch $17-billion Indian bullet train project as ties deepen,"NEW DELHI/TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will lay the foundation stone for India s first bullet train in Prime Minister Narendra Modi s home state this week, in a tightening of ties just days after New Delhi ended a dangerous military confrontation with China. The move by Abe, who starts a two-day visit to India on Wednesday, highlights an early lead for Japan in a sector where the Chinese have also been trying to secure a foothold, but without much success. Modi has made the 500-km- (311-mile-) long high-speed rail link between the financial hub of Mumbai and the industrial city of Ahmedabad in western Gujarat a centerpiece of his efforts to showcase India s ability to build cutting-edge infrastructure. The leaders will launch the start of work on the line on Thursday, India s railways ministry said in a statement.  This technology will revolutionize and transform the transport sector,  said Railways Minister Piyush Goyal, welcoming the prospects for growth brought by Japan s high-speed  shinkansen  technology. In Tokyo, a Japanese foreign ministry official told reporters,  We would like to support  Make in India  as much as possible,  referring to Modi s signature policy to lure investors in manufacturing.  And for that, we want to do what s beyond the Mumbai-Ahmedabad line and achieve economies of scale.   India would make  all-out efforts  to complete the line by August 2022, more than a year earlier than planned, the government said this week. Japan is providing 81 percent of the funding for the 1.08-trillion-rupee ($16.9-billion) project, through a 50-year loan at 0.1 percent annual interest.  Ties between India and Japan have blossomed as Modi and Abe increasingly see eye-to-eye in countering growing Chinese assertiveness across Asia. Japanese investment into India has surged in areas ranging from automotives to infrastructure in the remote northeast, making Tokyo its third-largest foreign direct investor.   India and Japan are also trying to move forward on a plan for New Delhi to buy Japanese amphibious aircraft - ShinMaywa Industries  US-2 - in what would be one of Tokyo s first arms transfers since ending a self-imposed embargo.  Tokyo hopes that by gaining a head start on rival exporters of rail technology such as China and Germany, its companies will be able to dominate business in one of the most promising markets for high-speed rail equipment. In 2015, China won a contract to assess the feasibility of a high-speed link between Delhi and Mumbai, part of a network of more than 10,000 km (6,214 miles) of track India wants to set up, but little progress has been made. Bullet train critics say the funds would be far better spent to modernize India s slow and rickety state-controlled rail system, the world s fourth largest.  But a $15-billion safety overhaul has hit delays as a state steel firm proved unable to fill demand for new rail. ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1
"Factbox: Humanitarian crisis in Bangladesh as 370,000 Rohingya flee Myanmar","(Reuters) - An estimated 370,000 Rohingya Muslim refugees have fled to Bangladesh to escape violence in neighboring Myanmar since late August, a spokeswoman for the U.N. refugee agency, Vivian Tan, said on Tuesday. At least 457,000 hungry and traumatized refugees have sought refuge in Bangladesh since October 2016. They have joined many thousands of refugees from previous violent episodes in Myanmar. Here are details gathered from U.N. sources working in the Cox s Bazar district of Bangladesh, on the Myanmar border, where many of the refugees end up. - The jump in the number of arrivals from Sunday to Monday was fueled by the movement of many refugees from so-called transit sites into new settlement areas, where they are counted. - Authorities have been broadcasting messages along crowded roads telling people to move to a proposed camp at a settlement called Kutupalong. - An area of about 1,500 acres (607 hectares) to 2,000 acres (809 hectares), north of Kutupalong, has been set aside for new arrivals.  - A survey to identify children aged 4 to 14 has been started, so as to enroll them in learning centers. - People, in particular, children, are becoming susceptible to waterborne diseases due to an acute shortage of clean water and sanitation facilities, as well as the common cold and fever. - Facilities are improving gradually, for example, two 5,000-litre (1,100-gallon) water tanks have been installed at a settlement called Unchiprang. - Some rice is now being distributed, in addition to high-energy biscuits. - The World Food Programme (WFP) has provided more than 68,800 people with high-energy biscuits since Aug. 27 as they arrive seeking shelter in Cox s Bazar.  - About 77,600 people have received warm meals through community kitchens run by aid agency Action Contre la Faim. These kitchens provide meals for about 5,300 people a day. - The WFP is especially concerned about women and children arriving hungry and malnourished. Nearly 3,000 pregnant women, new mothers and children under five have received a special, high-nutrient porridge made of wheat and soya flour. - Some families have taken children out of school, fearing they will get lost in the throng of people, but teachers are trying to reassure them.

Australia kicks off weeks-long same-sex marriage ballot,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia on Tuesday launched a postal vote on whether to legalize same-sex marriage as a widely watched poll indicated the country would be overwhelmingly in support. The non-compulsory ballot, which runs until the end of October, will determine whether Australia becomes the 25th country to legalize same-sex marriage, while also healing a rift in the government. Despite securing 70 percent public support in an Ipsos/Fairfax poll on Tuesday, the issue of same-sex marriage had faced a political deadlock, only broken last week when the High Court gave the all-clear for the vote. The poll illustrates why parliament should simply vote to approve same-sex marriage without holding the national ballot, opposition Labor leader Bill Shorten said.     Change in this country only ever happens when people participate in the change,  Shorten told reporters in Canberra.  Please don t leave this change to other people.   The ballot of nearly 16 million people at a cost A$122 million ($97.86 million) will help Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull unite his Liberal-National coalition, which had been fractured over the issue throughout his two-year tenure. Turnbull had been under pressure to resolve the impasse after two previous efforts to hold a compulsory vote were rejected by the Senate, where the government is in the minority. Frustrated progressive members said they would side with the opposition Labor Party to secure same-sex marriage if the PM could not finally resolve the issue, though some conservative lawmakers threatened to resign if Turnbull did not stick to a public vote, threatening the PM s one-seat majority. The impasse was eventually resolved when the High Court ruled the government could proceed with the non-compulsory vote, without Senate approval.

EU Parliament's Brexit coordinator urges May to address chamber,"STRASBOURG (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May should address the European Parliament when she visits the EU legislature to clarify Britain s plans for its divorce from the European Union, the parliament s Brexit coordinator said on Tuesday.  On Brexit, I m very pleased that Mrs. May has accepted the invitation of the European Parliament to come to the European Parliament,  Guy Verhofstadt told a news conference at the parliament in Strasbourg. May had accepted an invitation from the parliament to speak at a meeting of the heads of party groupings, he said.  But my proposal is that instead of only addressing the conference of presidents, I would encourage her to address the full house,  Verhofstadt said. Verhofstadt said a May address would be very helpful because the parliament had to give its approval to a Brexit agreement between the EU and Britain, notably on the question of citizens  rights, a divorce bill and the future Ireland/Northern Ireland border.  So in the future, all this, I think needs to be debated in an open dialogue between Mrs. May and all members,  Verhofstadt said, adding he did not know when May planned to visit. Verhofstadt pointed out that other leaders had done so in the past. They have included former U.S. President Ronald Reagan, former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as Britain s Queen Elizabeth in 1992 and two popes. The parliament s Brexit coordinator also said that, for the moment, negotiations had not made sufficient progress on the divorce issues to allow talks to move to the issue of future trade relations between Britain and the bloc. He added that the parliament would debate a motion in early October on whether enough progress had been made. ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1
"Norway's right-wing government wins re-election fought on oil, tax","OSLO (Reuters) - Norway s tax-cutting Conservative Prime Minister Erna Solberg declared victory on Tuesday after a parliamentary election, narrowly defeating a Labour-led opposition with her promises of steady management of the oil-dependent economy. The win is historic for Solberg, whose supporters compare her firm management style to that of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, because no Conservative-led government has retained power in an election in Norway since 1985.  It looks like a clear victory,  for the center-right, a beaming Solberg told cheering supporters in Oslo just after midnight (2200 GMT), following Monday s voting.   Our solutions have worked. We have created jobs,  she said, but warned,  We have some challenges ahead. ... Oil revenues are going to be lower. We all must take responsibility.  The ruling minority coalition of her Conservatives and the populist Progress Party, together with two small center-right allies, was set to win a slim majority with 89 seats in the 169-seat parliament, according to an official projection with 95 percent of the votes counted. (Election graphic tmsnrt.rs/2wYkVIO)  It s a big disappointment,  opposition Labour leader Jonas Gahr Stoere said, conceding defeat for his party that has been a dominant force in Norwegian politics for a century. Solberg, 56, plans more tax cuts as a way to stimulate growth for Europe s top oil and gas producer. Stoere had argued for tax increases to improve public services such as education and healthcare for Norway s 5 million citizens. The oil industry could be affected by the vote, because Solberg will need support from two green-minded, center-right allies to ensure a majority to pass legislation in parliament. One of the two parties, the Liberals, wants strict limits on oil and gas exploration in Arctic waters.  Solberg s Conservative Party was set to lose three seats to 45 in parliament, making her more dependent on outsiders  help and perhaps heralding a less stable government. And the head of the other small party, the Christian Democrats, warned Solberg he would not automatically back every government decision.  We will not give a guarantee for the next four years,  party leader Knut Arild Hareide said.   They (The Liberals and the Christian Democrats) will support Solberg as prime minister, but the question is whether they get a firm agreement or if there is cooperation on a case-by-case basis,  said Elisabeth Ivarsflaten, a professor in comparative politics at the University of Bergen.  Then it may be a weaker government,  she told Reuters.  The Norwegian currency, the crown EURNOK=, strengthened slightly following the first projections after falling sharply earlier in the day on weaker-than-expected inflation data. For much of the year, Labour and its allies were favored by pollsters to win a clear victory, but support for the government has risen as the economy gradually recovered from a slump in the price of crude oil, Norway s top export. Unemployment, which a year ago hit a 20-year high of 5  percent, has since declined to 4.3 percent, while consumer confidence is at a 10-year high.  Solberg has won credit for the upturn with a no-nonsense style of management. Norway s economy also has the cushion of a sovereign wealth fund worth almost $1 trillion, the world s biggest, built on income from offshore oil and gas.  Regardless of which government we get, the challenge will be to use less oil money,  said Erik Bruce, chief analyst at Nordea Markets.  There is broad consensus about the outlook for the sovereign wealth fund and the Norwegian economy, which means a tighter fiscal policy.  The sovereign wealth fund has wanted to invest in unlisted infrastructure to boost its return on investment. Finance Minister Siv Jensen has twice said no to the request over the past two years, citing political risk.  That stance is unlikely to change now that the government has been re-elected. Labour was set to remain the biggest party in Norway, with 49 seats, just ahead of the Conservatives. Stoere, who sometimes compares himself with French President Emmanuel Macron, took over the leadership of the Labour Party from Jens Stoltenberg, who left Norwegian politics to become NATO s secretary-general. Solberg s coalition partner, the populist Progress Party, has sharply limited immigration to Norway in what Stoere said is a betrayal of Norwegian values.  We have done our share of the job. We have delivered,  Finance Minister Siv Jensen, leader of the Progress Party, told party supporters as they chanted  four more years .  Norway s problems are small by the standards of most nations.  Apart from its sovereign wealth fund, Norway tops U.N. lists of the best country in which to live, based on issues such as per capita gross domestic product, education and life expectancy. It even rose to first, from fourth, in a 2017 survey that ranked nations by happiness. ",worldnews,"September 10, 2017 ",1
"Saudi Arabia says foils Islamic State bomb, foreign spying plots","DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia said on Tuesday it foiled an Islamic State plot to bomb its defense ministry headquarters and also said it had arrested several people suspected of carrying out espionage in the kingdom on behalf of foreign powers. It was not immediately clear whether the two announcements, made separately by a security official to state news agency SPA and a security source speaking to Reuters, were related. The would-be bombers were identified as two Yemeni nationals living under aliases in the kingdom who were detained along with two Saudi citizens also suspected of involvement in the attack planned for the capital Riyadh, the official from the Presidency of State Security added. Saudi Arabia has previously been hit by deadly bombing and shooting attacks by Islamic State militants targeting security forces and Shi ite Muslims. The assailants were training in the use of explosive belts, the security source added, while authorities said they seized grenades and firearms during the operation to foil the attack. Islamic State has for years criticized the leadership of Western-allied Saudi Arabia, the world s top oil exporter, accusing it of deviating from their strict interpretation of Islam and advancing the interests of their U.S. enemies. In a separate news item, SPA quoted a security source saying  authorities uncovered  intelligence activities for the benefit of foreign parties  by a group of people it did not name. A Saudi security source, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter, told Reuters that the suspects were accused of  espionage activities and having contacts with external entities including the Muslim Brotherhood , which Riyadh has classified as a terrorist organization.  The group is also accused of having contacts with and receiving financial and other forms of support from two other countries to harm the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and with the aim of destabilizing the security and national unity in preparation to overthrow the Saudi regime in favor of the Muslim Brotherhood,  the source said. Citing an ongoing investigation, the source declined to name the countries or the members of the group. The source said one of the detainees is a member of the armed Houthi movement, which is locked in 2 1/2 years of war with a Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, and is in direct contact with the group. The suspects are in custody and will be granted legal rights and due process, the source added. ",worldnews,"September 11, 2017 ",1
German prosecutor demands life for neo-Nazi suspect Zschaepe,"MUNICH, Germany (Reuters) - A German prosecutor urged judges on Tuesday to give a sentence of life imprisonment to Beate Zschaepe, the main surviving member of a neo-Nazi gang accused of murdering 10 people, most of them immigrants, over seven years from the year 2000. Prosecutors say Zschaepe was part of the National Socialist Underground (NSU) group which killed eight Turks, a Greek and a German policewoman. Zschaepe, 42, has denied taking part in the murders with two friends who killed themselves in 2011 when police discovered the gang by chance. But she has, through her lawyer, said she felt morally guilty for not stopping them. Judges have yet to give a verdict.   The accused is criminally fully responsible for her behavior,  said federal prosecutor Herbert Diemer, calling for Zschaepe to be given a life sentence for 10 murders. He described Zschaepe as an  ice-cold, calculating person , adding that there were no mitigating circumstances. Zschaepe, 42, listened impassively, resting her chin on her hands. Prosecutors said in July that four years of hearing evidence had shown that Zschaepe was a  co-founder, member and accomplice  of a terrorist organization. The group had carried out  the most violent and infamous terror attacks    including two bombings and 15 bank robberies   since the end of the Red Army Faction s two-decade spree in 1991, in which 34 people are estimated to have been killed. Although the NSU murders were carried out by Zschaepe s two friends, Uwe Mundlos and Uwe Boehnhardt, both now dead in what is believed to have been a murder-suicide, she played a major role behind the scenes, according to prosecutors.

France eyes legalizing assisted reproduction for gay women in 2018,"PARIS (Reuters) - The right of lesbian couples and single women to have access to assisted reproduction was  a matter of social justice  and will likely be legislated next year, a French government minister said on Tuesday. The move would mark a significant extension of gay rights in France, where violent protests preceded the legalization of same-sex marriage and adoption by homosexual couples in 2013.    It was a campaign promise. It will be honored,  Marlene Schiappa, minister for gender equality, told BFM TV. She said a bill would likely pass through parliament in 2018.      Current legislation means that gay women with sufficient funds travel abroad for artificial insemination while other women without the financial means cannot. Schiappa said that was unjust. French law still restricts techniques such as artificial insemination using donated sperm to heterosexual couples. A national ethics committee said last June that it backed the idea of medically assisted procreation for female couples and single women. Macron, president since May, had set such a recommendation as a prerequisite to any legislative action.  ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1

"China facing intensified threat of religious infiltration, extremism: official","BEIJING (Reuters) - China is facing heightened threats from foreign infiltration via religion and from the spread of extremism, a top official for religious affairs said on Tuesday, after strict new rules were passed to manage religious practice in the country. President Xi Jinping has emphasized the need to guard against foreign infiltration through religion and to prevent the spread of  extremist  ideology, while also being tolerant of traditional faiths that he sees as a salve to social ills. China s cabinet last week passed updated rules to regulate religion so as to bolster national security, fight extremism and restrict faith practiced outside state approved organizations. The new rules take effect in February. Wang Zuoan, the head of China s religious affairs bureau, said the revision was urgently needed because  the foreign use of religion to infiltrate (China) intensifies by the day and religious extremist thought is spreading in some areas.    Issues with religion on the internet are starting to break out ... and illegal religious gatherings in some places continue despite bans,  he added, writing in the official paper of the ruling Communist Party, the People s Daily. Wang said that freedom of religious faith is protected by the new rules.  At the same time, freedom of religious faith is not equal to religious activities taking place without legal restrictions,  he added. Religion within China needed to be  sinicized , a term officials use to describe the adjusting of religion to fit Chinese culture as interpreted by the Party.  These rules will help maintain the sinicization of religion in our country ... and keep to the correct path of adapting religion to a socialist society,  he said. China s five officially sanctioned religions - Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Catholicism and Christianity - vowed to fight  desinicization  at a forum on the topic held in Beijing last week, according state media. China has seen a revival of religious practice in recent decades after faith was effectively banned during the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s.  Official estimates put the number of believers at around 100 million, but scholars argue that the real number could be many times higher, due to many believers being unregistered with authorities. China requires places of worship to be registered with authorities, but many believers shun official settings in preference for private gatherings often known as  underground  churches. (Story corrects to reflect that rules were passed by China s cabinet, not parliament, in third paragraph.) ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1

Ruling Nationals recover support in jittery New Zealand election campaign,"WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Support for New Zealand s National Party has surged, a poll published on Tuesday suggests, indicating the ruling party will grab enough votes at looming national elections to govern. The Newshub-Reid poll is the latest twist in the rollercoaster ride of New Zealand s electoral campaign, coming just weeks after a separate poll showed support for the opposition Labour Party surging above the Nationals. That had given rise to speculation that Labour would return to power as the lead of a coalition government after almost a decade in opposition. The unusual volatility has been giving investors jitters.. The New Zealand dollar, the 11th most traded currency in the world in 2016, jumped to $0.7265 after the poll was released from $0.7224. The Newshub-Reid poll showed backing for the National Party up 4 points at 47.3 percent and, in a double whammy for Labour, showed the opposition party s support down 1.6 points at 37.8 percent.  It s a huge setback for Labour,  said Bryce Edwards, Wellington-based analyst at Critical Politics.  It really just shows how volatile this election campaign is.  The National Party has vowed to support free trade as global protectionism rises, in particular, by championing the Trans-Pacific Partnership pact, which Labour has said it would renegotiate.  The surprisingly strong result for National suggested it might not need the nationalist New Zealand First Party, long considered the likely kingmaker, to form a government at the Sept. 23 election. Labour changed its leader last month in a bid to jolt life into its struggling campaign, appointing 37-year-old Jacinda Ardern. That last-minute gamble had appeared to be paying off with Labour climbing dramatically in previous polls. An average of previous polls, compiled by Radio New Zealand on Friday, showed Labour s support had surpassing National s. The latest Newshub-Reid poll suggested that the two minor parties traditionally needed to form a coalition government would not have a role to play this time around. New Zealand First, led by populist politician Winston Peters, slipped 0.6 points to 6 percent. The Green Party, which is aligned with Labour for a potential coalition, fell to 4.9 percent, below the 5 percent threshold needed to gain seats in parliament. ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1

Germany's Schaeuble eyes another run as finance minister,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The chances of Wolfgang Schaeuble returning as German finance minister are rising as the Sept. 24 election approaches and politicians from rival parties play down the prospect of unseating the wily veteran. Schaeuble, who turns 75 next week, is the longest serving member of the German parliament. He is the face of German austerity policies that, critics say, deepened the euro zone crisis and hampered its economic recovery. But he has made abundantly clear that he would relish another run as finance minister. Ministry officials have even discussed reserving Schaeuble s wheelchair compatible hotel room in Washington for the 2018 spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank, according to one source. The ministry denies that any formal reservation has been made. The only people who could stand in Schaeuble s way are Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is on track to win a fourth term, and the leaders of the parties she ends up governing with. These include the Social Democrats (SPD), the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the Greens. It is a longstanding tradition that the junior coalition partner gets first choice of a ministry when a new government is formed. That means any one of the three parties could end Schaeuble s run at the finance ministry. But none of them seem intent on doing so if it means relinquishing prime cabinet positions like the foreign ministry, traditionally the most coveted post outside the Chancellery. Top politicians in all three parties, from Martin Schulz and Sigmar Gabriel of the SPD, to Cem Oezdemir of the Greens and Alexander Graf Lambsdorff of the FDP, have set their sights on the foreign ministry, according to senior officials in the parties who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity.  There is an argument for taking the finance ministry, but that would mean relinquishing the most cherished ministry of all,  one leading SPD politician told Reuters.  Both Schulz and Gabriel have their eyes on the foreign ministry.   I don t see anyone kicking out Schaeuble,  said a senior  Greens lawmaker, who conceded that no one in the party could be considered a serious contender for the post.  The finance ministry and the three parties declined to comment. Opinion polls suggest three coalitions might result from the election: a two-way partnership between Merkel s conservative bloc and the FDP, another  grand coalition  with the SPD or an untested three-way alliance between Merkel, the FDP and the Greens. Cabinet posts will be determined at the end of coalition talks that could drag on for months. If there is a party that might be tempted to block Schaeuble it is the FDP, haunted by its decision not to take the finance ministry in Merkel s second term. Instead, the FDP leader at the time, Guido Westerwelle, chose the foreign ministry, a move that backfired for him and his party. From his perch in the finance ministry Schaeuble quashed the FDP s plan for tax cuts, infuriating its pro-business supporters who fled the party, booting it out of parliament in 2013. Should Westerwelle s successor Christian Lindner decide to take the finance ministry for himself, either in a two-way coalition or a partnership that includes the Greens, it would be his for the taking. But Lindner has sent signals that he may prefer to lead the FDP in parliament rather than take a ministerial post under Merkel, according to multiple FDP officials. Much will depend on whether Merkel is prepared to push hard for Schaeuble during the coalition talks. The two have a checkered past and have clashed over Greece and Merkel s handling of the refugee crisis. But Merkel supported Schaeuble when he had serious health problems in 2010, giving him time off to recover when he was ready to resign. And aides to the chancellor say Schaeuble plays a vital role in keeping the conservative wing of the CDU onside.  That will be crucial as she embarks on talks with French President Emmanuel Macron on reform of the single currency bloc. People close to Schaeuble say Macron reminds the aging minister of himself when he was a young, passionate advocate of European integration. Schaeuble, who grew up near the French border, has since traded his idealism for pragmatism. He is skeptical about whether Europe is ready for the big leap forward that Macron has promised. But Merkel may see him as the right person to forge a compromise with Paris. Both she and Macron have voiced support for Schaeuble s idea to turn the euro zone s rescue mechanism, the ESM, into a more powerful European Monetary Fund (EMF). In France, Schaeuble was long seen as an impediment to closer cooperation because of his insistence on fiscal discipline and hardline stance towards southern states like Greece. That too may be changing.  We don t always agree with him, but he is committed to euro zone reform,  said a French official close to Macron.  He is a francophile and he s one of the few people out there who is putting forth ideas and thinking about solutions.  ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1
"China's big banks halt services for North Koreans, tellers say","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China s Big Four state-owned banks have stopped providing financial services to new North Korean clients, according to branch staff, amid U.S. concerns that Beijing has not been tough enough over Pyongyang s repeated nuclear tests. Tensions between the United States and North Korea have ratcheted up after the sixth and most powerful nuclear test conducted by Pyongyang on Sept. 3 prompted the United Nations Security Council to impose further sanctions on Tuesday. Chinese banks have come under scrutiny for their role as a conduit for funds flowing to and from China s increasingly isolated neighbor. China Construction Bank (CCB) (601939.SS) has  completely prohibited business with North Korea , said a bank teller at a branch in the northeastern province of Liaoning. The ban started on Aug. 28, the teller said. Frustrated that China had not done more to rein in North Korea, the Trump administration was mulling new sanctions in July on small Chinese banks and other firms doing business with Pyongyang, two senior U.S. officials told Reuters. A person answering the customer hotline at the world s largest lender, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd (ICBC) (601398.SS), said the bank had stopped opening accounts for North Koreans and Iranians since July 16. The person did not explain why or answer further questions. The measures taken by the largest Chinese banks began as early as the end of last year, when the Dandong city branch of China s most international lender, Bank of China Ltd (BoC) (601988.SS), stopped allowing North Koreans to open individual or business accounts, said a BoC bank teller who declined to be identified. Existing North Korean account holders could not deposit or remove money from their accounts, the BoC bank teller said. At Agricultural Bank of China Ltd (AgBank) (601288.SS), a teller at a branch in Dandong, a northeastern Chinese city that borders North Korea, said North Koreans could not open accounts. The teller did not provide further details. Official representatives for BoC, ICBC, CCB and AgBank could not be reached for comment. Banks in Dandong have been under the microscope as tensions have risen, given their proximity to North Korea. In June, the United States accused the Bank of Dandong, a small lender, of laundering money for Pyongyang. Attempts to slowly choke off the flow of funds to and from North Korea come after the United States sanctioned a Chinese industrial machinery wholesaler that it said was acting on behalf of a Pyongyang bank already sanctioned by the United Nations for supporting the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The Chinese wholesaler was found to be operating through 25 accounts at banks in China. Although measures are in place, some bankers questioned how well the rules would be enforced. Chinese lenders have experienced high-profile failures to police money-laundering in recent years, with some facing allegations that bankers were complicit in the movement of illicit funds.  Asking whether we will be able to enforce the new rules is the same question as asking how tight our know-your-client checks are,  said a senior corporate banker at the Bank of China who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.  There will always be holes,  she said. ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1
Leader of China's $9 billion Ezubao online scam gets life; 26 jailed,"BEIJING (Reuters) - A Beijing court on Tuesday sentenced the architect of the $9 billion Ezubao online financial scam to life imprisonment, and handed down jail time to 26 others, marking the close to one of the biggest Ponzi schemes in modern Chinese history. The ruling comes at a time when the government is stepping up efforts to crack down on risky and illicit behavior in the country s financial sector, including the unruly peer-to-peer industry that continues to attract high volumes. Beijing First Intermediate People s Court sentenced Ding Ning - chairman of Anhui Yucheng Holdings Group that launched Ezubao in 2014 - to life in prison and fined him 100 million yuan ($15.29 million) for crimes including illegal fundraising, illegal gun possession and smuggling precious metals. Ding Dian, the chairman s brother, was also sentenced to life, while Zhang Min, Yucheng s president, and 24 others were sentenced to imprisonment for 3 to 15 years, according to an article on the Beijing Courts social media account. Ezubao, once China s biggest P2P lending platform, folded last year after it turned out to be a Ponzi scheme that collected 59.8 billion yuan ($9.14 billion) from more than 900,000 investors through savvy marketing. By the time police made arrests in early 2016, the company had failed to repay 38 billion yuan. The incident sparked a crackdown on the freewheeling online financial services market and led to new regulations to control China s P2P industry - where monthly volumes are above $50 billion, statistics published by industry portal P2P001 show. Ezubao s excesses also became a cautionary tale following its collapse. Ding collected a monthly salary of 1 million yuan, and admitted on state television to spending an estimated 1.5 billion yuan in Ezubao funds on himself.  We fabricated projects to raise money,  Ding said, according to a Xinhua report published last year, and then used fabricated project companies to re-circulate cash back into accounts linked to his companies. Ding also asked dozens of his secretaries to dress only in Chanel, Gucci and other luxury branded clothing to make the company appear highly successful.  He told Zhang, the group president, to buy up everything from every Louis Vuitton and Herm s store in China.  (reut.rs/2xsfaHH) ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1
"New Zealand Labour still wants TPP part, but only if it can ban foreign home ownership","WELLINGTON (Reuters) - A New Zealand Labour government will still want to be part of the stalled Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal but only if it allows for foreigners to be banned from buying existing homes, opposition leader Jacinda Ardern said on Tuesday. Labour, firming as the frontrunner ahead of the National government in a Sept. 23 election, wants to curb overseas buyers  home purchases in a bid to cool the housing market and make home ownership more affordable for New Zealanders. Foreigners with the right to live in New Zealand would be exempt from Labour s proposed ban, which would still be at odds with provisions in the TPP trade deal as well as New Zealand s free trade agreement with South Korea.  It is an agreement we want to be part of, but we also want to maintain our ability to legislate under our laws to protect what is an overheated housing market,  Ardern said.  We want to be in there but our housing bottom line is pretty firm for us,  she told New Zealand media. The original 12-member TPP, which aims to cut trade barriers in some of Asia s fastest-growing economies, was thrown into limbo in January when U.S. President Trump withdrew from the agreement. The remaining 11 members have said they remain committed to the deal, but implementation of the agreement linking 11 countries with a combined GDP of $12.4 trillion has stalled. Ardern, who has almost single-handedly changed Labour s election chances since becoming leader in August, has made home ownership a campaign focus. She has criticized National for failing to tackle a housing crisis during nine years in government, promising to build more affordable homes and to crack down on foreign speculators. Labour wants to reconsider New Zealand s role in the TPP if foreign investment provisions are not restricted. Banning foreign investment in existing homes would also mean having to renegotiate New Zealand s trading agreement with South Korea, although its free trade deal with China already provides for restrictions on foreign investment.  Korea has the same carve-out ... for themselves so they can restrict New Zealanders ... Australia has that same carve-out in their agreement with Korea, so we don t anticipate that would be a significant sticking point,  she said. National criticized Labour s plans to renegotiate the trade agreement with South Korea, describing it as an  ill-thought out and vague  policy. Support for Labour rose to 41.8 percent in the latest average of opinion polls, nudging above National s 41.1 percent. ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1
Dancer who hid Peru rebel chief freed from prison after 25 years,"LIMA (Reuters) - A ballet dancer in Peru who was caught hiding the leader of the Shining Path in her apartment in 1992 was freed from prison after finishing her 25-year sentence on Monday. Maritza Garrido Lecca, 52, emerged from a prison on the dusty outskirts of Lima smiling. As she stepped in a car, journalists shouted:  Do you regret it?  Garrido Lecca is the latest in a wave of former militants to be freed, and their release has stirred fears of unrest. Raised in an affluent Catholic home in Peru s capital Lima, Garrido Lecca stunned Peru when authorities discovered the country s most wanted man, Abimael Guzman, had been secretly living in the second story of her apartment above the studio where she taught ballet and modern dance. Her story inspired the 2002 John Malkovich-directed film  The Dancer Upstairs  that depicted the kind of patient detectivework that led to Guzman s capture. Guzman launched the Shining Path s attempt to overthrow the state in 1980 in what would become one of Latin America s deadliest internal conflicts. An estimated 69,000 people were killed in the two-decade battle between state security forces and leftist insurgents. The majority of victims were the poor indigenous peasants whom Guzman hoped would embrace his plans for an armed rebellion. Residents of Lima s upscale neighborhood Miraflores waved Peruvian flags in protest as they waited for Garrido Lecca to arrive at her elderly mother s apartment building.  The Shining Path and terrorism are our enemy and we ll be vigilant about combating them,  Justice Minister Marisol Perez told journalists ahead of Garrido Lecca s release. While the Shining Path is no longer a threat to the Peruvian state and the group s political arm, Movadef, has been blocked from forming a party, authorities say former members are fanning conflicts and winning support among young people. Peru s Interior Minister Carlos Basombrio accused former Shining Path inmates of infiltrating a teachers strike that dragged on for more than two months with frequent clashes between police and protesters. Out of some 6,000 inmates who had been convicted of terrorism, the  vast majority  are now free, Peruvian security analyst Pedro Yaranga said. While no former Shining Path member has asked for forgiveness for the group s violent past, Movadef says it is no longer seeking to obtain power with an armed rebellion. After her arrest, Garrido Lecca denied being part of Shining Path s leadership but acknowledged having links to the group and shouted her allegiance to it before news cameras. Peru s former Prime Minister Pedro Cateriano, who lives in the building where Garrido Lecca is expected to stay, said Peru has no choice but live with the former rebels.  I don t like being Garrido Lecca s neighbor, either, but, that s how a state based on the rule of law works,  Cateriano told reporters. ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1
Turkey orders former intelligence personnel detained in Gulen probe: AA,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey issued arrest warrants for 63 people, including former National Intelligence Agency (MIT) personnel, over alleged links to the U.S.-based cleric accused of orchestrating last year s attempted coup, Anadolu agency reported on Tuesday. The police operation was launched in 21 provinces across Turkey, the state-run news agency reported. Ankara says cleric Fethullah Gulen, who has lived in the United States since 1999, was behind the abortive putsch in July 2016. Gulen has denied involvement. More than 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial for alleged ties to Gulen s movement and some 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended from jobs in the public and private sectors for the same reason. Some of Turkey s Western allies and rights groups have expressed concern about the crackdown and suspect the government has used the coup as a pretext to quash dissent. The government says the purges are necessary due to the gravity of the threats it has faced since the failed putsch, in which more than 240 people were killed. ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1
Philippine police halt drug tests after residents petition court,"MANILA (Reuters) - Police have been forced to stop conducting drug surveys and testing in the Philippine capital s biggest and most populous area after a lawyers  group representing residents filed a petition before a court, a police chief said on Tuesday. Thousands of residents had been surveyed and a few hundred had been tested in a door-to-door anti-narcotics campaign in two communities in Manila s Quezon City from May this year, part of President Rodrigo Duterte s bloody war on drugs. Human rights groups and Duterte s political opponents have said tests conducted by police amounted to harassment that could endanger the lives of those who tested positive. Activists say large numbers of users have been killed during the anti-drug campaign, often by mysterious gunmen. Community officials were still allowed to go around the city s 142 neighborhoods asking people to complete surveys about drug use and take voluntary urine tests, said Guillermo Eleazar, Quezon City police chief.  The police will no longer have an active role in the anti-drug activities,  Eleazar told Reuters, a day after he attended a court hearing on a petition to stop the police tests.  Our uniformed personnel will now be limited to providing security and visibility upon the requests of our barangay (community) officials. They will no longer take part in asking questions and taking urine samples,  he said. The decision comes as Philippine police are under intense media scrutiny over their conduct in an anti-narcotics campaign that has killed thousands of Filipinos over the past 15 months and alarmed human rights monitors. Activists and some opposition politicians have accused Duterte of having a kill policy that aims to eliminate suspected drug dealers rather than take them into custody. Duterte and the police reject such accusations and say that those killed had resisted arrest violently.  Eleazar said the drug tests police had conducted were voluntary and not coercive. He said the court did not issue a restraining order because he assured the judge it was up to each community to decide its own programmes and police would play only a supporting role. Eleazar accepted some police officers were  over-zealous  in the conduct of house-to-house surveys and tests, but said petitioners were wrong to blame police, who were only trying to help.  The petitioners are barking up at the wrong tree,  he said.  They should ask the court to stop the barangays from doing these anti-drug surveys and tests.  The National Union of People s Lawyers (NUPL) said they expected police to shift blame.  No doubt this about-face by the police was due to public protests and the legal suit,  the NUPL said in a statement. ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1
Human Rights Watch says Saudi-led air strikes in Yemen are war crimes,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Human Rights Watch accused the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen of war crimes on Tuesday, saying its air strikes killed 39 civilians including 26 children in two months.  The rights group said five air strikes hitting four family homes and a grocery store were carried out either deliberately or recklessly, causing indiscriminate loss of civilian lives in violation of the laws of war. The coalition has repeatedly denied allegations of war crimes and says its attacks are directed against its foes in Yemen s armed Houthi movement and not civilians. Yemen has been torn by a civil war in which Yemen s internationally-recognized government, backed by a coalition supported by the United States and Britain, is trying to roll back the Iran-aligned Houthi group which controls most of northern Yemen, including the capital Sanaa.  The Saudi-led coalition s repeated promises to conduct its air strikes lawfully are not sparing Yemeni children from unlawful attacks,  said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, in a statement.  This underscores the need for the United Nations to immediately return the coalition to its annual  list of shame  for violations against children in armed conflict,  she said. On August 4, coalition aircraft struck a home in Saada, killing nine members of a family, including six children, ages 3 through 12.  On July 3, an air strike killed eight members of the same family in Taiz province, including the wife and 8-year-old daughter, the organization said. HRW said it interviewed nine family members and witnesses to five air strikes that occurred between June 9 and August 4, and did not detect any potential military targets in the vicinity.  The war has killed more than 10,000 people, displaced more than three million and ruined much of the impoverished country s infrastructure. The Saudi-led coalition was formed in 2015 to fight the Houthis and army troops allied with them who have fired missiles into the kingdom. HRW called on United Nations Security Council to launch an international investigation into the abuses at its September session.   On Monday, the U.N. said it has verified 5,144 civilian deaths in the war in Yemen, mainly from air strikes by a Saudi-led coalition, and an international investigation is urgently needed.

Japan PM Abe's ratings regain 50 percent amid North Korea security jitters,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s support ratings have recovered to the 50 percent level, a poll released on Tuesday showed, helped by public jitters over North Korea s missile and nuclear tests and by disarray in the main opposition party. A September 8-10 survey by the Yomiuri newspaper put support for Abe s administration at 50 percent, up 8 points from the previous month. Abe s support had sunk below 30 percent in some polls in July, battered by suspected cronyism scandals and perceptions among voters that he had become arrogant after more than four years in office. His ratings improved slightly cabinet reshuffle in early August. Since then, news has been dominated by rising regional tensions over North Korea s ballistic missile tests, including one that flew over northern Japan. Abe has spoken to U.S. President Donald Trump by phone numerous times, seeking to demonstrate the U.S.-Japan alliance is firm. Pyongyang last week carried out its sixth and biggest nuclear test and Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera warned more provocations could be in store after the U.N. Security Council stepped up sanctions, imposing a ban on the North s textile exports and capping crude oil imports.  Japan also wants to take leadership to change North Korea s policies while coordinating closely with other countries,  Abe told reporters on Tuesday. With parliament in recess, Abe was  able to use the  crisis  in North Korea to monopolize the spotlight by getting the media to portray him as a strong leader,  said Koichi Nakano, a  political science professor at Sophia University. Japan s opposition Democratic Party, meanwhile, failed to  improve its ratings after the election last month of a new leader, former foreign minister Seiji Maehara. The Democrats also face likely defections to an embryonic party that allies of popular Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike, an ex-ruling party lawmaker, are trying to form. Sixty percent of voters did not hold hopes for Maehara s leadership compared to 33 percent who did. Support for his party languished at 5 percent versus 40 percent for Abe s Liberal Democratic Party, the Yomiuri said. Reflecting Koike s popularity, the yet-to-be-launched  Japan First  party, fared better, with 41 percent expressing hopes for the new group. Whether Abe can maintain the gains in popularity remains to be seen.  The scandals have not gone away and in a couple of weeks, Abe will have to convene the Diet ... so the recovery in  support levels may well turn out to be temporary,  Nakano said.

"With 7.4 million without power, utility workers get respect","Fort Lauderdale and New York (Reuters) - When more than 7.4 million homes and businesses are without power after a hurricane, utility workers tend to get noticed a bit more than usual. That s what Gus Beyersdorf, 40, and his colleague Nick Jensen, 32, utility workers from Wisconsin, found out while inspecting power lines in Florida on Monday. The two - among the thousands of power-line workers brought in from out-of-state by major utilities - spent about five minutes outside a house in Fort Lauderdale, when two cars with women who said they lived in the neighborhood stopped to inquire about the return of power to their homes - obviously trying to get their attention.  I think you guys are sexy. Men in hard hats are attractive!  said one of the women, obviously just joking with the Wisconsin men, but also making it clear that she would like it if they would get the power turned back on at her house.  Major utilities in the state - including Florida Power & Light Co, Duke Energy Corp  and Tampa Electric - have mobilized tens of thousands of workers to deal with the enormous power outages, which by Monday evening numbered more than 7.4 million homes and businesses after Hurricane Irma landed as a Category 4 storm early Sunday.  While the numbers in Florida were declining slightly, more outages were being reported in Georgia and other states as Irma, now a tropical storm, moved north. Beyersdorf and Jensen left northern Wisconsin on Friday morning and raced to southern Florida to be in place ahead of Irma s impact. Between 2,000 and 3,000 utility workers from out-of-state are staying at BB&T Stadium in Broward County, which is home to the National Hockey League s Florida Panthers, said Beyersdorf.  Power losses in Georgia, which were nearing 900,000 as of 3 p.m. EDT, were expected to increase as the storm moved north.  In Florida, the state s biggest electric company said its outages dipped to 3.3 million from a peak of 3.6 million earlier on Monday. A total of almost 4.5 million Florida Power & Light customers have been affected by the storm, with about 1 million getting service restored, mostly by automated devices.  We ve never had that many outages, and I don t think any utility in the country ever has,  FPL Chief Executive Eric Silagy said at a news conference on Monday.  It is by far and away the largest in the history of our company.  FPL said it was still assessing the damage and could not yet say when it would restore service to most customers. Some homes and businesses could be without power for weeks, especially in the hardest-hit areas like southwest Florida, the NextEra Energy Inc unit said.  It took a week for Matthew,  Jensen said, referring to a hurricane that last year did not make landfall in Florida but caused power outages.  This one is going to take a lot longer.  As Irma pushed north, outage figures were increasing at other large utilities, including units of Duke Energy, Southern Co and Emera Inc.  Duke s outages held around 1.2 million on Monday evening, while Emera s Tampa Electric utility said outages eased to about 320,000 from a peak earlier on Monday of over 330,000. FPL said its two nuclear plants were safe. Both units at its Turkey Point facility, about 30 miles (48 km) south of Miami, were shut by early Monday. At its St. Lucie nuclear plant about 120 miles (190 km) north of Miami, FPL reduced power at Unit 1 because of salt buildup from Irma in the switchyard, NRC spokesman Roger Hannah said. The plant s other reactor, Unit 2, continued to operate at full power. Irma is expected to sap demand for fuel for a time, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note on Monday, but they cautioned that supply could remain strained because of refining capacity offline after Hurricane Harvey, which hit Texas two weeks ago.

Factbox: Over 7.4 million lose power from Irma in U.S. Southeast - utilities,"(Reuters) - Over 7.4 million homes and businesses were without power in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and Alabama because of Hurricane Irma, according to state officials and utilities on Monday.  Most outages were in Florida Power & Light s service area in the southern and eastern parts of the state. A unit of NextEra Energy Inc and the state s biggest power company, FPL said its outages dipped to around 3.4 million by Monday evening from a peak of 3.6 million earlier in the day. As the storm weakens as it heads toward Georgia, outages have leveled off or even declined at other Florida utilities, while increasing in Georgia, South Carolina and Alabama. Florida outages for Duke Energy Corp, which serves the northern and central parts of the state, increased to almost 1.2 million, according to the company s website. Irma hit southwest Florida on Sunday morning as a dangerous Category 4 storm, the second-highest level on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale. It gradually weakened to a tropical storm by Monday morning.  The storm, which was moving into southern Georgia, was packing maximum sustained winds of 60 miles (97 km) per hour, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center s latest update at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT). In Georgia, utilities reported about 950,000 customers without power. Other big power utilities in Florida are units of Emera Inc and Southern Co, which also operates the biggest electric companies in Georgia and Alabama. ",worldnews,"September 11, 2017 ",1
Guatemala president retains immunity from prosecution in graft probe,"GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - Guatemala s Congress on Monday voted overwhelmingly to preserve President Jimmy Morales  immunity from prosecution after the attorney general submitted a request to investigate him over suspected financing irregularities during his 2015 election campaign. The vote to protect Morales from possible prosecution was lopsided, with only 25 of the 158 members of Congress voting to strip Morales  of his legal protections. Presidential immunity can only be lifted with the backing of at least two-thirds of the chamber, or 105 members. Backers of Morales argued their vote to stop the probe from advancing favored political stability in the Central American nation.  Democracy isn t built by changing the president every two years,  said Congressman Raul Romero, head of the Fuerza party, referring to the corruption cases that led to the 2015  resignation of Morales  predecessor, Otto Perez Molina. The vote in Congress was a blow to the U.N.-backed International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), which was pushing to determine the origin of some $800,000 in funds Morales managed as secretary general of the conservative National Convergence Front (FCN) party he led from 2015 to 2016. It was widely believed that those in favor of stripping Morales of his impunity would struggle to win enough support in Congress to green light an eventual prosecution as CICIG is also investigating all the major parties in Guatemala over suspected illegal financing.  Members of Congress are making a pact of corrupt officials now that they are afraid of being investigated themselves for illegal electoral financing,  said Alvaro Montenegro, head of the anti-corruption organization Justicia Ya. Morales, who has denied any wrongdoing, issued a statement late on Monday praising the vote as a sign of the country s unity and  democratic maturity  of its institutions.   I call for an end to the political and ideological confrontations and together we ll continue to build the Guatemala we all desire,  the statement said.  The congressional vote reversed the recommendation of a Guatemalan congressional committee on Sunday that Morales  immunity be revoked. Last month, Guatemala s attorney general and CICIG jointly sought to investigate Morales, a former comedian, over the illegal financing allegation. Two days later, Morales declared the head of the U.N. body  persona non grata.  Under the leadership of Ivan Velasquez, a veteran Colombian prosecutor, CICIG has caused problems for Morales, first investigating his son and brother, and then training its sights on him. The Guatemalan president won office in 2015 running on a platform of honest governance after Perez Molina was forced to resign and imprisoned in a multi-million dollar graft case stemming from a CICIG investigation.

Mexico president leads government response in quake zone,"JUCHITAN, Mexico (Reuters) - Mexico s president on Monday threw himself into areas badly hit by last week s devastating earthquake amid frustration at delays in getting food and water to stricken communities where at least 96 people died and 2.5 million were left in need of aid. Accompanied by several cabinet ministers, President Enrique Pena Nieto took on a busy schedule as he toured the battered southern state of Chiapas, seeking to inspire confidence in the government s relief effort. Pena Nieto s approval ratings have plumbed depths lower than any recent president, and his Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) faces a major struggle to retain power in presidential elections next July. The law bars him from seeking re-election. Speaking in the hard-hit city of Tonala, Pena Nieto urged construction companies to aid rebuilding efforts.  If construction firms commit to showing solidarity by building a few homes ... construction efforts can be carried out quicker,  he said.  Don t let anyone take advantage of you, or take control of your affairs. The government is here.  Mexican cement producer Cemex said on Monday it would donate $1 million worth of aid to reconstruction efforts. The final cost of the quake is likely to be far higher. Among those with Pena Nieto were Interior Minister Miguel Angel Osorio Chong and Finance Minister Jose Antonio Meade, both potential PRI candidates for the presidency. The quake killed at least sixteen people in Chiapas and four others in Tabasco. The vast majority of deaths so far reported were the 76 in neighboring Oaxaca state. Many Oaxaca fatalities were in the town of Juchitan, where more than 5,000 homes were destroyed. Tens of thousands of others were damaged in the region. Government officials delivered bags of simple rations including water and canned food on Sunday, but many Juchitan residents complained about the slow pace of assistance.  We don t have food or water, we re desperate,  said Jesus Ramirez, 27, who works in a plastics factory.  We re trying to eat whatever we can find, any kind of food.  Much of Juchitan and its surroundings had no running water, and piles of rubble were still restricting access to streets. Electricity was returning, but residents complained officials were slow to conduct house-by-house damage assessments. Alfredo Jimenez, a 19-year-old engineering student, said he and neighbors banded together to help victims of seven flattened homes in the area, feeling unable to count on the government.   We see government people passing by, the army and the marines, but they haven t offered us anything,  he said. Margarita Lopez, 56, a domestic worker, lined up for assistance in one Juchitan neighborhood where nearly every house was severely damaged.  Almost nothing has arrived from the government, and we don t know what else we can do,  Lopez said. Thursday s 8.1 magnitude quake was the most powerful to hit Mexico in 85 years, surpassing a 1985 temblor that killed thousands in Mexico City and triggered public outcry over the government response. That disaster hurt the PRI s reputation and some analysts believe it contributed to its removal from power in a 2000 vote, ending 71 consecutive years of one-party rule. Under pressure to do more at home, the government on Monday withdrew an offer to help victims of Hurricane Harvey in Texas. Mexico has been coping with heavy rains and the impact from Hurricane Katia on the Gulf state of Veracruz. The quake struck off the coast of Chiapas, and Mexico s national seismological institute said more than 1,000 aftershocks have since been reported. State-run oil company Pemex said on Monday it has not restarted its Salina Cruz refinery due to the aftershocks. ",worldnews,"September 11, 2017 ",1

Supreme Court justice temporarily preserves Trump refugee ban,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy on Monday provided a temporary reprieve for President Trump s order blocking most refugees from entering the United States, putting on hold a lower court s ruling loosening the prohibition. Kennedy s action gave the nine justices more time to consider the Justice Department s challenge filed on Monday to the lower court s decision allowing entry to refugees from around the world if they had a formal offer from a resettlement agency. The full Supreme Court could act within days. The Justice Department opted not to appeal another part of last Thursday s ruling by the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that related to Trump s ban on travelers from six Muslim-majority nations. The 9th Circuit ruling broadened the number of people with exemptions to the ban to include grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins of legal U.S. residents. Without Kennedy s intervention, the appeals court decision would have gone into effect on Tuesday. Kennedy asked refugee ban challengers to file a response to the Trump administration s filing by noon on Tuesday. Under the 9th U.S. Circuit s ruling, up to 24,000 additional refugees would become eligible to enter the United States than otherwise would be allowed, according to the administration. Trump s March 6 order banned travelers from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days and locked out most aspiring refugees for 120 days in a move the Republican president argued was needed to prevent terrorist attacks. The order, which replaced a broader January one that was blocked by federal courts, was one of the most contentious acts of his presidency. Critics called it an unlawful  Muslim ban  that made good on Trump s promise as a candidate of  a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.  The broader question of whether the travel ban discriminates against Muslims in violation of the U.S. Constitution, as lower courts previously ruled, will be argued before the Supreme Court on Oct. 10. The Supreme Court in June partially revived the order after its provisions were blocked by lower courts. But the justices said a ban could be applied only to those without a  bona fide  relationship to people or entities in the United States. New litigation was brought by Hawaii over the meaning of that phrase, including whether written assurances by resettlement agencies obligating them to provide services for specific refugees would count. Hawaii and other Democratic-led states, the American Civil Liberties Union and refugee groups filed legal challenges after Trump signed his order in March.  The Trump administration has ended its odd and ill-advised quest to ban grandmas from the country,  Hawaii Attorney General Douglas Chin said on Monday.  With respect to the admission to the United States of refugees with formal assurances and the Supreme Court s temporary stay order, each day matters,  Chin added, promising to respond soon to the administration s filing. In court papers filed earlier on Monday, the Justice Department said the 9th Circuit refugees decision  will disrupt the status quo and frustrate orderly implementation of the order s refugee provisions.  Omar Jadwat, an ACLU lawyer, contrasted Trump s efforts to keep alive his travel ban with the Republican president s decision last week to rescind a program that protected from deportation people brought to the United States illegally as children, dubbed  Dreamers.   The extraordinary efforts the administration is taking in pursuit of the Muslim ban stand in stark contrast to its unwillingness to take a single step to protect 800,000 Dreamers,  Jadwat said.

"Sweden, Britain seek U.N. meeting on situation in Myanmar","UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Sweden and Britain on Monday requested a closed-door United Nations Security Council meeting on the  deteriorating situation  in Myanmar s Rakhine state, home to the majority-Buddhist nation s Rohingya Muslims, diplomats said.  The meeting would likely be held on Wednesday, diplomats said.   I think it will be a private meeting but with a public outcome of some form,  British U.N.

It s a sign of the significant worry that Security Council members have that the situation is continuing to deteriorate for many Rohingya who are seeking to flee Rakhine state in Burma and move into Bangladesh,  Rycroft said.  The United Nations  top human rights official slammed Myanmar earlier on Monday for conducting a  cruel military operation  against Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine state, branding it  a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.   The Security Council discussed the situation behind closed doors on Aug. 30. In a rare letter to the council earlier this month, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed concern the violence could spiral into a  humanitarian catastrophe.  Rights groups informally briefed Security Council diplomats on the Myanmar violence on Friday. Russia and China did not send any diplomats, according to people at the meeting.

"Hurricane Irma kills 10 in Cuba, Castro calls for unity","HAVANA (Reuters) - President Raul Castro called on Cubans on Monday to unite in swiftly rebuilding the Caribbean nation in the wake of Hurricane Irma, which killed at least 10 people during a devastating three-day rampage along the length of the island. The storm crashed into Cuba late on Friday, with sustained winds of than 157 miles per hour (253 km per hour). It tore along the island s northern shore for some 200 miles (322 km) - lashing tourist resorts on the island s pristine keys - before turning northward to batter Florida. In Havana, people set about removing debris from the streets on Monday and mopping up homes hit by widespread flooding. The hurricane - the first Category 5 storm to make landfall in Cuba since 1932 - tore off roofs, felled trees and downed electricity poles, leaving millions without power and water. State media said on Monday Irma had seriously damaged Cuba s already dilapidated sugar industry, flooding and flattening an extensive area of sugar cane.  Given the immensity of its size, practically no region escaped its impact,  Castro said in a statement published in state-run media, urging Cubans to unite to rebuild the country.  The task we have before us is immense but, with a people like ours, we will win the most important battle: the recovery.  Castro, 86, who has said he will step aside early next year, said authorities had not been able to assess the full extent of damage yet, but the hurricane had impacted housing stock and the power grid, as well as agriculture. The fatalities in Cuba brought the death toll from Irma to 39 in the Caribbean. The hurricane dealt a potentially heavy blow to Cuba s agriculture- and tourism-reliant economy at a difficult moment, with an economic reform program appearing stalled and aid from key ally Venezuela shrinking. Seven of the Cuban dead were in the province of Havana, which only caught the outer reaches of the hurricane but still saw waves of up to 36 feet (12 meters) pummel its historic seafront boulevard on Sunday. The two youngest victims, Mar a del Carmen Arregoit a and  Yolendis Castillo, both 27, died when a balcony crashed down onto their bus in central Havana, infamous for its creaking infrastructure. The oldest, Nieves Mart nez, 89, was found floating in water in front of her home in the Vedado district of Havana in the wake of heavy flooding in the capital, according to a statement from civil defense authorities. Large parts of Havana remained underwater on Monday.  We have absolutely nothing, we lost it all, the fridge, the washing machine, we lost it all here,  said Ayda Herrera, whose home on Havana s seafront boulevard was flooded. Fatalities also were reported in Matanzas, home to the tourist resort of Varadero, and the regions of Ciego de Avila and Camaguey farther east. While many of Cuba s top resorts on the northern islands took a direct hit from the hurricane, Castro said they would be fixed up in time for high tourist season at the end of the year. Many tourists flew home ahead of Irma, but others hunkered down in hotels and shelters.  Tropical paradise turned into hell for us,  said Spanish tourist Michel Munoz, 31, who said he spent the hurricane sheltering in a Havana convent and had struggled to find food on Sunday as most restaurants were closed. Excavators have started the laborious task of removing debris and fallen trees from roads throughout the island and trucks carried drinkable water to the worst-affected areas.  We are working twice as hard as usual to ensure as much bread as possible to the population,  said Alain Alfonso, a worker at a bakery in Central Havana. ",worldnews,"September 11, 2017 ",1

Tunisia parliament backs Chahed's new government,"TUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisia s parliament gave Prime Minister Youssef Chahed s new government a vote of confidence on Monday after the premier detailed plans to halve the budget deficit and trim the public wage bill in the next three years as part of a reform package. Chahed last week named a new cabinet after weeks of wrangling between the ruling Nidaa Tounes party and rival Islamist party Ennahda over posts that had delayed progress on a reform program backed by the International Monetary Fund. Lawmakers voted late on Monday to approve the new cabinet, giving Chahed support to push on with austerity measures.  We hope this will be the government that gives Tunisians back some hope,  parliament assembly President Mohamed Naceur said after the vote. Tunisia has been praised for its democratic progress after the 2011 uprising against autocrat Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, but successive governments have failed to advance in economic reforms to trim deficits and create jobs and growth. Chahed earlier said his government needed consensus backing to push ahead with reforms by 2020 that he hopes will revive Tunisia s economy, which has been hit by unrest after the 2011 revolt and by militant attacks on the tourism industry.  We are preparing an economic plan to relaunch and salvage the Tunisian economy,  he told parliament five days after naming a cabinet that includes a new minister in charge of economic reforms.  This is needed to balance our finances.  Chahed said the government aimed to reduce the deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic product by 2020 from 6 percent expected this year. He said growth was expected to hit 5 percent that year; in the first half of this year, the economy expanded by 1.9 percent. Backed by the International Monetary Fund, the North African country is looking to reduce subsidies, overhaul its pension system and shrink its large public sector. But worries over social unrest have kept authorities from advancing with reforms. Chahed said the government planned to reduce the public wage bill to around 12.5 percent of GDP from the current 14 percent - one of the highest ratios in the world. In an effort to boost foreign currency reserves, he said the government would also loosen currency controls to allow Tunisians to hold foreign currency accounts locally and introduce an amnesty for illicit foreign currency trade.

Peru says expelling North Korean ambassador over nuclear program,"LIMA (Reuters) - Peru said on Monday that it was expelling North Korea s ambassador over the country s refusal to heed the world s  constant calls  to end its nuclear program. The ambassador, Kim Hak-Chol, has five days to leave Peru, the foreign affairs ministry said in a statement. Earlier this month North Korea launched its biggest nuclear bomb test, prompting global condemnation as U.S. President Donald Trump said  appeasement  would not work. Peru stressed that it was committed to a peaceful solution to the dispute and  strict compliance  with resolutions passed by the United Nations Security Council. The UN Security Council is set to vote on Monday to impose new sanctions on North Korea after the United States watered down the text of a resolution to appease China and Russia. Peru said it would  carry out all diplomatic efforts aimed at denuclearizing the North Korean peninsula.  Peru s announcement follows a similar move by Mexico last week and U.S. Vice President Mike Pence s public call last month for Latin American nations to isolate Pyongyang. North Korea s embassy in Lima declined comment. ",worldnews,"September 11, 2017 ",1
Caribbean residents fend off looters after Irma; Branson urges 'Marshall Plan',"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (Reuters) - Food shortages and looting on Caribbean islands hammered by Hurricane Irma sparked growing criticism of the government response, prompting British billionaire Richard Branson to call for a  Marshall plan  to help the region recover. Irma ripped through the tiny easterly Leeward Islands last week as one of the Atlantic s strongest ever storms, killing two dozen people, uprooting trees, tearing down power cables and severely damaging the homes of poor locals and the global jet-set alike. Across the whole of the Caribbean, Irma killed nearly 40 people and devastated basic services, tearing cracks in law and order. Looting erupted on some Caribbean islands where residents and tourists were stranded with little food, shelter or drinking water. Jenn Manes, who writes a blog on U.S. Virgin Island St. John, detailed a list of robberies and break-ins on the island after Irma struck, saying she had to install a bar on the inside of her door to keep out would-be burglars.   This is not St. John anymore. I m not sure what it is. What I do know is that I am scared. My friends are scared. And we don t know what to do,  she wrote. Despite sending reinforcements and ships to deliver help, France, Britain and the Netherlands have been criticized for not doing enough for the islands that they oversee. Britain s Defence Minister Michael Fallon at the weekend said his government s effort was  as good as anybody else s.  The Dutch government on Sunday described the situation as  fragile  on its half of the island of St. Martin, where an undisclosed number of arrests of looters were made after Irma damaged or destroyed 70 percent of the local housing stock. Alex Martinez, a 31-year-old American trapped on the Dutch part of St. Martin by Irma, said looters tried to raid his near-deserted hotel before he and others chased them off.  We had to fend for ourselves,  he told Reuters. Struggling to get answers about loved-ones, many people resorted to sharing information and making pleas on a Facebook page set up to help people on St. Martin. Dutch King Willem-Alexander and Interior Minister Ronald Plasterk on Monday visited St. Martin, reviewing the damage done to the battered island with local leaders. French President Emmanuel Macron was expected in the Caribbean on Tuesday. Following the passage of Hurricane Luis in 1995, which killed at least 15 people in the Caribbean and damaged 60 percent of housing on St. Martin, the U.S. National Hurricane Center estimated the cost to St. Martin alone at $1.8 billion. Businessman Branson, who has lived in the British Virgin Islands for the past 11 years, said in a blog post on www.virgin.com that the region needed a  Disaster Recovery Marshall Plan  to rebuild and revitalize its economy - a reference to the multibillion-dollar U.S. program that helped rebuild Western Europe after the devastation of World War Two.   We must get more help to the islands to rebuild homes and infrastructure and restore power, clean water and food supplies,  said Branson, head of the Virgin Group conglomerate. He said he was writing from Puerto Rico, where he was mobilizing aid efforts, and that he would be returning to the Virgin Islands soon for recovery work. Branson said the British government had a  massive role to play  in rebuilding its territories, including the British Virgin Islands, an offshore financial center. The premier of the British Virgin Islands, Orlando Smith, also appealed for urgent aid from Britain, saying the situation was critical and calling for a comprehensive package. The plan should include the possibility of more extreme weather  as the effects of climate change continue to grow,  he said. Still, on Monday, blogger Manes on U.S. Virgin Island St. John reported the situation was improving, saying police were patrolling the streets and that a Navy ship had arrived to help.

"Belgian mayor's throat slashed in cemetery, shocking country","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The murder of a Belgian city mayor whose throat was cut in a cemetery on Monday has shocked the country, and the country s prime minister expressed  horror  at the death of the retired national lawmaker. Citing the public prosecutor, Belgian media said Alfred Gadenne, 71, the conservative mayor of Mouscron, an industrial town of 57,000 just across the border from the northern French city of Lille, was found dead in a graveyard close to his home where he acted as caretaker and locked the gates each night. Local news service SudInfo, citing unnamed sources, said a suspect had handed himself in to police and that the motive was unclear. The case was handed to a local prosecutor rather than to national counter-terrorism investigators.

Factbox: Norway's close-fought election for parliament,"OSLO (Reuters) - Norwegians vote on Sept. 10 and 11 to pick a parliament for the next four years and determine whether the center-right minority government stays in power or is replaced by parties on the center-left. Opinion polls show the election remains too close to call. Exit polls and forecasts based on early votes will be made public on Monday at 1900 GMT, and most ballots will be counted within three to four hours. In the case of an exceptionally tight race however, the final result may not emerge until late on Tuesday. Below is a summary of key policy differences and the dynamics of the race: All 169 seats in parliament are up for grabs, and as many as nine parties are expected to win seats under Norway s system of proportional representation. However, there are only two candidates for the job of prime minister - the incumbent Erna Solberg of the Conservatives and Labour s Jonas Gahr Stoere. A calculation by www.pollofpolls.no, measuring the average of September opinion polls, gave Solberg s four-party block 85 seats, just enough for a majority, while the four on the center-left, plus the independent Green Party, would win 84 seats. But whether it s the center-left or center-right that hits the crucial 85 seats, the winner faces tricky post-election negotiations and will meet tough demands from small parties to keep their support over the next four years. The race could be decided by how many of the small parties clear the key four-percent hurdle that gives access to a pool of so-called  seats at large , boosting their presence in parliament. Two parties on the right, two on the left and one in the center, the Greens, are all close to this key threshold. Solberg seeks further cuts in personal income tax and a reduction of the wealth tax, but has declined to say by how much. She requires backing from the centrist Liberals and Christian Democrats, which would temper the size of any cuts. Labour has vowed to raise taxes for above-average earners and the wealthy by up to $2 billion to improve public services and reduce the reliance on cash from Norway s sovereign wealth fund. Citing concerns over climate change and potential pollution, several small parties seek to limit the expansion of Norway s oil and gas industry, which brings in almost half the country s export revenues. The independent Greens, which could hold the balance of power in post-election maneuvers, have made it a condition for anyone seeking their support to end all exploration   a demand that neither Labour nor the Conservatives are willing to meet. Meanwhile, the Liberal Party hopes to slow down the awards of new exploration acreage to oil firms if the Conservatives stay in power, while on the left the Reds and the Socialist Left will make similar demands of a Labour-led government. The seas surrounding the arctic Lofoten archipelago could thus remain off-limits to the oil industry, while the extent of drilling in the far-north Barents Sea may emerge as a flash-point in post-election negotiations. With nearly $1 trillion saved up from Norway s extensive oil and gas industry, the next parliament faces key questions over how to organize the fund and whether to allow investments beyond the foreign stocks, bonds and real estate it currently holds. Decisions are mostly made in consensus between the bigger parties, however, and neither Labour nor the Conservatives have said whether they agree with a recent report that suggested it should no longer be managed by the central bank. If Labour s Gahr Stoere emerges as the likely next prime minister, he will face pressure from center-left parties to review EU-outsider Norway s extensive inclusion in the European Union s single market. At stake is Norway s participation in the European Economic Area (EEA) treaty, strongly favored by both Labour and the Conservatives but opposed by the euro-skeptic Centre Party (CP) and the Socialist Left (SL). However, both the CP and the SL, in government with Labour from 2005 to 2013, agreed at the time to govern on the basis of the EEA.

UK police charge serving soldiers over suspected far-right terrorism,"LONDON (Reuters) - Three men, including two serving soldiers, were charged by British police on Monday with terrorism offences, including belonging to a banned far-right group. The men were among five arrested on Sept. 5 as part of a pre-planned, intelligence-led operation. The other two were released without charge on Sunday. West Midlands Police said 22-year-old Alexander Deakin, 32-year-old Mikko Vehvilainen and 24-year-old Mark Barrett had all been charged with being members of neo-Nazi organization the National Action group. Barrett and Vehvilainen both gave their addresses as British army bases. All three will appear before Westminster Magistrates Court on Tuesday. National Action became the first far-right group to be outlawed in Britain last year after the murder of member of parliament Jo Cox, whose killing the group had praised. Police said Deakin had also been charged possessing documents useful in committing or preparing an act of terrorism, distributing a terrorist publication and inciting racial hatred.  Vehvilainen was also charged with possessing documents useful in committing or preparing an act of terrorism, as well as publishing threatening or abusive material and possessing a weapon.

Saudi clerics detained in apparent bid to silence dissent,"(Reuters) - Several prominent Saudi clerics have been detained in an apparent crackdown on potential opponents of the conservative kingdom s absolute rulers amid widespread speculation that King Salman intends to abdicate in favor of his son. Saudi sources told Reuters that Salman al-Awdah, Awad al-Qarni and Ali al-Omary were detained over the weekend. Officials could not be reached or declined to comment. All three are outside the state-backed clerical establishment but have large online followings. They have previously criticised the government but more recently kept silent or failed to publicly back Saudi policies, including the rift with Qatar over supporting the Muslim Brotherhood. Awdah was imprisoned from 1994-99 for agitating for political change and leadership of the Brotherhood-inspired Sahwa (Awakening) movement. He later called for democracy and tolerance during the  Arab Spring  uprisings of 2011. Saudi officials have dismissed reports that the king may soon pass the throne to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who already dominates economic, diplomatic and domestic policy. But the al-Saud family has always regarded Islamist groups as the biggest internal threat to its rule over a country in which appeals to religious sentiment cannot be lightly dismissed and an al Qaeda campaign a decade ago killed hundreds. In the 1990s, the Sahwa demanded political reforms that would have weakened the ruling family.  Mohammed bin Salman is very likely to be the next king but any dissenting voices that could challenge this succession could also be considered destabilizing from the regime perspective,  said Jean-Marc Rickli, head of global risk at the Geneva Centre for Security Policy.  You put that in the context of the Qatar rift and it is very difficult right now in the Gulf to have an opinion that is not considered biased or adversarial because the situation is so polarized on all sides.  Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and transport links with Qatar in June over its alleged support for Islamist militants, a charge Doha denies. In the past two years, Crown Prince Mohammed has launched radical reforms to foster economic diversity and cultural openness, testing the kingdom s traditions of incremental change and rule by consensus. Resistance has not been met kindly, with the authorities increasingly silencing independent actors, said Stephane Lacroix, a scholar of Islam in Saudi Arabia.  It s a much broader attempt to crush Islamists regardless of whether they act in opposition or not,  he said.  This (the arrests) would be [Prince Mohammed] and the regime trying to impose a much stricter political order.  The crackdown is not limited to Islamists. Civil liberties monitors say freedom of expression is increasingly constrained in Gulf Arab states including Saudi Arabia.  There is a general climate of being hypersensitive and almost paranoid,  said Madawi al-Rasheed, visiting professor at the Middle East Centre, London School of Economics.  There is no room for any kind of dissent at the moment.  The government toughened its stance following the Arab Spring after it averted unrest by increasing salaries and other state spending but the Brotherhood gained power elsewhere in the region. The group represents an ideological threat to Riyadh s dynastic system of rule, and its use of oaths of allegiance and secret meetings are anathema to the Saudis. It was listed by Riyadh as a terrorist organization in 2014 and diplomats and analysts say there is little prospect that would change. Taking power in January 2015, King Salman initially appeared willing to allow the Brotherhood a role outside politics, for example by not stopping affiliated preachers such as Awdah from speaking publicly on religious or social issues. That appears to have changed in recent months, as a shift in the official discourse targeted Islamists and arrests increased, said Lacroix.  What happened a couple of days ago is an acceleration of the process,  he said, although it is unclear what specifically prompted the detentions. Awdah tweeted on Friday welcoming a report that suggested the row between Qatar and other Arab countries may be resolved.  May God harmonize their hearts for the good of their people,  he wrote after a telephone call between Crown Prince Mohammed and Qatar s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani. Awdah comes from Buraidah, heartland of the kingdom s ultra-conservative Wahhabi school of Islam. Criticism of the ruling family in the 1990s earned him praise from Osama bin Laden, whom he eventually denounced. His Sahwa movement was later undermined by a mixture of repression and co-optation.  Some clerics, however, maintained large followings through YouTube sermons. Awdah has 14 million Twitter followers. He supported resistance to U.S. forces in Iraq as  jihad , or holy war, but then emerged as an ally in the government s campaign against violent jihadists. In 2011, Awdah called for elections and separation of powers, principles antithetical to strict Islamist ideology. He has since been largely quiet on issues of domestic reform. Qarni, who was detained at home in Abha in Saudi Arabia s south, had also expressed support for reconciliation with Qatar, hopes for which were quickly dashed when Saudi Arabia ended any dialogue with Qatar, accusing it of  distorting facts .  It seems today in Saudi Arabia that not supporting openly and enthusiastically what is happening against Qatar basically makes you an agent of Qatar,  said Lacroix.  People who don t take a stance stand in the middle, and there s no middle ground for the Saudis now.  ",worldnews,"September 10, 2017 ",1
"Exclusive: Iraq holding 1,400 foreign wives, children of suspected Islamic State fighters","SOUTH OF MOSUL, Iraq (Reuters) - Iraqi authorities are holding 1,400 foreign wives and children of suspected Islamic State fighters after government forces expelled the jihadist group from one of its last remaining strongholds in Iraq, security and aid officials said. Most came from Turkey. Many others were from former Soviet states, such as Tajikistan, Azerbaijan and Russia, Iraqi army and intelligence officers said. Other Asians and a  very few  French and Germans were also among them. The wives and children are being held at an Iraqi camp south of Mosul. Most had arrived since Aug. 30, when Iraqi troops drove Islamic State out of Mosul. One intelligence officer said that they were still in  verifying their nationalities with their home countries, since many of the women no longer had their original documents. It is the largest group of foreigners linked to Islamic State to be held by Iraqi forces since they began driving the militants from Mosul and other areas in northern Iraq last year, an aid official said. Thousands of foreigners have been fighting for Islamic State, or Daesh, in Iraq and Syria.  We are holding the Daesh families under tight security measures and waiting for government orders on how to deal with them,  said Army Colonel Ahmed al-Taie from Mosul s Nineveh operation command.  We treat them well. They are families of tough criminals who killed innocents in cold blood, but when we interrogated them we discovered that almost all of them were mislead by a vicious Daesh propaganda,  he said. Reuters reporters saw hundreds of the women and children sitting on mattresses crawling with bugs in tents without air-conditioning in what aid workers called a  militarized site . Turkish, French and Russian were among the languages spoken.   I want to go back (to France) but don t know how,  said a French-speaking veiled woman of Chechen origin who said she had lived in Paris before. She said she did not know what had happened to her husband, who had brought her to Iraq when he joined Islamic State. A security officer said the women and children had mostly surrendered to the Kurdish peshmerga near the northern city of Tal Afar, along with their husbands. The Kurds handed the women and children over to Iraqi forces but kept the men - all presumed to be fighters - in their custody.  Many of the families had fled to Tal Afar after Iraqi troops pushed Islamic State out of Mosul. Iraqi forces retook Tal Afar, a city of predominantly ethnic Turkmen that produced some of Islamic State s senior commanders, last month. Most of its pre-war population of 200,000 have fled. An interior ministry official said Iraq wanted to negotiate with embassies the return of the women and children.  We can t keep this number in our custody for a long time,  he said. Officials had counted so far at least 13 nationalities, said Army Lieutenant Colonel Salah Kareem.  Aid workers and the authorities are worried about tensions between Iraqis, who lost their homes and are also living in the camp, and the new arrivals.  Many Iraqis want revenge for the harsh treatment they received under the extremists  interpretation of Sunni Islam, which they imposed in Mosul and the other areas they seized in 2014.  The families are being kept to one side (of the camp) for their own safety,  an Iraqi military intelligence officer said. The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), which is supporting the 541 women and their children, said Iraq  must swiftly move to clarify its future plans for these individuals .  Like all those fleeing conflict, it is imperative that these individuals are able to access protection, assistance, and information,  NRC said in a statement.  They are in de-facto detention.  Western officials are worried about radicalized fighters and their relatives coming home after the collapse of Islamic State s  caliphate . French officials have indicated a preference for citizens found to be affiliated with IS to be prosecuted in Iraq.  The general philosophy is that adults should go on trial in Iraq,  a French diplomatic source told Reuters last month, of those found to have been fighters.  We think children would benefit from judicial and social services in France.  The women in the camp were cooking noodles or lying on mattresses with their babies in the hot tents. Many were still wearing the black abayas and face veils, which were mandatory in areas the militants controlled.  My mother doesn t even know where I am,  said a 27-year-old French woman of Algerian descent. She said she had been tricked by her husband into coming with him through Turkey into Syria and then Iraq when he joined Islamic State last year.  I had just given birth to this little girl three months before,  she said holding the infant and asking not to be named.  He said  let s go for a week s holiday in Turkey.  He had already bought the plane tickets and the hotel.  After four months in Mosul, she ran away from her husband to Tal Afar in February. She was hoping to make it back to France but he found her and would not let her leave.  She tearfully recounted how her five-year-old son was killed in June by a rocket while playing in the streets.  I don t understand why he did this to us,  she said of her husband, who she said was killed fighting in Mosul.  Dead or alive - I couldn t care less about him.  She and a few other families had walked for days to surrender at a Kurdish peshmerga checkpoint beyond al-Ayadiyah, a town near Tal Afar where the militants made their last stand.  We were getting bombed, shelled and shot at,  she said. Kurdish officials said dozens of fighters surrendered after the fall of Tal Afar but gave no details. One Tal Afar resident said he had seen between 70 and 80 fighters fleeing the town in the final days of the battle. ",worldnews,"September 10, 2017 ",1
Russia sanctions should be phased out if Ukraine ceasefire holds:  Germany's Gabriel,"BERLIN (Reuters) - European sanctions imposed on Russia over its role in the Ukraine crisis should be phased out gradually if an internationally agreed ceasefire deal was implemented, German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said on Monday. The conflict between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists has claimed more than 10,000 lives since it erupted in 2014.  Germany and France have tried to convince both sides to implement a peace deal agreed in Minsk in 2015 but with little success.  The official agreement is: Only if there is 100 percent peace, then we ll lift 100 percent of the sanctions,  Gabriel said during a panel discussion organized by German business daily Handelsblatt in Berlin.  Gabriel said, from his point of view, this was a  totally unrealistic  position.  We introduced the sanctions gradually and we ll lift them gradually - this is actually a commonly known fact,  Gabriel said.  He said that if there was a lasting ceasefire in eastern Ukraine, then the United States probably would also be willing to take similar steps.

Germany is heading toward a Sept. 24 federal election.

Pope says humanity will 'go down' if it does not address climate change,"ABOARD THE PAPAL PLANE (Reuters) - Pope Francis said the recent spate of hurricanes should prompt people to understand that humanity will  go down  if it does not address climate change and history will judge those who deny the science on its causes.  If we don t turn back, we will go down,  Francis told reporters on Sunday on the plane returning from Colombia. Francis strongly backed the 2015 Paris agreement on reducing global warming, from which the United States withdrew this year. Francis spoke as hurricane Irma pounded central Florida as it carved through the state with high winds, storm surges and torrential rains that left millions without power, ripped roofs off homes and flooded city streets. Francis was asked about recent hurricanes, including Irma and Harvey, and if political leaders who do not want to work with other countries to stem global warming should be held morally responsible for future effects on the planet.  You can see the effects of climate change and scientists have clearly said what path we have to follow,  he said, referring to a consensus by scientists that global warming is caused by human activity such as fossil fuels.  All of us have a responsibility, all of us, small or large, a moral responsibility. We have to take it seriously. We can t joke about it,  he said.  Each person has their own. Even politicians have their own.  Ahead of the Paris summit in 2015, Francis wrote a major encyclical, or papal letter, on the care of the environment which backed the gradual elimination of fossil fuels to stem global warming. The accord, agreed on by nearly 200 countries, aims to cut emissions blamed for global warming. The United States committed to reducing its own by 26 to 28 percent, compared with 2005 levels, by 2025. Many world leaders criticized Trump for pulling out.  If someone is doubtful that this is true, they should ask scientists. They are very clear. These are not opinions made on the fly.  They are very clear. Then each person can decide and history will judge the decisions,  he said. U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the Paris agreement shortly after visiting the Vatican in May. The Vatican had urged him to stay in the accord. A Vatican official said at the time that the U.S. move was a  slap in the face  for the pope and the Vatican. ",worldnews,"September 11, 2017 ",1

The ruling coalition of the Conservatives and Progress Party, and two smaller center-right allies, would win 88 seats in the 169-seat parliament, Norway s Directorate of Elections projected based on a count of early votes.

Around one million rally for Catalan independence from Spain,"BARCELONA (Reuters) - Around one million Catalans rallied in Barcelona on Monday, waving red and yellow striped flags and banging drums, in a show of support for independence after Madrid moved to block a referendum on the region s split from Spain. Sept. 11 marks the  Diada , Catalonia s national day, which commemorates the fall of Barcelona to Spain in 1714 and is traditionally used by pro-independence activists to call for secession for the northeastern region with a distinct language. However, this year s event had particular significance as a show of strength for the independence movement just three weeks ahead of a referendum on the issue which Madrid has declared illegal and taken steps to obstruct in the courts.  Demonstrators climbed on each others  shoulders to form human towers, a Catalan tradition, while others carried banners reading  We re going to be a free country!  and  Full of hope  while wearing fluorescent yellow t-shirts with the word  yes .  City police said on Twitter that around one million people took part, one of the highest turn-outs in recent years. Protesters said they hoped the vote would go ahead as planned on Oct. 1.  We hope that we will be able to hold the referendum with total normality, because in a democracy it is normal to be able to vote,  said German Freixas, a 42-year-old engineer accompanying his family to the rally.  If the people want it to happen, it will go ahead.  The Constitutional Court last Thursday suspended the referendum after a legal challenge by Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy. Police have since searched newspaper offices and printers for signs of any preparation for the referendum. The head of Catalonia s regional government, Carles Puigdemont, told journalists on Monday:  It s not an option that the referendum won t go ahead. It s 20 days away and we ve already overcome many hurdles.  Puigdemont is facing criminal charges of misuse of public money, disobedience and abuse of office for organizing the referendum. He is prepared to go to prison, he has said. A majority of Catalonia s mayors have so far said they will allow the use of municipal facilities for the vote. The mayor of Barcelona, Ada Colau, said on Monday she would do everything possible to allow people to vote but would not put civil servants  jobs at risk. Polls have shown support for independence waning in recent years with those wanting a separate state in a minority. However, a majority of Catalans want to vote on the issue. At a peaceful march in August, convened as a show of unity in the wake of Islamist attacks that killed 16, mostly in Barcelona, the king and Rajoy were booed and jeered by the crowds in a show of resentment toward Madrid.  Protesters on Monday held a minute of silence for the victims of the attacks. ",worldnews,"September 10, 2017 ",1

"In volatile Kenya, MP and former senator detained over hate speech allegations","NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenyan police detained a ruling party lawmaker and a former opposition senator on Monday for alleged hate speech, as political tensions simmered following the Supreme Court s decision to annul the presidential election.  Both the candidates in that ballot, incumbent president Uhuru Kenyatta and veteran opposition leader Raila Odinga, also ratcheted up the temperature in public speeches on Monday and the opposition said it would boycott the opening of parliament.  Politics in Kenya often follows ethnic lines and has in the past erupted into deadly violence, making the authorities sensitive to perceived inflammatory statements.  Reported instances of hate speech have risen sharply since the surprise ruling on Sept. 1, the first of its kind in Africa, when the supreme court voided Kenyatta s reelection citing irregularities in the tallying process.   Moses Kuria, a member of parliament and Johnson Muthama, a former senator, have been arrested on hate speech allegations,   interior ministry spokesman Mwenda Njoka told Reuters by phone. Njoka did not give further details, and police did not respond to queries.  Last week, Kuria gave a public speech calling for a  manhunt  for Odinga s supporters, who had greeted the court ruling with jubilation. Two witnesses described a roadblock set up the next day near where Kuria gave his speech, where ruling party supporters checked the ethnicity of passengers in vehicles to see if they might be opposition supporters.  On Sunday, Muthama, a former senator for the opposition Wiper party, gave a speech peppered with insults aimed at Kenyatta. In a televised speech on Monday, Kenyatta said the ruling party might use its majority in the legislature to impeach Odinga if the opposition leader won the new polls, scheduled for Oct. 17.   Even if he is elected, we have the opportunity in parliament within two months, three months to kick him out,  Kenyatta said in a nationally televised speech.  Waikwa Wanyoike, a barrister specializing in constitutional law, said the government s majority fell short of the majority needed in both houses to impeach a president.   It s just posturing. It requires a two-thirds majority in both houses ... there also has to be grounds to do it. They can manufacture grounds but it s hard to manufacture the numbers,  he said.  Odinga, meanwhile, accused the government of a mass sterilization campaign under the guise of giving tetanus vaccinations.   Hundreds of thousands of our girls and women between 14 and 49 will not have children because of state-sponsored sterilization sold to the country as tetanus vaccination,  Odinga said at a press conference.  Odinga cited Kenya s Lancet laboratories as one of his sources. But Dr Ahmed Kelebi, managing director of Lancet, said such claims were based on debunked misinterpretations of their data. After Odinga spoke, a founding member of his opposition alliance, Moses Wetangula, said the opposition would boycott the opening of parliament on Tuesday.   (Opposition) members of parliament from both houses will not attend the intended opening of the house because the president is a lame duck president,  Wetangula said.  He is enjoying temporary incumbency and has got no moral authority whatsoever to officially open parliament.  ",worldnews,"September 11, 2017 ",1

"Militant blast, gun attack kill 18 police in Egypt's Sinai","ISMAILIA, Egypt (Reuters) - Militants attacked a security convoy in Egypt s strife-torn Sinai Peninsula, killing at least 18 policemen in a blast and a gun battle on Monday, sources said - an assault claimed by Islamic State. The attackers detonated an improvised explosive device and managed to destroy three armored vehicles and a signal-jamming vehicle near Arish, the capital of North Sinai province, the security and medical sources said. The attack turned into a gunfight and the militants also opened fire on ambulance workers, injuring four, the sources told Reuters.  At least 18 policemen, two of them officers, died in the violence, and a brigadier general lost a leg in the blast, several sources at Arish hospital said. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement posted by its news agency Amaq. The Sunni Muslim militants are waging an insurgency in the rugged, thinly populated Sinai, aiming to topple the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.  Militants have killed hundreds of soldiers and police there since 2013, when the military, led by Sisi, ousted Egypt s Islamist president Mohamed Mursi after mass protests against his rule. At least 23 Egyptian soldiers were killed when suicide car bombs tore through two military checkpoints in North Sinai in July, in one of the bloodiest assaults on security forces in years. The Interior Ministry said several policemen were killed or injured in the attack, without giving figures. The prime minister s office called it a  traitorous incident .  Prime Minister Sherif Ismail affirmed the state s determination to fight these criminal actions that target the safety and will of citizens with its full force,  a government statement said. The United States strongly condemned the attack and said it would  continue to stand with Egypt as it confronts the threat from terrorism,  the State Department said.

"Russia, Jordan agree to speed de-escalation zone in south Syria","AMMAN (Reuters) - Jordan said on Monday it was working with Russia to roll out a plan to end fighting in southwestern Syria  in the fastest possible time  - part of a peace pact for the border area brokered by Amman, Moscow and Washington.  Jordan and Russia s foreign ministers met in Amman to discuss progress in setting up a  de-escalation zone  in the particularly sensitive region that includes Syrian territory neighboring Israel. Neither side gave details on any sticking points, but diplomats told Reuters they have included the final positions of fighting forces, U.S. unease about Russian involvement in policing the deal, and when to reopen a key border crossing. Russia, which backs Syria s government in the civil war, and the United States, which backs rebel forces seeking to topple President Bashar al-Assad, met secretly in Jordan in June and  announced a ceasefire in Syria s southwest a month later. The truce - the first peacemaking effort in the war by the U.S. government under President Donald Trump - has reduced fighting there and is meant to lead to a longer-lasting de-escalation, a step toward a full settlement more than six years into the complex war.  We expressed our support to resolve all issues relating to the de-escalation zones  performance,  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters in Amman.  The goal is to set up a de-escalation zone in the fastest possible time,  his Jordanian counterpart Ayman Safadi said.  Our priority is that our borders are secure and that means that there should be no Daesh nor Nusra nor sectarian militias,  Safadi added, referring to Islamic State and a rebel force once linked to Al Qaeda, both operating in Syria. An official and two senior diplomats told Reuters the powers have made progress in drawing up a map of the de-escalation zone, including Quneitra province bordering Israel, alongside the southern Deraa province adjoining Jordan. The official and diplomats said Washington had also secured an understanding with Moscow that militias backed by the Syrian government s ally Iran must be pushed 40 km (25 miles) from the border. That might help allay Israeli and Jordanian concerns about the presence of Lebanon s Iran-backed Hezbollah group in the area.  Diplomats said Lavrov also pressed Jordan to re-open its Nasib border crossing with Syria, something Amman has so far resisted, saying it needs more security. But it has strongly backed the broader de-escalation deal, seeing it as paving the way for an eventual return of tens of thousands of refugees in its territory. Rebels say the ceasefire remains fragile and fear Syria s army will return to attack them once it has consolidated gains in the north and other areas. Insurgents say the de-escalation zones merely free up Syria s army to make territorial gains elsewhere. Syria s army, supported by Russian air power and Iranian-backed militias, has in recent weeks gained a string of post along the border with Jordan in southeastern Syria, a zone that is outside the ceasefire area.

Turkey says U.S. indictment of former minister amounts to 'coup attempt',"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey said on Monday its former economy minister, indicted in the United States for conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran, acted within international law and that charges against him amounted to a coup attempt through American courts. Former minister Zafer Caglayan  has protected Turkey s interests as Turkish economy minister, and has acted within the laws of our country and international laws while doing that,  government spokesman Bekir Bozdag said. The charges against Caglayan were  a repetition of the December FETO coup attempt ... through the American judiciary , Bozdag said, referring to 2013 leaks about alleged government corruption which were blamed on President Tayyip Erdogan s opponents. Caglayan and the ex-head of a state-owned Turkish bank were charged on Wednesday with conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran by illegally moving hundreds of millions of dollars through the U.S. financial system on Tehran s behalf. [nL8N1LO4RO] The charges stem from the case against Reza Zarrab, a wealthy Turkish-Iranian gold trader who was arrested in the United States over sanctions evasion last year. He has pleaded not guilty. Wednesday s indictment marked the first time an ex-government member with close ties to Erdogan had been charged in the investigation that has strained ties between Washington and Ankara.  Erdogan said last week he had told Washington that Turkey had never agreed to comply with its sanctions on Iran, and called on the United States to review the indictment. Turkey s presidency said on Saturday Erdogan spoke by phone with U.S. President Donald Trump. It did not say whether the two leaders discussed the case.

UK's May needs parliament to back deal with N.Irish party - campaigner,"LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May must seek parliamentary approval for a billion-pound deal with a Northern Irish party that propped up her government after an inconclusive election, a legal campaigner quoted government lawyers as saying on Monday. After losing her majority at the June 8 election, May s Conservative Party secured the support of the small Democratic Unionist Party which allowed her to form a minority government. Northern Ireland would get 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) extra funding as part of the deal, the government said at the time. [nL8N1JN0LL] But, citing correspondence with government lawyers, campaigner Gina Miller, who defeated ministers in an earlier high-profile legal case over the process for triggering Britain s exit from the European Union, said the deal could not be executed without parliamentary approval.  Alongside a statement condemning the government for not making the need for parliamentary approval public, Miller released a letter from the government s legal department.  The agreement does not, and could not, involve the Government providing or committing itself to any provision of additional funds to Northern Ireland which would not be authorised under standard procedures, including the consent of Parliament,  the letter said. A spokesman from May s office said all government spending required parliamentary authorisation, and that its focus in Northern Ireland was on ending a political stalemate that has left it without a regional government for eight months. Any parliamentary vote would be expected to pass with the support of Conservative and DUP lawmakers, but could invite further unwelcome scrutiny of a deal which has been heavily criticised by political opponents.  The opposition Labour Party described it as a  bribe  and said the government needed to be clear about how it would be paid for. In January, Miller successfully challenged the government s plan to begin EU divorce proceedings without first seeking parliamentary approval. After a Supreme Court ruling sided with Miller in that case, May was forced to pass legislation through parliament. ",worldnews,"September 11, 2017 ",1
German foreign minister equates far-right AfD party with Nazis,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel on Monday equated the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party with the Nazis who ruled the country from 1933 to 1945, an insult rarely heard in national politics. In an interview with Internet provider t-online.de, Gabriel said many German voters were considering voting for the AfD in the Sept. 24 parliamentary election because they felt their concerns about migration, security and jobs were not being addressed. Founded in 2013 as an anti-European Union party, the AfD shifted its focus from the euro zone debt crisis to immigration after Chancellor Angela Merkel in 2015 opened the doors to over a million migrants, many fleeing war in the Middle East.  If we re unlucky, then these people will send a signal of dissatisfaction that will have terrible consequences. Then we will have real Nazis in the German Reichstag for the first time since the end of World War Two,  said Gabriel, a member of the Social Democrats, junior partners in the ruling coalition. The AfD declined to comment on Gabriel s remarks, which came after the Welt am Sonntag newspaper cited what it called a racist email reportedly written by Alice Weidel, a top AfD candidate, to a Frankfurt business associate in 2013. The German government was destroying society by allowing it to be overrun by  culturally foreign people such as Arabs, Sinti and Roma,  the newspaper quoted the email as saying. Weidel s spokesman Christian Lueth, writing on Twitter, dismissed the report as  fake news  aimed at keeping his party out of parliament. He told the Tagesspiegel newspaper that Weidel had assured him the email was not from her. Lueth declined to comment further when contacted by Reuters. Other parties also lined up to criticize the AfD, which polls show is on course to enter the national parliament for the first time after the election. The party has seats in 13 of 16 state legislatures. Bavarian state premier Horst Seehofer, head of the CSU sister party of Merkel s conservatives, dismissed the leaked email as a publicity-seeking  provocation  by the AfD that was best ignored. Justice Minister Heiko Maas, a member of Gabriel s SPD, said in an essay published in the Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper that parts of the AfD s program, including on religion, family and Europe, were unconstitutional. German prosecutors separately launched an investigation into remarks by another AfD official, Alexander Gauland, who said  Germany s integration minister should be  dumped  back to Turkey, her parents  country of origin. [nL2N1LS093] Christian Lindner, who heads the pro-business Free Democratic Party that is also poised to win seats in parliament, described the AfD as an anti-liberal and authoritarian party that was completely at odds with his own. Gabriel urged steps to reverse the AfD s gains in neglected communities and villages of the former communist East Germany.  We must change course and not only reimburse the cost of taking in migrants, but also give local communities the same amount on top so they can do more for their citizens,  he said. Merkel, whose CDU/CSU conservatives are leading the SPD by double digits in opinion polls, looks poised to win a fourth term. Both her camp and the Social Democrats have ruled out governing in coalition with the AfD. ",worldnews,"September 11, 2017 ",1
"U.N. rights boss sees possible ""crimes against humanity"" in Venezuela","GENEVA (Reuters) - The United Nations human rights chief said on Monday that Venezuelan security forces may have committed crimes against humanity against protesters and called for an international investigation. But Venezuela s foreign minister defended the record of the government of President Nicolas Maduro, rejecting the allegations as  baseless . Venezuela has been convulsed by months of demonstrations against the leftist president who critics say has plunged the oil-rich country into the worst economic crisis in its history and is turning it into a dictatorship.  My investigation suggests the possibility that crimes against humanity may have been committed, which can only be confirmed by a subsequent criminal investigation,  Zeid Ra ad al Hussein told the U.N. Human Rights Council. He said the government was using criminal proceedings against opposition leaders, arbitrary detentions, excessive use of force and ill-treatment of detainees, in some cases amounting to torture. Last month, Zeid s office said Venezuela s security forces had committed extensive and apparently deliberate human rights violations in crushing anti-government protests and that democracy was  barely alive .  There is a very real danger that tensions will further escalate, with the government crushing democratic institutions and critical voices,  Zeid said. The opposition, which boycotted the election for the Constituent Assembly, has accused electoral authorities of inflating turn-out figures for the July 30 vote. However, Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza told the Geneva forum:  We have now selected the National Constituent Assembly, this is the true expression of our citizens  will. It will have the powers to draw up a new Constitution.    The opposition in Venezuela is back on the path of rule of law and democracy, we will see dialogue emerging thanks to mediation of our friends,  he said. Arreaza accused protesters of using firearms and  home-made weapons  against security forces, but noted that the last death was on July 30.  Our country is now at peace,  he added. Venezuela is among the 47 members of the Council, where it enjoys strong support from Cuba, Iran and other states. Diego Arria, who was Venezuela s ambassador to the United Nations in New York from 1991 to 1994, told a separate Geneva event organized by activists and action group UN Watch that Venezuela should be referred to the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court.  I am convinced that the killing in the streets equates to crimes against humanity,  he said. The Hague-based court defines such crimes as including torture, murder, deprivation of liberty, sexual violence and persecution, he said.  Julieta Lopez, aunt of opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez who remains under house arrest after three years in a military jail, said abuses continued.  There is no right to express a different political opinion without being threatened, beaten or imprisoned,  she told the same event. ",worldnews,"September 11, 2017 ",1
"After financial pledges, France urges Chad to hold elections","PARIS (Reuters) - France on Monday urged Chadian authorities to press ahead with parliamentary elections after securing billions of dollars in pledges from donor countries aimed at helping to revive the country s struggling economy. President Idriss Deby, who was re-elected in 2016 after gaining power in 1990 at the head of an armed rebellion, said in February that lack of financial resources meant Chad s parliamentary elections would be postponed indefinitely.  The legislative elections are an important moment in democratic life,  French foreign ministry spokeswoman Agnes Romatet-Espagne told reporters in a daily briefing.  We hope in this regard that the Chadian authorities ... will be in a position to announce a calendar (for elections) soon.   In a statement on Friday, Chad s government said it had secured about $18.5 billion in pledges for a 2017-2021 national development program, double its original expectations. Romatet-Espagne said France would contribute 223 million euros ($267.27 million).  The former French colony, one of the poorest nations in the world, has been rocked by humanitarian crises over the past decade, including conflicts in the east and south, drought in the arid Sahel region and flooding.  That has been compounded since 2012 by instability on its borders with Libya, Nigeria and Central African Republic, forcing Chad to increase its security budget to handle thousands of refugees and counter a growing cross-border threat. Its economy has especially been hit by a more than 50 percent drop in the price of oil, which represent three-quarters of its revenues. However, critics say too much of its revenues goes to the army.  Military spending has helped Chad intervene in the Central African Republic, Mali, in neighboring countries threatened by Boko Haram and as far afield as the Saudi Arabia-led coalition to fight Houthi combatants in Yemen,  International Crisis Group analyst Richard Moncrieff said in a note on Sept. 8.  This engagement has strengthened relations with Western powers and brought substantial financial and political support. The EU, France and the U.S. in particular today consider Deby as their principal partner in the fight against terrorism in the Sahel. For Deby it is win-win: tackle domestic armed opposition, pay his troops and gain significant leverage over donors.  The headquarters of France s 4,000-strong counter-terrorism Barkhane force is in the Chadian capital N djamena. Asked at Science Po university on Sept. 6 whether France s policy in West Africa was still based on  Francafrique , Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian sought to play down that perception.  We no longer talk about Francafrique but AfricaFrance,   Le Drian said.  France does not support corrupt (leaders), but on the contrary there are presidents who have been elected by universal suffrage - you mentioned some of them (Deby and Niger President Mahamadou Issoufou) - and whose elections were not contested, and that is the reality.      Franceafrique describes an informal web of relationships Paris has maintained with its former African colonies and its support, sometimes in the form of military backing, for politicians who favor French business interests.

Spanish Red Cross physiotherapist killed in Afghanistan,"MAZAR-I-SHARIF, Afghanistan (Reuters) - A Spanish physiotherapist working for the Red Cross in the northern Afghan city of Mazar-i-Sharif was shot dead on Monday, apparently by a hospital patient, officials said. Police said two arrests had been made and an investigation was underway. The International Committee of the Red Cross said Lorena Enebral Perez, 38, was killed in its orthopedic rehabilitation center in Mazar-i-Sharif.   Energetic and full of laughter, Lorena was the heart of our office in Mazar. Today, our hearts are broken,  said the ICRC s head of delegation in Afghanistan, Monica Zanarelli. Perez s work in Afghanistan involved helped people, including children, who had lost legs or arms, mostly in the war, to learn to walk again or feed themselves.    Sheer Jan Durani, a spokesman for the police chief in Balkh province, said two patients were admitted to hospital and one took out a pistol apparently concealed in a wheelchair and shot the woman. Both men were arrested, he said. Afghanistan is one of the most dangerous countries in the world for aid workers, with groups including the ICRC often facing attacks on their staff, both Afghan and foreign. Perez s death followed the killing in February of six ICRC staff in northern Afghanistan in an attack in which two other Afghan employees were abducted. The kidnapped Afghan staff were released six days ago, the ICRC statement said. The ICRC has seven rehabilitation centers in Afghanistan that manufacture more than 19,000 artificial limbs per year and treat hundreds of thousands of patients. ",worldnews,"September 11, 2017 ",1
"British child sex-abuser, 102, sentenced for crimes from 1970s","LONDON (Reuters) - A 102-year-old man given a suspended sentence on Monday for sexually abusing a girl in the 1970s is thought to be the oldest person convicted of a crime in Britain, prosecutors said. Douglas Hammersley was given a two-year suspended sentence after pleading guilty to three counts of indecent assault. The Crown Prosecution Service said the incidents took place in the Buckinghamshire area, to the west of London, when the victim was between five and eight years old.      We were able to prosecute Hammersley thanks to the victim coming forward, even though the offences were committed more than four decades ago,  said Jennie Laskar-Hall, senior prosecutor for the CPS. In December, a 101-year-old man was jailed for 13 years for a string of historical sex crimes against two young sisters and their brother. Police said he was the oldest person to have been found guilty of a crime in British legal history. ",worldnews,"September 11, 2017 ",1
Saakashvili plans to unite Ukraine opposition against president,"LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - A day after forcing his way past border guards back into Ukraine, former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili said he would unite the opposition against his former ally President Petro Poroshenko and planned to campaign for support. Saakashvili wants to unseat Poroshenko at the next election, accusing the president of reneging on promises to root out corruption and carry out reforms made during the 2014 Maidan protests, which ousted a pro-Kremlin leader.  At present it seems unlikely that Saakashvili, who studied in Ukraine and speaks fluent Ukrainian, will come to power. His Ukrainian citizenship, bestowed by Poroshenko when he made him governor of Odessa in 2015, has been withdrawn, and polls show little support for his party, the Movement of New Forces.  I am fighting against rampant corruption, against the fact that oligarchs are in full control of Ukraine again, against the fact that Maidan has been betrayed,  Saakashvili said at a press conference in the city of Lviv. Saakashvili divides opinion. Supporters see him as a fearless crusader against corruption but critics say there is little substance behind his blustery rhetoric.  Back home in Georgia, his time in office was tarnished by what critics said was his monopolizing power and exerting pressure on the judiciary. He was president at the time of a disastrous five-day war with Russia in 2008, a conflict that his critics argued was the result of his own miscalculations.   Saakashvili says he does not covet the presidency himself and wants to promote a new, younger politician to the post. But while perhaps not a threat as a direct rival, Saakashvili could prove to be an effective weapon against Poroshenko for powerful opposition figures like Yulia Tymoshenko, who was with him at the border on Sunday. Poroshenko trails in the polls behind Tymoshenko, a former prime minister and leader of one of Ukraine s largest opposition parties.     This is a marriage of convenience between Tymoshenko and Saakashvili, but the parties have different interests,  said political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko.  She tries to use this situation with the hope that this will provoke a political crisis in Ukraine and lead to early elections.  Saakashvili s relationship with Poroshenko dates back nearly three decades to when they were students at the same university in Kiev and their shared opposition to the Kremlin later brought them together as politicians. But a bitter spat erupted in November 2016, a year after Poroshenko invited Saakashvili to be the governor of the region of Odessa to help drive reforms. The latter quit, accusing Poroshenko of abetting corruption and turned into one of his loudest critics.  Meanwhile Poroshenko s office said Saakashvili had failed to deliver change as governor and said his Ukrainian citizenship was withdrawn because he allegedly put false information on his registration form. Saakashvili says the decision was politically motivated. It left him effectively stateless as Georgia has also withdrawn his citizenship. On Sunday evening Saakashvili and his supporters forced their way past a cordon of border guards to return to Ukraine from Poland.   It does not matter who violates the state border - invaders in the East or politicians in the West. There always must be legal responsibility,  Poroshenko said in televised remarks on Monday.  The president said Saakashvili should have used Ukrainian courts to challenge the revocation.  Now this is a matter of law enforcement agencies and they have begun to act,  Poroshenko said.   Saakashvili said he would travel to all regions of Ukraine to unite  different political forces around a common theme that we must have a democracy and we should not let oligarchs hold sway.  Ukraine s record of implementing reforms has been patchy since Poroshenko took office in 2014.  Reformist lawmaker Mustafa Nayyem, one of the faces of the Maidan protests and a member of Poroshenko s faction in parliament, traveled with Saakashvili on Sunday and accused the Kiev authorities of trying to silence opponents.   We didn t want this country when we stayed on Maidan,  he told reporters.  We wanted a country in which opponents, political opponents, have a right to say what they want.  Saakashvili may yet face arrest. Police have launched a criminal investigation into Sunday s incident, while General Prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko said those who crossed the border illegally would be prosecuted.  Kiev could leave Saakashvili alone, arrest him and possibly extradite him to Georgia. Saakashvili took power in Georgia after a peaceful uprising, known as the Rose Revolution, in 2003. The 49-year-old is now wanted on criminal charges in Georgia, which he says were trumped up for political reasons. ",worldnews,"September 11, 2017 ",1
Afghanistan will never again be militant sanctuary: U.S. ambassador,"KABUL (Reuters) - The U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan said on Monday Washington would never allow militants to use the country as a sanctuary, as American and allied troops in Kabul commemorated the Sept. 11 attacks. U.S. President Donald Trump in August committed nearly 4,000 additional troops to Afghanistan as part of an open-ended campaign against Taliban insurgents who have made advances in recent years. A U.S. led intervention sparked by the Sept. 11 attacks toppled the Taliban government in 2001. Since then more than 2,400 American troops and more than 1,000 international allies have died in Afghanistan.  Today we remember how this conflict began but let us also remember how this must end, with Afghanistan never again serving as an ungoverned space, sanctuary or base for those who are bent on attacking us and our allies,  ambassador Hugo Llorens told a crowd of soldiers at the NATO coalition s headquarters in Kabul.  The United states would also  completely annihilate  Islamic State militants in the region, Llorens said. The Taliban on Monday claimed responsibility for a suicide car bombing that wounded several NATO troops and Afghan civilians in a province north Kabul. ",worldnews,"September 11, 2017 ",1

Pakistan PM warns U.S. sanctions would be counter-productive,"ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan s Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi said it would be counter-productive for the United States to sanction Pakistani officials or further cut military assistance, warning it would hurt both countries  fight against militancy. U.S.-Pakistan relations have frayed since President Donald Trump last month set out a new Afghanistan policy and lashed out at nuclear-armed Pakistan as a fickle ally that gives safe haven to  agents of chaos  by harboring the Afghan Taliban and other militants. The United States has already begun conditioning future aid to Pakistan on progress Islamabad makes in tackling the Haqqani network militants who it alleges are Pakistan-based and have helped the Taliban carry out deadly attacks inside Afghanistan. Pakistan denies hosting militant sanctuaries, and Islamabad bristles at claims it has not done enough to tackle militancy, noting it has borne the brunt of violence in the so-called war on terror, suffering more than 60,000 casualties since 2001. Former petroleum minister Abbasi, 58, who was installed as prime minister last month after the Supreme Court ousted veteran premier Nawaz Sharif over undeclared income, told Reuters that any targeted sanctions by Washington against Pakistani military and intelligence officials would not help U.S. counter-terrorism efforts.  We are fighting the war against terror, anything that degrades our effort will only hurt the U.S. effort,  Abbasi said in an interview in Islamabad on Monday.  What does it achieve?  U.S. officials privately say the targeted sanctions would be aimed at Pakistani officials with ties to extremist groups and are part of an array of options being discussed to pressure Pakistan to change its behavior, including further aid cuts. Washington s civilian and military assistance to Pakistan was less than $1 billion in 2016, down from a recent peak of $3.5 billion in 2011, and Abbasi warned that Washington will not achieve its counter-terrorism aims by starving Pakistan of funds.  If the military aid cuts degrade our effort to fight war on terror, who does it help?  he said.  Whatever needs to be done here, it needs to be a cooperative effort.  Abbasi said one practical side-effect of military aid cuts and U.S. Congress blocking the sale of subsidized F-16 fighter jets to Pakistan will be to force Islamabad to buy weapons from China and Russia.  We ve had to look at other options to maintain our national defensive forces,  he said. The Trump administration s tougher stance is seen as pushing Islamabad closer to Beijing, which has pledged about $60 billion in roads, rail and power infrastructure in Pakistan as part of its ambitious Belt and Road initiative to build vast land and sea trade routes linking Asia with Europe and Africa.  We have a major economic relationship with (China), we have a major military relationship since the 1960s, so that s definitely one of our options,  he said. Abbasi said it was  unfair  to blame Pakistan for all the troubles in Afghanistan, saying Washington should show more appreciation for Pakistan s losses from militancy and its role in hosting 3.5 million Afghan refugees. He added that Afghan-based militants have also launched cross-border attacks on civilians and military in Pakistan, prompting Pakistan to begin investing  several billion dollars  to fence the disputed and porous 2,500 km (1,500 mile) border.  We intend to fence the whole border to control that situation,  Abbasi added. Abbasi, a skydiving enthusiast and co-founder of a budget airline, also faces growing headwinds on the economy ahead of a general election, likely in mid-2018. Growth in Pakistan s $300 billion economy surged to 5.3 percent in 2016-17, its fastest pace in a decade, but the macro-economic outlook has deteriorated, stoking concerns Pakistan may need an International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout, as it did in 2013, to avert another balance of payments crisis. Foreign currency reserves have dwindled by almost a quarter to $14.7 billion since last October, while the 2016-17 current account deficit has more than doubled to $12.1 billion. Abbasi said Islamabad was looking at a raft of measures to alleviate current account pressures to avoid going back to the IMF, including reducing imports of luxury goods, boosting exports, and possibly devaluing its currency. Finance Minister Ishaq Dar is a staunch opponent of a weaker rupee - whose level against the dollar is effectively controlled by the central bank - but Abbasi said it had been discussed.  There are pros and cons to devaluation, but that could be a decision we take,  he said, adding that any devaluation would not be drastic, and  today, it s not on the table yet.  Abbasi, who has hinted his former boss remains the power behind the throne by repeatedly calling him  the people s prime minister , said the three-time premier remains hugely popular despite his disqualification by the Supreme Court on July 28.  Politics is not decided in courts,  said Abbasi, who was jailed along with Sharif after the 1999 military coup.  Politically, Nawaz Sharif is stronger today than he was on July 28.  Abbasi is also pushing ahead with a wide-ranging tax reform agenda before the elections - a tough task in a nation that has one of the world s lowest tax-to-GDP ratios and where tax evasion is rampant and often culturally acceptable. The ruling PML-N party is looking for cross-party support for the reforms, but Abbasi said radical changes would require an integrated approach, including building confidence among tax payers, reducing income taxes and making it less attractive to invest in a real estate sector that attracts black money.  You not only need to have a stick, you need to have a carrot also,  he said. ",worldnews,"September 11, 2017 ",1
U.N. brands Myanmar violence a 'textbook' example of ethnic cleansing,"GENEVA/SHAMLAPUR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - The United Nations  top human rights official on Monday slammed Myanmar for conducting a  cruel military operation  against Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine state, branding it  a textbook example of ethnic cleansing . Zeid Ra ad al-Hussein s comments to the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva came as the official tally of Rohingya who have fled Myanmar and crossed into southern Bangladesh in just over two weeks soared through 300,000. The surge of refugees - many sick or wounded - has strained the resources of aid agencies already helping hundreds of thousands from previous spasms of bloodletting in Myanmar.  We have received multiple reports and satellite imagery of security forces and local militia burning Rohingya villages, and consistent accounts of extrajudicial killings, including shooting fleeing civilians,  Zeid said.  I call on the government to end its current cruel military operation, with accountability for all violations that have occurred, and to reverse the pattern of severe and widespread discrimination against the Rohingya population,  he added.  The situation seems a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.  Attacks by Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) militants on police posts and an army base in the northwestern state of Rakhine on Aug. 25 provoked a military counter-offensive. Myanmar says its security forces are carrying out clearance operations to defend against ARSA, which the government has declared a terrorist organization. Myanmar on Sunday rebuffed a ceasefire declared by ARSA to enable the delivery of aid to thousands of displaced and hungry people in the north of Rakhine state, declaring simply that it did not negotiate with terrorists. Human rights monitors and fleeing Rohingya accuse the army and Rakhine Buddhist vigilantes of mounting a campaign of arson aimed at driving out the Rohingya. The government of Myanmar, a majority Buddhist country where the roughly one million Muslim Rohingya are marginalized, has  repeatedly rejected charges of  ethnic cleansing . Officials have blamed insurgents and Rohingya themselves for burning villages to draw global attention to their cause. Zeid said Myanmar should  stop pretending  that Rohingya were torching their own houses and its  complete denial of reality  was damaging the government s international standing. Western critics have accused Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi of failing to speak out for the Rohingya, who are despised by many in the country as illegal migrants from Bangladesh. Some have called for the Nobel Peace Prize Suu Kyi won in 1991 as a champion of democracy to be revoked. Monday s estimate of new arrivals in the Cox s Bazar region of Bangladesh since Aug. 25 was 313,000, an increase of 19,000 in just 24 hours.  Large numbers of people are still arriving every day in densely packed sites, looking for space, and there are clear signs that more will cross before the situation stabilises,  the International Organization for Migration said in a statement.  New arrivals in all locations are in urgent need of life-saving assistance, including food, water and sanitation, health and protection.  Thousands of Rohingya refugees are still stranded on the Myanmar side of the River Naf, which separates the two countries, with the biggest gathering south of the town of Maungdaw, monitors and sources in the area told Reuters. About 500 houses south of the town were set on fire on Monday, a villager in the Maungdaw region, Aung Lin, told Reuters by telephone.    We were all running way because the army was firing on our village,  he said.  A lot of people carrying bags are now in the rice fields.   Reuters journalists in Cox s Bazar could see huge blazes and plumes of smokes on the other side.  Those still waiting to cross into Bangladesh - many hungry and exhausted after a days-long march through the mountains and bushes in monsoon rain - have been stopped because of a crackdown on Bangladeshi boatmen charging 10,000 taka ($122) or more per person, sources said. Arshad Zamman, 60, said his family had only 80,000 Burmese kyat ($60) and so he had taken a boat to Cox s Bazar on his own and would return to pick up his wife and two sons when he had enough for their journey.  I will try to find money here. I will beg and hopefully some people will help me,  he said. Elsewhere in Myanmar, communal tension appeared to be rising after more than two weeks of violence in Rakhine state. A mob of about 70 people armed with sticks and swords threatened to attack a mosque in the central town of Taung Dwin Gyi on Sunday evening, shouting,  This is our country, this is our land , according to the mosque s imam, Mufti Sunlaiman.  We shut down the lights in the mosque and sneaked out,  the mufti, who was in the mosque at the time, told Reuters by phone. The government said in a statement the mob dispersed after police with riot shields fired rubber bullets. Rumors have spread on social media that Muslims, who make up represent about 4.3 percent of a population of 51.4 million, would stage attacks on Sept. 11 to avenge violence against the Rohingya.  Tensions between Buddhists and Muslims have simmered since scores were killed and tens of thousands displaced in communal clashes accompanying the onset of Myanmar s democratic transition in 2012 and 2013.

"Bangladesh seeks support to move fleeing Rohingya to remote, flood-prone island","DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh is seeking international support for its plan to relocate Rohingya Muslims fleeing violence in Myanmar to a remote Bay of Bengal island that critics say is flood-prone and unlivable. More than 300,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh from Buddhist-majority Myanmar since the latest violence began on Aug. 25, joining more than 400,000 others already living there in cramped makeshift camps. The United Nations  top human rights official on Monday slammed Myanmar for conducting a  cruel military operation  against the Rohingya, branding it  a textbook example of ethnic cleansing .  This is creating a huge challenge for Bangladesh in terms of providing shelter as well as other humanitarian assistance to them,  Bangladesh s foreign ministry said in a statement on Monday as Foreign Minister Abul Hassan Mahmood Ali held talks with diplomats. He urged the international community to push Myanmar to find a  permanent solution to this crisis  and  sought support for transportation of the Rohingya to Bhashan Char , also known as Thengar Char. Bangladesh, one of the world s poorest and most crowded nations, plans to develop Thengar Char, which only emerged from the silt off Bangladesh s delta coast 11 years ago and is two hours by boat from the nearest settlement.  It regularly floods during June-September monsoons and, when seas are calm, pirates roam the nearby waters to kidnap fishermen for ransom. The plan to develop the island and use it to house refugees was criticized by humanitarian workers when it was proposed in 2015 and revived last year. Bangladesh, though, insists it alone has the right to decide where to shelter the growing numbers of refugees. ",worldnews,"September 11, 2017 ",1

Merkel also welcomed Russia s proposal of deploying U.N. peacekeepers to address the Ukraine crisis, but stressed that the proposed mandate needed to be expanded, Seibert said.

German women ask Merkel for more support after vote,"BERLIN (Reuters) - A group of German women s organizations wrote to Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday demanding more support for their goals of equal participation, equal pay and better monitoring of gender policies after the Sept. 24 election. Merkel was elected as Germany s first female chancellor in 2005, helped by strong support from women voters, but the leader of the conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) has not made fighting for equal rights a major priority.   Women in Germany have moderated their demands for long enough and repeatedly accepted compromises. Without notable progress,  wrote the 17 groups representing 12.5 million women in professions ranging from medicine to law and engineering.  Now, new, binding milestones with clear targets need to be defined and achieved.  Opinion polls show that Merkel should easily win a fourth term, with women still more likely to vote for the CDU than the SPD, and far more likely to support Merkel   on 60 percent   than her SPD challenger Martin Schulz   on just 20 percent. Merkel was initially opposed to quotas, but her government  has introduced a requirement for women to hold 30 percent of seats on non-executive company boards after it was championed by her junior coalition partners, the center-left Social Democrats. Beyond that, however, progress at boosting female representation in both business and politics has been slow. None of Germany s top 30 listed companies has a female CEO and women hold only 7 percent of executive positions in the 160 biggest listed firms, up from 6 percent in 2016. Meanwhile, the percentage of women in the German parliament is expected to fall to 32 percent from a current 36.5 percent after the election due to the likely entry of the male-dominated Free Democrats and Alternative fuer Deutschland (AfD). Merkel says she wants half her new cabinet to be female, compared to seven out of 16 posts now, although that will depend on which party she shares power with. She has also warned firms they face tougher regulation if they do not promote more women. The women s groups said they welcomed Merkel s desire for an equal cabinet and for more women in business, but said more was needed to improve participation and equal pay.  The example of the mandatory gender quota for supervisory boards of large companies shows that legal targets are needed to speed up the necessary processes of change and a switch in role models in business and society,  the letter to Merkel said.

"Irma severely damages Cuban sugar industry, crop: state media","HAVANA (Reuters) - Hurricane Irma seriously damaged Cuba s already dilapidated sugar industry and flooded and flattened an extensive area of sugar cane, state-run media reported on Monday.  Some 300,000 hectares (740,000 acres) of cane were affected to different degrees,  Liobel Perez, spokesman for AZCUBA, the state sugar monopoly, was quoted as stating. He said 40 percent of the country s mills were also damaged, as were warehouses and other parts of the industry s infrastructure. Despite a steep decline in output over the last 15 years, the industry remains one of the country s most important in terms of employment and export earnings. The sugar harvest was scheduled to begin in November. The monster storm spent three days traversing most of the island s northern coast, from east to west, with particular force in the sugar-producing provinces of central Cuba, before heading north to Florida on Sunday. Officials have just begun to assess the damage, so the report was preliminary.  Cuba produced 1.8 million tonnes of sugar during the 2016-2017 season. ",worldnews,"September 11, 2017 ",1
Polish legal experts say Poland can demand German reparations,"WARSAW (Reuters) - Polish parliamentary legal experts ruled on Monday that Warsaw has the right to demand reparations from Germany for its actions in the country during World War Two, although Poland s foreign minister indicated that no immediate claim would be made. The issue of reparations, revived by Poland s eurosceptic ruling party Law and Justice (PiS) after decades of improving relations with Germany, could escalate tensions between the two European Union governments. In a non-binding ruling, the experts said a decision by Poland s communist authorities in the 1950s to relinquish all claims against Germany over damages caused by its invasion and occupation of much of Poland was unconstitutional and invalid.  (The communist government) was forced into this by the Soviet Union, and Poland was not a sovereign state at the time,  said Arkadiusz Mularczyk, a PiS deputy who had commissioned the study.  Poland has a legal basis to demand reparations.  The PiS government   deeply distrustful of Germany   has raised calls for wartime compensation in recent weeks but it has yet to officially demand reparations. Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski said on Monday that discussions on the issue  may not yield the appropriate result .  But they should take place to inform the German side about the enormity of destruction it has caused,  he told public broadcaster TVP1. Waszczykowski added further analysis was needed before any claims were lodged.   Six million Poles, including three million Polish Jews, were killed during the war, and the capital Warsaw was razed to the ground in 1944 after a failed uprising in which 200,000 civilians died. Relations between Germany and Poland had warmed following the 1989 collapse of communism, particularly under the previous centrist government in Warsaw. But they have sunk to a decade low since the nationalist-leaning PiS won a parliamentary election in 2015. It says Berlin wields too much influence within the EU. PiS also frequently invokes Poland s suffering under the German occupation as part of a broader effort it says aims to promote patriotism at home, and to counter accusations that some Poles were also perpetrators of wartime crimes against the Jews. Under communism, Poles were taught to believe that, with a few exceptions, the nation had conducted itself honorably during a war that killed a fifth of the Polish population.  But a series of books and films have questioned this self-image in recent years, opening a painful debate over collective guilt and reconciliation. German parliamentary legal experts said last month that Warsaw had no right to demand reparations.     ",worldnews,"September 11, 2017 ",1
U.N. nuclear watchdog chief says Iran playing by the rules,"VIENNA (Reuters) - The head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog said on Monday Iran was abiding by the rules set out in a nuclear accord it signed with six world powers in 2015, after Washington suggested it was not adhering to the deal. The State Department must notify Congress every 90 days of Iran s compliance with the deal. The next deadline is October and U.S. President Donald Trump has said he thinks by then the United States will declare Iran non-compliant. Yukiya Amano, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said Iran had not broken any promises and was not receiving special treatment.  The nuclear-related commitments undertaken by Iran under the (deal) are being implemented,  he said in the text of a speech to a quarterly meeting of the IAEA s 35-member Board of Governors.  Most sanctions on Iran were lifted 18 months ago under the deal and, despite overstepping a limit on its stocks of one chemical, it has adhered to the key limitations imposed on it. In April, Trump ordered a review of whether a suspension of sanctions on Iran related to the nuclear deal, negotiated under President Barack Obama, was in the U.S. national security interest. He has called it  the worst deal ever negotiated.  The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, traveled to Vienna last month to speak with Amano about Iran and asked if the IAEA planned to inspect Iranian military sites, something she has called for. Iran dismissed the U.S. demand as  merely a dream . Amano declined to comment on Haley s statements when asked by reporters. Iran has been applying an Additional Protocol, which is in force in dozens of nations and gives the IAEA access to sites, including military locations, to clarify questions or inconsistencies that may arise.  We will continue to implement the Additional Protocol in Iran ... as we do in other countries,  Amano said, referring to so-called complementary access visits granted under the protocol, details of which Amano said were confidential.  I cannot tell you how many complementary accesses we have had, but I can tell you ... that we have had access to locations more frequently than many other countries with extensive nuclear programs.  He called verification measures in Iran  the most robust regime  currently in existence. In addition, the IAEA can request access to Iranian sites including military ones if it has concerns about activities or materials there that would violate the agreement, but it must show Iran the basis for those concerns. That means new and credible information pointing to such a violation is required first, officials from the agency and major powers say. There is no indication that Washington has presented such information. ",worldnews,"September 11, 2017 ",1
Azeri court releases head of independent Azeri news agency,"BAKU (Reuters) - An Azeri court on Monday released the director of an independent news agency from pre-trial detention but said an investigation of him can continue, in a case condemned by human rights activists.

"Tribal clashes, political void threaten oil installations in Iraq's south","BASRA/BAGHDAD, Iraq (Reuters) - Worsening clashes among tribes and a political void is threatening security at oil installations in Iraq s main southern oil producing region, officials and security sources said. Iraq has concentrated security forces in the north and west of the OPEC oil producer in the biggest campaign since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 to retake territory lost to the Sunni extremist group Islamic State in 2014. That has created a void in the south, home to Iraq s biggest oilfields, where fighting between rival Shi ite Muslim tribes over farmland, state construction contracts and land ownership has worsened in the past few weeks. The surge in violence risks undermining government plans to lure new investment to the oil and gas sector it needs to revive an economy hit by a surge in security spending and destruction by Islamic State. Stability in Basra, the main southern city at the edge of the Gulf, is of vital importance as a hub for oil exports accounting for over 95 percent of government revenues. Officials said tribal clashes had not affected oil output yet. But this could change as recent fighting with mortars and machine guns had come close to the key West Qurna oil phase 1, West Qurna phase 2 and Majnoon oilfields north of Basra city.  Tribal feuds have been exacerbating recently and such a negative development could threaten the operations of the foreign energy companies,  said Ali Shaddad, head of the oil and gas committee in Basra s provincial council. State-run South Oil Co. (SOC) said the violence had started scaring oil workers and foreign contractors who in some cases had refused to move drilling rigs over security concerns.  Tribal fighting near oilfields sites is definitely affecting the energy operations and sending a negative message to foreign oil firms,  Abdullah al-Faris, a media manager at SOC, said. Iraq s government has dispatched thousands of soldiers and policemen into Basra which had been like the rest of the mainly Shi ite south relatively peaceful since 2003. Security force have tried to disarm tribesmen, which had seized large caches of light and heavy weapons from Saddam Hussein s army in the chaos following the 2003 invasion. But security officials said forces were stretched as troops were preparing another offensive against Islamic State, or Daesh, in the north to retake Hawija town. Strategically located east of the road from Baghdad to Mosul and near the Kurdish-held oil region of Kirkuk, Hawija fell to Islamic State in 2014.  We need larger forces to control rural areas and restrain lawless tribes in the south,  said Army Lieutenant Colonel Salah Kareem who serves in a brigade that was based in Basra before being moved to Mosul.  This is a difficult job for now as most troops are busy with fighting Daesh,  he said. The security challenges have been worsened by a political void after top local officials quit over graft charges. Basra s governor Majid al-Nasrawi stepped down last month and left for Iran after Iraq s anti-corruption body began investigating graft allegations against him. In July the head of the provincial council, Sabah al-Bazoni, was arrested and sacked after the watchdog accused him of taking bribes and misuse of power. Graft has been a major concern in Iraq but analysts say both men had also been caught in a political battle as parties from the country s Shi ite majority were gearing up for national elections in April 2018. Basra is seen as the ultimate prize given its oil wealth and investment potential. Bazoni, who belongs to former prime minister Nuri al-Maliki s State of Law coalition, had been at odds with Nasrawi from the Shi ite Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq over managing the province and distributing contracts for basic services and rebuilding infrastructure in Basra. Disagreements over how to award state contracts had escalated with each party publishing files alleging corruption against the other rivals, two Basra politicians said on condition of anonymity.  For some political parties having the upper hand in Basra is a key objective to expand their power,  said Baghdad-based analyst Jasim al-Bahadli, an expert on Shi ite armed groups.  Basra is forming the triangle of money, power and influence,  he said.  Two officials working with foreign oil companies operating in the south said the departure of top officials raised worries that the tribal clashes could get worse.  We need to see security challenges addressed to avoid working in a difficult operating environment,  said one official working at a foreign oil firm in Basra, asking not to be named.

"After Russia, Iran seeks deal for long-term Syria garrison: Israel","HERZLIYA, Israel (Reuters) - The Israeli intelligence minister said on Monday that President Bashar al-Assad was ready to permit Iran to set up military bases in Syria that would pose a long-term threat to neighboring Israel. While formally neutral on the six-year-old Syrian civil war, Israel worries that Assad s recent gains have given his Iranian and Lebanese Hezbollah allies a foothold on its northern front. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has lobbied Russia, Assad s most powerful backer, and the United States to curb the Iranian presence in Syria   as well as hinting that Israel could launch preemptive strikes against its arch-foe there. In July, Moscow ratified a deal under which Damascus allowed the Russian air base in Syria s Latakia Province to remain for almost half a century. Israeli Intelligence Minister Israel Katz said Iran could soon gain similar rights.  In these very days, Assad and Iran are nearing the signing of a long-term agreement that would anchor Iran s military presence in Syria, resembling the agreement that was signed between Assad and the Russians,  Katz told a security conference hosted by IDC Herzliya, a university near Tel Aviv.   The significance in terms of the danger and the threat against Israel - and not just against Israel, but also many countries in the region - is of the utmost clarity.   Katz did not elaborate on the source of his information or give any further details about the purported negotiations. The Iranian Foreign Ministry declined to comment and Syrian officials could not be reached. Katz said the plan was for an Iranian naval port, bases for Iran s air and ground forces, and  tens of thousands of Shiite militiamen being brought in from various countries  to fight alongside their Iranian and Hezbollah co-religionists in Syria. Iran s presence in Syria, and efforts to bolster Hezbollah in Lebanon, are expected to feature in Netanyahu s address to the United Nations General Assembly on Sept. 19.

More Germans detained in Turkey: German foreign ministry,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Another German couple is believed to have been detained in Turkey this weekend and one of the individuals remains in police custody, while the other has been barred from leaving the country, a German foreign ministry spokesman said on Monday. Spokesman Martin Schaefer told a news conference that Germany had no official information on the arrests that occurred on Sunday in Istanbul, but said the random nature of continued detentions by Ankara was cause for  the utmost concern .  The nightmare continues that is facing so many German citizens who wanted to do nothing but spend their vacation in Turkey,  said Schaefer.  It can hit anyone who thinks about entering Turkey. One doesn t believe oneself to be in danger, but suddenly one is in a Turkish prison.  Schaefer said those traveling to Turkey should be aware of the potential dangers, but said Berlin had no immediate plans to issue a formal travel warning.  We will not be drawn into using travel guidance in a political manner,  Schaefer said, adding that continued random arrests by Turkey of German citizens could force Berlin to issue such a warning. That would put Turkey on a par with Libya, Yemen or Syria, he added. The foreign ministry has urged German citizens since July 26 to exercise caution when traveling to Turkey. Before Monday s news of additional arrests, 10 Germans were in detention in Turkey, including German-Turkish journalist Deniz Yucel, who has been held for over 200 days. Schaefer downplayed the relevance of Turkey s warning on Saturday that its citizens should take care when traveling to Germany, saying the warning had  nothing to do with the reality  of 80 million German citizens and ethnic Turks living here. EU Commissioner Guenther Oettinger, in separate remarks, rejected calls for breaking off discussions with Ankara about its accession to the European Union, saying such a move would only strengthen President Tayyip Erdogan, who is under fire from Brussels over his crackdown on opponents after a failed coup. Last week German Chancellor Angela Merkel, expected to win a fourth term in the Sept. 24 election, infuriated Erdogan s government when she called for a formal halt to Turkey s stalled EU accession talks. Later she conceded that such a move would have to be decided unanimously by the EU. Tensions between Berlin and Ankara have been running high for more than a year, fueled in part by conflicts over lawmaker visits to German troops stationed in Turkey and Ankara s crackdown on alleged supporters of last year s coup.

Caribbean faces hard road to recovery after Irma's ravages,"VARADERO, Cuba (Reuters) - From Cuba to Antigua, Caribbean islanders began counting the cost of Hurricane Irma on Sunday after the brutal storm left a trail of death, destruction and chaos from which the tourist-dependent region could take years to recover. The Category 5 storm, which killed at least 28 people across the region, devastated housing, power supplies and communications, leaving some small islands almost cut off from the world. European nations sent military reinforcements to keep order amid looting, while the damage was expected to total billions of dollars. Ex-pat billionaires and poor islanders alike were forced to take cover as Irma tore roofs off buildings, flipped cars and killed livestock, raging from the Leeward Islands across Puerto Rico and Hispaniola then into Cuba before turning on Florida. Waves of up to 36 feet (11 meters) smashed businesses along the Cuban capital Havana s sea-side drive on Sunday morning. Further east, high winds whipped Varadero, the island s most important tourist resort.  It s a complete disaster and it will take a great deal of work to get Varadero back on its feet,  said Osmel de Armas, 53, an aquatic photographer who works on the beach at the battered resort.  Sea-front hotels were evacuated in Havana and relief workers spent the night rescuing people from homes in the city center as the sea penetrated to historic depths in the flood-prone area. U.S President Donald Trump issued a disaster declaration on Sunday for Puerto Rico, where Irma killed at least 3 people and left hundreds of thousands without electricity. Trump also expanded federal funds available to the U.S. Virgin Islands, which suffered extensive damage to homes and infrastructure. Further east in the Caribbean, battered islands such as St. Martin and Barbuda were taking stock of the damage as people began emerging from shelters to scenes of devastation. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the death toll on the Dutch part of St. Martin had doubled to four, and that 70 percent of homes had been damaged or destroyed. Following reports of looting, the Netherlands said it would increase its military presence on the island to 550 soldiers by Monday. Rutte said that to ensure order, security forces were authorized to act with a  firm hand . Alex Martinez, 31, a native of Florida who was vacationing on the Dutch side of St. Martin when Irma hit the island in the early hours of Wednesday, vividly described how his hotel was gutted by the storm, turning it into a debris-strewn tip. Doors were torn from hinges, windows shattered, cars lifted off the ground and furniture blown through the rooms after Irma hit the building with a burst of pressure that was  like you were getting sucked out of an aeroplane,  he said. Martinez, his wife and two others barricaded themselves in their bathroom, pushing with all their might to secure the door as Irma battered it with winds of up to 185 mph (300 km/h).  That s when we thought,  that was it ,  he said.  I honestly, swear to God, thought we were going to die at that point in time. Everything continued for maybe 20, 30 minutes; my wife s there, she s praying, praying, praying, praying, and things just kinda calmed down. I guess that s when the eye (of the storm came).  Staff deserted the hotel to look after their families and Martinez and a few others had to scavenge for food and water for three days until they were airlifted out on Saturday, he said. Dutch authorities are evacuating other tourists and injured people to Curacao, where Dutch King Willem-Alexander and Interior Minister Ronald Plasterk were expected to arrive today. France, which oversees neighboring Saint Barthelemy and the other half of St Martin, said the police presence on the two islands had been boosted to close to 500. The French interior ministry said 11 people suspected of  malicious actions  had been arrested since Friday as television footage showed scenes of chaos on the islands, with streets under water, boats and cars tossed into piles and torn rooftops. Irma killed at least 10 people on the two islands, the French government said. France s Caisse Centrale de Reassurance, a state-owned reinsurance group, estimated the cost of Irma at some 1.2 billion euros ($1.44 billion). French President Emmanuel Macron was due to visit St. Martin on Tuesday. Barbuda, home to some 1,800 inhabitants, faces a reconstruction bill that could total hundreds of millions of dollars, state officials say, after Irma steamrolled the island. The prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda, Gaston Browne, said Irma had wreaked  absolute devastation  on Barbuda, which he described as  barely habitable  after 90 percent of cars and buildings had been damaged. The government ordered a total evacuation when a second hurricane, Jose, emerged, but a handful of people refused to leave their homes, including  a gentleman (who) said he was living in a cave , said Garfield Burford, director of news at government-owned broadcaster ABS TV and Radio in Antigua and Barbuda. Irma also plunged the British Virgin Islands, an offshore business and legal center, into turmoil. Yachts were piled on top of each other in the harbor and many houses in the hillside capital of Road Town on the main island of Tortola were badly damaged. Both there and in Anguilla to the east, residents complained help from the British government was too slow in coming, prompting a defensive response from London.  We weren t late,  Defence Secretary Michael Fallon told BBC television on Sunday, saying Britain had  pre-positioned  an aid ship for the Caribbean hurricane season and that his government s response  has been as good as anybody else s.  British billionaire entrepreneur Richard Branson, who sought refuge in the wine cellar of his home on Necker island, called Irma the  storm of the century  on Twitter and urged people to make donations to help rebuild the region.

Germany's Greens want power plants shut as price of coalition,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany s Greens said on Monday that closing the country s 20 dirtiest coal-fired power stations would be a key condition of any coalition with Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives after this month s election. Greens co-leader Cem Ozdemir said he wanted to anchor the fight against climate change as the core  philosophy  of the next government, particularly given the backdrop of recent severe weather - from flooding in Germany to drought in southern Europe.  It is almost as if nature is trying to speak to us,  Ozdemir told journalists on a solar-powered boat anchored in Berlin, which the Greens planned to sail past Merkel s office later in the day. Polls show Merkel s conservatives are likely to win the  Sept. 24 election with around 38 percent of the vote but will need a coalition partner to govern, with options including a  Jamaica coalition  of the conservatives, the Greens and the liberal FDP. The Greens, however, have raised doubts about the viability of such an alliance, as they would be reluctant to work with the FDP. Ozdemir highlighted the gulf between these two parties, noting that a leading member of the FDP had branded links between recent extreme weather events and climate change as  fake news .   We will talk to everybody but not about everything,  Ozdemir said of potential coalition negotiations. Support for the Greens is on 8 percent in the latest polls  but a Forsa survey showed half of Germans would welcome the Greens being part of the new government. A study last week showed that Germany is set to miss its goal to cut carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by a far wider margin than previously thought.  Instead of being world champions in climate protection, we are world champions in lignite coal,  Ozdemir said, noting that Germany s CO2 emissions have been rising for eight years. Once dubbed the  climate chancellor  for pushing other wealthy nations to address climate change, Merkel has come under fire for not moving Germany fast enough to cut its reliance on fossil fuels as it phases out nuclear power.  Merkel has suggested that Germany should eventually consider phasing out lignate coal power plants to help it cut CO2 emissions, but she is treading carefully as the move could hit tens of thousands of jobs. Ozdemir said the Greens would demand that any government it joins must allot 1 billion euros ($1.2 bln) a year to improve public transport and cycle paths, and should push for improved CO2 emissions trading at a European level.

"Merkel in diplomatic push on North Korea, to speak with Putin: spokesman","BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel will speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin as part of high-level talks aimed at increasing pressure on North Korea over its nuclear program, her spokesman said on Monday. Berlin remains ready to support discussions about ways to find a peaceful solution to the crisis, spokesman Steffen Seibert told a regular government news conference, noting that Germany is one of few countries with diplomatic ties with Pyongyang.  That is why we have offered to be helpful in the search for new ways to de-escalate the situation,  he said, hours before the U.N. Security Council was due to vote on a U.S.-drafted resolution that would impose new sanctions on Pyongyang.  The only conceivable solution is a peaceful and diplomatic one. But to achieve such a solution, the pressure on North Korea must be increased.  Merkel has already discussed the issue with U.S. President Donald Trump, French President Emmanuel Macron, South Korean President Moon Jae-in and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and also planned a telephone call with Putin, he said. North Korea was condemned globally for conducting its sixth nuclear test on Sept 3, which it said was of an advanced hydrogen bomb. Merkel told the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper on Sunday she was ready to become involved in a diplomatic initiative to end the North Korean nuclear and missiles program, and suggested the Iran nuclear talks could be a model. Germany and the five countries on the United Nations Security Council with veto power took part in talks that led to Iran agreeing a landmark deal in 2015 to curb its nuclear work in return for the lifting of most economic sanctions. Seibert said there had been no concrete request for Germany s help in initiating discussions over the North Korean crisis. Merkel, one of the world s longest serving democratic leaders, is expected to win a fourth term in office in a Sept. 24 vote, with polls giving her conservatives a double-digit lead over their main center-left rivals. Merkel is widely seen in Germany as a safe pair of hands at a time of global uncertainty such as the North Korea crisis, Britain s looming departure from the European Union and Donald Trump s presidency in the United States.

Thai junta tells Japan investors $45-billion development plan to go ahead,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - A $45-billion plan to redevelop Thailand s industrial east will go ahead regardless of whoever takes power after elections, the military government told hundreds of Japanese investors on Monday. The ruling junta, faced with weak exports and sluggish domestic demand, has focused on promoting investment to help revive growth in Southeast Asia s second-largest economy, which lags regional peers. The military government hopes the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) development project, worth 1.5 trillion baht ($45 billion), will lift growth to about 5 percent a year by 2020, from the latest government estimate of 3.5 for 2017.  Regardless of which government is in office, or when the election will be held, the EEC plan will continue, with certainty,  Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha told a gathering of 570 investors flown in from Japan.   It is law, an act embedded within the 20-year national strategy, and supported by the national development plans.  The junta has branded its 20-year strategy a guide for policymaking long after elections expected next year, at the earliest. The strategy has fueled concern among critics that the army plans to cement its grip on power, whoever wins an election. Japan was Thailand s biggest investor in 2016 with more than 57 billion baht ($1.7 billion), most of it going into the automobile industry. Thailand, known as the  Detroit of Asia,  is a regional base for some of the world s top carmakers, such as Toyota Motor Co. The government now wants to establish its own equivalent of Silicon Valley in the EEC.

Roma seek luck and love at Catholic shrine in Hungary,"CSATKA, Hungary (Reuters) - Thousands of Roma from Hungary and beyond flock every year to a shrine to the Virgin Mary in a chapel among undulating hills, to pray for good health, happiness and luck in love. Some actually find love there, like Adam Vidak and his wife Nikoletta who met at the huge party after the holy mass last year and have now returned. They want their newborn to be christened at the shrine, where the main Roma mass this year took place on Saturday.  We met each other on Facebook and arranged a date here, we came, we liked each other, then we got in the car and off we went,  said Vidak, 22, as 20-year old Nikoletta cradled the baby boy in her arms.  The next day we called her parents, told them we were together and shortly afterwards we had our wedding.  Hungary has an estimated 700,000 Roma, one of the largest Roma minorities in Central Europe. Most of them live in poverty. The Roman Catholic chapel in Csatka, around 120 km (75 miles) west of Budapest, is their main place of pilgrimage, but many non-Roma Hungarians also come to pray.  Roma families come carrying big candles and statues of the Virgin Mary, and draw water from the sacred spring next to the chapel which is believed to have magic healing powers. Some arrive in traditional outfits, like Zoltan Sztojka, 42, who wears a yellow silk shirt and a black vest embroidered richly in gold. He came with more than 40 family members from Soltvadkert, eastern Hungary.  Roma have been coming here for 150-200 years, so we have to be here. Everybody comes to lay down our sins, pray for luck, strength and health,  he says, showing an enormous silver ring with a finely engraved horse, the coat of arms of his family.  The chapel was built in 1862, and at that time a hermit lived at the site. Even under Hungary s four decades of communist rule from 1949, Roma came here in horse-drawn carts. Now there is a huge parking lot for cars and caravans, as some people camp out over the weekend. On the hill, a large family have set up camp, and are cooking tripe stew over a campfire. As a child, Sandor Jakab, 60, used to come here by cart with his parents. Now he brings his family for three days each year from the village of Erd.  We have our fridge and freezer here, full of meat and drinks,  he says. Is it true that many Roma families seek wives and husbands for their children during the pilgrimage? Jakab replies with his brother-in-law standing next to him.  Now let s say, for example, suppose the two of us know each other, then we would have a few drinks, and he has a daughter and I have a son....then we would chat and I would ask whether I can go to you to see your daughter (as a potential bride).  He says promises made at Csatka are carved in stone. But he does not agree with the huge party, loud music and dance that follows the prayers on the hillside.  My family does not go there... We pray and spend time together. This music is not for this place,  he says. ",worldnews,"September 11, 2017 ",1

Pro-independence from China posters appearing on Hong Kong campuses stoke new tension,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Thirteen Hong Kong universities and academic institutions accused the Chinese-ruled city s leader of undermining freedom of expression amid a row over pro-independence banners appearing on campuses. Hong Kong, a former British colony that returned to China in 1997, is guaranteed freedoms and a high degree of autonomy under a  one country, two systems  arrangement, including freedom of expression. At the start of the academic year, banners advocating independence from China appeared on noticeboards in at least seven universities. Some large black banners were hung across buildings. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam criticized the posters as a violation of China s sovereignty, while urging university administrators to take  appropriate action . Some colleges, including the prestigious Chinese University, described the posters as unconstitutional, but allowed some to remain. But late on Sunday, the 13 institutions issued a statement titled  Arming ourselves in our darkest hour , criticizing Lam and university authorities for  an explicit effort to limit our freedom of expression .  Student unions stress that everyone enjoys the freedom of speech, and this is the line that we shall never compromise ... we are ready to defend our rights and liberty,  it read. Some observers said the controversy could be used to justify another squeeze on the city s freedoms, soon after several young pro-democracy leaders were jailed for helping lead the city s massive  Occupy  pro-democracy civil disobedience movement in late 2014.   The row has also stoked tension between local and mainland students, who now comprise a sizeable part of university admissions, especially in post-graduate studies. Calls for independence, once rare in the financial hub, began to gain traction after the 2014 protests and as disillusionment grew toward China s perceived tightening grip. Late last year, two pro-independence lawmakers were disqualified from office after Beijing s parliament ruled their oath-taking carried digs at China.  Beijing resolutely opposes talk of Hong Kong splitting from China, with the mini-constitution stating the city is an  inalienable  part of the country. The so-called Basic Law also enshrines freedom of expression. Groups of students from both sides have faced off on several occasions, with mainland students putting up anti-independence posters, condemning calls for independence.  One female student from China was filmed and challenged for tearing down some of the pro-independence banners.  If you re talking about democracy, you can put them up (the banners) and I can pull (them) down,  she said in the video.  An official blog run by China s state mouthpiece, the People s Daily, on Sunday published a long editorial saying there were limits to freedom of expression and that Hong Kong laws on public order could be used to jail trouble makers.  It is quite apparent that Beijing and the Hong Kong government would like to use this excuse to impose a political crackdown,  said political commentator Joseph Cheng.  Certainly the pro-Beijing establishment has been asking for rapid legislation of the controversial Article 23 legislation,  Cheng added, referring to proposed national security laws that would criminalize perceived acts of sedition.

Crimean Tatar leader jailed for stirring anti-Russia protests,"SIMFEROPOL, Crimea (Reuters) - A man who led protests against Russia s plans to annex Crimea from Ukraine was jailed for eight years in the disputed territory on Monday - a move Ukraine s president called an act of Russian repression. Crimean Tatar leader Ahtem Chiygoz was found guilty of stirring up mass disorder by calling street demonstrations in February 2014 against a referendum which later sealed Russia s seizure of the peninsula. Prosecutors at the court in Simferopol - the capital of Russian-controlled Crimea - said two people died in the unrest. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said the jailing of Chiygoz added to the case against Russia which had already been  recognized as an occupier at the highest international level.   One can unlawfully confine someone s freedom, but it s impossible to break the will! You may occupy foreign land, but it will burn under your feet,  Poroshenko said on Twitter. There was no immediate comment from Russian authorities. Chiygoz was deputy head of the Mejlis representative body of Crimean Tatars which also condemned Monday s ruling. Mejlis head Refat Chubarov, who fled Crimea after its annexation, called the sentence  a new attempt to intimidate Crimean Tatars and suppress their will . The Crimean Tatars are a largely Sunni Muslim group who suffered mass deportation under Soviet dictator Josef Stalin in 1944 and make up more than 12 percent of Crimea s largely ethnic Russian population of about 2 million. Many of them were among the strongest critics of Moscow s March 2014 annexation of Crimea, which has drawn sanctions on Russia from the United States and Europe.  Kiev and its Western allies say the seizure was illegal. But Russian President Vladimir Putin justified it, saying he needed to protect its overwhelmingly pro-Moscow population from Ukrainian nationalists.  Chubarov said lawyers would launch an appeal with the Supreme Court of Russia  as the nation that occupied Crimea .  One can already forecast its decision - it will support the decision by Crimea s illegal supreme court. Accordingly, our next step will be the European Court of Human Rights,  he added. Chiygoz s lawyer Nikolai Polozov told Reuters Television the sentence was unlawful, as Chiygoz was a citizen of Ukraine, where the criminal code did not contain such an offense. His team would seek Chiygoz s extradition to Ukraine, he added.  ",worldnews,"September 11, 2017 ",1
"Philippines seeks big cut in drug rehab budget, stoking lawmakers' concern","MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines plans a cut of 75 percent in spending next year on drug rehabilitation facilities, while at the same time seeking a massive hike in funding for a war on drugs that has killed thousands, fuelling concerns among lawmakers.  The government has rejected criticism that it lacked the commitment to rehabilitate drug users, saying it has attracted financing and is building treatment facilities, but had underestimated the scale of addiction.   More than 3,800 people, most of them drugs suspects, have died in police operations in the drug war unleashed by President Rodrigo Duterte in July last year. Police deny they were executing suspects, saying those killed had violently resisted arrest. Senator Ralph Recto, who has questioned the government s anti-drugs budget, said he would scrutinize its proposal to cut expenditure on drug rehabilitation centers by 2.3 billion pesos ($45.23 million), compared to this year. The government has asked Congress for an increase of more than 40 times in next year s police budget for anti-drugs operations next year.  I will discuss these issues when the budget is formally presented,  Recto told Reuters in a text message. The lack of rehabilitation centers would cripple the  declared government policy  to wean substance abusers off drugs, Recto said in a statement over the weekend.     In August, Health Secretary Paulyn Ubial said eight drug rehabilitation centers would be built across the Philippines, funded by private firms, including conglomerate San Miguel Corp and property firm Megaworld. Last year, Manila opened what it called a  mega  drug rehabilitation facility to treat up to 10,000 patients and funded by a Chinese tycoon.  The Department of Health submitted a budget of 759.6 million pesos for state-managed rehabilitation facilities under the government s proposed 2018 spending plan, significantly less than this year s budget of 3.08 billion pesos. Methamphetamine use for a year or more would shrink the brain of a person, Duterte said in a speech in August last year, adding,  Therefore he is no longer viable for rehabilitation.  He estimated there are already more than 3 million Philippine drug users in a country of more than 100 million people.  The government s 13 drug abuse treatment and rehab facilities treated 14,733 out-patients in 2016, up more than three times from the previous year, and close to 30,000 in- patients, up four percent over 2015, the health department says.   Duterte has said the drugs war will continue and would be  unremitting as it will be unrelenting . ",worldnews,"September 11, 2017 ",1
"Factbox: Humanitarian crisis in Bangladesh as 313,000 Rohingyas flee Myanmar","(Reuters) - At least 313,000 Rohingya refugees have fled Myanmar in the past two weeks and sought shelter in Bangladesh, a Inter Sector Coordination Group (ISCG) report released on Monday stated.  At least 400,000 hungry and traumatized refugees have sought refuge in Bangladesh since October 2016. The exodus has put pressure on aid agencies and communities, which were already helping hundreds of thousands of refugees from previous violent episodes in Myanmar.

Germany investigates far-right election candidate accused of inciting hatred,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German prosecutors have launched an investigation into remarks  by an election candidate for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party that Germany s integration minister should be  dumped  back to Turkey, her parents  country of origin. The latest polls predict the AfD will win between 8 and 11 percent of the vote in Germany s federal elections on Sept. 24, but Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose conservatives have a 13-point lead over their main rivals, the Social Democrats (SPD), has ruled out any coalition with the party. Alexander Gauland, a co-founder of the AfD who heads the party in the state of Brandenburg, made the comment during a campaign speech there. He is likely to be elected to parliament, surveys show. The AfD has never held any Bundestag seats.  Gauland later conceded that his choice of words was  a little too tough  but repeated that the minister, Aydan Ozoguz,  had no business being in Germany  after she said Germany had no culture beyond its language. Top prosecutor in the town of Muehlhausen, Ulf Walther, said he had launched the investigation after receiving multiple complaints and that he would seek to establish whether Gauland could be charged with  incitement to hatred  over his comment about Ozoguz, who was born in Germany to Turkish parents. Walther said he did not expect the investigation to be completed before the election.  Founded in 2013 as an anti-European Union party, the AfD shifted its focus after the euro zone debt crisis eased off and began to campaign against immigration, fueled by Merkel s decision in 2015 to open Germany s borders to over a million migrants, many fleeing war in the Middle East. But the party has also been hit by a string of scandals and infighting at the top.  Walther s office was able to launch the investigation because Brandenburg did not offer immunity to state legislators like other German states. But he said Gauland would be covered by federal immunity if he wins a seat in the Bundestag. In that case prosecutors would need to seek a waiver of the immunity to proceed with an investigation, he said. Gauland would also get an opportunity to offer his view on the complaints.  Officials in the southern city of Ulm are also reviewing whether AfD election posters displayed in the southern city of Ulm that repeated the call to  dump  Ozoguz constitute slander or  incitement to hatred.

"Britain to lift pay cap for police, prison officers: media","LONDON (Reuters) - The British government will soften its seven-year grip on public-sector pay with police and prison officers set to get increases above a 1 percent cap, media reported. The reports suggested British Prime Minister Theresa May and her finance minister Philip Hammond want to take a cautious approach to increasing pay for public sector workers. Police account for around 5 percent of the 5.1 million public sector workers in Britain and prison staff represent a smaller group. Based on calculations by the Institute of Fiscal Studies, an increase in pay for police to match Britain s current 2.6 percent inflation rate would cost about 145 million pounds ($191 million) this year, a small extra strain on the budget which is likely show a deficit of 58 billion pounds. If the government gave all public sector workers a 2.6 percent increase this year, the additional spending would rise to nearly 3 billion pounds, IFS analyst Jonathan Cribb said. News reports published late on Sunday said ministers were expected to accept recommendations for bigger pay rises this week, paving the way for similar increases for other government employees in future. The higher increases for police and prison officers are based on the recommendations of independent pay-review bodies, with recruitment and retention problems being cited in the case of prison officers, the BBC said. Asked on Monday if the public sector pay cap was still in place, the prime minister s spokesman said the pay review process was continuing. A spokeswoman for the finance ministry declined to comment on the reports. Public-sector pay was frozen for all but the lowest earners in 2010 and increases were limited to of 1 percent a year from 2013. May has been under increasing pressure from ministers and lawmakers to end the cap since her party lost its majority in parliament in elections in June. Britain s inflation rate has risen sharply since last year s Brexit vote hit the value of the pound and is likely to reach about 3 percent soon, squeezing the spending power of households. The Bank of England is watching for signs of pay growth as it considers when to raise emergency-level interest rates for the first time since the global financial crisis a decade ago.

"Malay woman to be Singapore president, puts minority representation on agenda","SINGAPORE (Reuters) - There are no Muslim Malays in the top echelons of Singapore s army, and few among the senior ranks of its judiciary, but a member of its poorest ethnic minority is set to become the first woman president of the Southeast Asian city state this week. Halimah Yacob, a former speaker of parliament, will be formally named to the mostly ceremonial post on Wednesday,  media reported, after other candidates fell short of the criteria set for contesting the election. Aiming to strengthen a sense of inclusivity in the multicultural country, Singapore had decreed the presidency would be reserved for candidates from the Malay community this time. Halimah s experience as house speaker automatically qualified her under the nomination rules.  Of the four other applicants, two were not Malays and two were not given certificates of eligibility, the elections department said. The last Malay to hold the presidency was Yusof Ishak, whose image adorns the country s banknotes. Yusof was president between 1965 and 1970, the first years of Singapore s independence following a short-lived union with neighboring Malaysia, but executive power lay with Lee Kuan Yew, the country s first prime minister. The separation of Singapore from Malaysia gave ethnic Malays a clear majority in Malaysia, while ethnic Chinese formed the majority in independent Singapore. Leaders of both countries, however, recognized that peace and prosperity depended on preserving harmony between the two groups. But living in a Muslim-dominated neighborhood, with Malaysia and Indonesia next door, Singapore s leaders have long worried about the risk of conflicted loyalties among Malays.  You put in a Malay officer who s very religious and who has family ties in Malaysia in charge of a machine-gun unit, that s a very tricky business,  the late Lee Kuan Yew was widely quoted as saying in 1999. For Lee, whose son, Lee Hsien Loong, is now prime minister, the answer to social cohesion lay in creating a culture of meritocracy, rather than adopting policies of positive discrimination to boost the chances of advancement for Singapore s Malay and Indian minorities. Still, a government report published in 2013 found Malays  felt they were sometimes discriminated against and had limited prospects in some institutions, such as the armed forces.  Singapore s economic success and education policies have helped swell the ranks of middle-class Malays, but the last census in 2010 showed they lagged other ethnic groups on socio-economic measures such as household incomes and home ownership. Malays, who form just over 13 percent of Singapore s 3.9 million citizens and permanent residents, also underperform on measures such as university and secondary school education. Despite being the establishment candidate, Halimah wears a hijab, which is banned in state schools and public sector jobs that require uniforms. But she has seldom spoken publicly on the issue and there is little sign of change in official attitudes.  Farid Khan, one of the unsuccessful candidates and the chairman of marine services firm Bourbon Offshore Asia, told Reuters more Malays now hold political office, and some are making their way in the corporate world, but  there is still room for improvement.  The prospect of a Malay president is by itself unlikely to resolve concerns over under-representation, but analysts and advocates say it could help foster trust among communities.  Yet the reserved election has also injured some pride.  It cheapens the credibility of a Malay person that it requires a token election for us to be president,  said Malay comedian and television personality Hirzi Zulkiflie.  Some people intending to run are very capable.  ",worldnews,"September 11, 2017 ",1

The largely ceremonial post had been reserved this year for candidates from the ethnic Malay minority. Only Halimah was given the certificate of eligibility to contest the election by the Presidential Elections Committee, the Straits Times reported on its website. ",worldnews,"September 11, 2017 ",1
"Hyundai Motor, Kia to temporarily shut down U.S. plants due to Irma","SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea s Hyundai Motor Co and sister car maker Kia Motors Corp said on Monday they planned to temporarily shut down plants in the United States to avoid potential damage from Hurricane Irma.  The shut down comes at a time Hyundai s U.S. sales have fallen more than the market average, and after it recently announced plans to expand its SUV lineup and launch a pickup truck in the market in an attempt to reverse the slide.  In a statement, Hyundai Motor said it would suspend operation of its Alabama plant for two days - between Monday and Wednesday - while Kia Motors will stop operation of its Georgia plant for one day - between Monday and Tuesday.  The suspension is expected to result in lost production of about 3,000 vehicles for both, the Yonhap news agency earlier said on Monday, citing a Hyundai Motor group spokesman. A Hyundai spokeswoman declined to comment on the number. Hurricane Irma took aim at heavily populated areas of central Florida on Monday as it carved a path of destruction through the state with high winds and storm surges that left millions without power, ripped roofs off homes and flooded city streets. Hyundai s U.S. sales are down nearly 11 percent this year through July 31, worse than the overall 2.9 percent decline in U.S. car and light truck sales.  Sales of the Sonata, once a pillar of Hyundai s U.S. franchise, have fallen 30 percent through the first seven months of 2017. In contrast, sales of Hyundai s current SUV lineup are up 11 percent for the first seven months of this year.  ",worldnews,"September 11, 2017 ",1
U.N. rights chief urges Yemen inquiry after 'minimal' effort for justice,"GENEVA (Reuters) - The United Nations has verified 5,144 civilian deaths in the war in Yemen, mainly from air strikes by a Saudi-led coalition, and an international investigation is urgently needed, U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra ad al Hussein said on Monday.   The minimal efforts made toward accountability over the past year are insufficient to respond to the gravity of the continuing and daily violations involved in this conflict,  Zeid said in a speech to the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva.  The devastation of Yemen and the horrific suffering of its people will have immense and enduring repercussions across the region.   It is the third time that he has appealed for an international inquiry into human rights violations in Yemen where a two-year conflict pits the Saudi-backed Yemen government against Iran-supported Houthi rebels. Last week Zeid s office said the 47 countries on the Human Rights Council were not taking their responsibilities seriously, and urged them to probe the  entirely man-made catastrophe . The U.N. says the civil war has created the world s biggest humanitarian crisis, with the conflict compounded by an economic collapse that has pushed millions to the brink of famine. The crippling of the health and sanitation systems has enabled cholera to take hold with unprecedented speed, with about 650,000 people infected since late April, five times the global cholera caseload in 2016. During the three-week U.N. Human Rights Council session, Saudi Arabia and the Netherlands are expected to propose rival resolutions, inviting the council to continue backing Yemen s national human rights probe or to set up its own inquiry. For the past two years, Saudi Arabia has prevailed, but the situation in the country has not improved, and Zeid s office has said Yemen s national investigation is not up to the job. The draft Dutch resolution backs Zeid s position, a Western diplomat said.   The common assessment is that the situation has deteriorated. The compromise that was put in place last year hasn t delivered,  the diplomat said.  One of the resolutions will need to be dismissed.  ",worldnews,"September 11, 2017 ",1
China court releases video of Taiwanese activist confessing to subversion,"BEIJING (Reuters) - A Taiwanese activist on trial in China confessed on Monday to attempting to subvert the Beijing government, according to videos of his hearing released by Chinese authorities, although his wife refused to recognize the court s authority. Lee Ming-che, a community college teacher known for his pro-democracy and rights activism, went missing on a trip to mainland China in March. China s authorities later confirmed that he was being investigated on suspicion of damaging national security. Lee said he accepted the charge of subversion and expressed regret in videos of his comments released on social media by the Yueyang City Intermediate People s Court in central Hunan province.  I spread some attacks, theories that maliciously attacked and defamed China s government, the Chinese Communist Party and China s current political system, and I incited the subversion of state power,  Lee said, referring to comments written in an instant messaging group. Taiwan s presidential office said in a news briefing on Monday afternoon that the government is engaged in an  all-out effort to assist Mr. Lee Ming-che s family.     His relief is our top priority. The position of this government has been very clear. Mr. Lee is one of our citizens,  an office spokesman said, adding:  We ll do everything in our power to ensure his safe return.  Lee stood trial alongside Chinese national Peng Yuhua, 37, who confessed to creating instant messaging groups and founding an organization that sought to promote political change in China. Lee had been involved in both, Peng said in testimony released on video by the court. Taiwanese rights activist Xiao Yiming traveled to the mainland for the trial, but said he was barred from entering the courtroom. Xiao suspected Peng was being used by authorities to help strengthen the state s case against Lee, as he was unaware of any previous connection between the two men.  Taiwan has democratic freedoms and Lee has the right to share his ideas,  Xiao told Reuters by phone, describing Lee as a  prisoner of conscience .  Lee Ching-yu, Lee s wife, attended the hearing. Before leaving for China she had asked that Lee s supporters to forgive him for anything he might say that disappoints them during the hearing. She wrote a letter to her husband on Monday morning before the trial began, photographs of which were seen by Reuters.  I do not recognize this court. I also did not hire any lawyers,  she wrote. After the hearing, she tearfully repeated her request for forgiveness and unveiled what appeared to be two new tattoos on the underside of each of her forearms that read,  Lee Ming-che  and  I am proud of you , videos sent to Reuters showed. No one answered the court phone when called by Reuters on Monday. Releasing videos and transcripts of court hearings has become increasingly common in China as part of a push for greater judicial transparency and oversight. But rights activists say that in sensitive cases holding  open  trials allows authorities to demonstrate state power and deter others, with statements and verdicts usually agreed in advance. Ties between Beijing and Taipei have been strained since President Tsai Ing-wen, leader of the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, took office last year. Tsai s refusal to state that Taiwan and China are part of one country has angered Beijing, as have her comments about human rights on the mainland. Beijing maintains that the island of Taiwan is part of China and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under its control, while proudly democratic Taiwan has shown no interest in being governed by the Communist Party rulers in Beijing.

"Somali army repels al Shabaab after attack, at least 17 killed","MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Somali government forces have regained control of a town on the border with Kenya after al Shabaab militants stormed an army base there on Monday, causing heavy clashes in which at least 17 people died, the military said.  Islamist insurgents attacked the base at Balad Hawo early in the morning with a car suicide bombing before entering the compound, both sides said.  We were awoken by a suicide car bomb this morning and then fierce battle followed,  Major Mohamed Abdullahi told Reuters from the town.  We chased al Shabaab out of the town,  he said. Al Shabaab spokesman Abdiasis Abu Musab said the group s fighters left the town after releasing 35 prisoners from the local jail. At least 30 soldiers were killed, he said. According to the military official, at least 10 soldiers and seven al Shabaab militants were killed, though the death toll on both sides could still rise. Formed in 2006, Al Shabaab wants to topple the Western-backed government and impose its strict interpretation of Islam. Somalia has been at war since 1991 when clan-based warlords overthrew dictator Siad Barre and then turned on each other. Al Shabaab carry out frequent attacks on security and government targets, but also on civilians. They also target African Union peacekeeping troops.  Residents confirmed fighting had ended and that the militants had left the town.   Now Balad Hawo is calm and government forces fully control it,  Ahmed Hassan, a resident of the town told Reuters. Hassan said he saw 13 bodies collected from the military base.  ",worldnews,"September 11, 2017 ",1
U.N. sees 'textbook example of ethnic cleansing' in Myanmar,"GENEVA (Reuters) - The top U.N. human rights official on Monday denounced Myanmar s  brutal security operation  against Muslim Rohingyas in Rakhine state, saying it was disproportionate to insurgent attacks carried out last month. Communal tensions appeared to be rising across Myanmar on Monday after two weeks of violence in Rakhine state that have triggered an exodus of about 300,000 Rohingya Muslims, prompting the government to tighten security at Buddhist pagodas. Zeid Ra ad al-Hussein, addressing the United Nations Human Rights Council, said that more than 270,000 people had fled to Bangladesh, with more trapped on the border, amid reports of the burning of villages and extrajudicial killings.  We have received multiple reports and satellite imagery of security forces and local militia burning Rohingya villages, and consistent accounts of extrajudicial killings, including shooting fleeing civilians,  Zeid told the Geneva forum. He cited reports that Myanmar authorities had begun to lay landmines along the border with Bangladesh and would require returnees to provide  proof of citizenship . Rohingya have been stripped of civil and political rights including citizenship rights for decades, he added.  I call on the government to end its current cruel military operation, with accountability for all violations that have occurred, and to reverse the pattern of severe and widespread discrimination against the Rohingya population,  Zeid said.  The situation seems a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.   Last year Zeid s office issued a report, based on interviews with Rohingya who fled to Bangladesh after a previous military assault, which he said on Monday had  suggested a widespread or systematic attack against the community, possibly amounting to crimes against humanity .  I deplore current measures in India to deport Rohingyas at a time of such violence against them in their country,  Zeid said, noting that some 40,000 Rohingyas had settled in India, including 16,000 who have received refugee documentation.  Noting India s obligations under international law, he said:  India cannot carry out collective expulsions, or return people to a place where they risk torture or other serious violations.

Philippines says some rebels ready to surrender as troops advance in Marawi,"MARAWI CITY, Philippines (Reuters) - Some Islamic State-linked militants besieging the southern Philippines city of Marawi have sent  feelers  they are prepared to surrender after three and a half months of fighting, the military said on Monday. Philippine forces have used loudspeakers urging militants to give themselves up, telling the estimated 50 to 60 fighters left in the city their lives would be spared if they disarm, change out of their black clothes and walk to a designated location.  Hopefully, we will have surrenders within the next days,  spokesman Colonel Romeo Brawner told a news conference.  There are feelers. Definitely, there are feelers,  he added, declining to elaborate. The surrender offer came after a renewed, if short-lived, effort by Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte to start back-channel talks with militants, with a former Marawi mayor Omar Solitario Ali to have acted as an intermediary. Duterte on Saturday ruled out the possibility of allowing rebels to flee in exchange for the release of dozens of hostages. Two troops were killed at the weekend, taking to 147 the number of security forces killed in the Marawi conflict. Some 655 militants and 45 civilians have been killed, according to the army. Troops were engaged in running battles with the militant alliance, led by Abdullah and Omarkhayam Maute of the Maute group, and Isnilon Hapilon, a factional head of the Abu Sayyaf group, and Islamic State s so-called  emir  in Southeast Asia. More than 20 structures were captured, many laden with booby traps. Some were commercial high-rise buildings that have been used as sniper positions to thwart government forces. Brawner described the operations as  a big accomplishment considering the enemy established very strong defensive positions . While some areas of Marawi are seeing citizens return and shops and schools re-open, most of the city remains deserted. Its center is a wasteland, pummeled by daily air strikes and ground battles. The resistance of the militants has frustrated the more than 400,000 residents displaced from the area and raised questions about how relatively few Islamists took control of the lakeside town and held significant parts of it.  We are receiving a lot of questions: why is it taking too long for the government to recover this area?  said Brawner.  It is really difficult to do urban fighting.  The United States has been giving technical and logistics support to the Philippine military and on Monday announced it had deployed a Gray Eagle unmanned surveillance aircraft over Marawi. Australia has also provided two P3-Orion surveillance planes and last week announced it would send more defense personnel to train Philippine troops.

Lebanon to complain to U.N. over Israel violating airspace,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon will file a complaint to the United Nations against Israel for violating the country s airspace and causing damage by breaking the sound barrier in the south of the country, its foreign minister said on Monday.  Israeli jets flew low over the southern city of Saida on Sunday, causing sonic booms that broke windows and shook buildings for the first time in years, Lebanese security sources and residents said.      We have started preparing to file a complaint to the (U.N.) Security Council against Israel for flying its planes at low altitude... causing material, moral and sovereign damage,  Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil said in a tweet.      Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri said Lebanon would issue its complaint  against Israel for planting spy devices on Lebanese land and continuously breaching  its airspace, his office said.  Israeli warplanes regularly enter Lebanon s airspace, the Lebanese army says, but rarely fly so low. The Israeli military gave no immediate comment. Tensions have risen recently between Lebanon s Hezbollah and Israel, which fought a month-long war in 2006.      The 2006 war killed around 1,200 people in Lebanon, mostly civilians, and 160 Israelis, most of them troops. Israel has targeted Iran-backed Hezbollah inside Syria in recent years, including military leaders in several deadly strikes, but there has been no major direct confrontation.

"After Irma, tourists party and Cubans take a dip in flooded streets","VARADERO, Cuba (Reuters) - In the wake of Hurricane Irma, foreign tourists partied in the coastal resort of Varadero and some Cubans swam in the flooded streets of central Havana, both glad that the deadly storm s damage to the island of 11 million people had not been worse. British visitor Josephine Breslin, 49, spent the night on an inflatable bed in a hotel bathroom when Irma s 120 mph (195 km) winds walloped Cuba s top beach destination, but after helping sweep up on Sunday morning, she felt ready to start relaxing.   I think the atmosphere now is relief, knowing it is past and the building is still there and everyone is OK,  said the British woman, wearing a colorful pareo over her swimsuit.   You can feel people are settling down, the winds are going, the sun is coming out, its business as usual, Cuban rum   yes please!  she said. Irma was packing 160 mph (260 kph) winds when it made landfall in Cuba, the first storm of that power to reach the island since 1932, and it caused major damage to tourist infrastructure including an international airport on the sandy keys popular with Europeans and Canadians. It tore off roofs and downed electricity poles throughout the country before turning northwards and plowing through Florida on Sunday. But even with the power out across most of the country of 11.2 million people, the damage to inland Cuba appeared less than devastation wrought on smaller Caribbean islands. Winds had slowed a little by the time Irma reached Varadero. The storm, which killed at least 28 people in the Caribbean and at least one man in Florida, did not lead to reported fatalities in Cuba, which carried out a major evacuation effort prior to the storm. Havana was spared a direct hit but locals in the poor central district of the colonial city close to the seafront were dealing with waterlogged homes and possessions after 36 foot (11 meter) waves breached the city s curving sea wall, turning roads into canals.  Some let off steam on Sunday by diving into deeply flooded streets, paddling on wooden boards, or wading to stores for rum through the waist-deep water.  In the Barcelo hotel, Breslin was full of praise for the Cubans who evacuated them on buses along with thousands of others from the keys before Irma, and for the hotel staff who brought sandwiches to her room during the hurricane.  Earlier in the day, the mainly British guests on inclusive package tours with operator Thomas Cook had cleaned up the pool, put sunbeds back in their place and helped workers clear away the fallen trees and branches, everyone mucking in.  In the afternoon, guests milled around the lobby area, drinking from plastic cups, where the reggaeton summer hit Despacito blasted out of loudspeakers and hotel staff geared up to provide an evening of entertainment including salsa dancing.   We put the music on to bring stress levels down and so the clients feel better,  said Juan Carlos Varcas, 30, a Cuban salsa teacher at the hotel.  Another British tourist, Dave Kelsey, said he was winding down after spending part of the night huddled in a bathtub as winds howled through the hotel, flinging sunbeds far away, tearing up palm trees and flooding rooms.  After a few drinks, Kelsey was horsing around with a friend, both wearing random items of women s clothing and about to jump into the swimming pool. Other guests egged them on.  While it will take much of Cuba s tourism industry weeks, if not months to recover from the hurricane, guests at the Barcelo said they would not be deterred from returning to the Caribbean s largest island.  Don t get me wrong, my children don t want me to come back - they have been worried sick,  said Breslin, who has visited Cuba each of the past four years.  But I will come back to Cuba ... because the Cuban people are lovely.  ",worldnews,"September 11, 2017 ",1

Gunmen kill four  in sectarian attack in Pakistan,"QUETTA, Pakistan (Reuters) - Gunmen in southwestern Pakistan killed four members of a Shi ite Muslim Hazara family, including a 12-year-old boy, on Sunday, in the latest sectarian attack on the minority community, a senior police official said.  Two men on a motorcycle opened fire on a family of eight while they at a filling station some 30 kilometres (19 miles) north of Quetta, the capital of Pakistan s Baluchistan province. Aside from those killed, two others were wounded. Two  female members of the family were unscathed, having remained in their vehicle.  This was a sectarian attack,  senior police officer Tanveer Shah told Reuters, adding that no group has claimed responsibility for the shooting. Hazaras are frequently targeted by Taliban and Islamic State militants, and other Sunni Muslim militant groups in both Pakistan and Afghanistan.  Many Hazaras fled to Pakistan during decades of conflict in neighboring Afghanistan, and nearly half a million now live in and around Quetta. In 2013, three separate bombings killed over 200 people in Hazara neighborhoods, raising international awareness of the plight of the community. More than 20 Hazaras have been killed in similar shootings in Baluchistan in the past two years, police say.  The ongoing violence in the province has fueled concern about security for projects in the $57-billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor, a transport and energy link planned to run from western China to Pakistan s southern deep-water port of Gwadar.

Israel's Netanyahu says will meet Trump in New York next week," (Story corrects date of Netanyahu s U.N. address in first paragraph) By Ori Lewis JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday he would meet U.S. President Donald Trump later this month during a visit to New York, where he will address the United Nations General Assembly on Sept. 19. Netanyahu spoke to reporters accompanying him on a trip to Latin America before his plane left Tel Aviv for Argentina on Sunday night. He will also visit Colombia and Mexico before heading to New York. In Washington, the White House did not initially respond to a request for a comment on a meeting between the two leaders.   From Mexico I will go to New York to speak at the United Nations General Assembly and there I will meet my friend, President Donald Trump,  Netanyahu said. He added best wishes  to all our friends in the U.S. to overcome these difficult hours (during Hurricane Irma).  Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is also set to address  at the U.N. General Assembly but there has been no word of a possible meeting between him and Netanyahu. Netanyahu said he was the first incumbent Israeli prime minister to visit South America and termed his visit as  historic . The trip comes as Netanyahu is under investigation in two corruption cases. One of those, known as Case 1000, involves gifts that the prime minister and his family may have received from businessmen, while Case 2000 deals with alleged efforts by him to secure better coverage from an Israeli newspaper publisher. Netanyahu, who has been prime minister for 11 years over four terms, has denied any wrongdoing. Netanyahu leads a relatively stable coalition government and presides over a buoyant economy. His conservative Likud party has rallied behind him in the absence of clear rivals for the leadership, rebuffing calls for his departure from the center-left opposition. On Friday, Netanyahu s wife, Sara, who is accompanying him on the trip was notified that Israel s attorney general is considering indicting her on suspicion of using state funds for personal dining and catering services totaling some $100,000. A post on the prime minister s Facebook page published last week said the claims against her were  absurd and will be proven to be unfounded . Sara Netanyahu also spoke before departure and thanked the  many, many, many thousands of Israeli citizens and people around the world who support and help me.  ",worldnews,"September 10, 2017 ",1
"Thousands of homes wrecked by huge Mexican quake, death toll at 91","MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A massive earthquake off southern Mexico on Thursday night that killed at least 91 people damaged tens of thousands of homes and afflicted upwards of two million people in the poorer south, state officials said, as more details of the disaster emerged. The 8.1 magnitude quake off the coast of Chiapas state was stronger than a 1985 temblor that flattened swaths of Mexico City and killed thousands. However, its greater depth and distance helped save the capital from more serious damage. On Saturday, authorities in the southern state of Oaxaca said there were 71 confirmed fatalities there, many of them in the town of Juchitan, where the rush to bury victims crowded a local cemetery at the weekend. Another death was confirmed in neighboring Chiapas late on Sunday, bringing the total there to 16, a spokesman for local emergency services said. A further four deaths have also been registered in Tabasco state to the north. Television footage from parts of Oaxaca showed small homes and buildings completely leveled by the quake, which struck the narrowest portion of Mexico on the isthmus of Tehuantepec. Aftershocks continued into Sunday, and scores of people were wary about returning to fragile buildings hammered by the initial tremor, sleeping in gardens, patios and in the open air. Piles of rubble lay strewn around damaged streets, where the shock was still visible on the faces of residents. Oaxaca Governor Alejandro Murat told Mexican television the quake hit 41 municipalities and had likely affected around one in five of the state s 4 million-strong population.  We re talking about more than 800,000 people who potentially lost everything, and some their loved ones,  he said on Sunday. In Juchitan alone, more than 5,000 homes were destroyed. Hundreds of thousands of Mexicans were temporarily left without electricity or water, and many in the south were evacuated from coastal dwellings when the quake sparked tsunami warnings. In Chiapas, some 41,000 houses were damaged, governor Manuel Velasco said, estimating nearly 1.5 million people were affected. President Enrique Pena Nieto declared three days of national mourning and pledged to rebuild shattered towns and villages. However, some residents interviewed expressed frustration that the poor southern regions were still not getting the help they needed from the richer north and center of Mexico.

Powerful hurricanes to fuel demands from island nations at climate talks,"WASHINGTON/OSLO (Reuters) - Devastation from Hurricane Irma in the Caribbean will sharpen the demands from small island nations that top fossil-fuel consumers help them cope with damage attributable to climate change, according to representatives of some of those countries. That will put island nations on a collision course with the United States and other rich countries during United Nations climate talks in Bonn, Germany, in November.  The United States, under President Donald Trump, has expressed doubts about global warming and has vowed to withdraw from a global pact to fight it, while other wealthy nations have long resisted calls to pay for climate-related  loss and damage  abroad.  If ever there was a case for loss and damage, this is it,  Ronny Jumeau, U.N. ambassador from Indian Ocean island nation the Seychelles, told Reuters, referring to Irma and other recent storms. The Seychelles is a member of the U.N. negotiating bloc Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS).  Hurricane Irma graphically shows the destructive power of climate change and underscores that loss and damage isn t some abstract concept, but the reality of life today for the people who contributed least to the problem,  said Thoriq Ibrahim, Maldives  environment minister who chairs AOSIS. Fiji Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama, whose country will host the Bonn talks Nov. 6-17, has said the issue of who pays for  loss and damage  from climate-related disasters will be a key priority at the summit. Irma barreled into Florida on Sunday, sparking one of the largest evacuations in U.S. history, after leveling Caribbean islands St. Martin, Antigua and Barbuda. Gaston Browne, prime minister of Barbuda and Antigua, said Barbuda is  barely inhabitable.  Hurricane Harvey slammed into Texas on Aug. 25, triggering record flooding that killed around 60 people and caused billions of dollars in damage. Ministers from island nations will point to the back-to-back storms to pressure negotiators at Bonn to agree to details of a mechanism for addressing loss and damage from extreme weather as well as slower changes such as sea level rises and desertification. Climate scientists have said warmer air and water resulting from climate change may have contributed to the severity of the storms. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has disputed such claims as an attempt to  politicize  natural disasters. Loss and damage has been a contentious issue in climate negotiations for years, pitting rich countries against poor. Governments first approved a U.N.  loss and damage mechanism  in Warsaw in 2013 and reaffirmed it in the 2015 Paris Agreement. But it is unclear exactly what it would cover, who would pay, and how much it would cost. Under pressure from the rich nations, the preamble of the Paris Agreement says the loss and damage mechanism  does not involve or provide a basis for any liability or compensation . Myles Allen, a professor of geosystem science at the University of Oxford in England, said developed nations don t want to open the door to legal liability. But he said there should be debate about whether major corporations, such as producers of coal and oil, or other parties could be held responsible. Researchers at the Berlin-based Heinrich B ll Foundation have said at least $300 billion a year by 2030 would be needed to help people who lose their land and culture or are forced to migrate as a result of extreme climate-related problems. Such spending would come on top of $100 billion a year in funding by 2020 that richer nations have promised poorer ones under the Paris Agreement to help them develop cleanly and adapt to climate change.  Trump and the U.S. Congress have said the United States will no longer contribute to that goal. ",worldnews,"September 11, 2017 ",1
U.N. to vote on new North Korea sanctions on Monday afternoon: diplomats,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The U.N. Security Council is set to vote on Monday afternoon on a watered-down U.S.-drafted resolution to impose new sanctions on North Korea over its latest nuclear test, diplomats said, but it was unclear whether China and Russia would support it. The draft resolution appears to have been weakened in a bid to appease North Korea s ally China and Russia following negotiations during the past few days. In order to pass, a resolution needs nine of the 15 Security Council members to vote in favor and no vetoes by any of the  five permanent members - the United States, Britain, France, Russia and China. The draft, seen by Reuters on Sunday, no longer proposes blacklisting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The initial draft proposed he be subjected to a travel ban and asset freeze along with four other North Korea officials. The final text only lists one of those officials.  The draft text still proposes a ban on textile exports, which were North Korea s second-biggest export after coal and other minerals in 2016, totaling $752 million, according to data from the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency. Nearly 80 percent of the textile exports went to China. The draft drops a proposed oil embargo and instead intends to impose a ban on condensates and natural gas liquids, a cap of two million barrels a year on refined petroleum products, and a cap crude oil exports to North Korea at current levels. China supplies most of North Korea s crude. According to South Korean data, Beijing supplies roughly 500,000 tonnes of crude oil annually. It also exports 200,000 tonnes of oil products, according to U.N. data. Russia s exports of crude oil to North Korea are about 40,000 tonnes a year. The draft resolution also no longer proposes an asset freeze on the military-controlled national airline Air Koryo.  Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously adopted eight resolutions ratcheting up sanctions on North Korea over its ballistic missile and nuclear programs. The Security Council last month imposed new sanctions over North Korea s two long-range missile launches in July. The Aug. 5 resolution aimed to slash by a third Pyongyang s $3 billion annual export revenue by banning coal, iron, lead and seafood. The new draft resolution drops a bid to remove an exception for transshipments of Russian coal via the North Korean port of Rajin. In 2013 Russia reopened a railway link with North Korea, from the Russian eastern border town of Khasan to Rajin, to export coal and import goods from South Korea and elsewhere. The original draft resolution would have authorized states to use all necessary measures to intercept and inspect on the high seas vessels that have been blacklisted by the council.  However, the final draft text calls upon states to inspect vessels on the high seas with the consent of the flag state, if there s information that provides reasonable grounds to believe the ship is carrying prohibited cargo.  The Aug. 5 resolution adopted by the council capped the number of North Koreans working abroad at the current level. The new draft resolution initially imposed a complete ban on the hiring and payment of North Korean laborers abroad. The final draft text to be voted on Monday by the council would require the employment of North Korean workers abroad to be authorized by a Security Council committee.  However, this rule would not apply to  written contracts finalized prior to the adoption of this resolution  provided that states notify the committee by Dec. 15 of the number of North Koreans subject to these contracts and the anticipated date of termination of these contracts. Some diplomats estimate that between 60,000 and 100,000 North Koreans work abroad. A U.N. human rights investigator said in 2015 that North Korea was forcing more than 50,000 people to work abroad, mainly in Russia and China, earning between $1.2 billion and $2.3 billion a year. The wages of workers sent abroad provide foreign currency for the Pyongyang government. There is new political language in the final draft urging  further work to reduce tensions so as to advance the prospects for a comprehensive settlement  and underscoring  the imperative of achieving the goal of complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in a peaceful manner.

Cambodian leader threatens ban on opposition party,"PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen threatened on Monday that the main opposition party would be dissolved if it continues to back detained leader Kem Sokha, who has been charged with treason over an alleged plot to gain power with U.S. support. Kem Sokha was arrested on Sept. 3 and is the only serious election rival to Hun Sen, a 65-year-old former Khmer Rouge commander. Western countries have criticized the arrest, which marked a an escalation in a crackdown on critics ahead of a poll next year that could pose the toughest electoral challenge Hun Sen has faced in more than 30 years of rule.  The opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) said it would continue to support Kem Sokha as leader and threatened to boycott the election if he is not freed. Speaking at a graduation ceremony in Phnom Penh, Hun Sen warned that the CNRP s stand could mean  the dissolution of the party .  If the political party continues to blockade and defend this traitor, it means the party is also a traitor so there is no time to let this party operate in Cambodia s democratic process anymore,  Hun Sen said. Parliamentarians from the CNRP went to the prison where Kem Sokha is being held to demand his release. They said his arrest was illegal because he should have been protected by parliamentary immunity.  The party president Kem Sokha is the CNRP president now and will be in the future,  one of his deputies, Mu Sochua, said outside the prison, adding that his release was an essential condition to allow a free and fair election.  We can t participate in an election that isn t free and fair,  she said. The opposition party boycotted a parliamentary vote on whether Kem Sokha should be prosecuted. It would not have been able to block approval as Hun Sen s Cambodian People s Party (CPP) holds a majority, and the motion in favor of prosecuting was passed unopposed. It was unclear whether that effectively overrode Kem Sokha s right to claim parliamentary immunity. The evidence presented against Kem Sokha so far is a video recorded in 2013 in which he discusses a strategy to win power with the help of unspecified Americans.  His lawyers have dismissed the evidence as nonsense and said he was only discussing election strategy. Western countries and human rights groups have condemned the arrest of Kem Sokha and raised doubts as to whether next year s election can be fair, given the crackdown on the opposition, activists and independent media.   However Hun Sen s main ally, China, has said it supports Cambodia s efforts to preserve its own security. Hun Sen was due to visit Beijing on Monday. He said he was going to ask for more aid for Cambodia s health sector. (Story refiles to correct opposition party acronym to CNRP in later references.) ",worldnews,"September 11, 2017 ",1

He said that, if the act of treason involved the whole party, it would be disciplined by law,  which means the dissolution of the party . ",worldnews,"September 11, 2017 ",1
Irma knocks out power to nearly four million in Florida: utilities,"(Reuters) - Hurricane Irma knocked out power to nearly 4 million homes and businesses in Florida on Sunday, threatening millions more as it crept up the state s west coast, and full restoration of service could take weeks, local electric utilities said.  Irma hit Florida on Sunday morning as a dangerous Category 4 storm, the second highest level on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, but by afternoon as it barreled up the west coast, it weakened to a Category 2 with maximum sustained winds of 110 miles per hour (177 kph). So far, the brunt of the storm has affected Florida Power & Light s customers in the states  southern and eastern sections, and its own operations were not immune, either.  We are not subject to any special treatment from Hurricane Irma. We just experienced a power outage at our command center.  We do have backup generation,  FPL spokesman Rob Gould said on Sunday.  FPL, the biggest power company in Florida, said more than 3.2 million of its customers were without power by 10 p.m. (0200 GMT Monday), mostly in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties. More than 200,000 had electricity restored, mostly by automated devices. The company s system will need to be rebuilt, particularly in the western part of the state, Gould said.  That restoration process will be measured in weeks, not days.  FPL is a unit of Florida energy company NextEra Energy Inc.  Large utilities that serve other parts of the state, including units of Duke Energy Corp, Southern Co and Emera Inc, were seeing their outage figures grow as the storm pushed north.  Duke s outages soared to 390,000 from 60,000 in a span of four hours on Sunday evening, and the company warned its 1.8 million customers in northern and central Florida that outages could ultimately exceed 1 million.  The company updated its website on Sunday evening with a warning to customers that outages may last a week or longer. Emera s Tampa Electric utility said the storm could affect up to 500,000 of the 730,000 homes and businesses it serves, and over 180,000 had already lost power. The utilities had thousands of workers, some from as far away as California, ready to help restore power once Irma s high winds pass their service areas. About 17,000 were assisting FPL, nearly 8,000 at Duke and more than 1,300 at Emera. Tampa Electric told customers on Sunday, however, that response crews were halting work because of the high winds.       FPL said on Friday that Irma could affect about 4.1 million customers, but that was before the storm track shifted away from the eastern side of the state. Its customers are concentrated in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties. The utility said its two nuclear plants were safe. It shut only one of the two reactors at its Turkey Point nuclear plant about 30 miles (48 km) south of Miami on Saturday, rather than both, because the storm shifted. It plans to leave both reactors in service at the St. Lucie plant about 120 miles (193 km )north of Miami because hurricane-force winds are no longer expected to hit the sites. There is also spent nuclear fuel at Duke s Crystal River plant, about 90 miles (145 km) north of Tampa. The plant, on Irma s current forecast track, stopped operating in 2009 and was retired in 2013. In a worst-case scenario, the spent fuel could release radiation if exposed to the air, but a federal nuclear official said that was extremely unlikely.  That fuel is so cold, relatively speaking, it would take weeks before there would be any concern,  said Scott Burnell of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  As the storm has come ashore, gasoline stations have struggled to keep up. In the Atlanta metro area, about 496 stations, or 12.2 percent, were out of gasoline, according to information service Gas Buddy. ",worldnews,"September 10, 2017 ",1
"Factbox: Over four million lose power in Florida from Irma, utilities say","(Reuters) - More than 4 million homes and businesses have lost power in Florida, major utilities said on Sunday, as Hurricane Irma pummeled the state. Most outages were in Florida Power & Light s service area in the southern and eastern parts of the state. FPL, the state s biggest power company, said more than 3.3 million of its customers were without service. As the storm moved up the coast, Duke Energy s outages steadily climbed.  Irma hit Florida on Sunday morning as a dangerous Category 4 storm, the second highest level on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale. It weakened as it moved up the state s west coast and by late evening, it was a Category 2 with maximum sustained winds of 105 miles per hour (169 kph). FPL is a unit of NextEra Energy Inc (NEE.N).

The airport may reopen on Tuesday but it did not confirm the plans.  American now plans to resume limited operations when the airport reopens,  the airline said, noting federal agencies must assess whether the airport can reopen. The Fort Worth-based airline canceled all flights at the Miami airport starting on Friday evening in anticipation of Hurricane Irma, along with flights at three other south Florida airports. All American flights remain canceled through Monday at 12 other Florida airports, as well as Hilton Head, South Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia. ",worldnews,"September 11, 2017 ",1
Ex-Georgian leader Saakashvili barges across Ukraine border,"SHEHYNI, Ukraine (Reuters) - Former Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili and a crowd of supporters barged past guards to enter Ukraine from the Polish border on Sunday after a prolonged standoff between Saakashvili and the Ukrainian authorities. Amid shouts of  victory  and  glory to Ukraine , Saakashvili returned to Ukraine despite being stripped of Ukrainian citizenship by his one-time ally, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, and facing possible arrest and deportation.   Poroshenko invited Saakashvili to be a regional governor to help drive reforms after protests in 2014 ousted a pro-Russian president in Kiev. But Saakashvili quit as governor of Odessa in November, accusing Poroshenko of abetting corruption.  Thousands of Saakashvili s supporters gathered on the border on Sunday while prominent lawmakers, including former Ukrainian prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, traveled with him from Poland. Saakashvili had tried to cross the border by train but the train did not leave its station in the Polish town of Przemysl. The woman in charge of the Ukrainian train said she had been ordered by the authorities - she declined to specify whether Polish or Ukrainian - to stop the train leaving until Saakashvili got off.  He then traveled by bus to the border and was stopped by guards who sealed off the area, causing a tailback of vehicles. Supporters pushed their way through and escorted him across.  I came with my Ukrainian passport, I wanted to show my passport and make a statement,  a triumphant Saakashvili told supporters after crossing.  Instead, the authorities arranged this circus.  Poroshenko s spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.   The crowd broke through the Shehyni checkpoint,  Oleh Slobodyan, a spokesman for the Ukrainian border service, wrote on Facebook.  The fight started. It s hard to predict the consequences of this situation.  A statement by the border service said several police and border guards were injured during the clash and said a group of people, whom it did not name, had crossed the border illegally.  Saakashvili took power in Georgia after a peaceful pro-Western uprising, known as the Rose Revolution, in 2003. The 49-year-old is now wanted on criminal charges in Georgia, which he says were trumped up for political reasons. Loathed by the Kremlin, Saakashvili was once a natural ally for Poroshenko after Moscow annexed Ukraine s Crimea region in 2014. But he has become one of the Ukrainian president s most vocal critics, casting doubt on the Western-backed authorities  commitment to tackle entrenched corruption. Saakashvili has accused the Ukrainian authorities of using pressure tactics to deter him from returning to Kiev, where he has launched a campaign to unseat Poroshenko. Speaking to reporters earlier in the Polish city of Rzeszow, Saakashvili said Poroshenko viewed him as an  existential threat .   It looks like he is getting rid of a political opponent and no matter how many times he says that I am not a danger to him, every action of his shows exactly the opposite, that he regards me as a great and immediate danger,  he said.

Trump on Hurricane Irma: 'This is some big monster',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump called Hurricane Irma  some big monster  as it battered the Florida coast, saying he wanted to go to the state very soon and praising emergency officials for their efforts to protect people.  The bad news is that this is some big monster,  Trump told reporters at the White House, saying damage from the storm would be very costly.  Right now, we are worried about lives, not cost,  Trump said after returning from Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland where he monitored the storm and met with his Cabinet. The path of the storm, tracking the west coast of Florida, meant it might be less destructive than it would otherwise have been, Trump said, noting the next five or six hours would be critical.  I hope there aren t too many people in the path,  he said.  You don t want to be in that path.   The U.S. House of Representatives canceled votes scheduled for Monday because of the hurricane. Trump said the U.S. Coast Guard had been heroic and that the Federal Emergency Management Agency was doing a good job to help coordinate the response with states. He added, however:  I think the hard part is now beginning.  Trump has offered the full resources of the federal government to Florida and the affected states, Vice President Mike Pence told reporters during a visit to FEMA s Washington headquarters on Sunday.  Wherever Hurricane Irma goes, we ll be there first,  Pence said.  We ll be there with resources and support, both to save lives and to help to recover and rebuild these states and these communities.  On Sunday, Trump also issued a disaster declaration for the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, and expanded federal funds available to the U.S. Virgin Islands in the aftermath of Irma, the White House said. Trump owns a resort in Palm Beach, Florida, where he has often traveled during his presidency, as well as three golf courses in the state. He told reporters he hoped to travel to the state soon.  We re going to Florida very soon,  Trump said. ",worldnews,"September 10, 2017 ",1
Hurricane Irma threatens Florida's bustling tourism industry,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hurricane Irma s path of destruction up Florida s Gulf Coast on Sunday threatens to disrupt a thriving state tourism industry worth more than $100 billion annually just months ahead of the busy winter travel season. Some of the state s biggest attractions have announced temporary closures, including amusement park giants Walt Disney World s Magic Kingdom, Universal Studios, Legoland and Sea World, which all planned to close through Monday.  About 20 cruise lines have Miami as a home port or a port of call, according to the PortMiami website, and many have had to move ships out of the area and revise schedules.  Carnival Cruise Lines and Royal Caribbean have canceled and revised several sailings as a result of the storm and have offered credits and waivers on trips where passengers are unable to travel.  A Carnival spokesman said the situation in Florida on Sunday was still not clear enough to fully assess how widespread the effects will be.  We will know more in the hours ahead since the hurricane is active in Florida right now,  spokesman Roger Frizzell said. Irma made a second Florida landfall on Sunday on southwestern Marco Island as a Category 3 storm bringing winds of 115 miles per hour (185 kph) and life-threatening sea surge. Disney canceled the Monday sailing of one of its cruise ships and said it is assessing future sailings, which stop throughout the Caribbean and in the Bahamas.  Florida is one of the world s top tourism destinations. Last year nearly 113 million people visited the state, a new record, and spent $109 billion, state officials said earlier this year. The first half of 2017 was on track to beat that record pace, officials said.      The damage Irma s winds and storm surge do to Florida s 660 miles (1,060 km) of beaches and the structures built along them during more than 30 years of explosive population growth will be critical to how quickly the state s  s No. 1 industry recovers. The Gulf beaches west of St. Petersburg and Clearwater,  are squarely in the storm s path.  In 2016, more than 6.3 million people visited Pinellas County, which encompasses those cities, and generated more $9.7 billion in economic activity. Up and down the wide, sandy beaches of Pinellas County are traditional  old Florida  waterfront hotels such as the Don Cesar, a coral pink 1920s hotel on St. Pete Beach, which was closed by the storm. There are also modern high-rises and resorts that are part of the nation s biggest chains and brands including Hyatt Hotels, Marriott International, Intercontinental Hotels Group, Hilton Hotels & Resorts and Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company. The low-lying barrier islands would be inundated if Irma s storm surge reaches forecast heights of as high as 15 feet (4.6 meters).  While some newer structures in the area are built on elevated pilings, many older homes and businesses are not.  ",worldnews,"September 10, 2017 ",1
Slightly injured pope ends Colombia tour with unity appeal,"CARTAGENA, Colombia (Reuters) - Pope Francis, his eye bandaged and blackened after a minor accident in the popemobile, left Colombia on Sunday after appealing to the country to  untie the knots of violence  after a 50-year civil war. His last day in the Andean country got off to a rocky start when he lost his balance and bumped his head while riding in the popemobile. He bruised his cheekbone and cut his left eyebrow, blood staining his white cassock.  The Vatican said he received ice treatment and was fine.    A smiling pope continued the trip wearing a bandage over his cut.  I was punched. I m fine,  the 80-year-old pontiff joked afterward, the bruises on his face clearly visible. At the end of the day, when he said Mass for about 500,000 people in the city s port area, the bruise had swollen and he had a black bag under his eye.  If Colombia wants a stable and lasting peace, it must urgently take a step in this direction, which is that of the common good, of equity, of justice, of respect for human nature and its demands,  he said in a strong voice in the homily of the Mass, accompanied by Caribbean and salsa music.  Only if we help to untie the knots of violence, will we unravel the complex threads of disagreements,  he said. The pontiff left Colombia on an Avianca flight to Rome after watching a  cumbia  troupe perform traditional coastal singing and dancing with President Juan Manuel Santos and his wife, Maria Clemencia.  Francis used the trip to urge Colombians deeply polarized by a peace plan to shun vengeance after a bloody civil war. He also said leaders had to enact laws to end injustice and social inequality that breeds violence. Cartagena, a top tourist destination famous for its colonial walled ramparts, was the home to Saint Peter Claver, a Spanish priest who ministered to slaves in Colombia in the 1600s, defying Spanish colonial masters who treated them as chattel. The pope used the occasion to again decry modern slavery and human trafficking and defend the rights of immigrants. Human rights groups estimate that millions of people around the world are victims of human trafficking and forms of modern slavery such as forced labor and prostitution.  Here in Colombia and in the world, millions of people are still being sold as slaves; they either beg for some expressions of humanity, moments of tenderness, or they flee by sea or land because they have lost everything, primarily their dignity and their rights,  the pope said just before praying before Claver s relics. Some 300 Afro-Colombians who receive assistance from the Jesuit religious order, of which the pope is a member, prayed  with him in the church. Francis visited the impoverished neighborhood of San Francisco and blessed the cornerstone of a shelter for at-risk Afro-Colombian girls vulnerable to child prostitution, drugs and violence. Earlier in the day, the first Latin American pope said he was praying for the well-being of all countries on the continent but particularly Venezuela, which has been caught up in a social and economic crisis.  I express my closeness to all the sons and daughters of that beloved nation, as well as to all those who have found a place of welcome here in Colombia,  referring to the tens of thousands of Venezuelans who have crossed the border to find food and medicine.  From this city, known as the seat of human rights, I appeal for the rejection of all violence in political life and for a solution to the current grave crisis, which affects everyone, particularly the poorest and most disadvantaged of society,  he said. National Human Rights Day is celebrated in Colombia on Sept. 9, in honor of Claver, who died in 1654. Venezuela has been convulsed by months of near-daily protests against leftist President Nicolas Maduro, who critics say has plunged the oil-rich country into the worst economic crisis in its history and is turning it into a dictatorship. World bodies and foreign governments have expressed concern about the shortage of food and medicine in Venezuela and called for political dialogue between Maduro and the opposition. Church leaders in Venezuela have made a series of highly critical speeches since late last year. ",worldnews,"September 10, 2017 ",1
Irma evacuees find full hotels but a warm welcome in Georgia,"ATLANTA (Reuters) - As hundreds of thousands of Floridians flee Hurricane Irma, people in the state of Georgia have opened their homes to strangers who emerged from hours-long traffic jams to find hotels and campgrounds booked solid. Authorities in Florida have ordered about a third of the state s population, 6.3 million people, to evacuate ahead of the hurricane s expected landfall on Sunday. Some stayed put, but many left their homes. And many who drove to neighboring Georgia initially had nowhere to stay. With churches in Atlanta appealing for donations of mattresses and blankets for shelters, and hotels and motels along Interstate 75 heading north to the city from Florida reportedly at capacity through next week, homeschool teacher Mary Hoyt decided something needed to be done. She helped found Atlanta Hurricane Solidarity, an informal network that works via word of mouth and local news media attention, and has so far managed to match 75 evacuee families with homes in Atlanta.  Those are the ones we have settled or on their way,  said Hoyt, who lives in the city s eastern suburb of Decatur.  We have 300 more homes and counting that are available. People are so amazingly generous.  At the Atlanta Motor Speedway, meanwhile, staff are accustomed to accommodating thousands of campers at their NASCAR stock car racing events. They have opened the facilities in Hampton, about 25 miles (40 km) south of Atlanta, for free to anyone seeking refuge.  Many Georgia coast residents were also locking up homes and heading inland before Irma hits. On Saturday, all lanes of Interstate 16, which runs west of historic Savannah, were turned inland for evacuating traffic only. Campsites in places like Indian Springs State Park, near the small town of Flovilla, a few miles (kms) east of Interstate 75, were full, said park manager Katherine Darsey.  There are a lot of Florida license tags here,  Darsey said, adding that people were still welcome to use the parking lot overnight if they needed a safe place to rest. The Airbnb website listed 85 homes in Georgia and Florida on Saturday evening that had been made available for free to Irma evacuees by the properties  owners, said Airbnb spokeswoman Crystal Davis. Evacuees  four-legged friends were also seeking safety: Animal shelters that were already busier than usual with pets displaced from Texas and Louisiana last month by Hurricane Harvey reported more arrivals from Florida. The equestrian center in Alpharetta, another Atlanta suburb, has agreed to house 150 horses from Florida for free, said its director, Matt Casey. Forty horses had arrived by Saturday afternoon, and more were on the way. One cat from Paisley, about 40 miles (60 km) north of Orlando, was en route to sanctuary in Indiana when she was spooked by a traffic accident while being driven through Atlanta. The 2-year-old calico named Coco jumped out of the car s window and darted into woods.  I ve been heartsick over it,  said her owner, Cindy Voelz, 55.  She must be so frightened.   Voelz is staying with friends in the city while she looks for Coco. She said she really appreciates the help she has had searching from volunteers at an Atlanta animal shelter.  I can t believe how nice everyone is here,  she said. ",worldnews,"September 10, 2017 ",1

British trade union conference evacuated over bomb threat,"LONDON (Reuters) - A hotel and nearby conference center on the south coast of England where Britain s Trades Union Congress (TUC) is holding its annual conference were evacuated on Sunday due to a bomb threat, police said. Police said the Grand Hotel in Brighton, where five people were killed by an Irish Republican Army bombing during the Conservative Party conference in 1984, received an anonymous phone call at 1530 GMT on Sunday saying there was an explosive device in the building.  The nearby Brighton Centre, where the TUC was meeting and where the opposition Labour Party is due to hold its annual conference later this month, was also evacuated.  Thorough searches and enquiries are taking place to establish as soon as possible whether or not the call is a genuine one,  Sussex Police said in a statement.  Military ordnance disposal are attending as part of the search. Nothing untoward has been found at this time.  ",worldnews,"September 10, 2017 ",1

Brazilian billionaire Joesley Batista surrenders to police,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Billionaire Joesley Batista, one of the owners of JBS SA, the world s largest meatpacker, and executive Ricardo Saud surrendered on Sunday and were arrested by Brazilian police, their lawyer said. Batista and Saud went to federal police headquarters in Sao Paulo on Sunday afternoon and will be transferred to Brasilia on Monday, their lawyer, Pierpaolo Bottini, said.  The arrests were ordered by Supreme Court Justice Edson Fachin, who agreed to a request by Brazilian Prosecutor-General Rodrigo Janot. The court revoked immunity from prosecution under previous plea deals struck by Batista and Saud, a former director of holding company J&F Investimentos. In his decision ordering both arrested for at least five days, Fachin wrote the state witnesses were  selective  and did not present all information related to crimes they confessed to in their plea deals.  Janot sought the arrests after Batista and Saud recorded themselves discussing crimes not covered in the plea bargain. The taped conversation, made public by the Supreme Court, was inadvertently submitted to prosecutors with unrelated material last week. In a statement on Sunday, J&F lawyers said both men  did not lie nor omitted information  in their plea deals. The Supreme Court Justice denied a request for the arrest of former prosecutor Marcelo Miller, who was accused by the prosecutor-general of helping Wesley and Joesley Batista with their plea deal before leaving the Prosecutor s Office in April to a private law firm.

"After insurgents' truce, Myanmar says 'we don't negotiate with terrorists'","YANGON/SHAH PORIR DWIP ISLAND, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Myanmar on Sunday rebuffed a ceasefire declared by Muslim Rohingya insurgents to enable the delivery of aid to thousands of displaced people in the violence-racked state of Rakhine, declaring simply that it did not negotiate with terrorists. Attacks by militants on police posts and an army base on Aug. 25 prompted a military counter-offensive that triggered an exodus of Rohingya to Bangladesh, adding to the hundreds of thousands already there from previous spasms of conflict. According to the latest estimate by U.N. workers in the Cox s Bazar region of southern Bangladesh, about 294,000 - many of them sick or wounded - have arrived in just 15 days, putting huge strain on humanitarian agencies  operations. Thousands of Rohingya remaining in the north-western state of Rakhine have been left without shelter or food, and many are still trying to cross mountains, dense bush and rice fields to reach Bangladesh. The Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) insurgent group declared a month-long unilateral ceasefire, starting on Sunday, so that aid could reach these people. The impact of ARSA s move is unclear, but it does not appear to have been able to put up significant resistance against the military force unleashed in Rakhine state, where thousands of homes have been burned down and dozens of villages destroyed. ARSA s declaration drew no formal response from the military or the government of Buddhist-majority Myanmar. However, the spokesman for Myanmar s leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, said on Twitter:  We have no policy to negotiate with terrorists.  Myanmar says its security forces are carrying out clearance operations to defend against ARSA, which the government has declared a terrorist organisation. Human rights monitors and fleeing Rohingya say the army and Rakhine Buddhist vigilantes have mounted a campaign of arson aimed at driving out the Rohingya, whose population is estimated at around 1.1 million. About a dozen Muslim villages were burned down on Friday and Saturday in the ethnically mixed Rathedaung region of Rakhine, two sources monitoring the situation said.  Slowly, one after another, villages are being burnt down - I believe that Rohingyas are already wiped out completely from Rathedaung,  said one of the sources, Chris Lewa of the Arakan Project, a Rohingya monitoring group.  It was unclear who torched the villages, and independent journalists are not allowed into the area. In Cox s Bazar, Reuters journalists saw waves of Rohingya arriving on Sunday, and crowds of desperate people - mostly women and children - queuing for handouts of food and clothes. More than 300 people arrived on small boats and fishing trawlers on Shah Porir Dwip island, a short distance from the mouth of the Naf river that separates the two countries and flows out into the Bay of Bengal. Many collapsed on the beach from motion sickness and dehydration.  Three Rohingya were killed by landmines on Saturday as they tried to cross from Myanmar, a Bangladeshi border guard said, and Amnesty International said there were two landmine incidents on Sunday, including a blast that blew off a man s leg.  All indications point to the Myanmar security forces deliberately targeting locations that Rohingya refugees use as crossing points,  Tirana Hassan, Amnesty international s Crisis Response Director, said in a statement.  This is a cruel and callous way of adding to the misery of people fleeing a systematic campaign of persecution,  she said. A Myanmar military source told Reuters last week that landmines had been laid along the border in the 1990s to prevent trespassing and the military had since tried to remove them. But none had been planted recently. Dipayan Bhattacharyya, the World Food Programme s spokesman in Bangladesh, said the latest estimate of new arrivals was 294,000 and there were discussions underway to revise up the prediction made last week that it would reach 300,000. The government of Bangladesh is planning for an influx of up to 400,000, Additional Superintendent of Police for Cox s Bazar Afruzul Haque Tutul told Reuters. The United Nations has appealed for aid funding of $77 million to cope with the emergency in southern Bangladesh. The wave of hungry and traumatised refugees is  showing no signs of stopping , the U.N. Resident Coordinator in Bangladesh Robert Watkins said in a statement late on Saturday.  It is vital that aid agencies working in Cox s Bazar have the resources they need to provide emergency assistance to incredibly vulnerable people who have been forced to flee their homes and have arrived in Bangladesh with nothing,  he said. The International Crisis Group said in a report that the strife in Rakhine is causing more than a humanitarian crisis.  It is also driving up the risks that the country s five-year-old transition from military rule will stumble, that Rohingya communities will be radicalised, and that regional stability will be weakened,  it said. Aung San Suu Kyi has come under international pressure to halt the violence. Critics complain that Suu Kyi, who won a Nobel peace prize for championing democracy, has failed to speak out for a minority that has long complained of persecution.

"Pope bumps head, hurts left eye, but is well: Vatican","CARTAGENA, Colombia (Reuters) - Pope Francis lost his balance while riding in the popemobile through a crowd in Cartagena, Colombia, on Sunday, bruising his left cheekbone and eyelid, but he was not seriously hurt. The Vatican said he received ice treatment and was fine to continue on his trip. Video images showed the pope hitting the left side of his face against a vertical bar of the popemobile, a specially designed open-top vehicle that allows the pontiff to stand and greet the faithful as his motorcade advances. A few drops of blood were seen on his white cassock and the area around his left eye looked bruised and swollen.  I was punched. I m fine,  the pope joked as he left a house in the poor neighborhood of San Francisco on the last day of his trip to Colombia. He later was seen with a small bandage over his left eyebrow.  The pope is fine. He injured his left cheekbone and eyelid,  spokesman Greg Burke said. ",worldnews,"September 10, 2017 ",1
"Syria army, U.S.-backed forces converge on Islamic State in separate offensives","BEIRUT (Reuters) - Syrian government forces and U.S.-backed militias converged on Islamic State in separate offensives against the militants in the eastern Syrian province of Deir al-Zor on Sunday. The U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces alliance of mostly Kurdish and Arab militias (SDF) said it had reached Deir al-Zor s industrial zone, just a few miles to the east of the city after launching operations in the area in recent days. The Syrian army and its allies, backed by Iran and by Russian air cover, meanwhile advanced from the west to seize full control of the Deir al-Zor-Damascus highway, a Hezbollah-run media unit reported. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said at least 17 civilians had been killed by Russian air strikes in Deir al-Zor on Sunday. The attacks squeezed Islamic State in its last major Syria stronghold in areas near the border with Iraq. The group has come under pressure since losing its de facto capital Mosul in Iraq this year and is surrounded by the SDF in Raqqa, its former Syria bastion. The jihadist group still holds much of Deir al-Zor province and half the city, as well as a pocket of territory near Homs and Hama further west, however, and is mounting counter-attacks. Sunday s advances mean that U.S.-backed forces and the Syrian government side, boosted by Russian military support, are separated only by about 15 km (10 miles) of ground and the Euphrates River in Deir al-Zor. Much of northeast Syria to the east of the Euphrates is held by the SDF, which is dominated by the Kurdish YPG militia. The Syrian government and its allies are increasingly capturing the remaining areas Islamic State holds to its west. Government troops linked up with forces already in Deir al-Zor at the Panorama entrance to the city, bringing the whole road under their control for the first time in years, the Hezbollah media unit reported. The Syrian army and its Iran-backed allies, which include Lebanese Hezbollah, this week broke a three-year siege by the jihadists of a government-held enclave in Deir al-Zor and an adjacent air base. Syrian state TV broadcast footage of Syrian officers who had been holed up in Deir al-Zor emotionally greeting their superiors after being surrounded by IS since 2014. The United Nations estimates that some 93,000 people were living in  extremely difficult  conditions in government-held parts of Deir al-Zor, supplied by air drops to the air base. Syrian government forces and their allies have been able to turn their attention to the fight against Islamic State in eastern Syria after recapturing many areas in the west from rebels. The SDF on Saturday announced an operation to capture northern and eastern parts of Deir al-Zor province and staged  attacks from the northern countryside and southern Hasaka, which is under YPG control. The SDF, backed by U.S.-led air strikes and special forces on the ground, has captured most of Raqqa, upstream along the Euphrates, from Islamic State. Islamic State has lost nearly half of its territory across both Iraq and Syria, but still has 6,000-8,000 fighters left in Syria, the U.S.-led coalition has said. The forces leading the SDF s operation in Deir al-Zor say they do not expect clashes with Syrian government forces, but will respond if they come under fire. Syria s crowded battleground has shown the risks of escalation between world powers militarily involved in the six-year-old Syrian conflict. In June a U.S. warplane shot down a Syrian army jet near Raqqa in and the SDF accused the Syrian government of bombing its positions, raising tension between Washington and Moscow. The Cold War foes have also engaged over Syria, however, including setting up communication channels for flight safety in Syrian airspace. Both countries say the priority in Syria is to defeat Islamic State. Rounds of Syria talks between world powers have increasingly focused on Islamic State. Negotiations where Syria s opposition has repeatedly called for the removal of President Bashar al-Assad have failed to bring an end to the conflict. ",worldnews,"September 10, 2017 ",1
Syrian rebels say U.S. allies push for retreat from southeast Syria,"AMMAN (Reuters) - Two Western-backed Syrian rebel groups fighting the Syrian army and Iranian-backed militias in southeastern Syria have been asked by their Western and Arab backers to pull out of the area and retreat into Jordan, rebels and diplomatic sources said on Sunday. Both Usoud al-Sharqiya and Martyr Ahmad Abdo, part of the Free Syrian Army group, said they were told to end fighting in the area by their backers from the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and neighboring states that support them, which include Jordan and Saudi Arabia.  There is a official request for us to leave the area,  said Badr al Din al Salamah, a senior official in the Usoud al Sharqiya group, one of the main rebel groups in the area and  a recipient of the military aid from the U.S.-backed alliance. Since early this year, the rebels have pushed Islamic State militants out of a large swathe of sparsely populated territory stretching some 50 km (30 miles) southeast of Damascus, all the way to the Iraqi border along the frontier with Jordan. But an offensive by the Syrian army, backed by Iranian militias and heavy Russian air cover, has encircled the rebels and eroded their gains. In recent weeks, the army has regained a string of border posts with Jordan that it had abandoned in the early years of the conflict Western diplomatic sources said the request was tied to a decision by the administration of U.S. President Trump in July to halt the CIA s program to equip and train rebel groups fighting the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.  The CIA program began in 2013 as part of efforts by the administration of then-President Barack Obama to overthrow Assad. The Trump administration says its strategy in Syria is focused only on defeating Islamic State. In a letter purportedly to rebel commanders and seen by Reuters, they were told they although they had fought bravely to fend off the Syrian army, their presence in a small enclave now posed a threat to them. The decision has caused disaffection among hundreds of fighters in the two groups, who consider withdrawing into Jordan as effectively disbanding their forces. The two groups, who have hundreds of fighters, will have to hand over heavy artillery and dozens of U.S.-made anti-tank missiles that played a part in their battlefield successes against Islamic State and the Iranian-backed militias, rebels say. In a meeting on Saturday, the rebel commanders told the joint operations center in Jordan that requested their withdrawal they would rather  stay and die  in the desert than leave the battlefield.  We have rejected the request,  since if we entered Jordan we would consider it the end ... the blood of our martyrs has not dried yet,  said al-Salameh. The military operations center has not offered them a choice to move to a U.S. garrison further east near the border with Iraq in Tanf, the rebels say. That garrison, run by a separate program of the Pentagon, hosts an Arab rebel tribal group known as the Maqhawir al Thwra. Another rebel official said they were not necessarily opposed to withdrawing, but they wanted assurances from Jordan they could lobby to expand to the Badia area a U.S.-Russian-brokered ceasefire, which has halted fighting in southwest Syria. Washington and Jordan are currently negotiating with Moscow to implement a de-escalation zone that would push back Iranian-backed forces 40 kms north of the border strip with Jordan, diplomats say.   We have accepted in principle and there are matters that have to be resolved. But until this moment there is no final agreement on withdrawing and we are still in the Badia and still fighting and in our posts,  said Said Seif, a spokesman of the Martyr Ahmad Abdo group.

Merkel and the refugees: How German leader emerged from a political abyss,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Near the end of a recent campaign speech in northern Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel turned to Europe s refugee crisis of 2015 and offered her audience a comforting dual message. Germans should be proud of the warm welcome they gave  hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers, many of them fleeing war and persecution in the Middle East, she told an audience of over 1,000 gathered in the fishing village of Steinhude.  Then she shifted gears:  What happened in 2015 cannot, should not and must not happen again.   It is a phrase she has used repeatedly in market squares across Germany as she campaigns for a fourth term in a federal election on Sept. 24 that she is widely expected to win. [nL5N1LQ0H1 Two years since she opened Germany s borders to asylum seekers to avert what she says was a looming humanitarian disaster, and saw her popularity slide as a result, Merkel has climbed her way out of the deepest hole of her political career.  There are many factors behind her comeback. But few are as important as her skill at spinning a narrative about the refugee crisis that many Germans can support, whether they cheered or condemned her actions of 2015.  Merkel is not running on a policy of open borders and that fits perfectly with the mood in the country,  said Robin Alexander, author of a best-selling book on the German government s handling of the refugee crisis.  Many people like the image of Germany as a model of humanitarian virtue. At the same time they know the country could not continue to welcome refugees like it did. It is this set of feelings that Merkel is appealing to.  By the end of 2015, 890,000 asylum seekers had entered Germany, many without proper identity checks, overwhelming local communities. Merkel s actions divided Europe and led to a surge in anti-immigrant sentiment. The hard-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party seems sure to enter parliament for the first time. A year after her decision, and following a series of small-scale attacks in Germany by Islamist militants, her popularity ratings had plunged 30 points to 45 percent and she faced questions about whether she would run for chancellor again.  Yet today, 63 percent of Germans say she is doing a good job and, according to a Bertelsmann Foundation survey this week, 59 percent believe the country is on the right track.  It has been a long, difficult road back,  said one of her top aides.  But we have gotten to a point where the refugee issue is no longer a negative for Merkel in the election campaign.  Merkel has been helped by external events such as Britain s vote for Brexit last year and Donald Trump s election victory in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, both of which reinforced her appeal as a guarantor of stability.  A decision by Macedonia in early 2016 to shut its border with Greece stemmed the flow of refugees, easing pressure on Germany. And the country has not suffered a large-scale Islamist attack, an event which might have triggered a voter backlash. But Merkel s knack for understanding how Germans tick has also been crucial.  At many of her public appearances, she is confronted by anti-immigration protesters who try to drown out her speeches with whistles and chants of  Merkel must go! .  In Steinhude, a woman held up a sign showing Merkel s diamond-shaped hand pose over a German flag with a blood-spattered bullet hole in the middle.  I offer you terror, death and chaos , the sign read. But the dozen or so protesters were dwarfed by supporters who applauded her message.  I m not sure if there was another way to handle the refugee crisis. Those refugees had to go somewhere,  said Willi Kordes, 70, who runs a sewage treatment firm in nearby Vlotho.  I don t trust anyone to do it better.  Working in her favor in the election is the fact that many of Germany s other established parties, including the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), led by her main challenger Martin Schulz, backed her open-door policy. The AfD, running a racially-tinged campaign that has put off some voters, has come off its 2016 highs in the polls. The one mainstream party that has offered a hardline alternative, the Christian Social Union (CSU), is the Bavarian sister party to Merkel s Christian Democratic Union (CDU). A vote for the CSU is akin to a vote for Merkel. A crucial factor behind Merkel s rebound has been the decline in asylum seekers entering Germany. About 280,000 arrived in 2016, with another drop likely this year. Merkel takes credit for this, pointing to a deal she brokered between the European Union and Turkey, under which Ankara has cut the number of migrants crossing into Europe via its territory.   But critics say the closing of Balkan borders   which Merkel publicly opposed   was the real driver. Some see parallels with her behavior in the euro zone financial crisis, when European Central Bank President Mario Draghi s pledge to do  whatever it takes  to keep the currency bloc together, allowing her to stick to a hard line towards euro states such as Greece without fear of consequences.  In the refugee crisis, it has been countries like Macedonia, Turkey and Hungary - which shut down routes the refugees used - that have done Merkel s  dirty work , allowing her to maintain the image of a caring leader who helped people fleeing war. The approach has helped Merkel extend her control over the political centre. Some right-wing voters may have fled for the AfD but polls suggest young, urban voters who traditionally lean left could fill the gap.  Germany s economy has been strong enough to absorb the influx of refugees without big cracks emerging in society. In reaction to its Nazi past, Germany has emerged as a more open, tolerant country than many assumed when the crisis hit. A survey published this month ranking the top fears of the Germans put terrorism at the top. But a separate poll for the Bild newspaper showed they do not see curbing immigration as a priority.  Germans are astonishingly global, liberal and open to the world,  said Menno Smid, head of the Infas Institute for Applied Social Sciences, which released a survey last month showing broad acceptance of refugees in Germany.  We are the winners from globalization. The economic factors that led to Trump simply don t exist.  ",worldnews,"September 10, 2017 ",1
Merkel challenger spells out conditions for post-election coalition,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel s Social Democrat (SPD) challenger said on Sunday his party would not form any alliances after a Sept. 24 election unless fair wages, free education, secure pensions and a commitment to a democratic Europe were guaranteed. The SPD was trailing Merkel s conservatives by 13 points in an Emnid poll published on Saturday, with 24 percent support. Polls show the most likely coalitions are a re-run of the current conservative-SPD alliance or a  Jamaica  tie-up of the conservatives, Greens and pro-business Free Democrats (FDP). For the first time, SPD leader Martin Schulz on Sunday laid out his conditions for joining any coalitions in a video broadcast on the party s website.  Specific policies for fair wages, good schools, secure pensions and a democratic Europe for peace - that s what I promise you,  61-year-old Schulz said.  An SPD government would implement these plans. They re non-negotiable for me. That s why I want to become German chancellor,  he said. But polls suggest the SPD s only option for gaining power would be as a junior partner in another  grand coalition  with the conservatives under Merkel. Schulz has put social justice at the core of his campaign, but that has failed to gain much traction. Germans have generally enjoyed 12 years of prosperity under Merkel, and she has trumpeted her economic achievements - such as reducing unemployment - throughout the campaign. In an interview with the Funke newspaper group, Schulz said he was against a re-run of the current coalition, an alliance that is always a last resort because it leaves little opposition in parliament.  We re not seeking to continue the grand coalition,  he said.  I m running to supersede Merkel.  Merkel warned supporters at a campaign rally in the northwestern town of Delbrueck on Sunday that the election result was not yet clear despite her lead in the polls.  A lot of people say the vote is practically decided already ... but it is not,  she said, adding that many people would make up their minds in the final days before the vote. She had on Saturday called for a high election turnout, saying:  We must fight for every single person to go and vote.  Germany s smaller parties narrowed down possible coalition options over the weekend, with both the Greens and the FDP saying they could not imagine a  Jamaica  coalition, the name refers to the black, yellow and green colors of the Jamaican flag.

Egyptian security forces kill 10 suspected militants in Cairo raids,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt s security forces killed 10 suspected militants on Sunday in a shootout during a raid on two apartments in central Cairo, the Interior Ministry said. Nine policemen, including four officers, were injured during the two raids, it said in a statement. An insurgency led by Islamic State in Egypt s rugged Sinai peninsula has killed hundreds of soldiers and policemen since the Egyptian military overthrew President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood in mid-2013, but attacks have increasingly moved to the mainland in recent months. Authorities received information about militants fleeing North Sinai to hideouts in Cairo, where they were preparing to carry out attacks on more centrally located provinces, the ministry statement said.  The police suffered their injuries after a suspected militant detonated an explosive device to block them from entering the building and during an exchange of fire that followed, security sources said.    One of the security sources said authorities suspect the individuals to be members of Hasm, a group which has claimed several attacks around the Egyptian capital targeting judges and policemen since last year. Egypt accuses Hasm of being a militant wing of the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist group it outlawed in 2013. The Muslim Brotherhood denies this.  ",worldnews,"September 10, 2017 ",1
U.S. denies Iran report of confrontation with U.S. vessel,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - An Iranian military vessel confronted an American warship in the Gulf and warned it to stay away from a damaged Iranian fishing boat, Tasnim news agency reported on Sunday, but the U.S. Navy denied any direct contact with Iranian forces. The American vessel turned away after the warning from the Iranian ship, which belonged to the naval branch of the Iranian army, according to Tasnim. The Iranian military vessel then towed the fishing boat, which had sent out a distress signal after taking on water, back to shore. The agency did not specify when the incident, close to the strategic Strait of Hormuz, took place. In statement, U.S. Naval Forces Central Command (NAVCENT) said the coastal patrol USS Tempest, operating in the Gulf of Oman on Sept. 6, heard the distress call of an unidentified small boat about 75 nautical miles from the Tempest s position. At the same time the motor vessel Nordic Voyager, much closer to the boat in distress, offered help and had made visual contact with it. The Tempest offered to support the Nordic Voyager which declined the offer, NAVCENT said.  Following the radio traffic from a distance, USS Tempest heard the Nordic Voyager coordinate additional Iranian Navy help for the vessel in distress to tow it back to Iran.   At no time was there any direct contact between the U.S. and Iranian maritime forces,  NAVCENT spokesman Chloe Morgan said. Tensions have been on the rise between the Iranian and U.S. military in the Gulf in recent months. In August, an unarmed Iranian drone came within 100 feet (31 meters) of a U.S. Navy warplane as it prepared to land on an aircraft carrier in the Gulf, a U.S. official said at the time. And in July, a U.S. Navy ship fired warning shots when an Iranian vessel in the Gulf came within 150 yards (137 meters) in the first such incident since President Donald Trump took office in January, U.S. officials said. Years of mutual animosity had eased when Washington lifted sanctions on Tehran last year as part of a deal to curb Iran s nuclear ambitions. But serious differences remain over Iran s ballistic missile program and conflicts in Syria and Iraq. The Trump administration, which has taken a hard line on Iran, recently declared that Iran was complying with its nuclear agreement with world powers, but warned that Tehran was not following the spirit of the accord and that Washington would look for ways to strengthen it. During the presidential campaign last September, Trump vowed that any Iranian vessels that harass the U.S. Navy in the Gulf would be  shot out of the water.  ",worldnews,"September 10, 2017 ",1
Canada deported hundreds to war-torn countries: government data,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada has deported hundreds of people to countries designated too dangerous for civilians, with more than half of those people being sent back to Iraq, according to government data obtained by Reuters. The spike in deportations comes as Canada faces a record number of migrants and is on track to have the most refugee claims in more than a decade. That has left the country scrambling to cope with the influx of asylum seekers, many crossing the U.S. border illegally. Between January 2014 and Sept. 6, 2017, Canada sent 249 people to 11 countries for which the government had suspended or deferred deportations because of dangers to civilians. That includes 134 people to Iraq, 62 to the Democratic Republic of Congo and 43 to Afghanistan, the data shows.  The number of Iraq deportations increased from 22 in 2014 to 51 in 2016 and stands at 35 so far this year.  The decision to remove someone from Canada is not taken lightly,  Canada Border Services Agency spokeswoman Patrizia Giolti wrote in an email.   Everyone ordered removed from Canada is entitled to due process before the law, and all removal orders are subject to various levels of appeal.  The Canada Council for Refugees has said existing avenues of appeal are too limited, leaving little recourse for people facing deportation to dangerous countries. Canada can deport anyone who is not a citizen, for reasons including criminality, exhausting attempts to obtain permanent residency and non-compliance with immigration laws.  The federal government has suspension or deferral designations for countries or regions deemed dangerous but may still deport people to them because of criminality, security risks or human rights violations. The United Nations  High Commission on Refugees recommends states refrain from deporting people to Iraq because of the human rights situation and the conflict there, said Jean-Nicholas Beuze, the organization s Canadian representative. But some regions, such as Kurdistan, are safer, he added.  The responsibility is on the state sending people back to those countries to make sure ... that those people will not become internally displaced within their own country and dependent on humanitarian aid,  Beuze said.     In July, a U.S. judge temporarily blocked the deportation of more than 1,400 Iraqis, many with criminal charges or convictions. They had claimed they would face death or persecution if they return to their home country because they belonged to minority groups, including Chaldean Catholics, Sunni Muslims or Iraqi Kurds.

Prosecutor links suspect arrested last week near Paris to ISIS,"PARIS (Reuters) - A French prosecutor said on Sunday that a man arrested last week after a police raid on a flat near Paris had a direct connection with Islamic State. Police discovered a stash of explosives in the raid last Wednesday in Villejuif, south of Paris, and found TATP, a product often used by suicide bombers.  A second cache of explosive materials was discovered in a nearby town the following day. Two men who were arrested were put into formal investigation on Sunday and placed in detention, the Paris prosecutor, Francois Molins, told a news conference. A third suspect was released with no charges.  Analysis from the material seized showed one of the suspects had been in direct contact in August 2016 with Rachid Kassim via Facebook,  Molins said. Kassim, believed to be a senior Islamic State militant,   was targeted by the U.S. military in a strike near the city of Mosul, Iraq, earlier this year. TATP has been used by militants in several attacks in Western Europe in recent years, including Manchester in May, Brussels in 2016 and Paris in 2015.

South Africa's Ramaphosa steps up criticism ahead of ANC leadership vote,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, a leading contender to become head of the ruling ANC in December, stepped up his criticism of the government on Sunday, saying state-owned companies had been  captured  and funds looted from them. Ramaphosa s remarks during a speech to an African National Congress meeting in the old diamond-mining town of Kimberley  were tougher than others he has made on government graft, signaling the issue will be a main theme of his campaign.  He also took aim   without naming them - at the wealthy Gupta family, friends of President Jacob Zuma who have been accused of using undue influence to win lucrative state contracts. Zuma and the Guptas have denied any wrongdoing.  Many of these state-owned enterprises have been captured by certain people, by a certain family,  Ramaphosa said.   All of our state-owned enterprises have been captured and we are saying we want to see an end to state capture and the money that has been stolen, we want it back,  he said, to roars of approval from the audience.  South Africa s top prosecutor said on Wednesday police were examining a trove of leaked documents detailing relations between the Guptas and Zuma, but it was too early to say if a prosecution should be launched. Ramaphosa said in May that South Africa was in danger of becoming a  mafia state  and he took a swipe in July at the Guptas over media reports that state funds were diverted in 2013 to pay for a lavish Gupta family wedding. But Sunday s remarks about a  certain family  were more pointed and come as the race heats up for the ANC s top spot. The next head of the party, who will be selected in December, will be its presidential candidate in 2019 national elections. Ramaphosa s main challenger, veteran politician and Zuma s ex-wife Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, will next week be sworn in as a member of parliament, a move which could see the former minister brought back into the cabinet, raising her profile. Analysts say she has the backing of Zuma s well-established patronage network as well as organizations such as the party s Women s League. Ramaphosa is a trade unionist-turned-business tycoon who has the backing of a diverse group of unions, communists and investors who do not always see eye to eye but want to rid the ANC of Zuma s influence and legacy.  The opposition has long accused Zuma of sleaze and influence-peddling while in office. He survived a no-confidence vote in parliament on Aug. 8 but 30 ANC lawmakers voted with the opposition, indicating deep divisions in the party that has dominated South African politics since the end of apartheid in 1994.

"Turks safe in Germany, Merkel says, dismissing Ankara's warning","DELBRUECK, Germany (Reuters) - Turks can safely come to Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Sunday, dismissing a warning from Ankara that its citizens should take care when traveling there due to what it said was an increase in anti-Turkish sentiment. Tensions between Berlin and Ankara have been bubbling for months and Turkey s warning on Saturday came after Germany s foreign ministry said on Tuesday Germans traveling to Turkey risked arbitrary detention even in tourist areas.  I want to say very clearly that all Turkish citizens can travel here,  Merkel said in the northwestern German town of Delbrueck during a campaign event ahead of a Sept. 24 election.  No journalists get arrested here and no journalists get put in custody. Freedom of opinion and the rule of law prevail here and we re proud of that,  Merkel said. She pointed to German-Turkish journalist Deniz Yucel, who has been detained in Turkey for more than 200 days. He is one of 12 German citizens now in Turkish detention on political charges, four of them holding dual citizenship.  We think there s no justification at all for him being in prison and the same applies to at least 11 other Germans,  Merkel said. Merkel, who infuriated the Turkish government last weekend by saying she would seek an end to Turkey s membership talks with the European Union, is expected to win a fourth term in the upcoming election. Polls give her conservatives a double-digit percentage lead over their rival Social Democrats (SPD).     ",worldnews,"September 10, 2017 ",1
Merkel optimistic EU dispute over refugee distribution will soon end,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she was optimistic that a dispute over how to distribute asylum seekers in the EU would soon be resolved after a court ruled on Wednesday that member states must take in a share of refugees who reach Europe. Speaking to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung (F.A.S.) newspaper two weeks before a national election in which she is expected to win a fourth term, Merkel said she welcomed the court s decision. Separately, the newspaper also reported that in negotiations between member states about redistribution, a compromise was starting to emerge which would link accepting refugees to payments that would come from the EU.  The vast majority of EU states had not filed a complaint about redistribution and do not take the view that they never want to take in a refugee so I think there s an opportunity to achieve a distribution of refugees that shows solidarity in the not too distant future,  Merkel said in the F.A.S. interview.  In its ruling, the EU s highest court dismissed complaints by Slovakia and Hungary over the mandatory quotas introduced in 2015 to relocate asylum seekers from Greece and Italy. Immigration has been a key issue during campaigning for Germany s Sept. 24 election. In the interview, Merkel said it was important to show solidarity in dealing with the migration crisis because otherwise there would be no solidarity on other issues in the EU and  that would be bitter for the cohesion of Europe .  The newspaper reported that in negotiations between member states about redistribution, a compromise was starting to emerge which would link accepting refugees to payments that would come from the EU. Citing sources involved in the negotiations, F.A.S. said EU member states had developed ideas such as solving the dispute by creating an incentive system in which the EU would give countries 60,000 euros for each refugee they take in. If an EU member state undercuts its quota by more than half, the 60,000 euros per person should be withdrawn, it said. As the distribution mechanism would be for a maximum of 200,000 refugees per year, it would cost up to 12 billion euros, the newspaper said. It would also be possible to put border guards or national asylum officers in overburdened states so they take in fewer migrants, the newspaper said. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere had told a Saturday newspaper that social benefits for asylum seekers in Germany were  quite high  and needed be harmonized across Europe.

Russia urges dialogue to solve Gulf crisis,"JEDDAH (Reuters) - Arab countries and Qatar should enter into direct talks to solve a diplomatic dispute, Russia s foreign minister said on a trip to Saudi Arabia on Sunday, urging all parties to restore regional unity. Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt severed ties with Qatar on June 5, accusing it of supporting terrorist groups - a charge it denies.  We have confirmed our position (that we are) in favor of settling the disagreements by means of negotiations, by directly expressing concerns and achieving solutions which would take into account the concerns and the interests of all parties,  the minister, Sergei Lavrov, told a news conference in Jeddah.   We are interested in all those mediatory efforts that are currently being made producing results and the unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) being restored,  he added. Kuwait and the United States have been mediating to reach a breakthrough in the three-month long crisis that has put the whole region on edge, and prompted Turkey to send troops to the wealthy Gulf state in a sign of support.  Last week, Saudi Arabia suspended any dialogue with Qatar, accusing it of  distorting facts , just after a report of a phone call between the leaders of both countries suggested a breakthrough in the Gulf dispute. Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told the news conference that Qatar needed to show seriousness in finding a solution to the crisis.  We want clarity in the Qatari position, we want seriousness in finding a solution to this crisis that leads to the implementation of principles which all countries support: no supporting terrorism, no welcoming unwanted guests, no spreading hate, no intervention in others  affairs,  Jubeir said.  The two ministers also discussed the planned de-escalation zones in Syria and unification of the Syrian opposition.  The kingdom supports the creation of de-escalation zones and looks forward to starting a political process that will end the Syrian crisis,  Jubeir said. President Bashar al-Assad s negotiators have not met directly with the opposition because there is no unified delegation from the High Negotiations Committee (HNC) and two other groups, known as the Cairo and Moscow platforms, all claim to represent the opposition.

"More than 300 Syrian refugees rescued, arrive in Cyprus","NICOSIA (Reuters) - Two boats crowded with 305 Syrian refugees arrived in Cyprus overnight, police said on Sunday, one of the largest group landings of migrants to the island since the outbreak of the Syrian war in 2011. The vessels were tracked sailing to the north-west of the island and were thought to have set off from the Turkish coastal city of Mersin.   For their safety they were towed to harbor,  a police spokesman said. One of the vessels had been taking in water, the spokesman added. Cyprus is the closest European Union member state to Syria, yet many fleeing conflict have largely avoided the island because it has no direct easy access to the rest of the continent.  The single largest group arrival since the Syrian conflict started was 345 people who were rescued in September 2014.  Police said they were questioning a 36 year old Syrian man believed to have been steering one of the vessels. The others would be taken to a reception center west of the capital, Nicosia.  The Syrians, who included many minors, appeared in good health. A woman and her infant were taken to hospital for precautionary reasons, the spokesman added. ",worldnews,"September 10, 2017 ",1
Australia gay marriage rally draws record crowd ahead of postal vote,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - More than 20,000 people rallied in Sydney on Sunday urging the legalization of same-sex marriage, days ahead of a contentious postal survey on the issue that has divided the country.     Organizers said the gathering was Australia s largest gay rights demonstration, as a diverse range of people clad in rainbow colors converged on the heart of the city to insist on equal rights.  We re blown away by the response,  Cat Rose from Community Action Against Homophobia said.  The force we ve shown today puts us in a good stead to win this battle over the next couple of months.       Though the postal ballot is non-binding, a  yes  vote is expected to lead to the legalization of same-sex marriage which could further fracture the government of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. Ballots will be mailed out from Sept. 12, with a result expected some time in November. The country s Opposition Leader, Bill Shorten, said it was the law that had to change, not the gay community.  We ve got one last mountain to climb  before we make marriage equality a reality. Let s climb it together, today,  he said. Turnbull, who has said he will be voting in support of same-sex marriage, told a gathering of the Liberal and National parties  faithful on Sunday that the issue was one where everyone is entitled to an opinion.  Many people will vote  yes , as I will, because they believe the right to marry is a conservative ideal as much as any other principle,  he said. His words were in contrast to those of one of his party s previous leaders, former prime minister John Howard, who officially launched the  no  campaign on Saturday. Howard said in a statement on the website of the Coalition for Marriage that there could not be changes to social institutions without wider consequences.  I believe there is a conflict here between those seeking the right for same-sex marriage and the rights of the child, and I believe the right of the child to have a mother and father should be preserved,  he said. The coalition, the lead campaigner against same-sex marriage, did not respond to requests for comment. It includes the Australian Christian Lobby and the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia.   However,  yes  campaigner Kerryn Phelps, the former chief of the Australian Medical Association, said the survey was about unifying the nation.   What we want is to see Australians united in marriage equality and united in fairness for all Australians,  she said. Rally attendees Stephen Madden, 55, and David Long, 47, have been together for 21 years and want to get married.   We ve had the world s longest engagement,  Long said.  My mum would really like to have a legal son-in-law,  Madden added. The Sydney event followed a similar rally in Melbourne last month which organizers said was attended by 15,000 people. Police declined to comment on the numbers at both rallies.  Australia is one of the only developed English-speaking countries not to have legalised same-sex marriage, despite strong popular support and the backing of a majority of lawmakers.

Cambodian opposition party to boycott parliament vote on leader,"PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodia s main opposition party will boycott a parliamentary vote to strip their detained leader of immunity on Monday and will instead go to Kem Sokha s jail to demand his release, one of his deputies said on Sunday. Kem Sokha, the head of the Cambodian National Rescue Party (CNRP), was arrested a week ago and charged with treason for allegedly plotting to win power with the support of the United States, escalating a crackdown on critics of Prime Minister Hun Sen and independent media ahead of a general election next year. Two aid groups run by the publisher of the Cambodia Daily, shut a week ago in a dispute over a crippling tax bill, said they were suspending work after their accounts were frozen. Parliament is due to vote on whether to remove the immunity from prosecution which Kem Sokha gets as an elected member of parliament. The ruling Cambodian People s Party s (CPP) majority means the motion is certain to pass anyway. CNRP deputy leader Mu Sochua said the parliament vote was illegal.  We can t accept this. We will demand that Kem Sokha, who has not done anything wrong, be released,  she said, adding members of parliament would hold a protest at the prison where he is being held near the border with Vietnam. CPP spokesman Sok Eysan said the opposition boycott would be unconstitutional, but the CPP had enough votes to strip Kem Sokha of his immunity anyway. Hun Sen, a 65-year-old former Khmer Rouge commander, has ruled Cambodia for more than 30 years and said last week he planned to stay in power for another decade. Next year s election had been expected to be his toughest electoral test, but Western countries and human rights groups have raised doubts as to whether the vote will be fair. They have criticized Kem Sokha s arrest, but China has given its backing to close ally Hun Sen. The evidence presented against Kem Sokha so far is a video recorded in 2013 in which he discusses a strategy to win power with the help of unspecified Americans. His lawyers have dismissed the evidence as nonsense and said he was only discussing election strategy. In recent weeks, Hun Sen has also expelled the National Democratic Institute, a non-governmental organization that promotes democracy, and ordered 19 radio stations off the air. The independent English-language Cambodia Daily shut last week after being given a month to pay a $6.3 million tax demand. Japan Relief for Cambodia and World Relief for Cambodia, aid groups financed by the paper s publisher, said their accounts had been frozen and they would have to suspend building schools and teaching English and computing to thousands of pupils.

UK publisher rejected request to block academic articles in China," (This Sept 8 story corrects headline, clarifies timing of request in paragraph 3.) By Fanny Potkin and Michael Martina LONDON/BEIJING (Reuters) - Britain s Cambridge University Press has rejected a request from its Chinese state-owned importer to block online access in China to scholarly articles from the American Political Science Review.  A request was indeed made by the Chinese importer, but was not acted upon by Cambridge University Press, so no content was blocked,  a spokeswoman for CUP said in an emailed statement. CUP later clarified that the request had been made early last month. China s State Council Information Office told Reuters on Friday that importers of foreign publications must verify that the products are legal. In August, CUP, the publishing arm of the elite Cambridge University, reversed a decision to block online access in China to several hundred articles and book reviews in the China Quarterly, a leading academic journal on Chinese affairs that has been published since the 1960s. It said it had blocked the articles, which covered sensitive topics including the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy protests, the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution and Tibet, in order to keep its other academic and educational materials available in China. Academics called the decision an affront to academic freedom.  The State Council Information Office, responding by fax two weeks after a Reuters request for comment, said that publishers choose for themselves to import materials based on market demand and the law.  All publications imported into China s market must adhere to Chinese laws and regulations.

"Weeks after row over academic articles, China says imported publications must be legal","BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese importers of foreign publications must verify the products are legal, China said on Friday, weeks after a British academic publisher which blocked access to hundreds of scholarly articles in the country reposted the material. Cambridge University Press (CUP) said in August that it had removed some 300 papers and book reviews published in the China Quarterly journal from its website in China following a request from the Chinese government.  It said it had blocked the articles, which covered sensitive topics, including the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy protests, the 1960s Cultural Revolution and Tibet, in order to keep its other academic and educational materials available in the country.

"UK doesn't need Brexit to curb EU immigration, says former PM Blair","LONDON (Reuters) - Britain could bring in tough new controls on immigration from the European Union without actually having to leave the bloc, former prime minister Tony Blair said on Sunday. Concerns over the impact of high levels of immigration on public services and housing were cited as a factor by many who voted to leave the EU in last year s referendum. Prime Minister Theresa May s Conservative government has said free movement of EU citizens coming to Britain must end. Many Brexit supporters blame Blair s government, which allowed citizens of former communist states to settle immediately in Britain despite a long transition period implemented by other EU countries, for a big influx of EU migrants from 2004.  There is no diversion possible from Brexit without addressing the grievances that gave rise to it. Paradoxically, we have to respect the referendum vote to change it,  Blair, who has said Brexit can and should be stopped, wrote in the Sunday Times newspaper.  We can curtail the things that people feel are damaging about European immigration, both by domestic policy change and by agreeing change within Europe to the freedom of movement principle,  added Blair, who led a Labour government for a decade from 1997. Asked about Blair s proposals, defense minister Michael Fallon said the government had to get on with delivering Brexit.  The country has taken its decision, we are leaving the European Union now and that means freedom of movement has to end ... there have got to be restrictions on those coming here,  he told BBC Television. A leaked government document last week said Britain was considering measures to restrict immigration for all but the highest-skilled EU workers, plans some companies called alarming. A paper published on Sunday by Blair s Institute for Global Change said the government could take steps including registering EU migrants when they arrive to keep track of whether they meet EU rules about finding work. EU migrants could also be forced to show evidence of a job offer before being allowed to enter Britain, and those without permission to reside could be banned from renting, opening a bank account or accessing welfare benefits, it said. The paper also proposes seeking an  emergency brake  to implement temporary controls on migration when services are stretched   a strengthened version of a deal offered to former Prime Minister David Cameron ahead of the referendum.

Suicide bomber kills six people in central Somalia: police,"MOGADISHU (Reuters) - At least 6 people died on Sunday after a suicide bomber blew himself up in a restaurant just outside a senior official s office in the central Somali city of Beledweyne, police and residents said. The al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab group said it was behind the attack.  At least six people died and several others were wounded. A suicide bomber blew up himself in a restaurant,  major Hussein Osman, a police officer told Reuters from Beledweyne. The Sunday afternoon blast took place outside the office of the governor of the Hiran region, where he was holding a meeting, police and residents said.  We are behind the attack at the Hiran governor s headquarters. There are casualties. We targeted the workers of the Hiran administration,  said Abdiasis Abu Musab, al Shabaab s military operation spokesman. Beledweyne is about 340 km north of Mogadishu. Residents said clan elders were among the dead.  The suicide bomber who had an explosive jacket stood inside the restaurant and blew up himself. We were heading to a meeting in the governor s office when it happened,  Farah Ali, a local elder, told Reuters. Somalia has been at war since 1991, when clan-based warlords overthrew dictator Siad Barre and then turned on each other. Al Shabaab has in the past carried out frequent attacks in Mogadishu and other parts of Somalia in a bid to topple the country s Western-backed government and drive out African Union peacekeeping troops. Al Shabaab also wants to impose its strict interpretation of Islam in Somalia. ",worldnews,"September 10, 2017 ",1
NATO's Stoltenberg says North Korea's 'reckless behavior' requires global response,"LONDON (Reuters) - North Korea s  reckless behavior  is a global threat and requires a global response, the head of the NATO military alliance said on Sunday. NATO has not been directly involved in the crisis, which saw Pyongyang carry out its sixth and most powerful nuclear test a week ago, but has repeatedly called on North Korea to abandon its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.  The reckless behavior of North Korea is a global threat and requires a global response and that of course also includes NATO,  NATO head Jens Stoltenberg said in an interview with BBC television. Asked whether an attack on the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam would trigger NATO s Article 5, which requires each member of the alliance to come to the defense of any other, Stoltenberg said:  I will not speculate about whether Article 5 will be applied in such a situation.    We are now totally focused on how can we contribute to a peaceful solution of the conflict,  he said.   There is no easy way out of this difficult situation, but at the same time we have to ... continue to work for political solution, continue to press also the economic sanctions.  The United States and its allies had been bracing for another long-range missile launch in time for the 69th anniversary of North Korea s founding on Saturday, but no fresh provocations were spotted while the North held numerous events to mark the holiday. Throughout last week, South Korean officials had warned the North could launch another intercontinental ballistic missile in defiance of U.N. sanctions and amid escalating tensions with the United States. British defense minister Michael Fallon also told the BBC he was very concerned about the situation.  We are doing now what we can to bring about a diplomatic solution, what we have to avoid at all costs is this spilling over in to any kind of military conflict,  he said.  The U.S. is fully entitled to defend its own territory, to defend its bases and to look after its people but this involves us, London is closer to North Korea and its missiles than Los Angeles.  Fallon said he did not believe North Korea currently had a missile capable of hitting London but said the missile program was accelerating and their range was getting  longer and longer .  We have to get this program halted because the dangers now of miscalculation, of some accident triggering a response are extremely great,  he said. ",worldnews,"September 10, 2017 ",1
"North Korea's Kim Jong Un fetes nuclear scientists, holds celebration bash","SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un hosted a massive celebration to congratulate his nuclear scientists and technicians who steered the country s sixth and largest nuclear test a week ago, its official news agency said on Sunday. The United States and its allies had been bracing for another long-range missile launch in time for the 69th anniversary of North Korea s founding on Saturday, but no fresh provocations were spotted while the North held numerous events to mark the holiday. Throughout last week, South Korean officials had warned the North could launch another intercontinental ballistic missile in defiance of U.N. sanctions and amid an escalating standoff with the United States. Washington told the U.N. Security Council on Friday to call a meeting on Monday to vote on a draft resolution establishing additional sanctions on North Korea for its missile and nuclear program. Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera said it was vital to put pressure on North Korea through additional sanctions, including blocking or slowing its fuel supplies.  If we put firm pressure on North Korea such that it realizes it cannot develop missiles, it will accept dialogue and we can progress with diplomatic efforts,  Onodera told public broadcaster NHK on Sunday.  Unless we firmly apply pressure, North Korea will not change its direction.  KCNA said Kim threw a banquet to laud the nuclear scientists and other top military and party officials who contributed to the nuclear bomb test last Sunday, topped with an art performance and a photo session with the leader himself.  KCNA did not specify when the banquet had been held, but analysts said it had likely been on Saturday. Photos released on Sunday by KCNA showed the young leader breaking into a broad smile at the People s Theater with two prominent scientists: Ri Hong Sop, head of North Korea s Nuclear Weapons Institute, and Hong Sung Mu, deputy director of the ruling Workers  Party of Korea s munitions industry department.  Ri and Hong have played vital roles in the North s nuclear program, appearing at close distance to Kim during field inspections and weapons tests, including the latest nuclear test. Ri is a former director of Yongbyon Nuclear Research Center, North Korea s main nuclear facility north of Pyongyang, where Hong also worked as a chief engineer.  North Korea had said the latest test was an advanced hydrogen bomb. There was no independent confirmation but some Western experts said there was enough strong evidence to suggest the reclusive state has either developed a hydrogen bomb or was getting very close. KCNA said on Sunday the scientists and technicians  brought the great auspicious event of the national history, an extra-large event through the perfect success in the test of H-bomb .  Kim praised the developers in his own remarks as  taking the lead  in attaining the  final goal of completing the state nuclear force  in line with his parallel pursuit of nuclear and economic development.   The recent test of the H-bomb is the great victory won by the Korean people at the cost of their blood while tightening their belts in the arduous period,  Kim was quoted as saying.  Ri and Hong s roles have also been noted overseas, prompting the United Nations, the United States or South Korea to blacklist them.  Aside from the elite, rank-and-file North Koreans also commemorated the anniversary on Saturday by visiting the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, which houses the embalmed bodies of founding father Kim Il Sung and his son and successor Kim Jong Il. KCNA said service personnel and civilians, including children, laid floral baskets and bouquets at the statues of the deceased leaders across the country, while enjoying art performances and dancing parties.

Karachi s Rohingya community comprises migrants from an earlier era of displacement dating back to the 1960s and  70s. Despite decades in a foreign land, they have stayed in touch with family back home, especially in recent years through mobile phones and social media.  In the past two weeks, nearly 300,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh after the Myanmar military launched an offensive in response to a series of attacks by Rohingya insurgents on police posts and an army base. Hundreds of homes in Rohingya villages have been burned and about 400 people have been killed.  The older members of Karachi s Rohingya community fled from a repressive military regime that took power in 1962, escaping on foot or by boat to Bangladesh, which was then East Pakistan. Eventually, they made their way to Karachi. Most of the people living in the slum called Arakanabad were born in Pakistan, or fled violence in their homeland decades ago. It s named for Arakan, which was what Rakhine used to be called. Raheela Sadiq, a more recent migrant who came to Pakistan 15 years ago, said she has been unable to contact relatives in Rakhine via mobile phone for nearly two weeks.   I have seen what is happening to people over there on the internet,  she said as tears filled her eyes. Videos and pictures depicting violence in Rakhine and shared on social media are passed around quickly in Arakanabad, adding to fears and anxiety about relatives back home.  Fisherman Noor Mohammed, 50, said three members of his  family in Rakhine were killed a few days ago.   My brother, brother-in-law, and nephew were there (in Rakhine). They are all dead now. The army over there killed them,  he said, adding that he heard the news from another nephew who is still alive.   Hoor Bahar, 60, said she left Rakhine with her husband over 30 years ago when her mother and sister were killed.   I have one sister left who went to Bangladesh seven to 10 days ago,  she added. However, she said, her sister is being held on a beach by boatmen who brought her from Rakhine and are demanding $350 as payment. Arakanabad smells of fish. The Rohingya who live here largely work on fishing boats, or clean the catch brought by fishermen who set sail from the nearby Korangi Creek.  Most of them say they are not able to obtain Pakistani identity cards, essential for opening bank accounts, enrolling children in schools, using public hospitals, and even getting a job.  Fishing boats, where identity cards are not asked for, are one of the few employment options left although fishermen can sometimes be asked for identification by coast guards.   There is no policy in Pakistan for the Rohingya,  said Noor Hussain, the Pakistan head of the Rohingya Solidarity Organization, pointing out that the without state-issued identity cards the community cannot progress. Thousands of Rohingya families are crammed into the one-room cement brick houses that line the narrow streets of Arakanabad.  Children play amidst knee-high garbage, and crowd around to share slices of jello topped with sugar, or other sweetmeats sold by hawkers.   The community is living in extremely difficult circumstances, and our youth is being destroyed because they cannot get an education,  said Hussain. Despite the poverty, the community raised around 1.5 million rupees ($15,000) over the Eid al-Adha holidays earlier this month to help refugees fleeing Rakhine.   Our community is not a burden on Pakistan,  Hussain said.   The government of Pakistan is making millions of dollars by exporting the fish our people catch,  he said, adding that  giving citizenship rights to the Rohingya would only benefit the country.

Nancy Hatch Dupree 'Grandmother of Afghanistan' dies in Kabul,"KABUL (Reuters) - Nancy Hatch Dupree, a historian from the United States who helped set up the Afghanistan Centre at Kabul University, has died in the country whose culture she worked for more than five decades to preserve, the university said on Sunday. She was 89. Dupree arrived in Kabul in 1962 as a diplomat s wife but soon divorced and married Louis Dupree, an archaeologist celebrated for his adventurous exploits and groundbreaking discoveries of Paleolithic Afghan tools and artifacts. For the next 15 years, they traveled across Afghanistan by Land Rover as Louis Dupree excavated prehistoric sites and Nancy wrote a series of witty and insightful guidebooks to a country since torn apart by decades of warfare.  She called herself an old monument and a lot of Afghans called her the  Grandmother of Afghanistan,  said Wahid Wafa, Executive Director of the Afghanistan Centre.  She understood and knew Afghanistan much better than anybody else.  A fixture in the social scene of Kabul during the 1970s, a now-vanished world of smart cocktail parties and mini-dresses, they were forced to leave in 1978 after the Soviet-backed government accused Louis Dupree of being a spy. Her husband died in 1989 and much of the time before her return to Afghanistan in 2005 was spent in Pakistan, where as well as briefly meeting Osama Bin Laden and working with the growing number of war refugees, she assiduously gathered as much documentation on Afghanistan as she could. In 2005, after the fall of the Taliban and the installation of a new Western-backed government in Kabul, she returned with some 35,000 documents wrapped up in fertilizer bags, which became the basis for the Afghanistan Centre archive. A prolific writer, she was director of the Centre between 2006 and 2011 and continued to go into her office after she stepped down, remaining an institution in the cultural life of Kabul and receiving a stream of visitors.    It was Nancy s aim to preserve Afghanistan s heritage,  said Wafa.  She was a very funny, interesting person who loved to talk to anyone coming to visit. She was kind, she was very giving with the information she had and she was always lobbying for the Afghanistan she first knew.  While she could be waspishly critical of both blundering Westerners and Afghans she felt were promoting a bigoted version of their culture, she retained her faith in her adopted country to the end, Wafa said.   Despite the 40 years of war in Afghanistan she was always hopeful of the future and hopeful for the future of the new generation in Afghanistan.  ",worldnews,"September 10, 2017 ",1
Israeli jets break sound barrier in south Lebanon causing damage,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Israeli jets flew low over the city of Saida in southern Lebanon on Sunday causing sonic booms that broke windows and shook buildings for the first time in years, security sources and residents said. Israeli warplanes regularly enter Lebanese airspace, the Lebanese military says, but rarely fly so low. The Israeli military gave no immediate comment. The sonic booms also caused panic in Saida, residents said. Tension has risen between Lebanon s Shi ite group Hezbollah and Israel, which last fought a war in 2006.  Hezbollah has played down the prospects of another imminent conflict but warned it could take place on Israeli territory, and said its rockets could hit targets anywhere in Israel. Israel s air force chief has said it would use all its strength in a future war with Hezbollah. The 2006 war killed 1,200 Lebanese, mostly civilians, and 160 Israelis, mostly soldiers.

Netanyahu's son under fire over 'anti-Semitic' imagery on Facebook,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - From an argument over dog poo to an alleged anti-Semitic caricature he posted on Facebook, Yair Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister s 26-year-old son, is courting controversy with his social media activity. The criticism of Netanyahu in Israel is turning into a sideshow to more weighty events: criminal investigations into corruption allegations against his father and mother. They both deny any wrongdoing. The young Netanyahu is widely seen in Israel as being groomed by his parents as a future political leader and the Facebook posts have attracted particular public interest. On Saturday, he posted a cartoon using what the Anti-Defamation League, which monitors anti-Semitism worldwide, described as anti-Semitic imagery in a Facebook post mocking some of his father s critics. It included a depiction of U.S. billionaire George Soros at the top of a food chain, dangling the world in front of both a reptile and former prime minister Ehud Barak, a frequent critic of Netanyahu. Jewish financiers controlling the world is a well-known anti-Semitic theme. Soros supports left-wing and human rights organizations that have been highly critical of Israel and its treatment of Palestinians. The Israel office of the Anti-Defamation League denounced the cartoon on Twitter, writing:  The caricature posted by Yair Netanyahu includes explicit anti-Semitic elements. One cannot belittle the danger inherent in an anti-Semitic discourse.  In further Facebook posts following criticism for posting  the cartoon, Yair Netanyahu, who is a university student, condemned the Israeli left for being two-faced in trying to silence him. A family spokesman said Yair Netanyahu would not be making any other comment. The prime minister refused to ask questions from reporters about the post on Sunday morning at the start of his weekly cabinet meeting. Last month, the son made another headline-grabbing post after a protester was killed during a white nationalist rally in the U.S. state of Virginia.  It appeared to suggest that hard-left organizations now pose more of a danger than neo-Nazi groups, which he wrote are a dying breed. In July, Netanyahu junior found himself in a bizarre social media row over dog poo. A neighbor of the family said on Facebook that Yair, who lives with his parents, responded with an obscene gesture and walked away after she had asked him to clean up the mess left by the dog he was walking in a park. The post went viral. A family spokesman said at the time that the woman had behaved aggressively and  Yair does not know if Kaiya (the dog) did defecate as (she) alleges . Some critics in Israel suggested Netanyahu s online activities were meant to deflect attention from his parent s legal troubles.      On Friday, Israel s attorney-general said he was considering indicting Sara Netanyahu on suspicion of using state funds for personal dining and catering services amounting to some $100,000. Benjamin Netanyahu, who has served as prime minister for 11 years, spread over four terms, is being investigated by police in two corruption cases. ",worldnews,"September 10, 2017 ",1
"Koreans in Japan wary of tensions with North, worry about backlash","OSAKA, Japan (Reuters) - Ethnic Koreans living in Japan are nervously watching growing tensions over North Korea and are wary of a possible backlash against their community as Pyongyang ramps up its sabre-rattling. While public antipathy towards Koreans does not appear to have escalated in reaction to the North s latest nuclear test and missile launches, the community has been the target of abuse by Japanese nationalists after similar incidents in the past. The North conducted its most powerful nuclear test ever last week, and in late August fired a ballistic missile over Hokkaido in northern Japan in a new show of force.     In the western Japanese city of Osaka   home to the country s largest population of ethnic Koreans   few are willing to talk publicly about North Korea, and those that do have mixed views on Pyongyang s actions. Pu Kyon Ja, owner of the store selling Korean traditional clothes and a second-generation Korean resident in Japan, said she felt the North s pursuit of nuclear weapons was a natural reaction against threats from the United States.  I can t say this loudly but I secretly think well done  on  North Korea s development of missile and nuclear capabilities, she said. North Korea is  under great pressure (from the international society), which I believe should end.   I m watching over the current situation with great hope,  she added. On the other hand, Chung Kap-su, another second-generation Korean in the town, said he hopes North Korea stops further provocations and pursues a peaceful path by seeking dialogue with South Korea.  North Korea can t defeat (the United States), so I hope it changes its way.  Some 453,096 South Koreans and 32,461 North Koreans lived in Japan last year, according to government data. Many were forced to move there during Japan s occupation of the Korean peninsula before and during World War Two. Japan passed an anti-hate law last year, which may be discouraging fresh acts of abuse against the community, but the issue still bears watching, said Moon Gyeong-su, professor of ethnic Korean studies at Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto.  When North Korea launches missile or conducts nuclear tests, for example, Korean schools have been an easy target for bullies and accusations (in Japan),  he added.

Wife of detained Taiwan activist to attend his trial in China,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - The wife and mother of detained Taiwanese rights activist Lee Ming-che were due to arrive in China on Sunday to attend his subversion trial on Monday, Taiwan s Mainland Affairs Council said in a statement, calling for Lee s safe return home. Lee, a community college teacher and pro-democracy and human rights activist, went missing during a March visit to China. Authorities later confirmed he had been detained, straining already-tense ties between the mainland and the self-ruling island. Authorities at the Intermediate People s Court of Yueyang city, in the central province of Hunan, said Monday s trial on suspicion of subversion of state power would be an open hearing. Chinese courts have video-streamed or live-blogged increasing numbers of proceedings in recent years as part of a push towards judicial transparency However, rights activists say that in sensitive cases, holding  open  hearings is a tool for authorities to demonstrate state power and that usually the defendant has agreed to an outcome. On Saturday, Lee s wife, Lee Ching-yu, asked during a news conference that supporters forgive her husband if he says something in court which disappoints them, as he might be required to give testimony against his own free will. On Sunday she declined to comment to a large media contingent as she checked into her flight at Taipei Songshan Airport, where she was to fly to Changsha, in Hunan province, via Shanghai.  Taiwan s Mainland Affairs Council said it would do everything in its power to facilitate Lee s safe return.  Our government s approach to this case has been predicated on preserving our country s dignity while ensuring Lee Ming-che s safety,  it said. Lee s case has strained relations between Taipei and Beijing, which have been particularly tense since President Tsai Ing-wen, leader of Taiwan s independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, took office last year. Beijing regards the island as a breakaway province and it has never renounced the use of force to bring it back under mainland control. ",worldnews,"September 10, 2017 ",1
"With Trump meeting, Malaysia's PM seeks to put 1MDB scandal behind him","KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - In a room packed with Malaysian civil servants, foreign ministry secretary general Ramlan Ibrahim raised his right hand as he read out an anti-corruption pledge. He was among thousands of state officials nationwide to take such an oath in the past several weeks, part of an anti-graft campaign called by Prime Minister Najib Razak.  The citizens are becoming more informed   they ask for public service which is more efficient, transparent and fair,  Ramlan said after the event in Putrajaya, the administrative capital. The campaign comes as Najib prepares to meet President Donald Trump in the United States this week, where the Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are pursuing investigations into 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), a state fund the prime minister oversaw. Najib must also call a general election by mid-2018 although some commentators have suggested he could do so this year itself. The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) has arrested  dozens of top officials under the anti-graft campaign, including officers at national oil company Petronas and state-controlled palm oil firm Felda. More than 600 arrests were made just this year, MACC data showed. The actions are unusual in the Southeast Asian country, where corruption is seen as widespread. Four out of five Malaysians aged 18-35 cited corruption as the most serious issue facing the country, according to a survey released last month by the Global Shapers Community, a programme under the World Economic Forum.     But critics say the campaign ignores the elephant in the room: 1MDB. The state fund is being investigated in at least six countries for money-laundering and misappropriation of funds, including an alleged $681 million transfer into the prime minister s personal account.  Malaysia s attorney-general closed the 1MDB probe in January 2016, and cleared Najib of any wrongdoing.   The U.S. Justice Department has sought to seize about $1.7 billion in assets allegedly bought with stolen 1MDB funds. Its lawsuits say those involved included Najib s step-son Riza Aziz and his close associate Jho Low.  In court filings last Tuesday, the FBI, which is conducting a criminal investigation, alleged that potential witnesses in the case fear for their safety and need protection.  But investigations into 1MDB in Malaysia appear to have shut down. MACC had  a roomful  of files on 1MDB, a former MACC official told Reuters, but the commission could not pursue it once Malaysia s attorney-general declared the case closed.  In a way, this campaign is the MACC trying to show that it is doing its job. Even if they cannot secure a conviction (against their targets), the MACC can show that it has done all it could to stamp out major corruption,  said the former official, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. Cynthia Gabriel, director of the Kuala Lumpur-based Center to Combat Corruption and Cronyism (C4), said there was  enough substance  for MACC to reopen the case on 1MDB.  MACC declined to comment on whether the commission would reopen its 1MDB investigation.   No comment on that, we are very fair in investigating anybody here, whoever they are,  deputy chief commissioner Azam Baki told reporters in Putrajaya. Anti-corruption campaigners say they fear Trump s invitation to Najib to visit the United States may affect the investigations in the United States.  Territorial influence and geopolitical interests of the United States appears to have hollowed out its commitment to fight international corruption, much to the detriment of the future of Malaysia and the world,  Gabriel said. U.S.-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) said Trump s invitation was  particularly inappropriate , given Najib s use of repressive laws to stifle critics.  There s little doubt that Najib will use this White House visit to burnish his credentials going into next year s election in Malaysia, and redouble his repression of critics using the stamp of approval from this visit,  HRW s deputy Asia director Phil Robertson told Reuters.  Najib has said he hopes his visit will drum up more trade and investment for Malaysia.  I would like to see this as a two way mutually beneficial partnership,  he told reporters on Friday.  I hope the U.S. sees Malaysia as a reliable partner on issues such as trade and investment, security partnership, counter terrorism and I also hope that U.S. companies see us as among the best countries to invest in.  A government source said a defense agreement was also on the table, although no details were immediately available. Senior leaders of the ruling United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) are concerned the party may suffer election losses from the string of graft scandals linked to Najib, a source aware of discussions within the party said. With Najib and the MACC s clean-up campaign, the source said, the party hopes to appease Malaysians frustrated with the corruption and draw back foreign investors who fled as the probe into 1MDB expanded. Besides diverting attention from 1MDB, critics say Najib is also using MACC s anti-graft campaign to target political opponents such as Lim Guan Eng, an opposition leader who is the top elected official in Penang province. He has been charged with abuse of power in the purchase of a bungalow.  You are going after all sorts of offences, but the biggest one, it stinks to high heaven,  said Lim, the secretary-general of the Democratic Action Party.  Everyone can smell it, except you.

Havana braced for floods after Hurricane Irma rakes Cuban keys,"HAVANA/CAIBARIEN (Reuters) - Hurricane Irma uprooted trees and tore off roofs in Cuba on Saturday with 125-mile-per-hour (200-km per hour) winds that damaged hotels in the island s best-known beach resorts and forced evacuations as far along the coast as low-lying areas of the capital Havana.  Power was out and cellphone service was spotty in many regions as Irma neared the end of a 200-mile (320-km) trek westwards along the top of the island. It was forecast to head north toward Florida in the evening. In the fishing town of Caibarien, residents swept mud from beachside homes after storm surge drove 3 feet (1 meter) of seawater up the shore. In streets carpeted with fresh green seaweed as the water receded, people said it was the strongest cyclone ever to hit the town.   Sheets of zinc that came flying into our backyard also damaged the kitchen wall and we lost many roof tiles,  said Angel Coya, 52, adding he was optimistic that Cuba s Communist government would help repair the damage.  We have to keep on.  Irma s turn northward was expected to occur around 150 miles (240 km) east of the capital. Nevertheless, authorities shut off power in large parts of the city and evacuated some 10,000 people from central Havana near the Malecon seawall because of fears of flooding from the storm surge. By Saturday evening, the sea had penetrated two blocks over parts of the city s historic seafront boulevard, and the waters were expected to advance farther as the surge grew. Restaurants on the seaside drive pulled down their shutters and stacked sandbags against the storm. Still, many Cubans expressed a sense of relief after the eye of the first Category 5 storm to make landfall on the island since 1932 passed over the northern keys, just grazing the mainland with its full force.  Honestly, I expected worse. I thought I would come back and find the roof gone,  said Yolexis Domingo, 39, using a machete to hack the branches off a tree that fell in front of his house in Caibarien.  Still, it is going to be a while before I can come back to live here. The water came up to a meter high and some of the roof flew off.  Overnight, the storm pounded the chain of pristine keys and tourism resorts that stretch along the coast from central Camaguey province to Villa Clara province, and it was headed toward Varadero, Cuba s most famous beach getaway.  Cayos Coco and Guillermo, the crown jewels of what is known as the King s Gardens, with 16 hotels frequented by Canadian and European tourists, sustained serious damage, local authorities in the area said.  At least one bridge on a causeway to the area collapsed, and the communications tower for the keys was no longer standing. Dozens of coastal towns were damaged, with some reports of collapsed houses, though no deaths had been reported.  This is a beautiful town but now it is a disaster,  said local resident Sandro Sanchez, 27, walking through the main square after the hurricane had passed Remedios, in Villa Clara. Corrugated iron from roofs were strewn in the streets alongside rubble. Lampposts were bent double, plant pots smashed and the fronds of palm trees shredded.  You can t do anything against nature,  he said.  We never had a storm wreak so much damage here. This is really a mess.  On Saturday, Irma covered most of the island, the Caribbean s largest. Its force sent shockwaves and flooding inward. In the city of Camaguey, Anaida Morales said she just been through a night from hell with her mom, stepson and husband.      The trees in the park in front of my house are down and others strewn all over the streets. Lots of roofs are gone and some houses collapsed. The river that runs through the city is about to flood,  she said.  The wind roared all night and it is still strong. I couldn t sleep. I m scared of hurricanes and this is the worst I have been through,  she said. Morales said she made a phone call to her daughter, who shares her name, in Florida, where millions of people were preparing for Irma s arrival.  I just spoke to Anaida, it is hard to believe she is getting ready to go through the same thing I just did,  she said. ",worldnews,"September 9, 2017 ",1
Florida Keys hit by near-hurricane winds from Irma - NHC,"(Reuters) - Wind gusts near hurricane force were occurring in the Florida Keys, the National Hurricane Center said on Saturday in an update on Hurricane Irma. The storm was about 105 miles (170 km) southeast of Key West with maximum sustained winds of 125 miles per hour (205 kilometers per hour), the center said.  Irma was moving west-northwest at 9 mph (15 kph).  The center said a weather station in Vaca Key reported sustained winds of 48 mph (77 kph) with a gust to 66 mph (106 kph). Marathon, Florida, in the Keys reported sustained winds of 51 mph (81 kph) with a gust to 71 mph (115 kph). On the Saffir-Simpson wind scale, sustained winds of at least 74 mph (119 kph) are classified as hurricane strength. Irma s maximum sustained winds of 125 mph were classified as a Category Three storm.  ",worldnews,"September 10, 2017 ",1
Rohingya insurgents declare temporary ceasefire amid humanitarian crisis,"BANGKOK/COX S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Rohingya insurgents declared a month-long unilateral ceasefire, starting on Sunday, to enable aid groups to help ease a humanitarian crisis in northwest Myanmar. Nearly 300,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh and 30,000 non-Muslim civilians have been displaced inside Myanmar after the military launched a counter-offensive following attacks by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) insurgents on 30 police posts and an army base on Aug. 25.  ARSA strongly encourages all concerned humanitarian actors resume their humanitarian assistance to all victims of the humanitarian crisis, irrespective of ethnic or religious background during the ceasefire period,  ARSA said in a statement.   The impact of the move is unclear. The group does not appear to have been able to put up significant resistance against the military force unleashed in Myanmar s northwestern Rakhine state. In the last two weeks, thousands of homes have been burned down, dozens of villages uprooted and thousands of people are still on the move toward the border with Bangladesh. The wave of hungry and traumatized refugees pouring into Bangladesh has strained aid agencies and local communities already helping hundreds of thousands displaced by previous waves of violence in Myanmar. In its statement, ARSA called on the military to also lay down arms and allow humanitarian aid to all affected people. Myanmar says its security forces are carrying out clearance operations to defend against ARSA, which the government has declared a terrorist organization. Rights monitors and fleeing Rohingya say the army and Rakhine Buddhist vigilantes have mounted a campaign of arson aimed at driving out the Muslim population. On Friday, the United Nations in Bangladesh found tens of thousands of refugees who had not been counted before, raising the count to 270,000 from some 164,000 the day before. On Saturday, that jumped by another 20,000 to 290,000. On Saturday, thousands of Rohingya were milling on the road near the camp of Kutapalong, carrying bamboo and tarpaulin to build shacks. Children and women flocked to every stopping vehicle, begging. Aid workers say a serious humanitarian crisis is also unfolding on the Myanmar side of the border. Red Cross organizations are scaling up their operations in Rakhine after the United Nations had to suspend activities there following government suggestions that its agency had supported the insurgents. The United Nations evacuated non-critical staff from the area. Thousands of displaced people in Rakhine have been stranded or left without food for weeks. Many are still trying to cross mountains, dense bush and rice fields to reach Bangladesh.   The U.N. and INGOs have not been very welcome in Rakhine and...they are not able to operate and ensure the safety and security of their staff and volunteers,  said Joy Singhal of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). The government had invited the Red Cross to assist them, he said. Aid workers worry many Rohingya had been left without food since mid-July, when the World Food Programme (WFP), which had been providing food and cash assistance, was unable to operate. The government said it would set up camps for internally displaced people in Rakhine but the move could draw opposition from U.N. humanitarian experts.

Exclusive: Flying into the eye of Hurricane Irma with U.S. 'Hurricane Hunters',"THE EYE OF HURRICANE IRMA (Reuters) - The sky darkened, lightning flashed and a jolt of turbulence shook the cabin of the hulking Air Force turbo-prop aircraft as it plied its way toward the eye of Hurricane Irma, one of the strongest Atlantic storms ever recorded. Piloting the four-engine, WC-130J aircraft was Air Force Reserve Lieutenant Colonel Jim Hitterman, who over the past 22 years has flown into 40 to 50 hurricanes.  Every storm is different but he likens the experience to driving through a car wash - with one big difference.  As you re driving through that car wash, a bunch of gorillas start jumping on top of your car,  Hitterman said, adding that sometimes shaking gets so bad, he cannot see his instruments.  On Friday and Saturday, Reuters accompanied the Air Force Reserves   Hurricane Hunters,  whose hard-won data taken directly from the center of storms like Hurricane Irma are critical to U.S. forecasts that save lives. Experts say U.S. satellite data simply cannot do the job.  We can estimate by satellite what the strength and size of a hurricane is. But only if you go into the hurricane can you really get an accurate measure of its exact center location, the structure, the maximum winds,  said Rick Knabb, a hurricane expert at the Weather Channel and a former director the National Hurricane Center. The 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron s  Hurricane Hunters  are based at Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, Mississippi. Its members trace the origin of hurricane hunting to a 1943 barroom dare by two then-Army Air Corps pilots to fly through a hurricane off Texas. Today, the missions are carried out largely by Air Force reservists who, after a few days or weeks of chasing storms, return to their jobs in the civilian world. Hitterman, 49, flies for Delta Airlines most of the time and, as a hobby, races motorcycles.  The flight meteorologist, Major Nicole Mitchell, is an experienced television news meteorologist and mother of an eight-month-old baby boy. She normally lives in Minnesota. The way Mitchell sees it, the more accurate her data is, the more accurate the forecasts can be that tell U.S. citizens whether to evacuate their homes as Irma or other storms advance.  It s a fact that we make a difference,  she said. Mitchell s plane would make four passes in total through Irma s eye during that mission, some entries and exits more turbulent than others. Its final pass came on Saturday, as Hurricane Irma walloped Cuba s northern coast. Irma s interaction with Cuba s terrain weakened the storm from a Category 5 to a Category 4 hurricane but U.S. National Hurricane Center warned the storm was anticipated to strengthen again.  Irma was expected to hit Florida on Sunday morning, bringing massive damage from wind and flooding to America s fourth-largest state by population. Millions of Florida residents have been ordered to evacuate. Despite the severity of storms like Irma and the undeniable danger on the ground, these U.S. flights into hurricanes have an incredible safety record - not one aircraft has been lost in more than four decades. The last time was in 1974. But they are not without risk. Some six hurricane or typhoon hunting aircraft have been lost in total, costing 53 lives, according to the Weather Underground website. Jeff Masters, director of meteorology of The Weather Underground, recalled an extremely close call during a flight into Hurricane Hugo in 1989 organized by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which also fields its own turbo-prop aircraft.  The pilot lost control of the aircraft, one of the engines caught on fire, and the aircraft descended rapidly, all because satellite data had given his crew the sense they were flying into a Category 3 storm. It turned out to be a Category 5. They were flying much too low for a storm that potent.   We went in at 1,500 feet, which is a no-no in a Category 5 and we got clobbered,  recounted Masters. The pilot was able to recover control after entering Hugo s eye. On the mission into Irma, jolts of turbulence also shook the equipment in the cabin as it neared the eye of the hurricane. Emergency parachutes swayed.  But then, suddenly, everything in the plane settled down.  It was safe enough to take off seat belts. The flying was smooth.   Inside the eye, the sky opened up. The dark  eyewall  - the surrounding ring of clouds - could be seen outside the cockpit window. Masters says someday drones might be able to do the risky job now done by experienced air crews.  But, from the cockpit of this Hurricane Hunter flight, that possibility still seems distant.  This aircraft, like all of the 53rd s 10 WC-130J planes, are     specially equipped to gather meteorological data and send it to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. Some of that equipment is operated manually.  That includes releasing sensors through the belly of the aircraft that, as they fall, transmit storm data including Irma s pressure, wind speed and direction. As the mission got underway, the sensors - known as dropsondes - appeared to be malfunctioning. Technical Sergeant Karen Moore, the loadmaster who releases the dropsondes from the aircraft, among many other duties, said she could not get its GPS signal as it fell into Irma s winds.

"Pope, in Medellin, recalls 'painful memory' of narco wars","MEDELLIN, Colombia (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Saturday visited Medellin, epicenter of Colombia s narco wars of the 1980s and asked that God convert the hearts of the  drug assassins  who cut short so many young lives. On his penultimate day in Colombia, Francis flew to Medellin, the city northwest of the capital that was once notorious as the stomping grounds of drug lord Pablo Escobar. In unscripted comments at the last event of the day, he said he could not leave without mentioning the  painful memory  of  so many young lives truncated, discarded, destroyed . He asked his listeners to ask God  for forgiveness for those who destroyed the dreams of so many young people. Ask the Lord to convert their hearts, ask for an end to this defeat of young humanity.  The Medellin that Francis visited is a city transformed since his predecessor Pope John Paul visited in 1986. It was then rife with violence among cartels, paramilitary groups and guerrillas that raged in the poor  comuna  neighborhoods on its outskirts. The city is now heralded as a model of urban development. It has installed cable cars up the steep Andean slopes that surround it to save working-class residents a punishing climb, and it has built libraries in sections that were once sites of gun battles. Feared drug trafficker Escobar, Medellin s most infamous resident, was gunned down in the city in a U.S.-backed operation in 1993. He was recently resurrected as a character in the popular Netflix series  Narcos.  At the start of the day, Francis said a Mass where he urged Colombians to help their fellow citizens who hunger for food, dignity and God, pressing his appeal for the South American country to tackle social inequality. Speaking in a homily to hundreds of thousands of people on muddied fields, Francis urged Colombians to  get involved  in helping each other and to embrace  acts of non-violence, reconciliation and peace.  The leader of the world s 1.2 billion Roman Catholics has brought a message of national reconciliation as the country tries to heal the wounds left by a 50-year civil war and bitter disagreements over last year s peace deal with leftist guerrillas that some say lets them off too leniently. On Friday in the tropical city of Villavicencio, the pontiff asked Colombians skeptical of the deal with the FARC guerrillas to be open to reconciliation with those who have repented, speaking hours after a top rebel leader asked the pontiff for forgiveness.. Francis has also used his trip to the predominantly Roman Catholic country to denounce the social inequality that still plagues Colombia, which has extreme poverty in some rural areas. He has called for laws to tackle the structural causes of these problems, which he said spur violence. Christians, he told the ecstatic crowd at the Mass,  are called upon to be brave, to have that evangelical courage which springs from knowing that there are many who are hungry, who hunger for God - how many people hunger for God! - who hunger for dignity, because they have been deprived.  He visits the city of Cartagena on Sunday before leaving for Rome that night. ",worldnews,"September 9, 2017 ",1
"Amid tension, Trump and Turkey's Erdogan agree to strengthen ties","ANKARA (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and Turkey s Tayyip Erdogan spoke on Saturday and agreed to continue to work toward stronger ties and regional security, Erdogan s office said, a day after he lashed out at U.S. authorities for indicting one of his ex-ministers. Ties between the United States and its NATO ally have been strained by Washington s support for the YPG Kurdish fighters in the battle against Islamic State in Syria. Turkey considers the YPG a terrorist group. Ankara has also been frustrated by what it sees as Washington s reluctance to extradite the Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen. Turkey blames Gulen, who has lived in Pennsylvania since 1999, for last year s failed coup.  Noting the strategic partnership between Turkey and the United States, the two leaders emphasized the importance of continuing to work together to further strengthen bilateral relations and increase stability in the region,  the Turkish Presidency said in a statement. The two leaders agreed to meet in New York at the United States General Assembly, scheduled for this month. The call was notable for its timing, coming a day after Erdogan described a U.S. prosecutor s indictment against Turkey s former economy minister as being politically motivated and tantamount to an attack on Ankara. The former minister, Zafer Caglayan, and the ex-head of a state-owned Turkish bank were charged this week with conspiring to violate Iran sanctions by illegally moving hundreds of millions of dollars through the U.S. financial system on Tehran s behalf. The indictment marked the first time an ex-government member with close ties to Erdogan had been charged in the on-going U.S. investigation, which has strained ties between the two countries.  For the moment, it is impossible to evaluate this within legal logic,  he told reporters on Friday.  I see this step against our former economy minister as a step against the Turkish Republic. He had also called on Washington to re-think the charges.  I hope we ll get a chance to discuss this issue in the United States. You may be a big nation, but being a just nation is something else. Being a just nation requires the legal system to work fairly.   ",worldnews,"September 9, 2017 ",1
Funerals crowd cemetery of dead from massive Mexico quake,"JUCHITAN, Mexico (Reuters) - Anguished mourners lined the streets of the southern Mexican city devastated by the most powerful earthquake to strike the country in 85 years, coffins raised on their shoulders as they advanced slowly to a crowded cemetery on Saturday. More than half of the 65 known victims of Thursday night s 8.1 magnitude quake died in Juchitan, a picturesque, historic city near the coast where more than 5,000 homes were destroyed and many more left without running water or electricity. In the Eighth Section neighborhood, a working-class area where nearly every home was damaged, a loud drum and horn band played traditional music before the funeral of one of the 37 dead so far recovered from the wreckage of the somber city.  The piercing blasts of the burly horn section at times were drowned out by the plaintive wailing of mourners for Maximo Zuniga, a little boy whose distraught relatives said was fond of his spiky black hair and bright red tennis shoes. The three-year-old boy was asleep when the force of the quake brought his brick bedroom walls crumbling down on top of him, his mother and an older brother. The boy died shortly after he was pulled from the rubble; the other two survived.  I could barely see a little bit of his hair peeking out and his forehead,  said neighbor Alejandro Sanchez, who was the first to come to the stricken family s aid.  There was a heavy wooden beam on top of all three of them and lots of dirt,  he added, as the dead boy s uncle sobbed uncontrollably nearby. The long, juddering tremor was felt some 500 miles (800 km) away in Mexico City and as far south as Honduras, but unlike the 8.0 magnitude quake in 1985 that killed thousands in the capital, outlying areas of Mexico were left relatively unscathed. By contrast, much of the hot, muggy city of 100,000 near the Pacific coast looked as though it had been turned upside down. Piles of rubble lay scattered across town, chunks of roofs littering the ground, and more than 300 locals were receiving care for injuries in area hospitals.    Many residents refused to stay indoors for fear that badly damaged structures might yet come tumbling down. Neighbors of the Zuniga family handed out red tulips and others set off fireworks. Then the assembled crowd of about 200 mourners set out for the local cemetery, four men carrying the boy s small white coffin draped in thin sheets of bright blue paper as the band led the procession. Snaking through narrow streets, the colorful flower-bearing train of people in T-shirts and caps had to step over piles of debris and masonry from collapsed walls as neighbors turned out to line the route, bowing their heads as the coffin passed. In the midst of a frantic search for a missing police officer, President Enrique Pena Nieto made a brief appearance on Friday afternoon in Juchitan s devastated downtown. Pledging help to rebuild and attempting to soothe raw nerves, Pena Nieto declared three days of national mourning. But his words were cold comfort for Alma Alverez, Maximo s 48-year-old grandmother, who crossed her arms as men shoveled dirt over the small coffin.  Pena Nieto was able to make it here in his helicopter super fast. That s how help should be arriving, right? Exactly how he got here. But it hasn t,  Alvarez said, reflecting a belief that Mexico s south has long been ignored by the richer north. Two other funerals of quake victims were underway in the same cemetery as Fernando Lopez, a cousin of Maximo, stood near the back, his head bandaged from cuts suffered protecting his grandmother from falling tiles when the disaster struck.  This is what you re going to see the next few days,  he said, pointing to the other funeral services taking place.  The whole town will be here in the cemetery or in the hospital. We ll tidy up what we can clean, but we won t be celebrating anything on September 15th,  said Lopez, referring to the start of Mexico s independence day festivities.  We don t have anything to celebrate.  Juchitan s mayor, Gloria Sanchez, agreed.  A great sadness overwhelms us,  she said.  The situation in Juchitan is critical, unlike anything we ve ever seen before.  ",worldnews,"September 9, 2017 ",1
Hurricane Irma poses toughest test for U.S. nuclear industry since Fukushima,"(Reuters) - Hurricane Irma will pose the toughest test yet for U.S. nuclear power plants since reactors strengthened their defenses against natural disasters following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident in Japan in 2011. Irma was on course to hit South Florida early on Sunday after slamming Cuba as a Category 5 storm. It weakened to a Category 3 storm with maximum sustained winds of 130 miles per hour (210 km per hour) on Saturday, but was expected to strengthen before reaching Florida, bringing a storm surge to a state home to four coastal nuclear reactors. The National Hurricane Center s forecast track shows Irma making landfall on the southwest side of the Florida Peninsula, west of the two nuclear reactors at the Turkey Point plant.  The operator, Florida Power & Light (FPL), has said it will shut Turkey Point well before hurricane-strength winds reach the plant. The reactors are about 30 miles (42 kilometers) south of Miami. FPL said it will also shut the other nuclear plant in Florida at St Lucie, which also has two reactors on a barrier island on the state s east coast, about 120 miles (193 km) north of Miami.  We will shut the reactors down 24 hours before Category 1 force winds are forecast to hit,  FPL Chief Executive Eric Silagy told a news conference. FPL said both Turkey Point and St Lucie were designed to withstand storms stronger than any ever recorded in the region and both plants are elevated 20 feet (6 meters) above sea level to protect against flooding and extreme storm surges. But South Miami Mayor Philip Stoddard said he was concerned about the potential for floods to damage power generators at Turkey Point, which in turn might threaten the ability of the plant to keep spent nuclear fuel rods cool. At Fukushima in Japan, an earthquake and tsunami disrupted power supplies and caused the fuel in some units to meltdown.   The whole site is pretty well able to handle dangerous wind, the real problem from my perspective is water,  Stoddard said. He said he was more worried about the nuclear waste than the reactors.  The real question is can they keep the spent fuel cool.  Peter Robbins, an FPL spokesman, said  Mayor Stoddard is wrong. Turkey Point is safe and is ready for Hurricane Irma.  U.S. nuclear operators have taken steps to improve preparations for disasters since Fukushima. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) required plants to install portable pumps and generators to keep water moving over fuel rods and the spent fuel pool even if offsite power supply was lost. Nuclear plants also hired more staff and stored equipment needed to deal with reactor problems.  Things are better today than in March 2011. Time will tell whether better proves good enough,  said Dave Lochbaum, director of a watchdog group, the nuclear safety project, at the Union of Concerned Scientists. The NRC said it was posting more inspectors at the two Florida plants and was considering sending more inspectors to plants in Georgia and South Carolina should the storm head that way. The NRC said the plants should not be compromised by Irma s storm surge.  The storm surge forecasts that we have seen so far do not challenge the sites  designs,  said NRC spokesman Scott Burnell. Both Florida plants have previously weathered major storms. Turkey Point took a hit from Hurricane Andrew, a Category 5 storm, in 1992, damaging a smokestack at fossil fuel plant at the site. Repairs cost about $90 million. St Lucie withstood the back-to-back impact of Hurricanes Frances (Category 2) and Jeanne (Category 3) in 2004. FPL shut St Lucie last October as Hurricane Matthew skirted the Florida coast. Lochbaum said the NRC and the industry could do more to reduce vulnerability to flooding. In January 2014, about 50,000 gallons of rainwater leaked into the St Lucie plant after a heavy downpour. An NRC study blamed degraded and missing flood seals that were not discovered during checks after Fukushima. There is also spent nuclear fuel at the site of a third power plant in Florida which stopped operating in 2009. That is the Crystal River plant, owned by Duke Energy Corp (DUK.N). Duke is in the process of transferring used fuel from the spent fuel pool at the plant to dry cask storage as part of work to decommission the plant. Once in storage, the fuel no longer needs cooling.  The NRC s Burnell said Duke has suspended work to transfer the rods ahead of Irma. He said the fuel was safe and the plant also has backup power, even though it has been shut for years. Irma is expected to disrupt much of Florida s power supply. FPL, the state s largest electric company, has warned Irma could cut service to about 4.1 million of its nearly 5 million customers. FPL is one of four large publicly traded utilities in Florida. Other natural disasters since Fukushima have shut some plants. An earthquake in Virginia in 2011 shut Dominion Energy Inc s (D.N) North Anna plant for about 2-1/2 months, the time it took to complete a full damage inspection. That plant sustained no major damage.  Hurricane Sandy in 2012 caused three reactors in the U.S. Northeast to shut but inflicted no serious damage. ",worldnews,"September 8, 2017 ",1
Heavy squalls with tornadoes from Irma sweep south Florida: NHC,"(Reuters) - Hurricane Irma was about 110 miles (175 km) southeast of Key West, Florida, and heavy squalls carrying tornadoes were sweeping across south Florida, the National Hurricane Center said on Saturday.  The storm had maximum sustained winds 120 miles per hour (195 kilometers per hour). The center said the core of Irma will continue to move near the north coast of Cuba for next few hours and should be near the Florida Keys on Sunday morning. ",worldnews,"September 10, 2017 ",1

I think now with what s happened with the hurricane, I m going to ask for a speedup.

Caribbean islands fear grim tourist season in Irma's wake,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Hurricane Irma s deadly tear through the Caribbean will hobble the region s multi-billion dollar tourism industry for months, just as hotels, airlines, and cruises were gearing up for the region s peak winter season.  As one of the most powerful Atlantic storms in a century, Irma has killed 21 people, leaving hotels, airports and other buildings damaged or flattened across prime vacation islands such as St. Martin and Barbuda. On Friday, it hurtled north of Cuba toward Florida. Jack Richards, president of U.S.-based tour operator Pleasant Holidays, said it may be well into next year before the local tourism industry begins to normalize, costing it billions in lost business. The region s busiest travel season runs from  mid-December to Easter, when Americans, Canadians and Europeans leave behind snow and cold for the warm, turquoise Caribbean waters.  Can this be repaired in time? The infrastructure to rebuild these countries simply isn t there,  he said.  This is just massive.  Just a few days after Irma razed the first islands, Richards said his bookings have already dropped for the Caribbean, his company s second-most popular destination worldwide for U.S. tourists. More than 26 million international tourists were expected this year in the Caribbean, the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) projected before Irma hit. In 2016, foreign visitors spent $31 billion in the Caribbean and were expected to spend an additional 5.3 percent in 2017. The WTTC estimates that in 2016, travel and tourism contributed $56 billion in gross domestic product.  Any disruption in the tourism industry is a disruption of our livelihood,  Caribbean Tourism Organization (CTO) spokesman Hugh Riley said.  Officials across the islands have struggled to gauge the scope of destruction, after Irma knocked out electricity and cell phone service, and forced airports to close. The trouble may not yet be over for the Caribbean, with Hurricane Jose forecast on Saturday to pass as a powerful Category 4 storm close to the same group of islands that were trashed by Irma. The hurricane season is set to run for several more weeks. As of Friday afternoon, the U.S. Virgin Islands Department of Tourism was urging visitors to stay away from St. Thomas, where four people died in the storm and where the airport remains closed to comercial traffic. The St. Croix airport was slated to reopen on Friday.  The 150-room Windward Passage, an upscale hotel overlooking the St. Thomas harbor in the U.S. Virgin Islands, plans to close for six months, it reported to the Department of Tourism.  On the tiny island of Barbuda alone, home to about 1,800 people and reef-lined beaches, preliminary damage estimates top $100 million, Riley said. Some 95 percent of the island s buildings were destroyed.      Cruise lines, tour operators and airlines have scrambled to accommodate tourists or postpone plans. Royal Caribbean Cruises, Carnival Cruise Lines and Norwegian Cruise Line each canceled several of their Caribbean-bound cruises through the weekend and rerouted others to avoid sailing through the storms  dangerous paths.  European tour operator TUI said it had evacuated its Florida customers to hotels in inland Orlando, and brought vacationers in Cuba to shelters.  German tour operator DER Touristik said it would bus tourists arriving by cruise ship in Miami on Friday directly to shelters, and that ships would leave the harbor again before the hurricane hits. Recovery efforts in hard-hit areas have so far proven difficult.  Rolando Brison, St. Martin s director of tourism, said firefighters struggled to hose off sand dumped by the storm onto the airport runways, leaving nearly 3,000 tourists stranded. The airport remained closed on Friday.  Tourism is the economy,  he said.  It s how our people eat.       (This version of the story corrects paragraph 11 to show that St. Thomas airport is closed, not St. John s) ",worldnews,"September 8, 2017 ",1
To flee or stay? Irma's shifting path forces some to reconsider,"MIAMI/TAMPA, Fla. (Reuters) - Walter Hodgdon scrapped plans to ride out Hurricane Irma on Saturday when shifting forecast models suddenly put his home on a barrier island on Florida s Gulf Coast directly in its path. Within hours, Hodgdon and his partner had hastily boarded up their home and were driving to North Carolina, having the time to store just a few valuable glasswares in an inner closet.   Last night, during one of the models, they drew a line right over our house,  said Hodgdon, 58, who lives on Terra Ceia where Tampa Bay meets the Gulf of Mexico.  We figured if we are going to leave, we are going to leave completely.  Hodgdon and his partner, Nels Gullerud, were among the scores of people living on Florida s west coast forced to make last-minute decisions about whether to hunker down - or flee - amid one of the fiercest Atlantic storms in a century.  Storm models that earlier in the week projected Irma to bear most heavily on eastern Florida now had the storm barreling right up the western coastline, menacing population hubs around Tampa and Fort Myers.  People haven t known exactly what to do, because the situation changes every 12 hours,  said Adam Gray, pastor of Redeeming Church in St. Petersburg, Florida, who two days ago week talked to relatives on the east coast about staying with him. Now his wife and young child had evacuated, while he stayed behind to help church members board up their houses and locate spare rooms on higher ground. He planned to open the church to those unable to find shelter. Others in Irma s path decided to take their chances. As surrounding neighborhoods evacuated, Andrea Prather of Fort Myers stocked up on bottled water and food to ride out the storm with her boyfriend and her cat. The 51-year-old pop singer felt safe on the 25th floor of a high-rise built to withstand hurricane-force winds. Still, as the most recent hurricane models showed the storm heading her way, her jitters flared.   When it made that turn, that s when I had that anxiety pit in my stomach,  she said.  How can anyone be totally prepared?  Michael Albrecht, a communications professor at Eckerd College in St. Petersburg, decided to stay at his parents  fourth-floor condo in South Pasadena, near the Gulf of Mexico.  He decided he would be safer in the concrete building with aluminum storm shutters, high above any storm surge, than at his own one-story house in nearby Gulfport, on a street prone to flooding and surrounded by tall trees that could fall down.  No branches can hit you up here on the fourth floor,  said Albrecht, 40.  I m worried about what if it s a week without air conditioning and electricity. That ll be inconvenient but not life-threatening.  But after a week of making and changing evacuation plans, Dionna Duncan, 48, on Saturday morning simply opted to leave her home in Palm Harbor, Florida. She had been working all week, without time to prepare. Plywood and other supplies were sold out. She could only put out a few sandbags. She remembered to take 200-year-old family pictures. But she left hanging in her closet the wedding veil that her daughters had wanted to wear someday.  You just forget, because you are in such a hurry,  said Duncan, who works in the insurance industry and had for years made detailed disaster plans.  When you are staring something like this in the face, it doesn t matter what your experience is. Most of your knowledge just escapes you.  Retiree Ann Pinsker, 71, and her husband chose to evacuate from their Fort Lauderdale condo on Florida s east coast on Thursday when they thought the storm was headed that way. After a 3-1/2-hour drive stretched into 9-1/2 hours, they now fear the storm is headed directly at the hotel where they are staying in Lakeland, in the central part of the state.  With Fort Lauderdale now predicted to be spared the brunt of the storm, their neighbors are sending them photographs from a  hurricane party  they are holding in the building.  I wish we were there,  Pinsker said.  But hindsight is 20-20.   ",worldnews,"September 9, 2017 ",1
Merkel suggests Iran-style nuclear talks to end North Korea crisis,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel told a newspaper she would be prepared to become involved in a diplomatic initiative to end the North Korean nuclear and missiles program, and suggested the Iran nuclear talks could be a model.  South Korea on Saturday braced for a possible further missile test by North Korea as it marked its founding anniversary, just days after its sixth and largest nuclear test rattled global financial markets and further escalated tensions in the region.  If our participation in talks is desired, I will immediately say yes,  Merkel told Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung in an interview to be published on Sunday. She pointed to negotiations that led to a landmark nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers in 2015. Back then, Germany and the five countries on the United Nations Security Council with veto power took part in talks that led to Iran agreeing to curb its nuclear work in return for the lifting of most sanctions. Merkel said that was  a long but important time of diplomacy  that ultimately had a  good end  last year, referring to when the deal was implemented.  I could imagine such a format being used to end the North Korea conflict. Europe and especially Germany should be prepared to play a very active part in that,  Merkel added. She said she thought the only way to deal with North Korea s nuclear program was to come to a diplomatic solution, adding:  A new arms race starting in the region would not be in anyone s interests.  Europe should stand united in trying to bring about a diplomatic solution and  do everything that can be done in terms of sanctions , she said. Merkel is expected to win a fourth term in office in a Sept. 24 vote, with polls giving her conservatives a double-digit lead over their rival Social Democrats. Merkel is widely seen in Germany as a safe pair of hands at a time of global uncertainty such as the North Korea crisis, Britain s looming departure from the European Union and Donald Trump s presidency in the United States. Merkel has spoken to leaders including Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe about North Korea this week. The newspaper said, without naming its sources, that she would speak by telephone with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday. ",worldnews,"September 9, 2017 ",1
"New Kosovo PM pledges dialogue with Serbia, graft fight","PRISTINA (Reuters) - Kosovo s newly-elected prime minister, ex-guerilla commander Ramush Haradinaj, pledged on Saturday to maintain dialogue with a former foe Serbia and put an end to endemic corruption. Haradinaj was chosen to form a new government on Thursday after his coalition struck an agreement with a smaller party, paving the way for them to take power.  Lawmakers endorsed his appointment on Saturday with 61 votes in the 120-seat parliament - ending a political deadlock that has persisted since elections on June 11.  There is no alternative to dialogue with Serbia,  Haradinaj told parliament.  Despite  a tragic history, we can not change the fact that we are neighbors,  he said.  Haradinaj s coalition comprises parties made up of former guerrillas who fought Serbian forces in 1998 and 1999. That campaign led to accusations of war crimes against him, but he was acquitted twice by a United Nations war crimes tribunal. His arrest in France in January on a Serbian arrest warrant for war crimes soured relations between Belgrade and Pristina. Haradinaj said his new government would fight corruption that has been deterring investors since Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008.    We have an endemic corruption in all institutions,  he said, ahead of an expected vote on his new cabinet in parliament where his party will command a slim majority. On Saturday, Belgrade officials gave support to 10 Serb deputies who have pledged to vote for Haradinaj s government in parliament in return for three ministerial posts.  But opposition lawmakers criticized Haradinaj for relying on votes of Serb deputies who they say would seek Belgrade s approval for any decisions they take.   It is unfortunate that after all these years the creation of Kosovo institutions is entirely in the hands of Belgrade. This is a catastrophic cabinet,  Avdullah Hoti of the opposition Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) said. Opposition MPs left the chamber as the vote took place. Central bank governor Bedri Hamza was appointed finance minister and Behgjet Pacolli, whom media refer to as the richest man in Kosovo, as foreign minister. The new government will have the difficult task of tackling 30 percent unemployment, and improving relations with Serbia, a precondition for the neighbors to move forward in their efforts to join the European Union. Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, almost a decade after NATO air strikes drove out Serbian forces that had been accused of expelling and killing ethnic Albanian civilians in a two-year counter-insurgency.

Philippine leader says 'no way' he'll do deal with Islamist rebels,"MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Saturday ruled out the possibility of allowing Islamic State-linked militants to flee a southern city in exchange for the release of dozens of hostages. The militants seized large parts of Marawi City on the island of Mindanao in May, and a hardcore of fighters has held out through more than 100 days of air strikes and ground attacks  by troops.  No way,  Duterte told reporters when asked about a rumor that one rebel leader, Omarkhayam Maute, had proposed releasing hostages in exchange for the safe exit of the militants. Pockets of fighters remain in the ruins of the heart of a city devastated by artillery and bombings, in an occupation that has alarmed the region about the possibility of Islamic State, on the back foot in Iraq and Syria, making a new home in the southern Philippines.  The military has launched its final push to retake Marawi, and is coming under heavy fire from gunmen as troops try to secure buildings and navigate through mines and booby-traps. The military estimates about 20 to 30 hostages are being held, some of whom it says were forced to take up arms against government troops.  If I can save one life there, I am willing to wait one year (to retake the city)  Duterte said of the hostages, after visiting wounded soldiers in Cagayan de Oro, a few hours away from Marawi. Martial law has been imposed in Mindanao, an island of 22 million people, until the end of the year, to allow the military to break up an alliance of pro-Islamic State militant groups. On another front, the military is also fighting communist rebels of the New People s Army following a breakdown in peace talks with the government. Duterte on Saturday threatened to expand martial law to other areas of the Philippines to crack down on the insurgents. Some 655 militants, 45 civilians and 145 soldiers and policemen have been killed in Marawi, according to the military, which says it has rescued 1,728 civilians. At least 400,000 have been displaced. Army spokesman Colonal Edgard Arevalo said saving hostages was the priority of the military s mission.  We are still very mindful of the presence of civilians -guns against their heads - who were made human shields or ordered to wield firearms and ammunition, were converted to become fighters and shoot at our troops,  he said in a statement. The United States has provided technical support to the Philippines military in Marawi. Visiting Manila on Friday, Australian Defence Minister Marise Payne offered a small  detachment of soldiers to provide training to Philippine forces. ",worldnews,"September 9, 2017 ",1
"On visit to Cartagena, Pope to honor 'slave of slaves' role model","BOGOTA/CARTAGENA, Colombia (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Sunday pays homage to the social justice legacy of one of his role models, Saint Peter Claver, who ministered to slaves in Colombia in the 1600s, defying Spanish colonial masters who treated them as chattel. Francis wraps up his five-day trip with a stop in Cartagena, the walled Caribbean port city that was a gateway for the slave trade in the New World. There, he is expected to hammer home his message that Colombia needs to address social inequality as it struggles to nurture a fledgling peace process to end a 50-year civil war. The Spanish-born Claver, who died in 1654, is revered throughout Latin America, particularly by fellow Jesuits like Francis, for his groundbreaking work with the era s poor and marginalized. Claver begged his Jesuit superiors in Spain to send him to   Cartagena so he could minister to the victims of the brutal trans-Atlantic slave trade, where African captives were bought and sold in colonial Cartagena s cobblestone streets. He boarded slave ships that arrived with their human cargo, distributing food on board and later ministering to the sick and dying in huts along the beach. Francis, who has made defense of the poor and downtrodden a major plank of his papacy, was greatly influenced by Claver s story from the days when he was a young Jesuit seminarian in his native Buenos Aires.   There are a lot of similarities that resonate with Pope Francis and this young, Latino Jesuit who has this transformative encounter with the poor,  said Father Sean Salai, a Jesuit priest and author of a book about the saints who influenced Francis. Through their encounter with the poor, both men moved  into more of a direct relationship with God s people,  Salai said in a phone interview from his base in San Antonio, Texas.  In a letter he called himself the  slave of the slaves forever,  and this encounter with the poor transformed him, much like Pope Francis, who gave up on the idea of doing a doctorate in theology to be closer to the people,  Salai said. While Cartagena s colonial historic district is Colombia s top tourist destination, the city, like much of the country, has deep socioeconomic and racial divisions. Poor Afro-Colombian street vendors sell coral and pearl jewelry, coconut milk and tropical fruits to tourists on the steps of the church named after Claver and where his remains are kept behind glass in the altar. Francis will pray before the remains, bless participants in two charity programs and visit a home where today s Jesuits help some 300 members of the city s poor Afro-Colombian community.  I came to receive the pope s blessing, to hear him,  said Liney Galindo, 32, from northern Barranquilla.  May God enlighten him to bring a message of forgiveness, reconciliation, and wisdom to us.      Francis also will meet homeless people and young girls in a Church program to prevent child prostitution in a city where young people are often victims of sex tourism and exploited by well-off locals and foreigners.

Uruguay vice president quits amid probe into use of public funds,"MONTEVIDEO (Reuters) - Uruguay s Vice President Raul Sendic presented his resignation on Saturday amid accusations that he misused public funds while heading state oil company Ancap. He first made the announcement at a special meeting of the Frente Amplio (FA) governing party.    I presented to the plenary of the FA my irreversible  resignation from the vice presidency. I also told President Tabare Vazquez,  he wrote in a tweet. The party s ethics committee has ruled that Sendic used his Ancap credit cards to buy personal items including books and furniture. He headed the oil company from 2008 to 2009 and 2010 to 2013. No criminal charges have been filed against Sendic.  ",worldnews,"September 9, 2017 ",1
Fires destroy more villages in Myanmar's Rohingya region: sources,"YANGON (Reuters) - Several more villages were burned down on Saturday in a part of northwest Myanmar where many Rohingya Muslims had been sheltering from violence sweeping the area, two sources monitoring the situation said. The fires, which started on Friday when up to eight villages went up in flames in the ethnically mixed Rathedaung region, have increased concerns that more minority Rohingya will flee to neighboring Bangladesh. Blazes started on Saturday engulfed as many as four more settlements in Rathedaung, likely destroying all the Muslim villages in the area, the sources said.  Slowly, one after another villages are being burnt down - I believe that Rohingyas are already wiped out completely from Rathedaung,  said Chris Lewa of the Rohingya monitoring group, the Arakan Project.  There were 11 Muslim villages (in Rathedaung) and after the past two days all appear to be destroyed.  It was unclear who set fire to the villages, located in a part of northwest Myanmar far from where Rohingya insurgents attacked 30 police posts and an army base last month, triggering an army counter-offensive in which at least 400 people have been killed. Independent journalists are not allowed into the area, where Myanmar says its security forces are carrying out clearance operations to defend against  extremist terrorists .  Human rights monitors and fleeing Rohingya say the army and ethnic Rakhine vigilantes have unleashed a campaign of arson aimed at driving out the Muslim population. Some 290,000 people have fled across the Bangladeshi border in less than two weeks, causing a humanitarian crisis. Rathedaung is the furthest Rohingya-inhabited area from the border with Bangladesh and aid workers are concerned that a large number of people were trapped there. The sources said that among the torched villages was the hamlet of Tha Pyay Taw. They were also concerned about the village of Chin Ywa, where many people sheltering from other burnings in the area had been hiding and two other settlements. On Friday, the villages of Ah Htet Nan Yar and Auk Nan Yar, some 65 km (40 miles) north of Sittwe, capital of Rakhine state, were also burned along with four to six other settlements. One source, who has a network of informers in the area, said 300 to 400 Rohingya who had been hiding at Ah Htet Nan Yar were now in the forest or attempting a perilous, days-long journey by foot in the monsoon rain toward the River Naf separating Myanmar and Bangladesh. Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi said on Thursday her government was doing its best to protect everyone, but she has drawn criticism for failing to speak out about the violence and the Muslim minority, including calls to revoke her 1991 Nobel Peace Prize. The country s Rohingya Muslims have long complained of persecution and are seen by many in Buddhist-majority Myanmar as illegal migrants from Bangladesh. ",worldnews,"September 9, 2017 ",1
Immigrants in Central Florida nervous about seeking shelter,"APOPKA, Fla. (Reuters) - With Hurricane Irma barreling down on Central Florida, Apopka resident Carmen Nova had a decision to make.  A Mexican immigrant living in the country illegally, she knew her mobile home was at risk in the storm. But the 30-year-old mother of three also knew that seeking protection could pose its own hazards.  In a time of increasing public sentiment against illegal immigration, undocumented immigrants like Nova are nervous about reporting to authorities, even if it is to take refuge from a hurricane.  There s an internal storm, there s an external storm, and there s a political storm, and they re all targeting this community,  said Sister Ann Kendrick, a Roman Catholic nun, community organizer and immigrant rights advocate.  They re getting hammered,  said Kendrick, who has worked hard in advance of the hurricane to convince undocumented immigrants that it is safer to take shelter than to remain in less-than-sturdy homes. Like other counties in Florida, Apopka s Orange County issued an evacuation order for people living in mobile homes, which are also known as manufactured homes and are a popular housing choice for immigrants. Fears among immigrants in the area were heightened in recent days after the sheriff in neighboring Polk County pledged to check criminal records of people seeking shelter. Although the statement did not mention immigration status and officials later clarified that undocumented immigrants would not be targeted, the warning nevertheless reverberated in migrant communities.  In Apopka, a town of about 50,000 people outside Orlando, Kendrick had plenty of work to do in advance of the storm.  The area s undocumented immigrants historically came to the area to work on farms but in more recent years have shifted to construction, landscaping and housekeeping.  Tirso Moreno, leader of the Apopka-based Farmworker Association of Florida, said the Polk County warning had an impact in Orange County.  It scared people,  said Moreno, who also spread the word with immigrants that they must take shelter. Moreno said he was not convinced that all the undocumented workers he spoke with would take his advice, saying some were likely to wait out the storm in their mobile homes.  The big problem is that many of them don t have enough information, although it s better than it used to be now that we have more Spanish-language media,  Moreno said. Kendrick said she fielded calls throughout the day on Friday from undocumented immigrants who wondered if it was safe to report to shelters. About 50 people, including several undocumented families, were waiting in line outside a shelter at Apopka High School when it opened at 9 a.m. on Saturday, Kendrick said.  They trust the schools, and they trust us, so if we tell them it s safe, they re coming,  Kendrick said. Nova, who cleans houses for a $15 an hour while her husband works as a landscaper for $12 an hour, was among those who decided to seek shelter, saying she would put her fate in God s hands.   If they ask for papers, I don t have them,  Nova said from her mobile home with boarded up windows as she prepared her family to move to the shelter.  The authorities will have to do what they have to do. I am not going to live in fear.  ",worldnews,"September 9, 2017 ",1
"U.S. undersecretary Shannon, Russian deputy foreign minister to meet","MOSCOW (Reuters) - U.S. Undersecretary of State Thomas Shannon will travel to Helsinki on Sept. 10-12 where he will meet Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, the U.S. Department of State said on Saturday. The meeting will  address areas of bilateral concern and cooperation , it said in a statement. Shannon will also lead the U.S. interagency delegation to the U.S.-Russia Strategic Stability Talks, it added. Quoting an unnamed Russian diplomat, Russian news agencies reported earlier on Saturday that the Ryabkov-Shannon meeting in Helsinki would take place on Sept. 11-12. Relations between Moscow and Washington are at their lowest point since the Cold War, strained by Russia s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the subsequent separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine, developments which led Washington to impose economic sanctions on Russia. U.S. President Donald Trump, himself battling allegations that his associates colluded with Russia, grudgingly signed into law the new sanctions against Moscow that had been drawn up by Congress.

Manchester concert venue shattered by bomb attack to reopen,"LONDON (Reuters) - The Manchester music venue where a suicide bomber killed 22 people as they left an Ariana Grande concert in May will reopen on Saturday for the first time since the attack. A benefit concert entitled  We Are Manchester  will raise money for a charitable trust in charge of establishing a permanent memorial in the northern English city. The victims of the May 22 attack at the Manchester Arena included many young girls, who make up a large part of U.S. singer Grande s fan base. The youngest, Saffie Roussos, was aged eight.  Parents who had come to pick up their children after the show were also among those killed in the attack carried out by Salman Abedi.  May s events will never be forgotten, but they will not stop us, or Mancunian music fans, from coming together to enjoy live music,  James Allen, the venue s general manager, said in a statement. The line-up for Saturday s concert, which was sold out, included Noel Gallagher, formerly of Oasis, one of the most successful bands to emerge from Manchester. Also performing will be local poet Tony Walsh, known as Longfella, who moved crowds to tears at a vigil in central Manchester the day after the attack with his poem  This Is The Place  which celebrates the spirit of the city. Grande will not take part, having performed at a previous benefit concert,  One Love Manchester , which raised funds for victims. The June 4 concert, which took place at a cricket ground in Manchester, also featured artists including Justin Bieber, Coldplay, Miley Cyrus and Pharrell Williams. ",worldnews,"September 9, 2017 ",1
Five suspected al Qaeda militants killed in Yemen drone strikes,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Five suspected al Qaeda militants were killed in drone strikes on two villages in Yemen s al Baida governorate on Saturday, a local official and residents said.   The strikes targeted two villages where al Qaeda is known to be active,  a local official said, adding that a total of five were killed in the strikes in central Yemen. Residents said two suspected militants were killed when a drone targeted the car they were traveling in.  Three people were injured in the strikes, they said. Yemen s al Qaeda branch, known as Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), has taken advantage of a more than two-year-old civil war between the Iran-aligned Houthi group and President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi s Saudi-backed government to strengthen its position in the impoverished country. The United States has repeatedly attacked AQAP with aircraft and unmanned drones in what U.S. officials say is a campaign to wear down the group s ability to coordinate attacks abroad.

Brazil top prosecutor requests billionaire Batista's arrest -source,"BRASILIA/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil s top prosecutor asked the country s Supreme Court late on Friday to approve the arrest of billionaire Joesley Batista, one of the owners of the world s largest meatpacker JBS SA, a person with knowledge of the matter said. Brazil s Prosecutor-General Rodrigo Janot had told a news conference on Monday that he was considering revoking a plea bargain deal struck by Batista and a fellow state s witness after they appeared to have inadvertently recorded themselves discussing crimes not covered in the deal. The source, who asked for anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, said that Janot had requested the arrest of Batista and Ricardo Saud, a former executive at the Batista family holding company J&F Investimentos, based on the four-hour recording. Janot s office did not respond to calls and email requests for comment. Joesley Batista and his brother Wesley confessed to bribing scores of politicians in plea bargain testimony that allowed them to avoid prosecution. Amongst the evidence they provided to prosecutors was a recording of President Michel Temer apparently endorsing hush payments to a possible witness in a graft probe.  The source said that Janot had revoked the benefits granted under the plea bargain deal to Joesley and Ricardo Saud, a former executive of holding company J&F Investimentos, through which the Batista family controls JBS.  He also asked Supreme Court Justice Edson Facchin to authorize the arrest of a former prosecutor, Marcelo Miller, the source said.  The taped conversation, which was made public by the Supreme Court this week, was inadvertently submitted to prosecutors with unrelated material last week.  In it, Batista and Saud say Miller helped the Batista brothers strike their plea bargain before leaving the Prosecutors Office in April to work in a private law firm. In a statement this week, J&F said Batista and Saud were simply discussing hypotheses in the conversation, not facts. Batista s lawyer, Pierpaolo Bottini, filed a request on Saturday for the Supreme Court to hear defense arguments before authorizing the arrest of his client and Saud. The lawyer also said Batista and Ricardo Saud are willing to surrender their passports.  A lawyer for Miller, Andr  Perecmanis, said on Saturday his client did not help the Batistas in their plea deal while working as a prosecutor.  Another source with knowledge of the matter said the leniency agreement of J&F Investimentos SA, which the company signed in May agreeing to pay a record leniency fine of 10.3 billion reais ($3.3 billion) for its role in the political bribery scheme, had been validated on Friday by a federal court. The source, asking for anonymity to discuss the matter freely, said that if a plea bargain by J&F Investimentos is canceled, the leniency agreement may also lose effect. A string of asset sales depend on the validity of the leniency agreement.  In three months, the holding company has signed agreements to sell Havaianas flip-flops maker Alpargatas SA ALPA4.SA, dairy company Vigor Alimentos SA and pulpmaker Eldorado Brasil Celulose SA, but the sales may only be finalized if the leniency agreement is still valid.

Lebanon arrests former mayor in border town near Syria: security sources,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanese security forces arrested a former mayor of the town of Arsal near the Syrian border on Saturday in connection with the capture of Lebanese soldiers, security sources said. Ali al-Hujeiri also stands accused of collusion with the Nusra Front Islamist group, al Qaeda s former Syria branch, the sources said. Militants from the Nusra Front and Islamic State briefly overran Arsal in 2014 and captured a number of soldiers before they withdrew during clashes with the army. Nusra Front released 16 soldiers in 2015 in exchange for the release of jailed Islamists. Islamic State killed all nine soldiers it had captured. Both groups were driven from their last foothold at the Syria-Lebanon border in recent separate offensives by the army and Lebanese Shi ite group Hezbollah. It was not immediately clear which group of captured soldiers Hujeiri was being accused over. Lebanese President Michel Aoun said this week the army was investigating the circumstances that led to the capture of the soldiers killed by Islamic State. ",worldnews,"September 9, 2017 ",1
"U.S.-backed forces, Syrian army advance separately on Islamic State in Deir al-Zor","BEIRUT/AL SHADADI, Syria (Reuters) - U.S.-backed militias and the Syrian army advanced in separate offensives against Islamic State in eastern Syria on Saturday, piling pressure on shrinking territory the group still holds in oil-rich areas near the Iraqi border. Syrian government forces fought their way to an air base on the outskirts of Deir al-Zor city that had been besieged for years by the jihadists, said a commander in the military alliance fighting in support of President Bashar al-Assad. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a U.S.-backed alliance of mostly Arab and Kurdish fighters, meanwhile launched attacks against Islamic State in the north of Deir al-Zor province in an operation to capture areas east of the Euphrates river. The advances against Islamic State, another blow to its control over territory it held for years as part of a self-declared caliphate, will likely bring U.S.-backed forces and the Syrian government side, backed by Russia and Iran, into closer proximity. A U.S. warplane shot down a Syrian army jet near Raqqa in June and the SDF accused the Syrian government of bombing its positions, showing the risk of escalation between warring sides in a crowded battlefield. The Syrian conflict, which started as a popular uprising against Assad in 2011, has drawn in the United States, Russia and regional powers. Peace talks have failed to bring an end to a war where Islamist groups have increasingly dominated Syria s armed opposition. The SDF operation in Deir al-Zor province aims to capture areas in its northern and eastern countryside and advance towards the Euphrates, according to the Deir al-Zor Military Council, which is fighting as part of the SDF.  The first step is to free the eastern bank of the Euphrates and the areas Islamic State still holds,  Ahmed Abu Kholeh, head of the military council, told Reuters after the announcement.  We re not specifying a timeframe but we hope it will be a quick operation,  he said at the town of al-Shadadi in Hasaka province. Abu Kholeh would not say whether there were plans to advance on Deir al-Zor city itself.  We don t know how the battles will go after this,  he said. He said SDF fighters did not expect clashes with Syrian government forces, but if fired upon  we will respond . The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group reported that SDF forces had advanced against IS in Deir al-Zor s northwestern countryside, seizing several hilltops and a village. Syrian government forces and their allies reached Deir al-Zor military airport on the other side of the Euphrates, where troops had been holed up since 2014, surrounded by Islamic State, the commander in the pro-Assad alliance said. The alliance includes Iran-backed militias and the powerful Lebanese Shi ite group Hezbollah. The advance came days after the army and its allies broke the siege of the main part of the city, which had been separated from the airport by IS attacks a few months before. Syrian troops also recaptured the Teym oilfield southwest of Deir al-Zor and seized part of a main highway running downstream to the city of al-Mayadeen, to which many IS militants have retreated, the British-based Observatory said. That advance would help block potential IS reinforcements from al-Mayadeen, it said. Islamic State in Syria still holds much of Deir al-Zor province and half the city, as well some territory further west near Homs and Hama, where government forces recaptured several villages on Saturday, pro-Damascus media reported. But the group has lost most of its caliphate which from 2014 stretched across swathes of Syria and Iraq, including oil-rich Deir al-Zor. The SDF is still battling to eject IS from the remaining areas it holds in Raqqa, northwest of Deir al-Zor and once the group s main Syria stronghold from where it planned attacks abroad. Talks between Russia, Iran and opposition backer Turkey in the Kazakh capital Astana are to take place next week, possibly followed by a separate track at the United Nations in Geneva in October or November. Assad s government has participated in previous rounds from a position of power as Damascus has clawed back much territory, including the main urban centers in the west of the country and increasingly eastern desert held by IS. Syria s non-Islamist opposition holds some pockets of territory in western Syria, and the SDF, which is dominated by the Kurdish YPG militia, controls much of Syria s northeast.

"France discusses increased pressure on North Korea with Trump, Abe","PARIS (Reuters) - France s Emmanuel Macron discussed increased pressure and sanctions on North Korea on the telephone with U.S. President Donald Trump and Japan s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Saturday, the French president s office said. The three leaders stressed the need for a  united and firm  reaction from the international community toward Pyongyang, Macron s office said.

The French presidency said North Korea s  repeated provocations  were a  threat to peace and international security . It also said Macron had expressed France s  solidarity  with Japan. Tension on the Korean peninsula has escalated as North Korea s leader, Kim Jong Un, has stepped up the development of weapons, testing a string of missiles this year, including one flying over Japan. Experts believe the Pyongyang government is close to its goal of developing a powerful nuclear weapon capable of reaching the United States, something U.S. President Trump has vowed to prevent.

Germany's Greens all but rule out three-way 'Jamaica' coalition,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany s Greens on Saturday all but ruled out a three-way coalition with Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives and the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) after the Sept. 24 election and a conservative said such an alliance would not be ideal. Polls show Merkel s conservatives are likely to win the election with around 38 percent of the vote but will be left in need of a coalition partner. Their rival Social Democrats (SPD) are lagging on around 22 percent. Possible coalition options include a repeat of the current  grand coalition  between the conservatives and SPD or a  Jamaica coalition  of the conservatives, FDP and Greens - the name referring to the black, yellow and green colors of the Jamaican flag. Katrin Goering-Eckhardt, one of the Greens  two top candidates, told regional newspaper Passauer Neue Presse:  I can t imagine Jamaica.  Coalitions tend to be tested at the state level before they are formed at the national level. A Jamaica alliance was formed in the coastal state of Schleswig-Holstein after Merkel s Christian Democrats (CDU) won an election there in May. But Goering-Eckhardt said the Greens and FDP had  diametrically opposed positions  on issues including climate protection, emission thresholds for clean cars and refugees.  I can t see how it could work at the national level,  she said. FDP leader Christian Lindner told Focus magazine he was also unable to envisage a Jamaica coalition given the hurdles to reaching agreement with the Greens on immigration and energy. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere, a senior conservative, told regional newspaper Rheinische Post neither the conservatives nor the SPD wanted to continue the current  grand coalition  because it  is not good for democracy , referring to the small parliamentary opposition that such a tie-up leaves. But he added that it would be harder to reach agreements with the Greens and FDP on domestic security than it has been with the SPD.  From a security perspective it would be good if the conservative bloc could choose a two-way alliance,  he said. Cem Ozdemir, the Greens  other top candidate, said in an interview with Tagesspiegel am Sonntag newspaper that his party wanted to be in the next federal government, which he suggested would be formed by Merkel:  The race for first place seems to be over - Angela Merkel is out in front.   But the latest polls show Merkel s conservatives and the Greens would not be able to muster enough support between them to form a two-way alliance. While support for the Greens has dropped to single digits this year - it is on 8 percent in the latest polls - a Forsa survey published this week showed half of Germans would welcome the Greens being part of the post-election government. Merkel on Saturday reiterated her warning to voters about a coalition between the SPD, radical Left party and Greens, telling voters in the southwestern city of Reutlingen that a red-red-green tie-up would be  bad for our country  and Germany should not embark on any experiments at a time of uncertainty. A red-red-green alliance, which had seemed a possible option early this year, has not been able to get a majority in polls for weeks. ",worldnews,"September 9, 2017 ",1
German minister urges EU to standardize asylum seeker benefits,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Social benefits for asylum seekers in Germany are  quite high  and they need to be harmonized across Europe, the country s interior minister was quoted on Saturday as saying, two weeks before a national election in which immigration is a key issue. Thomas de Maiziere belongs to Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives, who are expected again to emerge as the biggest party after the Sept. 24 election despite losing some support to the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD). The right-wing AfD, which has tried to tap into public disquiet over Merkel s 2015 decision to open German borders to more than a million migrants, is expected to win up to 11 percent in the election and enter the federal parliament for the first time. In an interview published in the regional newspaper Rheinische Post, de Maiziere appeared to target voters particularly concerned by the migrant influx, saying asylum procedures and benefits for asylum seekers needed to be harmonized across the 28-nation European Union.  What we need next is a standardized asylum system in Europe and we re currently negotiating that in the EU - it can t be that the standards are so different in Romania, Finland, Portugal and Germany,  he said.  Germany is the country that most (asylum seekers) want to live in because the process and conditions for being accepted are relatively generous compared with other European countries and the benefits for refugees are quite high compared with other EU member countries,  he said. De Maiziere said a more harmonized system could involve possible subsidies for migrants to help cover higher living costs in countries such as Germany on top of a uniform amount agreed at the level of the EU. He also called for common legal standards, saying:  Asylum seekers here can drag out their deportation significantly more than they can elsewhere using various legal paths.

Turkey cautions citizens about travel to 'anti-Turkey' Germany,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey cautioned its citizens on Saturday to take care when traveling to Germany, citing what it said was an upswing in anti-Turkish sentiment ahead of a German national election later this month. The advisory is likely to further exacerbate tensions between the two NATO allies, whose ties have soured following last year s failed coup against Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and his subsequent crackdown on alleged coup supporters.  The political leadership campaigns in Germany are based on anti-Turkey sentiment and preventing our country s EU membership. The political atmosphere... has actually been under the effects of far-right and even racist rhetoric for some time,  Turkey s foreign mininstry said in a statement. Last weekend German Chancellor Angela Merkel said during a televised election debate that she would seek an end to Turkey s membership talks with the European Union, in an apparent shift of her position that infuriated Ankara.  Merkel, whose conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) have long been skeptical about Turkey s EU ambitions, is expected to win a fourth term in office in Germany s Sept. 24 election.  Turkish citizens who live in, or who plan to travel to, Germany should be cautious and act prudently in cases of possible incidents, behavior or verbal assaults of xenophobia and racism,  the foreign ministry said. The advisory marks a reversal of roles. Earlier this year Germany warned its own citizens traveling to Turkey about increased tensions and protests ahead of a Turkish referendum on April 16 which considerably expanded Erdogan s powers. Merkel and other EU leaders have strongly criticized Erdogan s actions since the failed coup, saying his purges of Turkey s state institutions and armed forces amount to a deliberate attempt to stifle criticism. More than 50,000 people have been detained and 150,000  suspended in the crackdown, including journalists and opposition figures. Some German nationals have also been targeted. Turkey says the purges are necessary given the extent of the security threat it faces. ",worldnews,"September 9, 2017 ",1
Togo must introduce two-term limit swiftly to prevent crisis: U.N.,"DAKAR (Reuters) - Togo must go the way of other West African nations and swiftly limit presidential terms to two if it wants to prevent protests escalating into a political crisis, the United Nations envoy to the region said on Saturday. Thousands of people have taken to the streets in the past three days to demand that President Faure Gnassingbe step aside, in the most serious challenge to his family s 50-year ruling dynasty since the death of his father in 2005. Police have responded with tear gas, although avoiding the bloodshed that has tarnished previous demonstrations, and internet and phone calls have been restricted. There were no further reports of protests on Saturday, and they seemed to have died down, but the opposition said they would continue until Gnassingbe steps aside.   It has become unavoidable for Togo to join the rest of West Africa in having term limitations,  U.N. Special Representative for West Africa and the Sahel Mohamed Ibn Chambas told Reuters in a telephone interview. Since Gambia s Yahya Jammeh was forced out after losing an election last December, all West African countries except Togo have accepted two-term limits on presidential office   bucking a regressive trend across Africa to remove them and re-enable  presidents for life .  Our main perspective is to advise the Togolese to take those actions to prevent an escalation,  he added.  We are in a region where the security challenges are real and menacing and so we don t want to see any deep political crisis.  He said a move by Gnassingbe s government this week to propose a draft bill to reform the constitution and reintroduce a two-term limit was welcome. The opposition has rejected it because it says it would enable him to stay in power until 2030.  I suspect the devil is in the detail. We have to wait to see the formulation of the draft,  Chambas said. An official in Gnassingbe s cabinet did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but Chambas said he had received assurances during his meeting with the president on Friday that he had  heard the people . The president s father Gnassingbe Eyadema seized power in a 1967 coup and ruled for 38 years before his death. He brought in a two-term limit in 1992, in response to protests, then scrapped it a decade later when he decided he wanted to run again. When he died in 2005, the military installed his son instead of the national assembly head, as was constitutionally mandated, stoking protests in which at least 500 people were killed.  Faure Gnassingbe has since sought to remodel Togo as a shipping, banking and airline hub modeled on Dubai or Singapore, with some limited success in port upgrades, regional airline operator Asky and pan-African bank Ecobank.  Chambas urged the government to move swiftly with changes.  My biggest fear for it to go to the national assembly and there be a total blockage. I hope there will be a clear time line...not a perception that this is a delaying tactic,  he said.  That will go a long way toward building confidence.  ",worldnews,"September 9, 2017 ",1
Angola's opposition appeals election results,"LUANDA (Reuters) - Angola s main opposition party has appealed to the constitutional court to annul the results of last month s election, which gave a landslide victory to the ruling MPLA, arguing the electoral process failed to comply with the law. The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) presented the appeal, accompanied with boxes of supporting documents rolled into court offices in shopping trolleys, late on Friday. The move comes after the National Electoral Commission (CNE) published definitive results on Wednesday giving The People s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) 61 percent of the vote and UNITA 27 percent.  Throughout a two-week process of vote counting following the Aug. 23 poll, the CNE repeatedly rejected formal complaints from opposition parties that the law was not being followed.  The law was completely violated and that means the results which the CNE published are invalid,  Ruben Sicato, UNITA spokesman, told reporters as the appeal was filed. UNITA alleges that in multiple provinces the published results were not the product of local vote counting but instead reflected numbers sent to the provinces from the CNE s head office in the capital Luanda. The MPLA has ruled Angola continuously since independence from Portugal in 1975. The party, which finally won a brutal 27-year civil war against UNITA in 2002, continues to enjoy widespread support for securing peace and an oil-fueled economic booms in the years that followed. But corruption, cronyism and a severe economic crisis thanks to a fall in the price of oil have weakened its support and opposition parties had expected to make larger gains.    We hope the constitutional court does its job,  Sicato said.   ",worldnews,"September 9, 2017 ",1
"France, Germany, Italy, Spain seek tax on digital giants' revenues","PARIS (Reuters) - France, Germany, Italy and Spain want digital multinationals like Amazon and Google to be taxed in Europe based on their revenues, rather than only profits as now, their finance ministers said in a joint letter. France is leading a push to clamp down on the taxation of such companies, but has found support from other countries also frustrated at the low tax they receive under current international rules.     Currently such companies are often taxed on profits booked by subsidiaries in low-tax countries like Ireland even though the revenue originated from other EU countries.  We should no longer accept that these companies do business in Europe while paying minimal amounts of tax to our treasuries,  the four ministers wrote in a letter seen by Reuters. The letter, signed by French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, Wolfgang Schaeuble of Germany, Pier-Carlo Padoan of Italy and Luis de Guindos, was addressed to the EU s Estonian presidency with the bloc s executive Commission in copy. They urged the Commission to come up with a solution creating an  equalization tax  on turnover that would bring taxation to the level of corporate tax in the country where the revenue was earned.  The amounts raised would aim to reflect some of what these companies should be paying in terms of corporate tax,  the ministers said in the letter, first reported on by the Financial Times. Le Maire, Schaeuble, Padoan and de Guindos of Spain said they wanted to present the issue to other EU counterparts at a Sept. 15-16 meeting in Tallinn. The EU s current Estonian presidency has scheduled a discussion at the meeting about the concept of  permanent establishment , with the aim of making it possible to tax firms where they create value, not only where they have their tax residence. France has stepped up pressure for EU tax rules after facing legal setbacks trying to obtain payments for taxes on activities in the country.

Russia berates German defense minister for war games remarks,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia s Defence Ministry on Saturday criticized German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen, saying it was bewildered by her assertion that Moscow planned to send more than 100,000 troops to war games on NATO s eastern flank this month. On Thursday, the German defense minister said the war games, code named Zapad or  West , were a clear  demonstration of capabilities and power of the Russians .   Anyone who doubts that only has to look at the high numbers of participating forces in the Zapad exercise: more than one hundred thousand,  von der Leyen told reporters at an EU defense ministers  meeting in Tallinn. Russia has said that its joint war games with Belarus will be purely defensive in nature, rejecting what it called false allegations that it might use the drills to train for invasions of Poland, Lithuania or Ukraine.  We are bewildered by the statements of Ursula von der Leyen, publicly talking through her hat and making arbitrary allegations about 100,000 Russian troops ...and about hidden threats to Europe,  Russia s military said in a statement. Russia has said around 13,000 troops from Russia and Belarus and almost 700 pieces of military hardware will be used in the exercises to be held in Belarus, the Baltic Sea, western Russia and Russia s exclave of Kaliningrad on Sept. 14-20. General Valery Gerasimov, chief of Russia s general staff, used a meeting on Thursday with General Petr Pavel, chairman of the NATO military committee, to reassure him about the upcoming war games.  It is hard to imagine that Ursula von der Leyen s colleagues from NATO, other competent German ministries or her own subordinates deliberately misled her,  Russia s defense ministry said.  It is much easier to suppose the opposite.   (For a graphic on Russia's Zapad war games, click tmsnrt.rs/2xQtYwH) ",worldnews,"September 9, 2017 ",1
Hamas leader in Cairo to discuss Gaza blockade,"GAZA (Reuters) - The new chief of Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, arrived in Cairo on Saturday to hold talks with senior Egyptian officials about the blockade of Gaza on his first such visit as leader, a Hamas spokesman said. In the past few months Hamas has sought to mend relations with Egypt, which controls their one international border crossing from the Gaza Strip. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has been wary of ties between Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood, ousted from power by Sisi after mass protests.     Hamas controls the Gaza Strip, a densely populated coastal territory that shares borders with Egypt and Israel, with which it has fought three wars since 2008.  For much of the last decade, Egypt has joined Israel in enforcing a partial land, sea and air blockade of Gaza. Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum said the talks with Egypt will focus on alleviating the blockade and mending a longstanding rift with rival group Fatah, headed by Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. An Egyptian source confirmed Haniyeh s arrival with a delegation for talks on the border crossing, security and power supplies. Haniyeh was elected Hamas leader in May. The group maintains a sizeable armed wing in Gaza since seizing the enclave from Fatah in 2007. Hoping to pressure Hamas to relinquish control of Gaza, Abbas has cut payments to Israel for the electricity it supplies to Gaza. This means that electricity has often been provided for less than four hours a day, and never more than six. Abbas has vowed to keep up sanctions against Gaza, saying measures are aimed against Hamas and not ordinary people. In turn, Hamas is trying to make a crack in the wall of sanctions by improving its relations with Egypt and other Arab countries. Israel, which signed a 1979 peace treaty with Egypt and coordinates closely with it on security, is maintaining a close watch on discussions between Egypt and Hamas. Like the United States and the European Union, it regards Hamas as a terrorist group. ",worldnews,"September 9, 2017 ",1
France's Le Pen seeks to bill herself as Macron's main opponent,"BRACHAY, France (Reuters) - French far-right leader Marine Le Pen, who has been largely out of the spotlight since stinging electoral defeats, on Saturday sought to reclaim the mantle of main opponent to President Emmanuel Macron, which polls now attribute to the far-left. Surveys show that while Le Pen gathered more votes in the presidential election this spring than her National Front (FN) ever did before, lower-than-expected scores, a damaging TV debate against Macron, infighting within the FN and unpopular anti-euro policies have seriously dented her image. Instead, far-leftist Jean-Luc Melenchon and his France Unbowed party, whose 17 lawmakers have been vocal opponents to Macron since their election in June, in particular on labor reform, are seen as the new president s strongest foes. Lashing out at Macron over his labor reform, immigration and security policies and what she said was the government s inadequate response to Hurricane Irma, Le Pen said in her first public speech in months:  Don t be mistaken, Mr Macron s dismantling efforts target not only the essence of our institutions but also society as a whole and each and every one of us, including on labor rules.   Calling France Unbowed  Islamo-Trotskysts,  saying they backed foreigners over French citizens and put up a show rather than properly opposing Macron, Le Pen said the hardline Laurent Wauquiez, favorite to lead the conservative The Republicans, would become more mainstream as soon as he was elected.  Our political family is the only one capable of being a proper alternative,  Le Pen told supporters in her traditional early September speech in the small, pro-FN eastern France village of Brachay. But in recognition of the difficulties her party faces and disappointment with the presidential and legislative election scores - the FN has only eight lawmakers in the lower house of parliament - Le Pen said she would tour France to meet supporters and discuss what should change within the FN. She confirmed the party would change its name at a congress early next year. And her speech struck a note that was different from her election campaign rallies. Le Pen on Saturday did not mention the euro at all and barely touched upon globalization, while both those themes were at the heart of her campaign strategy. Instead, Le Pen devoted the first chunk of her speech to a harsh criticism of immigration and Islamism, signaling a return to the far-right party s fundamentals as opinion polls show her anti-euro stance is unpopular.

Singapore decried for 'harassment' of anti-death penalty activists,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore should end harassment of peaceful activists, Human Rights Watch has said, after participants at a candlelight vigil for a man being executed for drug trafficking were stopped from leaving the country. On July 13, around a dozen people, including opponents of the death penalty and relatives Prabagaran Srivijayan, 22, attended the vigil outside Changi Prison in support of the man, who was to be hanged early the next morning. The man, who was executed on July 14, was convicted of trafficking 22.4 grams of heroin into Singapore.  During the vigil, participants said they were approached by police and told that a police report had been filed and that they were to remove the candles.  The police removed the candles and photographs of Prabagaran but the participants say they were not asked to disperse. A police statement on Saturday said 17 people were under investigation relating to whether they had been involved in an illegal assembly. Assemblies and processions for a cause in public places without a permit is a criminal offense in Singapore. Anyone convicted of organizing such an assembly faces penalties of up to S$10,000 ($7,440) in fines and up to six months in jail. The Singapore government has said that the law is required to provide for the individual s rights for political expression without compromising on  order and safety . Among those at the vigil were a journalist, who is an activist against capital punishment, an editor of independent online blog  Online Citizen  and a filmmaker whose most recent work focused on the detention in 1987 of political activists under Singapore s Internal Security Act. The three said in social media postings that they had been prevented from leaving the country, and had been told that they were required to stay in Singapore to assist police with an investigation. Human Rights Watch said the government should respect the right of free speech and assembly.  The government should end its harassment of activists campaigning against capital punishment and respect their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly,  the group said in a release on Thursday. None of the three had been arrested or charged, Kirsten Han, the activist and journalist, told Reuters. ",worldnews,"September 9, 2017 ",1
"Irma seen costing more than 1 billion euros in Saint Martin, Saint Barth","PARIS (Reuters) - The cost of Hurricane Irma, described as one of the most powerful Atlantic storms in a century, is seen costing at least 1.2 billion euros ($1.44 billion) in Saint Martin and Saint Barthelemy, a French public reinsurance body said on Saturday. Irma walloped Cuba s northern coast on Saturday as a Category 5 storm and was expected to hit Florida on Sunday morning, threatening massive damage from wind and flooding to the fourth-largest U.S. state by population. France s Caisse Centrale de Reassurance, a state-owned reinsurance group, said Irma would go down as one of the most damaging disasters in decades on French territory. Saint Barthelemy lies about 35 km southeast of Saint Martin, whose territory is divided between France and the Netherlands. The French interior ministry said on Saturday that 10 people had been reported dead on the two islands. ",worldnews,"September 9, 2017 ",1

Catalan independence vote divides region's mayors,"BARCELONA (Reuters) - Barcelona s mayor has asked for reassurances that municipal staff would not face legal action or lose their jobs if they helped to organize an Oct. 1 referendum on Catalonia seceding from Spain. However, some of the region s nearly 1,000 mayors have already said they would go ahead with the vote, despite it being declared illegal by Madrid. Having originally offered to allow premises across the city to be used as polling stations, Barcelona mayor Ada Colau has asked the Catalan government for further reassurances that civil servants involved would be protected, her office said.  We support the right to participate and protest completely but we will repeat what we have said many times before: we will not put at risk institutions or civil servants,  Barcelona s deputy mayor, Gerardo Pisarello, said on Friday. Catalonia s parliament voted on Wednesday to hold an independence referendum on Oct. 1, setting up a clash with the Spanish government that has vowed to stop what it says would be an illegal vote. Polls in the northeastern region show support for self-rule waning as Spain s economy improves. But the majority of Catalans do want the opportunity to vote on whether to split from Spain. As of Friday night, 674 of Catalonia s 948 municipal districts had informed the government of their intention to allow city spaces to be used for the vote, according to the Municipal Association for Independence (AMI). In a video posted on Twitter, the mayor of the Cerdanyola municipality tore in half a letter from the Constitutional Court warning of the legal repercussions of participating in the referendum to applause from the crowd watching. Pro-independence groups protested on Friday outside the offices of several mayors across Catalonia who announced they would not allow municipal spaces to be used for the vote. On Saturday, Spanish police searched the offices of a weekly newspaper in the town of Valls in search of ballot papers, according to newspaper La Vanguardia. On Friday, the Civil Guard police searched a printing company near Tarragona, reportedly in search of materials to be used in the independence vote. Spain s Civil Guard police was unavailable for comment but a court statement said the searches were related to charges brought by the public prosecutor in relation to the referendum.

Turkey kills 99 Kurdish militants in latest operations: military,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish security forces have killed 99 Kurdish militants, including a high-ranking one, in operations in southeast Turkey over the last two weeks, the armed forces said on Saturday. Security forces targeted outposts and caves used by the militants for shelter and storage in the southeastern provinces of Sirnak and Hakkari, near the Iraqi border, the military said in a statement.  Ninety-nine terrorists have been neutralized. One is in the so-called leading ranks,  it said. The outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by the United States, Turkey and the European Union, has waged a more than three-decade insurgency against the state. The PKK, which seeks autonomy for the largely Kurdish southeast, has bases in the mountains on both sides of the Turkey-Iraq border and is frequently targeted by Turkish security forces. The operations, which were carried out between Aug. 24 and Sept. 7, led to the seizure of 420 kg (925 lbs) of ammonium nitrate, used to make explosives, as well as bombs, guns and rifles, the military said.

Nigeria's Buhari urges calm after herdsmen kill 19 in central Plateau state,"ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria s President Muhammadu Buhari appealed for calm and an end to communal violence on Saturday after police said armed herdsmen killed 19 people in the central state of Plateau.  Local police said Fulani herdsmen attacked Ancha village, in the Bassa local government area of Plateau state, in the early hours of Friday. They said it was thought to be a reprisal attack after a boy from the herding community was killed.  Police provided details of the attack, in which five people were injured, late on Friday.  Fighting between semi-nomadic cattle herders and more settled communities over land use claims hundreds of lives a year in Nigeria s central and northern states.   I urge all our communities in the state and the other parts of the country to embrace peace and bring to a stop these painful and unnecessary killings,  said Buhari, in an emailed statement. He said communities and security agencies in Plateau had taken steps to  pull the state back from the brink of anarchy and senseless killings , adding that it would be  a painful loss to allow these unsavory acts to return . The violence is another security challenge for Buhari in addition to the eight-year Boko Haram jihadist insurgency in the northeast and attempts to maintain a fragile ceasefire in the southern Niger Delta energy hub where militant attacks on oil facilities last year cut crude production by more than a third.

Red Cross says staff member killed in South Sudan ambush,"JUBA (Reuters) - The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said on Saturday one of its drivers was shot dead when a convoy of their vehicles was ambushed in South Sudan s Western Equatoria State. The ICRC said Lukudu Kennedy Laki Emmanuel was killed when the convoy of nine trucks and a four-wheel-drive vehicle was shot at by unidentified gunmen while returning from Western Equatoria on Friday.  We are shaken and distraught by the killing of our colleague who was traveling in a convoy of vehicles which were clearly marked with the Red Cross emblem,  Fran ois Stamm, ICRC s head of delegation in Juba, said in a statement. The Western Equatoria region borders Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo. South Sudan  became independent from neighboring Sudan in 2011 following decades of conflict. The new nation slid into civil war less than two years later, after President Salva Kiir fired his deputy, Riek Machar.       The conflict has often followed along ethnic lines, killing tens of thousands and forcing nearly a third of the population of 12 million to flee their homes, with Uganda alone hosting 1 million South Sudanese refugees. South Sudan also continues to be one of the most dangerous places for aid workers.  Since the conflict began in December 2013, at least 82 aid workers have been killed, including 17 in 2017 - most of them South Sudanese, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA).   Since January, 27 security-related incidents have forced the relocation of some 300 aid workers. These incidents signify a worsening operating environment for humanitarians in South Sudan,  the UN OCHA said in a statement on Friday. ",worldnews,"September 9, 2017 ",1
"As U.S. ban on travel to North Korea kicks in, tourists say their farewells"," (This Aug 31 story corrects location of Burkhead s home in third paragraph.) By Christian Shepherd BEIJING (Reuters) - American tourist Nicholas Burkhead said he d be happy to return to his latest holiday destination, with its beautiful scenery, great food and friendly people. The problem is, the destination was North Korea and a U.S. State Department ban on travel to the isolated country takes effect on Friday. Burkhead, a 35-year-old resident of Virginia, was among the last American tourists to leave North Korea, landing on Thursday in Beijing.  I was surprised at how friendly everyone was,  Burkhead said after stepping off the last scheduled flight to Beijing from the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, before the U.S. travel ban kicks in.  It was very relaxing - beautiful scenery and they fed us very well in the restaurants there, but the exchange rate wasn t too good for the local won,  he told a waiting scrum of reporters. Burkhead arrived in Beijing on North Korea s state-owned Air Koryo after visiting Pyongyang as well as the city of Kaesong near the heavily armed border with South Korea. His five-day tour cost 1,850 euros ($2,200). Other Americans on the flight included two aid workers as well as Jamie Banfill, 32, who had led tours to North Korea but was visiting this time as a tourist. Banfill, who had made the trip to say goodbyes after regularly traveling to the North for a decade, said the travel ban short-sighted.  It s an extremely complex situation on the Korean peninsula and they oversimplified it,  he said. The United States last month announced a ban on U.S. passport holders from traveling to North Korea, effective Sept. 1. Journalists and humanitarian workers are allowed to apply for exemptions under the ban, which is similar to previous U.S. restrictions on travel to Iraq and Libya. Heidi Linton, director of Christian Friends of Korea, who has been working in North Korea for more than 20 years, told reporters she worried about the people her aid group helped, if her exemption was not granted soon.  We started a hepatitis B program and we have 705 patients that have been started on life-saving medicine, that if they go off that medicine then their lives are in danger,  she said.    It was not immediately clear how many Americans had sought, or been granted, exemptions or how many were still in North Korea. An official at the state department said it was not able to give an estimate on the number of U.S. citizens there. North Korea is under growing international pressure over its nuclear tests and repeated ballistic missile launches, including one this week that flew over northern Japan. The U.S. ban on travel to North Korea followed the death of U.S. college student Otto Warmbier, who was jailed during a tour last year. Warmbier, who was sentenced to 15 years hard labor for trying to steal a propaganda sign, was returned to the United States in a coma in June and died six days later. The circumstances surrounding his death are not clear, including why he fell into a coma. Warmbier had been detained leaving the airport in Pyongyang.    I was expecting a strict security check on exit but there was nothing like that,  Burkhead said. The State Department declared U.S. passports invalid for travel to, in or through North Korea. The restriction applies for one year unless extended or revoked by the secretary of state. North Korean state media has described the ban as a  sordid  attempt to limit human exchanges. North Korea is currently holding two Korean-American academics and a missionary, as well as three South Korean nationals who were doing missionary work.  This month, North Korea released a Canadian pastor who had been imprisoned there for more than two years. Hundreds of Americans are among the 4,000 to 5,000 Western tourists who visit North Korea annually, according to U.S. lawmaker Joe Wilson. ",worldnews,"August 31, 2017 ",1
"U.S. students' rape allegation against Italian police has 'some basis', minister says","ROME (Reuters) - Italy s defense minister has said there is  some basis  to allegations by two American students that they were raped in Florence by Carabinieri policemen. The two women, aged 19 and 21, have said they were raped in the early hours of Sept. 7 after they were given a lift home from a nightclub in the Italian city by a Carabinieri police patrol. The two policemen have denied the accusations. Italian media say the police were called to the nightclub after a fight broke out on the premises. The students told investigators that two officers had offered to give them a ride back to their residence. The students said they were raped inside the building before they could reach their rooms.  Investigations are still ongoing, but there is some basis regarding the allegations,  Defense Minister Roberta Pinotti told a conference on women s issues late on Friday.  Rape is always a serious matter. But it s of unprecedented seriousness if it is committed by Carabinieri in uniform.  The Carabinieri is a paramilitary police force under the control of the Defense Ministry. It works alongside the national police, which is controlled by the Interior Ministry. Italian media say the two women, who come from the states of Maine and New Jersey, told investigators they had drunk alcohol and smoked cannabis the night of the attack. They said they had been too frightened to scream or shout as the alleged assault took place. Police are carrying out DNA tests to try to verify their accusations, with results expected in the coming days. The case, which has received wide play in the Italian media, comes less than two weeks after a Polish tourist and Peruvian transsexual were brutally raped in the seaside resort of Rimini. Two Moroccans, a Nigerian and a Congolese asylum seeker have been arrested over the attacks, which led to a sharp increase in anti-immigrant sentiment in Italy.  The allegations levelled against the Carabinieri have dismayed the Italian establishment.  If this is true, and I hope that light is shed on the matter as soon as possible, then it would be an act of unheard of gravity,  Tullio Del Sette, the head of the army, told the ANSA news agency.

Syrian army seizes oilfield from Islamic State in east: state TV,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - The Syrian army and its allies recaptured an oilfield from Islamic State near the eastern city of Deir al-Zor on Saturday in further advances against the militants, state TV reported. Government forces also seized part of a main highway running from Deir al-Zor down to the city of al-Mayadeen, to which many Islamic State militants have retreated, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said. The Syrian army this week broke through Islamic State lines to reach a government-held enclave of Deir al-Zor besieged for years by the jihadists, and is fighting to reach a nearby air base which IS still surrounds. On Saturday, the army and militias fighting alongside it seized the Teym oilfield in desert south of Deir al-Zor, state TV said. Deir al-Zor is in an oil-rich area of Syria. To the east of Teym and south of the air base, government forces also recaptured part of the main road running from Deir al-Zor to al-Mayadeen, downstream along the Euphrates river and closer to the Iraq border, the Observatory reported. The British-based monitoring group said that advance would block potential Islamic State reinforcements from al-Mayadeen. The advances put yet more pressure on Islamic State s shrinking caliphate, which once stretched across northern and eastern Syria, and northwestern Iraq. In Syria, the group holds much of Deir al-Zor province and half the city, as well as a pocket of territory near Hama and Homs in the west of the country. ",worldnews,"September 9, 2017 ",1

South Korea braces for possible new missile test to mark North's founding day,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea braced for a possible further missile test by North Korea as it marked its founding anniversary on Saturday, just days after its sixth and largest nuclear test rattled global financial markets and further escalated tensions in the region.  Throughout the week, South Korean officials have warned the North could launch another intercontinental ballistic missile, in defiance of U.N. sanctions and amid an escalating standoff with the United States. Pyongyang marks its founding anniversary each year with a big display of pageantry and military hardware. Last year, North Korea conducted its fifth nuclear test on the Sept. 9 anniversary. Tension on the Korean peninsula has escalated as North Korea s young leader, Kim Jong Un, has stepped up the development of weapons, testing a string of missiles this year, including one flying over Japan, and conducting its sixth nuclear test on Sunday. Experts believe the isolated regime is close to its goal of developing a powerful nuclear weapon capable of reaching the United States, something U.S. President Donald Trump has vowed to prevent. Celebrating its founding anniversary, a front-page editorial of the Saturday edition of North Korea s official Rodong Sinmun said the country should make  more high-tech Juche weapons to continuously bring about big historical events such as a miraculous victory of July 28. . The July date refers to the intercontinental ballistic missile test.  Juche is North Korea s homegrown ideology of self-reliance that is a mix of Marxism and extreme nationalism preached by state founder Kim Il Sung, the current leader s grandfather.      South Korean nuclear experts, checking for contamination, said on Friday they had found minute traces of radioactive xenon gas but that it was too early to link it to Sunday s explosion. The Nuclear Safety and Security Commission (NSSC) said it had been conducting tests on land, air and water samples since shortly after the North Korean nuclear test on Sunday. Xenon is a naturally occurring, colourless gas that is used in manufacturing of some sorts of lights. But the NSSC said it had detected xenon-133, a radioactive isotope that does not occur naturally and which has in the past been linked to North Korea s nuclear tests. There was no chance the xenon  will have an impact on South Korea s territory or population , the agency said. Trump has repeatedly said all options are on the table in dealing with North Korea and on Thursday said he would prefer not to use military action, but if he did, it would be a  very sad day  for North Korea.  Military action would certainly be an option. Is it inevitable? Nothing is inevitable,  Trump told reporters.  If we do use it on North Korea, it will be a very sad day for North Korea.  Even as Trump has insisted that now is not the time to talk, senior members of his administration have made clear that the door to a diplomatic solution is open, especially given the U.S. assessment that any pre-emptive strike would unleash massive North Korean retaliation. North Korea says it needs its weapons to protect itself from U.S. aggression and regularly threatens to destroy the United States.  South Korea and the United States are technically still at war with North Korea after the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce, not a peace treaty. The USS Ronald Reagan, a nuclear-powered carrier, left its home port in Japan for a routine autumn patrol of the Western Pacific, a Navy spokeswoman said. That area included waters between Japan and the Korean peninsula, she added, without giving any further details.  The Ronald Reagan was out on routine patrol from May until August, and was sent to the Sea of Japan with the another carrier, the USS Carl Vinson, to take part in drills with Japan s Self Defense Forces as well as the South Korean military.  North Korea vehemently objects to military exercises on or near the peninsula, and China and Russia have suggested the United States and South Korea halt their exercises to lower tension. While Trump talked tough on North Korea, China agreed on Thursday that the United Nations should take more action against it, but it also pushed for dialogue. The U.N. Security Council is expected to vote on a new set of sanctions soon. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that it was too early to draw conclusions about the final form of the U.N. resolution, Russia s Interfax news agency quoted Lavrov as saying at a news conference on Friday. The United States on Friday told the U.N. Security Council that it intends to call a meeting on Monday to vote on a draft resolution establishing additional sanctions on North Korea for its missile and nuclear program, the U.S. Mission to the United Nations said in a statement. U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said last Monday that she intended to call for a vote on Sept. 11 and then the United States circulated a draft resolution to the 15-member council on Wednesday. The United States wants the Security Council to impose an oil embargo on North Korea, ban its exports of textiles and the hiring of North Korean laborers abroad, and to subject Kim Jong Un to an asset freeze and travel ban, according to a draft resolution seen by Reuters on Wednesday. It was not immediately clear how North Korean allies China and Russia would vote, but a senior U.S. official on Friday night expressed scepticism that either nation would accept anything more stringent than a ban on imports of North Korean textiles. Chinese officials have privately expressed fears that imposing an oil embargo could risk triggering massive instability in its neighbor.  North Korea offered fresh vitriol against the pending sanctions, specifically targeting Haley, who this week accused Kim of  begging for war .  There is nothing more foolish than thinking we, a strong nuclear state, will endure this evil pressure aimed at overthrowing our state,  the North s official news agency said in a commentary.  Even if Nikki Haley is blind, she must use her mouth correctly. The United States administration will pay for not being able to control the mouth of their U.N. representative.  China is by far North Korea s biggest trading partner, accounting for 92 percent of two-way trade last year. It also provides hundreds of thousands of tonnes of oil and fuel to the impoverished regime.   China s economic influence has been felt by South Korea as well. The two countries have been at loggerheads over South Korea s decision to deploy a U.S. anti-missile system, the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, which has a powerful radar that can probe deep into China. Shares in South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor (005380.KS) and key suppliers slid on Friday on worries over its position in China after highly critical Chinese state newspaper comments. The military section of China s Global Times newspaper on Thursday referred to THAAD as  a malignant tumor . ",worldnews,"September 8, 2017 ",1
Japan says jet fighters conducted drills with U.S. aircraft over East China Sea,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese F-15 fighter jets on Saturday conducted an air exercise with U.S. B1-B bombers in the skies above the East China Sea, Japan s Air Self Defense Force (ASDF) said. The joint drill comes as South Korea braces for a possible further missile test by North Korea as it marked its founding anniversary, just days after its sixth and largest nuclear test rattled global financial markets and further escalated tensions in the region. The exercise involved two U.S. Air Force B-1B Lancer bombers flying from Andersen Air Force Base on the U.S. Pacific island territory of Guam, which were joined by two Japanese F-15 jet fighters. On Aug. 31, Japanese F-15 fighter jets also conducted an air exercise with U.S. B1-B bombers and F-35 stealth fighters in skies south of the Korean peninsula, two days after North Korea launched a ballistic missile over northern Japan.

"Australia to allow more Pacific Islands workers, patrol fisheries","SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia will extend its Pacific Islands migrant labor program and fly aerial surveillance missions to protect valuable Pacific fisheries, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said at the Pacific Island Leaders Forum. The meeting, held in Apia, Samoa, brought 17 Pacific Island nations plus Australia and New Zealand to the negotiating table. The new agreement helps tiny low-income Pacific Island nations by giving them access to Australia s large and developed economy, with migrant workers repatriating funds via overseas remittances. The per capita gross national incomes of 11 countries in the region range from $1,540 for the Solomon Islands to $13,496 for Palau, according to World Bank figures, while Australian workers earn an average yearly salary of more than $64,000. Australia s population of 24 million people is highly urbanized, leading to labor shortages in rural areas. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull signed an agreement on Friday to allow 2,000 Islanders to work in rural areas over the next three years, adding to an existing seasonal worker program which supplies agricultural labor. The micro-nations of Kiribati, Nauru and Tuvalu will have first access to the scheme, which will allow workers to engage in non-farm work such as care of the elderly. The World Bank said it was in Australia s interests to encourage stability.  Aid dependency in the region is high, and reliance on aid alone is an unbalanced strategy. By improving employment prospects and increasing remittance flows, labor mobility helps stabilize otherwise fragile states,  it said in a new report, Pacific Possible, released at the forum. The report said the Pacific region had the potential to create more than 500,000 new jobs and increase incomes by more than 40 percent by 2040, if they focused on developing key areas such as tourism and fisheries.  The western and central Pacific Ocean covers about 8 percent of the world s ocean mass and contains the last healthy tuna stocks, supplying 60 percent of the world s tuna, the report said. Australia has agreed to fund aerial surveillance for Pacific Island member states to combat illegal fishing, with the planes to be in the air by the end of this year.

Small contingents of Australian soldiers will be sent to train Philippine troops, Payne said during a press conference with her counterpart, Delfin Lorenzana in Manila.   We are very committed to supporting the Philippines in its efforts to defend itself against terrorist threats,  Minister Payne said.  This is a threat to the region (that) we all need to work together to defeat.  But no Australian troops will be actively involved in the fighting, Lorenza said.  It would not look good if we would be needing troops to fight the war here. We are happy with the assistance we re getting from Australia.  The militants swept through Marawi on May 23 and have held parts of it despite sustained ground attacks by hundreds of soldiers and daily pummeling by planes and artillery. The southern Philippines has been marred for decades by insurgency and banditry. But the intensity of the battle in Marawi and the presence of foreign fighters fighting alongside local militants has raised concerns that the region may be becoming a Southeast Asian hub for Islamic State as it loses ground in Iraq and Syria. The Australian troops will compliment those from their country already sent to the Philippines to train local personnel, Payne said. Philippine troops fighting Islamic State-linked rebels in a southern city have encountered armed resistance from women and children who were likely family member of militants, the Phillipine military said on Monday. A spokesman for Payne said further details of the training contingent would be determined in coming days.   ",worldnews,"September 9, 2017 ",1
Pope to see a Medellin that has put drug wars in its past,"MEDELLIN, Colombia (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Saturday travels to Medellin, once notorious as the stomping grounds of drug lord Pablo Escobar, to find a city transformed since his predecessor Pope John Paul visited in 1986. Violence between cartels, paramilitary groups and guerrillas raged in the poor  comuna  neighborhoods on its outskirts and the late pontiff was moved to decry drug violence. Instead, Francis is expected to honor the commitment and sacrifice of those who dedicate themselves to religious vocations when he says mass for a crowd expected to draw hundreds of thousands of people near an airport. He also visits a home for children who were victims of violence and addresses priests, nuns, seminarians and their families at the La Macarena bullring. In the 1980s and early 1990s, violence between cartels, paramilitary groups and guerrillas raged in the poor  comuna  neighborhoods on its outskirts and the visiting pontiff was moved to decry drug violence. The city is now heralded as a model of urban development. It has installed cable cars up the steep Andean slopes that surround it to save working-class residents a punishing climb home and built libraries in neighborhoods once host to gun battles. Feared drug trafficker Escobar, Medellin s most infamous resident, was gunned down in the city in a U.S.-backed operation in 1993. He was recently resurrected as a character in the popular Netflix series Narcos. During his visit to the city, Francis will highlight those who choose the habit and the cassock over secular careers, as the number of new entrants to vocations in the Roman Catholic Church has slumped. At the La Macarena meeting, Francis will also pray before the relics of Mother Laura Montoya, a nun who was the first female Colombian saint. Montoya was a teacher and prolific author who hosted classes in her own home when the 1895 civil war forced schools to close. The leader of the world s 1.2 billion Roman Catholics has brought a message of national reconciliation as the country tries to heal the wounds left by the conflict and bitter disagreements over a peace deal with guerrillas agreed last year. On Friday in the tropical city of Villavicencio, he urged Colombians skeptical of a the deal with the FARC guerrillas to be open to reconciliation with those who have repented, speaking hours after a top rebel leader asked the pontiff for forgiveness.. He visits the city of Cartagena on Sunday before leaving for Rome that night.    ",worldnews,"September 9, 2017 ",1
Taiwan activist to be tried for subversion in China in 'open' hearing,"Beijing (Reuters) - China will on Monday put on trial a Taiwanese activist, who disappeared while on a visit to the mainland in March, on suspicion of subverting state power, in what court authorities said would be an open trial. Lee Ming-che, a community college teacher and human rights advocate, went missing on his March visit but authorities later confirmed he had been detained, straining already-tense ties between the mainland and the self-ruling island. Lee s trial will begin first thing on Monday morning, at the Intermediate People s Court of Yueyang city, in the central province of Hunan, a woman who answered the telephone at the court told Reuters.  Authorities have video-streamed or live-blogged increasing numbers of court proceedings in recent years as part of a push towards judicial transparency. But rights activists say that in sensitive cases, holding  open  hearings is a tool for authorities to demonstrate state power and that usually the defendant has agreed to an outcome. Photographs of a billboard announcement of the trial date and time, which circulated online on Friday, were genuine, the woman at the court confirmed. The announcement said Lee would stand trial alongside another man, Peng Yuhua, who is suspected of the same crime. It is not clear who Peng is or what his relationship to Lee is, if any. Lee Ching-yu, Lee s wife, who has been campaigning for his release, was contacted this week by a man who said he was her husband s lawyer and who told her to come to the mainland for the trial, Taiwan s Mainland Affairs Council said on Thursday. The council said the Taiwan government would help her apply for travel documents and arrange lawyers to go with her. Lee s case has strained relations between Taipei and Beijing, which have been difficult for decades but particularly tense since President Tsai Ing-wen, leader of Taiwan s independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, took office last year. Beijing regards the island as a breakaway province and it has never renounced the use of force to bring it back under mainland control. Proudly democratic Taiwan has shown no interest in being run by Communist Party rulers in Beijing. ",worldnews,"September 8, 2017 ",1
Mexico's strongest quake in 85 years kills dozens in the poor south,"JUCHITAN, Mexico (Reuters) - At least 61 people died when the most powerful earthquake to hit Mexico in over eight decades tore through buildings and forced mass evacuations in the poor southern states of Oaxaca and Chiapas, triggering alerts as far away as Southeast Asia. The 8.1 magnitude quake off the southern coast late Thursday was stronger than a devastating 1985 temblor that flattened swathes of Mexico City and killed thousands. The tremor rattled Mexico City and shook Guatemala and El Salvador, but the Oaxacan town of Juchitan bore the brunt of the disaster, with sections of the town hall, a hotel, a church, a bar and other buildings reduced to rubble. Dalia Vasquez, a 55-year old cook, said she watched emergency workers haul the bodies of her elderly neighbor and her middle-aged son from their collapsed home.  Her own house was badly damaged. Frightened by the possibility of aftershocks, she planned to sleep with dozens more in the streets and parks.  We have nothing now. We don t have any savings,  she said. President Enrique Pena Nieto flew to the battered town to oversee rescue efforts. The town s mayor, Gloria Sanchez, called it  the most terrible moment  in Juchitan s history.   Facades of shattered buildings, fallen tiles and broken glass from shop fronts and banks littered the pavements of Juchitan while heavily armed soldiers patrolled and stood guard at areas cordoned off due to the extent of the damage. Startled residents stepped through the rubble of about 100 wrecked buildings, including houses, a flattened Volkswagen dealership and Juchitan s shattered town hall. Scores paced the terrain or sat outside warily, mindful of the frequent aftershocks and reliving the night s terror.   It was brutal, brutal. It was like a monster, like a train was passing over our roofs,  said Jesus Mendoza, 53, as he milled about in a park across from the damaged town hall.  Alma Rosa, sitting in vigil with a relative by the body of a loved one draped in a red shroud, said:  We went to buy a coffin, but there aren t any because there are so many bodies.  All the deaths were in three neighboring states clustered near the epicenter that lay about 70 km (40 miles) off the coast. At least 45 people died in Oaxaca, many of them in Juchitan, while in Chiapas the count reached 12 and in Tabasco four people lost their lives, according to federal and state officials. In Chiapas, home to many of Mexico s indigenous ethnic groups, thousands of people in coastal areas were evacuated as a precaution when the quake sparked tsunami warnings, but only two-foot waves were produced by the quake. State oil company Pemex said there was no structural damage to it s 330,000 barrel-per-day Salina Cruz refinery, which it had shut down as a precaution, but it said it was checking problems in the electrical system before restarting the plant. At least 250 people in Oaxaca were also injured, according to agriculture minister Jose Calzada. Classes were suspended in much of central and southern Mexico on Friday to allow authorities to assess the impact. Dozens of schools were damaged, officials said. People ran into the streets in Mexico City, one of the world s largest metropolises and home to more than 20 million, and alarms sounded after the quake struck just before midnight. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said the quake s epicenter was 54 miles (87 km) southwest of the town of Pijijiapan at a depth of 43 miles (69 km). John Bellini, a geophysicist at the USGS National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colorado, said it was the strongest quake since an 8.1 temblor struck the western state of Jalisco in 1932. Across the Pacific, both the Philippines and New Zealand were on alert for possible tsunamis. Windows were shattered at Mexico City airport and power went out in several neighborhoods of the capital, affecting more than 1 million people. The cornice of a hotel came down in the southern tourist city of Oaxaca, a witness said. Mexico City is built on a spongy, drained lake bed that amplifies earthquakes along the volcanic country s multiple seismic fault lines. The 1985 earthquake was just inland, about 230 miles from Mexico City, while Thursday s was 470 miles away.  Authorities reported dozens of aftershocks, and President Pena Nieto said the quake was felt by around 50 million of Mexico s roughly 120 million population. Mexico is evaluating whether the quake will trigger a payout from a World Bank-backed catastrophe bond, Finance Minister Jose Antonio Meade said on Friday. Meade said the bond s coverage could reach $150 million, depending on magnitude and location. But he said Mexico has sufficient funds to pay for a cleanup whether the bond was triggered or not.

China's Xi urges France to help restart talks on North Korea,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping told President Emmanuel Macron on Friday he hoped France could play a  constructive role  in restarting talks on North Korea, state TV said. The French presidency said the two leaders had agreed in a telephone call on the need to put more international pressure on Pyongyang to get it back to the negotiating table and avoid a dangerous escalation.  Chinese TV quoted Xi as saying:  The Korean peninsula nuclear issue in the end can only be resolved through peaceful means, including through dialogue and consultations.           North Korea has tested a string of missiles this year, including one flying over Japan, and conducting its sixth and biggest nuclear test on Sunday. China hosted on-again, off-again six-party talks on North Korea, including Japan, Russia, the United States and the two Koreas, that fizzled out in 2008. Experts believe the isolated regime is close to its goal of developing a powerful nuclear weapon capable of reaching the United States, something U.S. President Donald Trump has vowed to prevent. Xi discussed North Korea in calls with Trump on Wednesday and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday.   Trump has urged China, North Korea s only major ally, to do more to rein in its neighbor.

Philippines suspends trade with North Korea to comply with U.N. resolution,"MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines has suspended trade relations with North Korea to comply with a U.N. Security Council resolution over its repeated missile tests, Manila s foreign minister said on Friday. The United States and other Western countries have asked the United Nations to consider tough new sanctions on North Korea after its test last week that it said was of an advanced hydrogen bomb.  We can say we have suspended trade relations with North Korea,  Foreign Minister Alan Peter Cayetano told reporters after a meeting with the U.S. ambassador on cooperation on an anti-drugs program.  We will fully comply with UNSC resolution including the economic sanctions.  Tension on the Korean peninsula has escalated as North Korea s young leader, Kim Jong Un, has stepped up the development of weapons in defiance of U.N. sanctions.  It has tested a series of missiles this year, including one that flew over Japan, and conducted its sixth and biggest nuclear test on Sunday.  The Philippines is North Korea s fifth-largest trade partner, with bilateral trade from January to June this year worth $28.8 million, according to the state-run Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency. On an annual basis, North Korea imported $28.8 million of products from the Philippines in 2016, an increase of 80 percent from the previous year, while Manila s imports from Pyongyang surged 170 percent to $16.1 million.  According to the Philippine Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), the main exports to North Korea in 2015 were computers, integrated circuited boards, bananas and women s undergarments.  The U.N. Security Council is quite clear,  Cayetano said.  Part of these are the economic sanctions and the Philippines will comply. We have been communicating with the DTI secretary and I think it was yesterday and the other day, we have gotten direction from the (presidential) palace to support the U.N. Security Council.  Cayetano said the trade ban covered raw computer chips from the Philippines. ",worldnews,"September 8, 2017 ",1
"South Korea finds traces of radioactive gas, 'can't yet link it' to nuclear test","SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean nuclear experts, checking for contamination after North Korea s sixth and largest nuclear test, said on Friday they have found minute traces of radioactive xenon gas but that it was too early to specify its source. The Nuclear Safety and Security Commission (NSSC) said it had been conducting tests on land, air and water samples since shortly after North Korea s nuclear test on Sunday. The statement said the commission was analyzing  how the xenon entered South Korean territory and will make a decision at a later time whether the material is linked to North Korea s nuclear test . Xenon is a naturally occurring, colorless gas that is used in manufacturing of some sorts of lights. But the NSSC said it had detected xenon-133, a radioactive isotope that does not occur naturally and which has in the past been linked to North Korea s nuclear tests. There was no chance the xenon  will have an impact on South Korea s territory or population , the statement said. ",worldnews,"September 8, 2017 ",1
"Officials found list of targets with 5,000 names in east German raid: media","BERLIN (Reuters) - German officials found lists with over 5,000 names of possible targets, including over 100 politicians, during the raids on the homes and workplaces of two terrorism suspects in the east German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern last week, Die Welt newspaper reported on Friday. The newspaper, citing security sources, said one of the suspects, a former policeman who has since been suspended, is believed to have used his office computer to search out the addresses of political opponents. German police on Aug. 28 raided the homes and workplaces of the policeman and another person suspected of planning to capture and kill politicians because of their views on immigration, authorities said. The newspaper report marked the first substantial details that have emerged about the case. At the time, the federal prosecutor s office said the suspects, who feared Germany s refugee policies would impoverish the country, had begun to stockpile food and ammunition and plan attacks. The newspaper said there were no indications thus far of surveillance of the people on the lists, or of any concrete murder plans. Much of the information was publicly available, the paper cited the sources as saying. Federal police officials seized two binders filled with names of over 5,000 people during searches of the properties of one of the suspects, an attorney and a local politician in Rostock, a northern city. It said the politicians on the list belonged to a wide range of parties, including Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives. ",worldnews,"September 9, 2017 ",1
North Korea-U.S. tensions are not Mexico's business: diplomat,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - North Korea s ambassador to Mexico on Friday said its tensions with the United States were not Mexico City s business after President Enrique Pena Nieto ordered that he leave the country in protest over Pyongyang s nuclear tests.  Mexico on Thursday said it had given the ambassador, Kim Hyong Gil, 72 hours to leave Mexico in order to express its  absolute rejection  of North Korea s recent nuclear activity, describing it as a grave threat to the region and the world. The North Korean ambassador branded the move as  ignorant  and said disagreement over the country s nuclear program was an issue for the United States and  has nothing to do with Mexico.   That is why I express great displeasure at the bilateral diplomatic measures taken by the Mexican government that claims to have a sovereign foreign policy. That (claim) is without basis,  he told reporters outside the North Korean embassy in Mexico City. Mexico has traditionally sought to steer clear of diplomatic spats, but in the past few months it has adopted robust language to condemn the governments of Venezuela and North Korea as they descended into increasing international isolation. Mexico s foreign minister, Luis Videgaray, has led the diplomatic push as he also seeks to convince the United States to keep the North American Free Trade Agreement in place. Mexico s move follows a tide of international condemnation of North Korea for repeated missile launches and the test of a powerful nuclear weapon in recent weeks. Videgaray on Friday stressed that Mexico was not breaking diplomatic ties with North Korea, but that the country  wanted to send a clear message of absolute rejection  of the recent tests.

Hurricane Irma thrives on fateful mix of 'ideal' conditions,"(Reuters) - Hurricane Irma, a deadly, devastating force of nature, rapidly coalesced from a low-pressure blip west of Africa into one of the most powerful Atlantic storms on record, following an unhindered atmospheric path and fed by unusually warm seas. A combination of many factors, experts said on Friday, set the stage for Irma s formation and helped the storm achieve its full thermodynamic potential, creating the monster tropical cyclone that wreaked havoc on the eastern Caribbean and may inflict widespread damage on Florida.  It got lucky,  said John Knaff, a meteorologist and physical scientist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  This storm is in the Goldilocks environment for a major hurricane. It s bad luck for whoever is in its path, but that s what going on here.  Brian Kahn, an atmospheric scientist and cloud specialist for NASA s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, called the ocean conditions that spawned Irma  absolutely ideal.  Balmy water temperatures along Irma s trajectory ran deep beneath the surface and slightly higher than normal, by as much as a degree Fahrenheit in places, providing ample fuel for the storm s development, scientists said. Irma also encountered little if any interference in the form of wind shear - sudden changes in vertical wind velocity that can blunt a storm s intensity - as it advanced at about 10 to 18 miles per hour, an ideal pace for hurricanes. Its fortuitous path of least resistance was essentially ordained by a well-placed atmospheric ridge of high pressure that steered the storm by happenstance through some of the Caribbean s warmest waters as well as an area mostly devoid of wind shear. The result was a gargantuan storm that rapidly grew to a Category 5, the top of the Saffir-Simpson scale of hurricane strength, with sustained winds of 185 miles per hour, the most forceful ever documented in the open Atlantic. It also ranks as one of just five Atlantic hurricanes known to have achieved such wind speeds during the past 82 years. Irma lashed Cuba and the Bahamas as it drove toward Florida on Friday after hitting the eastern Caribbean with its tree-snapping winds, torrential rains and pounding surf, killing at least 21 people and leaving catastrophic destruction in its wake. By Friday night, Irma s winds had diminished to 155 miles per hour (250 kph) and it was downgraded to a Category 4 storm, though still considered extremely dangerous. The tiny islands directly crossed by Irma, like Barbuda and St. Martin, did little to weaken it, but the storm s intensity could be measurably diminished by a close encounter with a larger land mass, such as Cuba, en route to the U.S. mainland, scientists said. So powerful is Irma that it may end up dampening another Category 4 storm in its wake, Hurricane Jose, which like Irma originated off the west coast of Africa and was following a similar course. Waters already plied by Irma could be left a bit cooler, robbing Jose of potential energy, and  outflows  from Irma could produce wind shear for Jose, said Scott Braun, a research meteorologist for NASA s Goddard Space Flight Center. Knaff said it was no surprise that the advent of Irma coincided with the precise peak of the Atlantic hurricane season. Much less certain is the role of global climate from human-induced atmospheric increases in heat-trapping  greenhouse  gases, scientists said. There is consensus that climate change has raised sea levels, which is likely to exacerbate hurricane storm surges. Rising ocean temperatures have been clearly documented as well. Research is divided on whether global warming will make tropical cyclones more frequent, though data from climate modeling suggests a higher probability for stronger, wetter hurricanes in the Atlantic when they do occur, said Tom Knutson, a climate research scientist for NOAA.  We think, based on model simulations that climate change is having an effect, making storms slightly more intense with higher rainfall rates, but these changes are not huge and we cannot yet clearly detect them in observations,  he said.

U.S. calls for U.N. Security Council vote on North Korea on Monday,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United States on Friday told the U.N. Security Council that it intends to call a meeting on Monday to vote on a draft resolution establishing additional sanctions on North Korea for its missile and nuclear program, the U.S. Mission to the United Nations said in a statement. The United States wants the Security Council to impose an oil embargo on North Korea, ban its exports of textiles and the hiring of North Korean laborers abroad, and to subject leader Kim Jong Un to an asset freeze and travel ban, according to a draft resolution seen by Reuters on Wednesday. It was not immediately clear how North Korean ally China and Russia would vote, but a senior U.S. official on Friday night expressed skepticism that either nation would accept anything more stringent than a ban on imports of North Korean textiles. Chinese officials have privately expressed fears that imposing an oil embargo could risk triggering massive instability in its neighbor. A Security Council resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by permanent members Britain, the United States, France, Russia or China to pass. Tension on the Korean peninsula has escalated as the North has stepped up the development of weapons, testing a string of missiles this year, including one flying over Japan, and conducting its sixth nuclear test on Sunday. South Korea braced for a possible further missile test by North Korea when it marks its founding anniversary on Saturday. Experts believe the isolated regime is close to its goal of developing a powerful nuclear weapon capable of reaching the United States, something President Donald Trump has vowed to prevent.

"Exodus of Rohingya to Bangladesh reaches 270,000 - UNHCR","COX S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - An estimated 270,000 Rohingya have sought refuge in Bangladesh over the past two weeks, the U.N. refugee agency said on Friday, announcing a dramatic jump in numbers fleeing violence in neighboring Myanmar s Rakhine State. A rights group said satellite images showed about 450 buildings had been burned down in a Myanmar border town largely inhabited by Rohingya, as part of what the Muslim minority refugees say is a concerted effort to expel them. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said the estimated number of Rohingya who fled to Bangladesh since violence erupted in Myanmar on Aug. 25 had risen from 164,000 on Thursday, after  aid workers found big groups in border areas.  We have identified more people in different areas that we were not aware of,  said Vivian Tan, a spokeswoman for UNHCR, while adding that there could be some double-counting.  The numbers are so alarming - it really means that we have to step up our response and that the situation in Myanmar has to be addressed urgently.  The latest flight of Rohingya began two weeks ago after Rohingya insurgents attacked security force posts in Myanmar s Rakhine State. That triggered an army counteroffensive in which at least 400 people died.  The United States, a principle backer of Aung San Suu Kyi s civilian government that came to power in Myanmar last year, said there had been shortcomings on the part of Myanmar security forces and the government in dealing with the situation. Patrick Murphy, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asia, said Washington was calling in talks with Myanmar s military and civilian leaders for urgent restoration of access to Rakhine State for humanitarian assistance and journalists. He said the security forces must respond responsibly to the attacks that began the crisis, telling reporters:  They have a responsibility to carry out those activities in accordance with rule of law and international human rights  Rights groups briefed U.N. Security Council diplomats on the Myanmar violence on Friday. Russia and China did not send any diplomats, according to people at the meeting. Myanmar has said it is was counting on China and Russia to protect it from any Security Council censure.  U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres spoke with Suu Kyi by phone on Wednesday and reiterated his concerns about the situation in Rakhine State, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told Reuters. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said the United States was  deeply troubled by continued reports of attacks against innocent civilians and will continue to urge (Myanmar) security forces to respect those civilians as it conducts security operations.  Washington was also calling on Myanmar to ensure that aid reached those in need as quickly as possible,  and that it is delivered in a manner that protects their rights and dignity,  she said in a statement. The wave of refugees, many sick or wounded, has strained the resources of aid agencies and communities already helping hundreds of thousands displaced by previous waves of violence in Myanmar. Many have no shelter, and aid agencies are racing to provide clean water, sanitation and food.  We need to prepare for many more to come, I am afraid,  said Shinni Kubo, Bangladesh country manager for UNHCR.  We need huge financial resources. This is unprecedented. This is dramatic. It will continue for weeks and weeks.  While most refugees are coming on foot, many are braving the sea. At least 300 boats carrying Rohingya arrived in Bangladesh s Cox s Bazar district on Wednesday, the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said. Buddhist-majority Myanmar says its security forces are fighting a legitimate campaign against  terrorists  it blames for the attacks on the security forces, burning homes and civilian deaths.  It says about 30,000 non-Muslims have been displaced. The 1.1 million Rohingya living in Myanmar have long complained of persecution. They are denied citizenship and regarded as illegal migrants from Bangladesh. There is very limited access to the north of Rakhine State and few if any independent witnesses, raising fears that a humanitarian crisis could be unfolding among Rohingya still there.  What we know is what people are saying as they come across, and what they re saying now, given this been going on since Aug. 25, is they are in an absolutely desperate state,  said IOM s Leonard Doyle.  They say (they are) living out in (the) open, without protection from the tropical sun with their children, without enough food to eat.   Bangladesh has proposed  safe zones  run by aid groups for Rohingya in Myanmar. But it would seem the plan is unlikely to be accepted there. Human Rights Watch said satellite images taken last Saturday showed hundreds of burned buildings in Maungdaw, a district capital in Rakhine State, in areas primarily inhabited by Rohingya.  If safety cannot even be found in area capitals, then no place may be safe,  said Phil Robertson, the group s deputy Asia director. A Myanmar reporter in the north of the state said he had reports from residents of an area called Rathedaung that six villages there had been torched and that there had also been shooting in the area. It was not clear who was responsible. Critics have accused Suu Kyi of not speaking out for the Rohingya and some have called for the Nobel Peace Prize she won in 1991 as a champion of democracy to be revoked. The United States has been careful to avoid direct criticism of Suu Kyi, and Murphy said Washington was looking to help Myanmar s transition to democracy succeed.  He noted that most authority in Rakhine State lay with the military, which wielded direct power in Myanmar for decades before Suu Kyi s election win. Murphy called for implementation of recommendations of a commission led by former U.N. chief Kofi Annan set up to find solutions for the ethnically and religiously divided Rakhine.  The fact that over a million people inside the country have been devoid of basic rights for generations has been a long-standing issue,  Murphy said.  It needs to be addressed.  Protests against the treatment of the Rohingya were held in several countries, including Muslim-majority Bangladesh,  Indonesia and Malaysia. Others were held outside Myanmar s embassies in Tokyo and Manila. Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said he was considering raising the issue in talks with U.S. President Donald Trump next week. Malaysia s coastguard said it was willing to offer Rohingya  temporary shelter, although it is unlikely refugees would travel hundreds of kilometres south by sea during the monsoon season, which lasts until late November. Thailand has also said it is preparing to receive people fleeing Myanmar, while Singapore said it was ready to help the humanitarian effort. ",worldnews,"September 8, 2017 ",1
New fires ravage Rohingya villages in northwest Myanmar: sources,"YANGON (Reuters) - Up to eight villages were burned down on Friday in a part of northwest Myanmar where large numbers of Muslim Rohingya had been sheltering from a wave of violence engulfing the area, a witness and three sources briefed on the matter told Reuters. The fires were blazing in the ethnically mixed Rathedaung township, where populations of Rohingya Muslims and Rakhine Buddhists live side by side.  Today around 4 p.m., I saw the smoke coming from where the villages were burning ...I saw it from the Chin village where I am staying now,  said a villager from the area contacted by Reuters by phone. It was unclear who set fire to the villages. Independent journalists are not allowed into the area, where Myanmar says its security forces are carrying out clearance operations to defend against  extremist terrorists .  Rights monitors and fleeing Rohingya say the army and Rakhine vigilantes have unleashed a campaign of arson aimed at driving out the Muslim population. The burning of more villages is likely to fuel an exodus of Rohingya to neighboring Bangladesh. Nearly 270,000 have fled in less than two weeks, creating a humanitarian crisis. Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi said on Thursday her government was doing its best to protect everyone, but she has drawn criticism from around the world for failing to speak out about the violence and the Muslim minority, including calls to revoke her 1991 Nobel Peace Prize. Rathedaung, the site of the latest fires, is the furthest Rohingya-inhabited area from the border with Bangladesh. Humanitarian workers had been concerned that a large number of the Muslims had been trapped there. The blazes were confirmed by sources including two monitors with a network of informants on the ground, and a local journalist based in the nearby town of Buthidaung. They said that among the torched villages were the hamlets of Ah Htet Nan Yar and Auk Nan Yar, some 65 km (40 miles) north of Sittwe, capital of Rakhine state. One source said a camp for internally displaced people in the area also went up in flames. One of the sources said 300 to 400 Rohingya who had escaped other burnings had been sheltering at Ah Htet Nan Yar until the day before the fire broke out. They had escaped before it started, the source said, quoting an eyewitness. The villagers were now hiding in the forest or attempting a perilous, days-long journey by foot in the monsoon rain toward the Maungdaw region and further west to the River Naf separating Myanmar and Bangladesh. The latest flight of Rohingya from their homes in Myanmar began two weeks ago after Rohingya insurgents attacked several police posts in Rakhine. That triggered an army counter-offensive in which at least 400 people were killed. ",worldnews,"September 9, 2017 ",1
"Hammered by Andrew, Florida town's rebuilding tested by Irma","HOMESTEAD, Fla. (Reuters) - This sprawling suburb on Florida s southern tip was nearly wiped flat by one hurricane 25 years ago. Now its residents hope they have rebuilt strong enough to withstand another. With Hurricane Irma churning toward Florida on Friday, many people in Homestead prepared to hunker down in houses that are substantially more fortified than those that were swept aside when Hurricane Andrew came ashore in 1992. Barreling ashore with winds of up to 165 miles (265 km) per hour, Andrew ripped roofs off houses and stripped palm trees bare. The Category 5 hurricane was responsible for 61 deaths and $26.5 billion in property damage, making it one of the most expensive storms in U.S. history. But a tough new building code approved after the storm required structures to be built to withstand wind speeds of at least 111 miles per hour. So-called hurricane impact windows, which are now common, must be made with shatterproof glass and cheap materials like particle board can no longer be used on roofs. Even construction cranes, a common sight in downtown Miami, must be able to withstand winds of up to 145 miles per hour. No one knows where Irma, a Category 4 storm with top sustained winds of 155 miles an hour late on Friday, will strike the hardest when it makes its projected landfall in south Florida on Sunday. But fortified roofs and other measures to secure buildings have persuaded people like Joy McRae of Homestead, which includes a major agricultural area, to stay put rather than join the hordes trying to escape for safer ground north on the Florida Turnpike and Interstate 95.  I convinced myself that it s not going to be so bad,  said McRae, 56, as she listed the features of her concrete house, built in 2007, including both shatterproof windows and aluminum  hurricane shutters. Though McRae was worried about possible flooding - many new neighborhoods in Homestead are built in low-lying areas - she said she did not expect a repeat of 1992, when Andrew tore the roof off her house and flattened entire neighborhoods nearby.  We ve got everything battened down, we re just getting some food and we re ready to ride it out,  she said.  If south Florida is sturdier now than it was 25 years ago, it also presents a bigger target, however. The population has grown by more than one-third since Andrew, to 2.7 million, as high-rise condos have sprouted in downtown Miami and potato fields have been transformed into subdivisions in outlying areas like Homestead. Homestead s population has more than doubled since 1992 to 67,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau and all that growth could lead to more devastation.  Insurer Swiss Re, in one estimate, said Irma would cause between $50 billion and $60 billion in damages if it were to  take an identical path to Andrew. That concerns some longtime residents, who say they are worried less by the prospect of property damage than by how their neighbors might behave in the chaos. Schoolteacher Michael Littman, 51, recalls hearing gunshots at night after Andrew blew through his neighborhood. Police struggled restore order for several days, he said, adding that he plans to keep his cellphone, wallet and Smith & Wesson pistol close by this time around.  I ve seen anarchy before,  Littman said.  It s shocking to see what happens when you strip away the thin veneer of civilization.  ",worldnews,"September 9, 2017 ",1
Brazil prosecutor charges members of Temer's party with criminal organization,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil s top prosecutor on Friday charged six lawmakers from President Michel Temer s Brazilian Democracy Movement Party (PMDB) with forming a criminal organization, the latest in a barrage of charges in the country s sprawling corruption scandal. Those accused by prosecutor Rodrigo Janot in a filing with the Supreme Court include former senator and president Jose Sarney, the government s leader in the Senate Romero Juca and four other current senators. A corruption scandal involving cartels of companies bribing officials for public contracts has enveloped most of Brazil s political elite with Janot expected to issue another charge against Temer in coming weeks.  Temer defeated a first corruption charge from Janot, when the lower house of Congress voted not to allow it to proceed to trial. Separately on Friday, the Supreme Court said it would consider next week requests from Temer that would block Janot from issuing further charges. In the charges against the senators, Janot alleges the group  unduly received 864 million reais ($279.84 million) and generated related losses of 5.5 billion reais for state-controlled oil firm Petrobras and 113 million reais for its subsidiary Transpetro. Transpetro s former president, Sergio Machado, was also charged. The PMDB said in a statement that the prosecutor lacked evidence and that it trusted the Supreme Court would set the charges aside. Juca said in a statement he believes the Supreme Court will seriously analyze the charges and he hopes for a speedy investigation. A representative for Machado said he continues to collaborate with authorities, providing evidence of crimes involving politicians and Transpetro suppliers that resulted in several cases being filed. Janot s latest charges echo those against former presidents Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Dilma Rousseff and six other members of the Workers Party for criminal organization earlier this week. Lula and Rousseff deny the charges. ($1 = 3.0875 reais) ",worldnews,"September 8, 2017 ",1

Venezuela's Maduro seeks debt negotiations after U.S. sanctions,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has invited bondholders to unspecified  negotiations  over the country s foreign debt in coming days, in response to recent U.S. financial sanctions.  With Venezuela deep in recession and its currency reserves at their lowest in more than two decades, the Maduro government and state oil company PDVSA have to pay about $4 billion in debt and interest during the rest of 2017.      All bondholders are invited to various rounds of negotiations over the next few weeks,  the president said in a speech late on Thursday to the new Constituent Assembly. He reiterated Venezuela would keep honoring debt, but said he wanted to talk with bondholders affected by sanctions recently imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump.  Maduro said Vice President Tareck El Aissami, already under U.S. financial sanctions over drug trafficking allegations, and Finance Minister Ramon Lobo would coordinate talks and some  bilateral conversations  with bondholders had already begun. In the same speech, Maduro said Venezuela would seek to  free  itself of the U.S. dollar and  implement a new system of international payments  using currencies such as the yuan, yen, rupee, euro and ruble. The president did not, however, specify whether paying in a different currency was an option his government wanted to discuss with bondholders. The Washington-based Institute of International Finance, which represents large banks and financial institutions, said it was advising a group of holders of Venezuelan bonds.  This informal group will take note of the Venezuelan announcements and discuss how to proceed,  IIF Executive Managing Director Hung Tran told Reuters. The group was made up of bondholders from the United States and elsewhere, he said. Tran said Venezuela could not change the currency of bonds without agreement by all or a large majority of holders. Last month, Trump, who brands Maduro a  dictator,  signed an executive order that prohibits Americans from dealing in new debt issued by the Venezuelan government or PDVSA. That could complicate any debt refinancing attempts. Washington has also sanctioned PDVSA s finance boss Simon Zerpa, meaning U.S. businesses are barred from dealing with him, and even Maduro himself in measures intended to punish the Venezuelan government for alleged corruption and rights abuses.   I will be announcing Venezuela s definitive response to the financial aggression we - and the international investors - have suffered from Donald Trump and (opposition leader) Julio Borges,  Maduro added in the speech on Thursday. Borges, the head of the opposition-led congress whose role has been overridden by the Constituent Assembly, has been spearheading an opposition campaign for foreign financial institutions to put the squeeze on Venezuela s government.  Venezuela will take a position to defend the judicial and financial security of the republic and its investors or holders of financial instruments,  Maduro added. Though Maduro gave no further details of what his government wanted to discuss with bondholders or where talks would be held, he did say 74 percent were American or Canadian.  Three bondholders consulted by Reuters said they had not received any formal approach to dialogue, though two said intermediaries for the government had been communicating with some investors informally.  We didn t receive an invitation or anything like that. Even if we had we don t think we would take it too seriously,  said one portfolio manager at a large New York firm that owns Venezuelan debt, asking not to be named.  In trading on Friday, Venezuelan government and PDVSA bonds were little changed in price. The OPEC nation of 30 million people is in the fourth year of a recession, with its population grappling with triple-digit inflation and shortages of food and medicine.  Critics say a long-failing socialist economic system is to blame for Venezuela s financial troubles, while the government blames an alleged  economic war  by domestic foes and Washington.  International reserves stood at $9.873 billion on Wednesday, compared with nearly $30 billion five years ago, central bank data shows. They are at their lowest level since 1995. Most of the country s reserves are tied up in gold that cannot be used in financial transactions without going through a certification process in another country.  In another speech on Friday, Maduro said that Venezuela would begin selling its oil, gas, gold and  all products  in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, but gave no further details of the intended changes in export transactions.

Saudi Arabia suspends any dialogue with Qatar: SPA,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia on Saturday suspended any dialogue with Qatar, accusing it of  distorting facts , just after a report of a phone call between the leaders of both countries suggested a breakthrough in the Gulf dispute. Saudi Arabia s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman spoke by the telephone with Qatar s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani on Friday when they discussed the Gulf dispute, state media from both countries reported earlier. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain cut diplomatic and trade links with Qatar on June 5, suspending air and shipping routes with the world s biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas, which is home to the region s biggest U.S. military base. The nations say Doha supports regional foe Iran and Islamists, charges Qatar s leaders deny. Kuwait has been trying to mediate the dispute.  During the call, the Emir of Qatar expressed his desire to sit at the dialogue table and discuss the demands of the four countries to ensure the interests of all,  Saudi state news agency SPA reported.  The details will be announced later after the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia concludes an understanding with the United Arab Emirates, the Kingdom of Bahrain and the Arab Republic of Egypt,  SPA said. The phone call was the first publicly reported contact between the two leaders since the start of the crisis.  Qatar s state news agency QNA said the phone call was based on coordination of U.S. President Donald Trump who had earlier talked with Sheikh Tamim. Trump on Thursday said he would be willing to step in and mediate the worst dispute in decades among the U.S.-allied Arab states and Qatar, and said he thinks a deal could come quickly. Both Qatar s Emir and the Saudi Crown Prince  stressed the need to resolve the crisis by sitting down to the dialogue table to ensure the unity and stability of the GCC countries,  QNA reported. Sheikh Tamim welcomed the proposal of Prince Mohammed during the call  to assign two envoys to resolve controversial issues in a way that does not affect the sovereignty of the states,  QNA said. Saudi Arabia later issued a second statement citing an unnamed official at the ministry of the foreign affairs denying the QNA report.  What was published on the Qatar News Agency is a continuation of the distortion of the Qatari authority of the facts,  SPA reported citing the Saudi official.  The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia announces the suspension of any dialogue or communication with the authority in Qatar until a clear statement is issued clarifying its position in public.

State Department approves $3.8 billion in arms sales to Bahrain: Pentagon,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has approved arms sales packages worth more than $3.8 billion to Bahrain including F-16 jets, upgrades, missiles and patrol boats, the Pentagon said on Friday. The approvals coincide with the State Department s notification to Congress, which had held up a similar arms deal last year over human rights concerns.  The proposed sales include 19 F-16V jets made by Lockheed Martin Corp which could have a value of up to $2.7 billion, the Pentagon said.  Other potential sales approved Friday include two 35 meter (114 feet) patrol boats with machine guns, 221 anti-tank missiles made by Raytheon Co and $1.8 billion worth of upgrades to Bahrain s existing fleet of F-16 jets, the Pentagon said in separate statements. In May, U.S. President Donald Trump said Washington s relations with Bahrain would improve, after meeting with the king of the Gulf Arab state during a visit to Saudi Arabia. However in June, U.S. Senator Bob Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he would block arms sales to members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, including Bahrain, until they made progress in resolving a simmering dispute with Qatar. But a U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity earlier on Friday, said the proposed sales were cleared by the Senate Foreign Relations and House Foreign Affairs Committees through the regular  tiered review process  which precedes this formal notification. The U.S. official also said the United States has regular discussions with Bahrain on human rights and political reform and continues to urge its government to pursue efforts that will enhance regional security.

Son of Russian lawmaker pleads guilty in cyber crime cases,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The son of a Russian lawmaker accused of stealing credit card data and other personal information has pleaded guilty in two criminal cases stemming from a probe into a $50 million online identity theft scheme, the U.S. Justice Department said on Friday. Roman Seleznev, 33, the son of Russian parliament member Valery Seleznev, pleaded guilty to one count of participating in a racketeering scheme, and another count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud. The charges were filed in federal courts in Nevada and Georgia, and the plea deal for both cases was finalized on Thursday. In April, Seleznev was sentenced to 27 years in prison by a federal court in Washington for his role in a cyber assault involving hacking into point of sale computers to steal credit card numbers. He was arrested in the Maldives and brought to the United States to face charges. The Russian government has previously criticized the arrest, calling it an unlawful kidnapping. Seleznev s attorney, Igor Litvak, said his client accepts responsibility for his role in the two cyber cases settled on Thursday, but that he intends to appeal his conviction stemming from the third separate Washington case.  We still feel the way he was brought to the U.S. was illegal,  Litvak told Reuters.  He was basically kidnapped.  The Nevada and Georgia cases involved a credit card fraud ring known as  Carder.su,  an Internet-based network used by criminals who trafficked stolen credit card data. In pleading guilty, Seleznev admitted he got involved with the ring in January 2009 and sold compromised credit card data to others on the network. He also admitted to serving as a  casher  by working with other hackers to defraud an Atlanta company that helped process credit and debit card transactions. That scheme ultimately let the hackers steal 45.5 million debit card numbers and withdraw $9.4 million from ATMs in 280 cities. ",worldnews,"September 8, 2017 ",1

Factbox: Irma vs Andrew: How 2017's big hurricane compares with 1992,"(Reuters) - Florida Governor Rick Scott has warned that Hurricane Irma, which was barreling toward Florida on Friday, could be more damaging than 1992 s Hurricane Andrew which caused more than $26 billion in devastation in the state. Following are some facts about hurricanes Irma and Andrew: - In 1992, Hurricane Andrew blasted the southern part of Florida as it moved from east to west, spending about four hours over the state. By comparison, Scott warned this week that Irma was wider than all of Florida and could swamp it from coast to coast, during a northward push through the state.  Remember, Hurricane Andrew is one of the worst storms in the history of Florida,  Scott said at a news conference.  This is much worse and more devastating on its current path.  - Hurricane Irma could hit the Florida Keys as a Category 5, which is the highest ranking for a storm s severity, with sustained winds of 160 miles per hour (258 km per hour). Andrew made landfall as a Category 5 with maximum sustained winds of 145 miles per hour (233 km/h), according to the National Weather Service. - Hurricane Andrew directly caused 15 deaths in Florida and another 29 indirect deaths, from causes such as fires, electrocutions and cleanup accidents, according to the National Weather Service. It directly killed eight people in Louisiana, and indirectly killed nine more in the Southern state. - Andrew damaged or destroyed 126,000 single-family houses and ripped apart 9,000 mobile homes, according to the National Weather Service. It also caused property damage in Louisiana after sweeping through the Gulf of Mexico.     Irma is larger than Andrew and it could leave 100,000 people without shelter, Federal Emergency Management Agency  Administrator Brock Long warned at a news conference. - In Homestead, Hurricane Andrew destroyed 1,167 mobile homes, which amounted to 99 percent of all the mobile homes in that South Florida town, according to the National Weather Service. After Andrew, the federal government imposed more stringent regulations for those types of homes.   ",worldnews,"September 8, 2017 ",1
Miami hospitals prepare for surge in births during Hurricane Irma,"(Reuters) - While many Miami hospitals are shutting down as Hurricane Irma bears down on Florida, some are offering shelter to their pregnant patients, bracing for the increase in births that often accompanies these large storms. At least three of the city s hospitals have plans in place to care for women with advanced or high-risk pregnancies.  They could be busy. When Houston was hit by Hurricane Harvey, the number of women who gave birth spiked. According to a Memorial Hermann Health System representative, at least five of the not-for-profit system s 11 Houston-area hospitals with labor and delivery units reported increases in the number of deliveries during Hurricane Harvey. In three, deliveries doubled. The reason may have something to do with a drop in barometric pressure that accompanies a hurricane. A 2007 study published in the Archives of Gynecology and Obstetrics noted a causal relationship between low barometric pressure and spontaneous delivery. But overall, the evidence is inconclusive, said Dr. Shannon Clark, an associate professor in the division of maternal fetal medicine at University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, on the Gulf of Mexico.  There s some studies that show an association and some that don t. It s kind of mixed,  Clark said in a telephone interview. Even so, she said,  It s still worth it to forewarn pregnant women in areas that are going to get hit that there could be a potential complication.  In Miami, Jackson Health System alerted women who are at least 34 weeks pregnant or who have a high-risk pregnancy that they may take shelter in one of three of its hospitals, as long as they have registered with the hospital in advance. These women are allowed to bring in one guest, but no pets. Tania Leets, a spokeswoman for the public health system which serves Miami-Dade County, said they offered the same service last year during Hurricane Matthew. Baptist Health South Florida offers shelter to women in Miami who are at least 36 weeks pregnant or who have a high-risk pregnancy in one of its four area hospitals. A pregnant woman and one adult companion can set up camp in a waiting room area; those who come must bring their own food, water and bedding. The shelter opens at 8 a.m. on Saturday and closes when the storm has passed, Baptist Health South said in a statement.  Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach will likewise shelter women who are at least 36 weeks pregnant or those with high-risk pregnancies, according to a statement on its website. At Memorial Hermann Greater Heights Hospital in Houston,  deliveries started to soar two days before Hurricane Harvey arrived, requiring five managers to help with patient care.   We all know in this business - full moons and storms are a problem,  said Kim Kendall, director of the hospital s family birth center. Staff made an effort to close the shades, redirect the conversation and focus on the delivery.  We tried to maximize the experience and minimize the hurricane,  said Kendall.

Pope urges skeptical Colombians to accept peace with guerrillas,"VILLAVICENCIO, Colombia (Reuters) - Pope Francis urged Colombians skeptical of a peace deal with guerrillas to be open to reconciliation with those who have repented, speaking hours after a top rebel leader asked the pontiff for forgiveness.  Dear people of Colombia: do not be afraid of asking for forgiveness and offering it,  he said, at an emotional meeting that brought together victims of the 50-year civil war with former guerrilla and paramilitary fighters. The Argentine pope, leader of the world s Roman Catholics, is visiting Colombia with a message of national reconciliation, as the country tries to heal the wounds left by the conflict and bitter disagreements over a peace deal agreed last year. Francis flew to the city of Villavicencio in Meta province, a vast cattle ranching area which was a hotbed of right-wing paramilitary and Marxist guerrilla violence during a conflict with successive governments. As he arrived, former Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebel leader Rodrigo Londono, now the head of a new political party, issued an open letter to the pope asking for forgiveness for the suffering the group inflicted. [nL2N1LP0UZ]  Your repeated expressions about God s infinite mercy move me to plead your forgiveness for any tears or pain that we have caused the people of Colombia,  Londono, who goes by the alias Timochenko, said in the letter. Tens of thousands of ecstatic people in this humid area of savanna and shantytowns packed the roads as the pope, riding in the front seat of a simple car, passed by on Friday morning after his plane arrived from the capital Bogota. The pope s afternoon prayer meeting in Villavicencio with about 6,000 survivors of the brutal conflict was the centerpiece of his five-day trip to overwhelmingly Catholic Colombia. He listened to personal accounts from four people, including a woman who joined a paramilitary group when she was 16, a former FARC guerrilla, and two victims of violence between the guerrillas and paramilitary squads. One of the victims, Pastora Mira Garc a, told how she lost her father, husband and two children in the conflict. To great applause she urged forgiveness to  break the cycle of violence  and said she could now  name the unnamable and forgive the unforgivable . On the wall of the stage was a destroyed statue of Jesus Christ recovered from a church attacked by the FARC in 2002 in the rain forest village of Bojaya. About 80 people were killed as they sought refuge from rebel bombings inside the humble church. The plaster figure, without arms or legs, has become an enduring symbol of the war.  As we look at it, we remember not only what happened on that day, but also the immense suffering, the many deaths and broken lives, and all the blood spilled in Colombia these past decades,  the pope said. Conflict between right-wing paramilitary squads, Marxist rebels, and government forces since the 1960s has killed more than 220,000 people and left millions more displaced. Now Colombians are deeply polarized as they prepare to receive 7,000 former fighters, such as Londono, into society. Many are furious that under last year s peace deal, FARC leaders accused of kidnapping and murder will avoid jail sentences and may receive seats in congress as members of a new political party. [nL1N1DN22O] Francis addressed this hesitancy head-on.   Undoubtedly, it is a challenge for each of us to trust that those who inflicted suffering on communities and on a whole country can take a step forward,  he said.   Let us heal that pain and welcome every person who has committed offences, who admits their failures, is repentant and truly wants to make reparation.  As he left Villavicencio, he stopped to pray at the Reconciliation Cross, a memorial to survivors and those killed during the war, and planted a tree as a symbol of peace. Earlier, Francis celebrated a Mass for hundreds of thousands of people on a muddy field to beatify Pedro Maria Ramirez, a priest who was killed in 1948 during a period of political violence known as  La Violencia,  and Bishop Jesus Emilio Jaramillo, killed in 1989 by the National Liberation Army (ELN) for suspected collaboration with the military.

Togo leader must quit now for protests to stop: opposition head,"DAKAR/LOME (Reuters) - The leader of Togo s main opposition alliance said on Friday that President Faure Gnassingbe must quit power immediately or protests against his family s 50-year ruling dynasty would continue. Thousands of people have taken to the streets in the past three days to demand that Gnassingbe step aside, in the most serious challenge to his family s stranglehold on power since the death of his father in 2005. Police used tear gas to disperse protesters who were burning tires in Lome s opposition stronghold of Be on Friday, a Reuters correspondent said.   He has to leave now. We will not accept him staying on any longer,  Jean-Pierre Fabre, head of the National Alliance for Change, told Reuters by telephone.   The Togolese are tired ... We will continue to protest.  It was not immediately possible to reach Gnassingbe s office. Text messages and phone calls were restricted and the internet has suffered outages. A short government statement on state TV merely acknowledged the protests and said that 10 people had been injured in them, of which eight were security forces and two protesters.  But unrest was less widespread than in previous days and traffic had resumed in some areas of the seaside capital amid a heavy police and paramilitary presence. By evening there were no further reports of protests, which seemed to have died down, a Reuters witness said. The president s father Gnassingbe Eyadema seized power in a coup in 1967 and ruled for 38 years before his death.  In response to protests, he introduced a 1992 constitution that brought in notional multi-party democracy and limited presidential terms to two. Ten years later, lawmakers scrapped the term limit so Eyadema could run for another term.  When he died in 2005, the military installed his son instead of the national assembly head as was legally required, triggering protests in which at least 500 people were killed. Fabre, a French-educated former economics lecturer and newspaper editor, lost to Gnassingbe in disputed presidential polls in 2010 and 2015. He told Reuters that another election would not be fair unless major reforms were made. Gnassingbe s government this week sought to appease its opponents by tabling a draft bill to reform the constitution and reintroduce a two-term limit, but opposition leaders reject it because it could still enable Gnassingbe to rule until 2030. The president, who has encouraged investment to try to turn his tiny nation into a business, banking and shipping hub modeled on Singapore or Dubai, has a mandate due to expire in 2020. But Fabre said even that was too late for him to leave.  We can t accept that. This is a question of liberty,  he said.  The resistance is now organizing itself ... We are very numerous.  The U.N. Special Representative for West Africa and the Sahel Mohamed Ibn Chambas urged Togo to respond to people s  legitimate expectations . He also called on all parties  to preserve peace and security . Chambas, who met with Gnassingbe on Thursday, has delayed his departure and is staying in Togo for further discussions, his spokesman said.   I remain convinced that all parties want to move forward on the reforms ... in order to reach a consensus to respond to the legitimate expectations of the Togolese people,  Chambas said in a statement. Since Gambian autocrat Yahya Jammeh was forced out after losing an election last December, West African countries have become unanimous in accepting two terms as the limit on presidential office   the only exception being Togo. Security forces appear to have avoided bloodshed so far this week, but Amnesty International condemned security forces for firing tear gas at and beating peaceful protesters, and for an  unjustified attack on internet freedom.

U.S. Navy moving aircraft carrier for Hurricane Irma relief,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Navy said on Friday that it was moving the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln and other ships into position to provide humanitarian relief from Hurricane Irma if needed. The Abraham Lincoln, along with the amphibious assault ship Iwo Jima and transport dock ship New York, have left Norfolk, Virginia and are making their way south while trying to avoid the hurricane, U.S. officials said. A destroyer is expected to join them.  These ships are capable of providing medical support, maritime civil affairs, maritime security, expeditionary logistic support, medium and heavy-lift air support,  the statement said. In total, the four ships have three CH-53E Marine heavy lift helicopters, 10 MH-60S and 14 MH-60R Navy medium life helicopters. The Pentagon said the assault ship Wasp near the U.S. Virgin Islands was carrying out evacuations for critical patients from the island of St. Thomas to the larger St. Croix island. So far, 21 patients have been evacuated with another 23 evacuations planned for Friday, U.S. Northern Command said in a statement.  The U.S. Air Force said it had moved 50 F-16 fighter jets and more than 100 personnel from Shaw Air Force base in South Carolina to Louisiana. Military facilities in the path of the hurricane have ordered evacuations.  MacDill Air Force base in Tampa, home to U.S. Central Command which oversees military operations in the Middle East, ordered a mandatory evacuation. Marine Corps Recruit Depot in Parris Island, South Carolina, said it had authorized and encouraged non-essential military and civilian personnel to evacuate.  ",worldnews,"September 8, 2017 ",1
Additional inspectors sent to Florida's nuclear plants ahead of Irma: NRC,"(Reuters) - The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said on Friday it has dispatched additional inspectors to the Turkey Point and St. Lucie nuclear plants in Florida in preparation for the effects of hurricane Irma on those sites. Turkey Point was expected to close on Friday evening and St. Lucie is to shut about 12 hours later, depending on the storm s path. The nuclear plants are located along Florida s Atlantic Coast, about 20 feet (6 meters) above sea level. The NRC inspectors are verifying that all of the preparations have been completed, and the plants  emergency diesel generators are available to be used if the storm affects off-site power supplies, the agency said in a statement. The inspectors will remain at the nuclear plant sites and the incident response center will remain staffed until the agency is assured that the storm no longer poses a risk to these facilities, the agency said.  The NRC expects to activate the regional incident response center in Atlanta, Georgia, on Saturday. Electricity generator Florida Power & Light (FPL), a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Inc, generates enough power for about 1.9 million homes at the Turkey Point and St. Lucie plants.  Hurricane Irma is expected to hit Florida as a powerful Category 4 on Sunday. It threatens to knock out power to more than 4.1 million homes and businesses served by FPL, affecting around nine million people based on the current storm track, the utility s chief executive said.

U.N. aviation agency to call for global drone registry,"MONTREAL (Reuters) - The United Nations  aviation agency is backing the creation of a single global drone registry, as part of broader efforts to come up with common rules for flying and tracking unmanned aircraft. While the International Civil Aviation Organization cannot impose regulations on countries, ICAO has proposed formation of the registry during a Montreal symposium this month to make data accessible in real time, said Stephen Creamer, director of ICAO s air navigation bureau. The single registry would eschew multiple databases in favor of a one-stop-shop that would allow law enforcement to remotely identify and track unmanned aircraft, along with their operator and owner.  The initiative comes at a time when drone usage is soaring in the United States, Europe and China, raising privacy concerns and fears of collisions with commercial jets.    You ve got to have some commonality so that you re not carrying five receivers in your police car,  Creamer said in an interview on Thursday. It s not yet clear who would operate such a database, although ICAO could possibly fill that role. The proposal, however, could face push back from users, after hobbyists successfully challenged the creation of a U.S. drone registry by the Federal Aviation Administration in court earlier this year. ICAO will host the symposium from Sept 22-23 on issues like registering and tracking drones, along with geofencing-like systems to prevent their operation in restricted areas. The talks will be at an event attended by experts and companies like Google, Rockwell Collins (COL.N) and Amazon.com (AMZN.O), according to the meeting program schedule. Montreal-headquartered ICAO, which normally sets standards for international civil aviation that are adopted by its 191-member countries, was asked to assist in the development of more uniform domestic drone regulations because the remotely-piloted aircraft are sold and flown globally.  They (drone makers) are worried that Europe might create one set of standards, United States might do a second and China might do a third. And they ve got to build a drone differently in these different environments,  Creamer said. Parimal Kopardekar, a principal investigator for Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management (UTM) at the NASA Ames Research Center in California said he supported the drone industry developing around the world with common operating standards.  I think it s smart that ICAO is trying to harmonize it,  he said by phone.    If you have a drone that you build in one country you should be able to use it in another country and vice versa.

U.S waives Jones Act to secure fuel for hurricane responders,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Friday said it was temporarily waiving a law that limits the availability of cargoes on the U.S. coasts, a step that will ensure enough fuel reaches emergency responders during Hurricane Irma and in the wake of Hurricane Harvey.  The Jones Act mandates the use of U.S.-flagged vessels to transport merchandise between U.S. coasts. The Department of Homeland Security waived the requirement for one week. This will allow oil and gas operators to use often cheaper, tax-free, or more readily available foreign-flagged vessels. Harvey, which hit Texas with record floods, had a wider effect of disrupting fuel distribution across Florida, Georgia and other Southeastern states by shutting refineries and pipelines.  With Hurricane Irma, one of the most powerful Atlantic storms in a century, expected to hit Florida in days, the region will experience  one of the largest mass evacuations in American history  and see historic levels of restoration and response crews, said Elaine Duke, acting secretary of Homeland Security. Waiving the Jones Act will ensure there is fuel to support lifesaving efforts and restore services and infrastructure in the wake of the storm, Duke said.  ",worldnews,"September 8, 2017 ",1
Factbox: Florida's most deadly and destructive hurricanes,"(Reuters) - Hurricane Irma was churning toward Florida on Friday, prompting the governor to plead with residents in the evacuation zone to flee their homes before the powerful and immense storms slams into the southern half of the state on Sunday.  Following are five of the most deadly and destructive hurricanes to make landfall in Florida, listed in chronological order: - Great Miami Hurricane, 1926 Miami s population had boomed in the early 1920s, and hurricanes were a strange phenomenon to new residents. When the eye of the storm came, people wandered outside in the deceptive calm. After they eye had passed, they were caught off guard by deadly winds and high waves. Outside Miami, flooding at Lake Okeechobee also caused many deaths. The storm killed at least 372 people in the state.  - Okeechobee Hurricane, 1928 It made landfall in Palm Beach County, Florida, unleashing waves as high as 20 feet (6 meters). In Palm Beach, a haven for the wealthy, some structures were flattened. The south shore of Lake Okeechobee, where migrant farm workers lived, was flooded as water topped dikes. At least 2,500 people are believed to have died from the storm in Florida, according to the National Weather Service. - Florida Keys Labor Day Hurricane, 1935 The hurricane struck the Florida Keys as a Category 5, the highest ranking possible. It killed more than 200 World War One veterans who were in the Keys to build a highway. The storm ranks as the most intense hurricane to hit the United States, based on a record low barometric pressure reading of 26.35 inches, according to the National Weather Service. It generated wind speeds of up to 200 miles per hour (322 km per hour). After ravaging the Keys, the storm moved north off the western coast of Florida before turning inland. In all, more than 400 people died in Florida.   - Hurricane Andrew, 1992 The hurricane struck South Miami-Dade County and caused an estimated $26 billion in damage. That ranked as the most expensive storm in U.S. history, until Hurricane Katrina inundated New Orleans and pummeled other parts of the U.S. South in 2005. More than a dozen people were directly killed by the storm in Florida, with others dying of indirect causes.  - Hurricane Wilma, 2005 While the death toll of five victims in Florida was low, compared with other hurricanes, Wilma caused more than $20 billion in property damage. It rambled across the southern part of the state, generating wind gusts of more than 100 miles per hour (161 km per hour). ",worldnews,"September 8, 2017 ",1
French minister calls out Trump on climate change as Irma wreaks havoc,"PARIS (Reuters) - French Environment Minister Nicolas Hulot said on Friday extreme weather conditions like the powerful hurricane bearing down on Florida risked becoming the norm, and took a dig at U.S. President Donald Trump s stance on climate change. In an interview with France 2 TV about Hurricane Irma, Hulot implied that Trump - who has called global warming a hoax - was ignoring the reality of man-made climate change, which most mainstream scientists regard as an established fact. Trump said in May he was pulling the United States out of the landmark 2015 global agreement to fight climate change that was brokered in Paris, saying it would harm the U.S. economy and cost jobs. Irma - described by Trump as a storm of  absolutely historic destructive potential  - pummeled Cuba and the Bahamas on Friday, and a second powerful hurricane was tracking towards the northeastern Caribbean. Asked if the storms might force Trump to rethink his  climate change policy, Hulot said:  What will change in the United States are the federal states, the cities, a whole section of society. I think that is what will make up for the reservations of the American president on the links between cause and effect.    ",worldnews,"September 8, 2017 ",1
Brazil police arrest ex-minister Vieira Lima after cash seizure,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian police on Friday said they arrested former minister Geddel Vieira Lima on new charges after a corruption probe found his fingerprints in bags hiding more than 51 million reais ($16.52 million) in cash. Vieira Lima was in charge of President Michel Temer s relations with Congress until November.  He had been under house arrest since July, accused of obstruction of justice for allegedly trying to deter entrepreneur L cio Funaro, who worked for politicians close to Temer, from striking a plea bargain deal with prosecutors. Judge Vallisney de Souza Oliveira said in a ruling authorizing the arrest that it was necessary to stop Lima from committing other crimes.  Police took hours to calculate the exact amount of money found in boxes and bags earlier this week at an apartment in Salvador, in the nation s biggest-ever cash seizure. When Lima resigned from his cabinet post in November, he was the fifth minister to leave the administration over graft allegations. Temer himself was later charged by the country s top prosecutor of corruption, an accusation he managed to defeat through a lower house vote in August.  Lima s lawyer, Gamil Foppel, said his client had no access to the court documents about the evidence found by police, in clear violation of the law.

U.S.-led surveillance aircraft leave area near Islamic State convoy in Syria,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State said on Friday its surveillance aircraft had moved away from an Islamic State convoy which has been trying to reach territory in east Syria. The Islamic State convoy has split in two, with 11 buses remaining in the open desert after others turned back into government-held areas. The Syrian government and Lebanon s Hezbollah group offered the convoy of originally about 300 lightly armed Islamic State fighters and about 300 family members safe passage in return for the militant group surrendering an enclave on the Syria-Lebanon border. However, the coalition has blocked the convoy from entering Islamic State territory in east Syria, near the border with Iraq, by cratering roads and destroying bridges.  To ensure safe de-confliction of efforts to defeat ISIS, coalition surveillance aircraft departed the adjacent airspace at the request of Russian officials during their assault on Dawyr Az Zawyr,  the coalition said in the Friday statement, using an acronym for Islamic State. The coalition said Syrian pro-regime forces had  advanced past  the convoy.  The regime s advance past the convoy underlines continued Syrian responsibility for the buses and terrorists,  Brigadier General Jon Braga, director of operations for the coalition said.

Hurricane Irma may cut power to over 9 million people in Florida: utility,"(Reuters) - Hurricane Irma threatens to knock out power to more than 4.1 million homes and businesses served by Florida Power & Light (FPL), affecting around nine million people based on the current storm track, the utility s chief executive said on Friday.  Everyone in Florida will be impacted in some way by this storm,  Eric Silagy said at a news conference, urging FPL customers to be prepared for a multiweek restoration process. FPL is the biggest power company in Florida serving almost half of the state s 20.6 million residents. Outages across the state will likely top 4.1 million customers since other utilities, including units of Duke Energy Corp, Southern Co and Emera Inc, will also suffer outages but have not yet estimated how many. Irma poses a significantly bigger menace to power supplies in Florida than Hurricane Harvey did in Texas because Irma is packing 150 mile-per-hour winds (240 km/h) that could down electric lines and close nuclear and other power plants.  This storm is unprecedented as far as strength and size. We are preparing for the worst and will likely have to rebuild parts of our service territory,  Silagy said, noting the kinds of winds expected could snap concrete poles. Irma s winds have rivaled the strongest for any hurricane in history in the Atlantic, whereas Harvey s damage came from record rainfall. Even as Houston flooded, the power stayed on for most, allowing citizens to use TV and radio to stay apprised of danger, or social media to call for help.  When Harvey made landfall in Texas it made it fully inland and weakened pretty quickly. Irma, however, could retain much of its strength,  said Jason Setree, a meteorologist at Commodity Weather Group. Irma has killed several people and devastated islands in the Caribbean.  Current forecasts put almost the entirety of the Florida peninsula in the path of the storm, which made landfall in the Caribbean with wind speeds of 185 mph. The threat of the Category 4 storm, the second highest rung on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, is grave enough that FPL plans to shut its two nuclear power plants in the state, and officials warned that it may have to rebuild parts of its power system, which could take weeks. One of those nuclear plants, Turkey Point, is located south of Miami near the southern tip of Florida, putting it near where Irma is expected to make landfall early Sunday morning. The other nuclear plant, St. Lucie, is on a barrier island on the east coast about 120 miles (193 km) north of Miami. Most Florida residents have not experienced a major storm since 2005, when total outages peaked around 3.6 million during Hurricane Wilma. Some of those outages lasted for weeks. Setree compared the projected path of Irma to Hurricane Matthew in 2016, which knocked out power to about 1.2 million FPL customers in October. FPL, a unit of Florida energy company NextEra Energy Inc, restored service to most customers affected by Matthew in just two days. In a statement this week, FPL estimated about half of its near five million customers - particularly in the trio of populous southeast counties Miami-Dade, Palm Beach and Broward - had not experienced a major hurricane since 2005. FPL said it had invested nearly $3 billion since 2006 to strengthen its grid, including placing 60 main power lines underground and installing nearly five million smart meters and other devices. Other utilities in the Sunshine State said in statements that they had also invested in intelligent, self-healing devices. Smart meters allow utilities to see outages as they occur, rather than waiting on customer calls, and utilities also use automated devices that can reenergize lines without damage that were taken offline because of contact with trees or other objects, said Jay Apt, director of the Carnegie Mellon Electricity Industry Center in Pittsburgh. Olivia Ross, a spokeswoman for CenterPoint Energy, which serves the greater Houston area, said these devices helped the utility keep the lights on for more people in the aftermath of Harvey as some issues were resolved remotely. But such devices can only do so much. Harvey s outages were limited to 312,000 customers, of which CenterPoint was responsible for about 109,000, as it quickly lost force after landfall and turned into a tropical storm. By contrast, Ross noted, Hurricane Ike in 2008 caused 2.1 million of CenterPoint s customers to lose power when it hit the Texas coast near Houston. ",worldnews,"September 8, 2017 ",1
'Ghost boats' drop Tunisian migrants onto sunny Italian tourist beaches,"ROME (Reuters) - The figures jumping from a small boat into the clear shallow waters and running ashore on an Italian beach look like troops practicing a D-Day-style landing, but this is no drill, and these are not soldiers. The images, caught on camera, show what has become a increasingly common sight on the beaches of Italy s southern islands - migrants from Africa landing in broad daylight.  In the past these boats came at night,  said Claudio Lombardo, the local head of the Mareamico (Friend of the Sea) environmental group who filmed the scene on a beach near Agrigento in Sicily on Wednesday morning.   When they came at night, all you saw was the abandoned boat on the beach the next day and the people were nowhere to be found, and that s why we called them ghost boats.  The change in tactic by people smugglers comes as the number of arrivals from Libya - long the busiest route for migrants from Africa trying to reach the European Union - have plummeted since departures from the coastal city of Sabratha were stopped by a shadowy armed group this summer.   As Libyan departures slumped, wooden boats from neighboring Tunisia have started landing on secluded Sicilian beaches, often in broad daylight while tourists are out sunbathing, an official leading the investigation into the arrivals told Reuters. Some 3,000 migrants, mostly men, have come from Tunisia in the past two months, with between 1,500-1,800 landing on the south coast of Sicily, and the rest on the smaller islands of Lampedusa or Linosa, said the local investigator, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  It is still fewer than the Libyan arrivals, which totaled well over 10,000 over the past two months, but such numbers have not been seen since Tunisia s  Arab Spring  revolution in 2010 and 2011, said Lombardo, whose priority is to protect beaches from damage caused by the abandoned boats and belongings. Those who reached the smaller islands have almost all been identified by police, while between 20 to 40 percent of those who made it to Sicily vanished without trace, the official said. Almost all are Tunisians, and some had already been expelled from Italy in the past, the investigator said. The Agrigento court is looking to see if smugglers pick them up upon arrival in Italy.  We re more concerned about the ones who try to flee because perhaps they could have problems with the law either in Tunisia or Italy,  he said. As for the 50-or-so filmed by Lombardo, they climbed up into the dry hills beyond the beach and headed inland, discarding T-shirts and shoes.  They have a kit with them, which is a bag with a change of clothes, and bottles of water and milk,  Lombardo said.  Within 30 minutes, they disappear. They re gone.  Police pick up many found walking along roads, the investigator said. On Thursday, one young Tunisian man was killed by a car in a hit-and-run near Agrigento. While some of the boats are big enough to make the more than 200-km (125-mile) crossing from Tunisia, some are very small, raising questions about how they got there.  We have not excluded the existence of mother ships,  the investigator said, referring to large fishing boats used in the past to ferry migrants close to the coast before putting them onto smaller boats for the last leg of the voyage.

UK's Farage says PM May might not last until Christmas,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage said on Friday that British Prime Minister Theresa May might be out of a job by Christmas unless she manages to get her party behind her and take charge of Brexit negotiations. Speaking at an election campaign event for the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) in Berlin, Farage said May needed to rapidly assert her authority over her Conservatives and also over the Brexit negotiations.  If she doesn t do those two things - doesn t get some sense of order back into her own party and direction back into where the negotiations are going then I think the whispering campaign will go from something that is being done in private to being done in public and she might not last til Christmas,  he said. At a citadel on the outskirts of Germany s capital, Farage said leading British ministers have been contradicting each other on a weekly basis so the government looked rudderless.  She has to stamp her authority on the party and do so pretty damn quickly,  said Farage, who while leader of the anti-EU UKIP Party played an important role in pressuring then-Prime Minister David Cameron to hold the Brexit referendum.

Britain's Farage talks Brexit at German right-wing election rally,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage received a standing ovation at a pre-election rally of the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) in Berlin on Friday, where he was presented as a model of what a right-wing eurosceptic politician can achieve. Far-right parties have suffered setbacks this year at elections in France and the Netherlands, but the AfD is set to enter Germany s national parliament for the first time in the Sept. 24 parliamentary vote. Farage, a leading voice in the victorious movement last year for Britain to leave the European Union, bemoaned the lack of discussion of Brexit in the German campaign.  (I m trying) to get a proper debate going in the biggest, richest and most important, powerful country in Europe about not just the shape of Brexit but perhaps even the shape of the European project to come,  Farage told reporters. He said Chancellor Angela Merkel and her Social Democrat (SPD) challenger Martin Schulz had refused to discuss Brexit as it was a  huge embarrassment for the European dream that both of them have had . Polls put the AfD, which wants to put an end to euro zone bailouts and call a referendum on Germany s EU membership, on up to 11 percent support. That could make it the largest opposition party if Merkel wins, as expected, and renews her  grand coalition  with the SPD. Beatrix von Storch, the AfD s 46-year-old deputy chairwoman, said her party took hope from Farage, who was a founding member of the eurosceptic UK Independence Party in 1993.  Nigel Farage showed the impossible is possible if you just believe in it and fight this fight - he did that for more than two decades and that makes him a role model for us,  she said. Farage said he thought Merkel would probably be better for Brexit as she was more likely to agree to a free trade deal between Britain and the EU, while Schulz, previously president of the European Parliament, was a  pro-EU fanatic .

"South Africa's Dlamini-Zuma, ANC leadership contender, to become MP","JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African veteran politician and anti-apartheid activist Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, a leading contender to take over as head of the ruling ANC in December, will be sworn in as a member of parliament next week, a senior party official said on Friday. Dlamini-Zuma, the ex-wife of current ANC leader and South African President Jacob Zuma, does not hold a top position and could use a seat in parliament to raise her profile ahead of the party s December leadership conference.   She is going to be sworn in,  ANC Secretary General Gwede Mantashe was quoted as saying by the local EWN news network. The former health and foreign affairs minister s main opponent in the ANC leadership race is expected to be Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, a trade unionist-turned-business tycoon whom many investors would prefer to see running a country with serious economic challenges. Dlamini-Zuma is pushing for a more radical redistribution of wealth from whites to blacks, a policy that appeals to many poor people who resent the stark racial inequality that persists 23 years after the end of apartheid. The next head of the ANC will be the party s presidential candidate in 2019 general elections. ",worldnews,"September 8, 2017 ",1
"Irma to stress-test Florida insurers, reinsurers: rating agencies","(Reuters) - Florida s insurance and reinsurance market is well equipped to handle hurricane losses, but Irma could strain the state s coverage market depending on the extent it makes landfall in Florida, according to rating agencies. Irma, the second major hurricane to approach the United States in two weeks, is expected to make landfall in south Florida on Sunday morning. Fitch said if the storm were to produce insured losses greater than $75 billion, some Florida insurers and reinsurers could experience  notable financial strain . Irma hit the Dominican Republic and Haiti on Friday, heading for Cuba and the Bahamas. The projected path and severity of Irma creates the potential for economic and insured losses to significantly exceed those experienced in Hurricane Andrew in 1992, Fitch said.

Russia hopes to agree on debt repayment with Venezuela by year-end,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Russian finance ministry wants to find a solution on how Venezuela will fulfill its debt obligations to Moscow by the end of this year, a senior ministry official said on Friday.     Konstantin Vyshkovsky, head of the state debt department at the finance ministry, told Reuters that Venezuela owed Russia more than $3 billion. Venezuela borrowed from Russia in late 2011 but failed to keep up with payments on the debt in 2016 as the South American state faced a full-blown economic and financial crisis.  For now we consider it to be a liquidity crisis but not a crisis of financial solvency,  Vyshkovsky said. Vyshkovsky said that the finance ministry hoped to agree on new conditions for how Caracas would honor the debt by the end of 2017.   What the conditions would be like and how quickly we would find a compromise remains to be seen. But our partners speak about a strong desire to reach an agreement quickly,  Vyshkovsky said. Vyshkovsky declined to say when he would expect Caracas to pay back its debt. Venezuela s unraveling socialist government is increasingly turning to ally Russia for the cash and credit it needs to survive, according to a Reuters special report published last month.

"Germany disputes size of Russian wargames, predicts 100,000 troops","TALLINN (Reuters) - Germany said on Thursday that Russia was planning to send more than 100,000 troops to war games on NATO s eastern flank this month, disputing Moscow s version that only 13,000 Russian and Belarussian servicemen would participate. The Sept. 14-20 exercises known as Zapad, or  West  in Belarus, the Baltic Sea, western Russia and the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, are stirring unease in NATO despite Moscow s assurances troops would rehearse a purely defensive scenario.  It is undisputed that we are seeing a demonstration of capabilities and power of the Russians,  German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen told reporters at an EU defense ministers  meeting in Tallinn.   Anyone who doubts that only has to look at the high numbers of participating forces in the Zapad exercise: more than one hundred thousand,  she said in a joint news conference with her French counterpart Florence Parly. (For a graphic on Russia's Zapad war games click tmsnrt.rs/2xQtYwH)  While Baltic nations have voiced concerns about a bigger-than-reported exercise and while NATO s secretary-general expects more than 13,000 troops, Von der Leyen s remarks are the first time a top Western politician has called out Russia publicly on what NATO sees as the true size of the war games. Such numbers would be legal under international treaties on war games, but would require inviting international observers. With less than 13,000 troops, international observation of the drills is not mandatory, Russia says. In a sign of efforts to contain tensions, NATO general Petr Pavel held his first face-to face meeting in more than two years with Russia s top general, Valery Gerasimov, in Azerbaijan on Thursday, the alliance said.  NATO said in a statement the meeting showed  a clear mutual interest to maintain the military lines of communication.  An exercise on that scale is one of NATO s most pressing concerns. France, for one, believes the war games are no simple military drill, even though Russian Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin told Western military attaches in Moscow in August the West had nothing to fear. Russia accuses NATO of building up forces on its frontiers in a manner reminiscent of the Cold War. But NATO says it is protecting the interests of member states bordering Russia who are troubled by Moscow s annexation of Ukraine s Crimea and links to pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine. Previous large-scale exercises in 2013 employed special forces training, longer-range missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles that were later used in the Crimea annexation and in actions in eastern Ukraine and Syria, NATO diplomats said.  Russia has a global strategy of a visible, deliberate demonstration of force,  Parly said before heading to meet French troops in Estonia as part of NATO s deployment of deterrent forces in the Baltics and Poland.  They have a strategy of intimidation,  Parly said, warning that any attack on a Baltic country or Poland by Russia would be considered an attack on all of the U.S.-led NATO alliance.

We'll lift Russia sanctions when east Ukraine is peaceful: Merkel,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Friday that she wanted European Union sanctions against Russia lifted, but only once peaceful conditions had been achieved in eastern Ukraine.

I spend much of my time working to achieve reasonable, good relations with Russia,  Merkel said, adding that she was trying, along with France, to achieve  peaceful conditions  in eastern Ukraine, where Moscow-backed separatists are fighting a war against the Kiev government.  The moment we get that, we will also lift the sanctions,  she said, adding that Russia s annexation of the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine and its backing for separatists were  against the principles that we have had in place since World War Two .

Backed by Western governments, the U.N. is trying to heal a rift between Libya s rival factions in order to stabilize the country and to tackle militant violence and people-smuggling from Libya s northern coast.  The mission has been based in Tunis since 2014, when fighting among rival Libyan brigades forced out most foreign embassy staff, but it has gradually increased its presence in Libya and has been planning for months for a fuller return. The military unit would probably consist of around 150 guards, Jean-Pierre Lacroix, U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, told a news briefing in Geneva. Most will be Nepalese.  To make sure that we protect our colleagues as they deploy in Tripoli there will be a guard unit which will be basically U.N. military personnel coming from Nepal,  Lacroix said.  U.N. Libya envoy Ghassan Salame told Italian newspaper La Stampa that  a little under 250  could be deployed in the  coming weeks . Deploying the guards to the base in Tripoli  will mean that around the beginning of October we can carry out a significant part of our work in Libya,  said Salame, who has headed the mission since June. A spokesperson for the mission said there were no plans to send U.N. peacekeepers to Libya. Security in Tripoli and other parts of western Libya is fragile, and armed groups that are largely unaccountable hold power on the ground.  Most foreign embassies closed and pulled out their staff in 2014 when heavy fighting between rival factions destroyed the capital s airport. It was the worst fighting since the fall of long-time leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. Libya slipped into turmoil after the NATO-backed uprising that toppled Gaddafi. A U.N.-backed government set up in Tripoli last year has struggled to assert its authority and is opposed by factions that control eastern Libya.  In July, rival leaders pledged in Paris to work toward elections in 2018 and a conditional ceasefire. Salame said constitutional and electoral laws would have to be written to ensure any vote brought lasting change.  We need to be sure everyone accepts the final result,  he said.  Let s not forget that presidential elections would be the first ever.  Salame also expressed frustration at competing international initiatives in Libya, where regional and European powers have vied for influence.   I think the proliferation of initiatives, of mediations, does not help,  he said. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said he hoped that after his country s efforts a revision of the 2015 U.N.-mediated deal that created the Tripoli government could be reached under Salame s auspices. Discussion has centered on reforming the government s leadership and power over military appointments.  It seems that efforts are converging,  Le Drian told reporters during a visit to Moscow.

Zimbabwe to start compiling new voter register next week,"HARARE (Reuters) - President Robert Mugabe on Friday said Zimbabwe will begin compiling a new voter register next week ahead of the 2018 presidential and parliamentary elections, in which the 93-year-old is seeking to extend his 37-year hold on power. Mugabe said in an official government notice that the  Zimbabwe Electoral Commission would start registering voters on Sept. 14 and would end the process on Jan. 15. Opposition parties have been demanding a new roll for voters and have previously accused Mugabe s ruling ZANU-PF party of manipulating the existing register. ZANU-PF denies these accusations. Mugabe also told the central committee of his ZANU-PF on Friday that his party should galvanize supporters to register anew.  He said Western powers were behind the last month s reunification of the main opposition Movement for Democratic Change but added that the opposition would still be defeated by ZANU-PF in next year s votes.  We know of course they are creatures of the West whose sole purpose is to dislodge ZANU-PF from power. But really, they come together as a bundle then one blow against a bundle will set the bundle in pieces,  Mugabe said to applause from ZANU-PF members. ",worldnews,"September 8, 2017 ",1

"Bangladesh wants 'safe zones' to ease Rohingya crisis, but seen unlikely","DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh has proposed creating  safe zones  run by aid groups for Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar s Rakhine state to stop hundreds of thousands of refugees crossing into its territory following a military crackdown. The plan, the latest in a string of ideas floated by Dhaka, is unlikely to get much traction in Myanmar, where many consider the Rohingya community of 1.1 million as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. That will leave Bangladesh, one of the poorest nations in the world, with little choice but to open new camps for refugees.   Dhaka sent the proposal to the Myanmar government through the International Committee of the Red Cross to secure three areas in Rakhine, home to the Rohingya community, suggesting that people displaced by the violence be relocated there under the supervision of an international organization, such as the United Nations.   The logic of the creation of such zones is that no Rohingya can come inside Bangladesh,  said Shahidul Haque, Bangladesh s foreign secretary, the top civil servant in the foreign ministry.  The Red Cross confirmed that it had passed on the request to Myanmar but said that it was a political decision for the two countries to make.   A Myanmar government spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.  Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh, a mostly Muslim nation of 160 million, from Buddhist-majority Myanmar in recent years.  The decades-old conflict in Rakhine flared most recently on Aug. 25, when Rohingya insurgents attacked several police posts and an army base. Since then, an estimated 270,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, joining more than 400,000 others already living there in cramped makeshift camps since the early 1990s. There are widespread fears that tens of thousands more could try to cross if the violence doesn t abate. Recent pictures from the border between the two countries show hundreds of Rohingya men, women and children trying to cross over into Bangladesh on foot and by boat. The humanitarian crisis next door has left Bangladesh scrambling to deal with people that it does not welcome either.  In recent days, Bangladesh officials have said they plan to go ahead with a controversial plan to develop an isolated, flood-prone island in the Bay of Bengal to temporarily house tens of thousands of refugees, drawing fresh criticism from the international community. It bowed to pressure on Thursday, with government officials saying that Dhaka would now make another 1,500 acres (607 hectares) of land available for camps to house refugees near Cox s Bazar, where many refugees already live as it is near the border with Myanmar.   They will be given temporary shelter,  said Kazi Abdur Rahman, additional deputy commissioner of Cox s Bazar. But Rahman added that the refugees would be fingerprinted and confined to the camp so that they did not mix with the local community.  These measures, however, do not offer a long-term solution to the crisis, and Dhaka says it is getting little support from its neighbor, which has been accused of trying to engineer  ethnic cleansing within its borders.  Bangladesh officials said they had proposed joint patrolling along the border but did not receive a response from Myanmar. Earlier this week, Bangladesh lodged a protest after it said Myanmar had laid landmines near the border between the two countries. Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel Laureate, has come under pressure to halt violence against Rohingya.  She has said that her government was doing its best to protect everyone in Rakhine but did not refer specifically to the Rohingya exodus.  The solution lies in Myanmar. The UN hopes that Myanmar can address the root causes of the problem,  said Shinji Kubo, head of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Bangladesh.  Kubo said the Bangladesh government was doing its best by accepting the refugees instead of sending them back. Bangladesh officials are turning to the international community for help, claiming support from countries such as Turkey, which has promised aid.  On Friday, a Malaysian coast guard official said the country will not turn away Rohingya Muslims and is willing to provide them temporary shelter. But any such voyage would be hazardous for the next few months, because of the annual monsoon.  The world community must come forward to help them, not by putting pressure on Bangladesh but by putting pressure on Myanmar not to resort to these atrocities and violence,  said H.T. Imam, a senior aide to Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.   The only solution is to force Myanmar to take back their citizens through international pressure. And we are working with our partners on that,  Imam said. Besides the creation of internationally-controlled safe zones in Rakhine state, Bangladesh has also mooted creating a buffer zone along the border, where the international community could set up camps and provide for the refugees, the officials said.  Further details of the plan could not be learned.    We will give aid agencies access. But we are not interested to give them shelter here. We are already overburdened,  said Mostafa Kamal Uddin, Bangladesh s home secretary. ",worldnews,"September 8, 2017 ",1
U.N. rights chief says EU deal on Libya migrants falls short,"GENEVA (Reuters) - A European and African deal to stem the flow of migrants coming through Libya to Europe fails to tackle the abuses they face, the top U.N. human rights official wrote on Friday.  The 28-nation European Union has long struggled to reach a coherent answer to the influx of migrants fleeing war, poverty and political upheaval in the Middle East and Africa, and the crisis is testing cooperation between member states. On Aug. 28, the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Chad, Niger and Libya agreed a plan to tackle illegal human trafficking and support nations struggling to contain the flow of people across the desert and Mediterranean sea.  U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra ad al-Hussein said it was significant that the agreement they struck in Paris recognized that a comprehensive response was needed.   But it is very thin on the protection of the human rights of migrants inside Libya and on the boats, and silent on the urgent need for alternatives to the arbitrary detention of vulnerable people,  he wrote in an article published by the United Nations. Zeid s office published a report last December on abuses faced by migrants in detention centres in Libya,  but memories are short when facts are inconvenient , he wrote. Since then the situation had worsened, with far too many allegations to verify and reports of bodies  in the desert, in the forest, on the beaches . Libya s morgues were overflowing, he said.  Apart from the families awaiting word from missing relatives, hardly anybody seemed to care, Zeid wrote.  The EU faces a moral and legal dilemma because it relies on cooperation with Libyan coastguards and plays down their abuses, which include shooting at aid workers trying to rescue migrants, Zeid said.  A coastguard that sometimes rescues migrants in distress   but sometimes chooses not to. Like the militias onshore, coastguards also sometimes beat, rob and even shoot the migrants they intercept,  he said. Zeid said he agreed with a letter to European leaders from Joanne Liu, the head of Medecins Sans Frontieres, a charity that has sent aid workers to rescue migrants.  The letter, entitled  European governments are feeding the business of suffering , asked:  Is allowing people to be pushed into rape, torture and slavery via criminal pay-offs a price European governments are willing to pay?   I fully support her analysis, and share her disgust at this situation,  Zeid wrote. ",worldnews,"September 8, 2017 ",1
German lawmakers visit Turkish air base but dispute unresolved,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German politicians visited their country s troops at an air base in Turkey on Friday but some lawmakers said they would not extend the airmen s mission to take part in NATO air patrols unless an underlying dispute over visiting rights was resolved. Germany s armed forces are under parliamentary control and Berlin insists lawmakers must have access to them, but Turkey  has repeatedly prevented visits from taking place. Friday s visit was arranged by NATO, sidestepping Ankara s objections. Some of the lawmakers, who were flown to the Konya air base on a NATO plane from the alliance s Brussels headquarters, said Germany s parliament would only extend the troops  mandate if future visits were more straightforward. The current mandate expires at the end of this year.  The conflict over visiting rights must be dealt with before parliament votes again on the mandate,  said Green lawmaker Tobias Lindner, a member of the delegation.  Flying via Brussels cannot be a long-term solution.  Relations between Ankara and Berlin were already strained by Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan s crackdown on opponents after  a failed coup last year, and Turkey s refusal to let German members of parliament visit airmen based in the country has exacerbated tensions.  It must be possible for us to visit our soldiers serving abroad,  said Henning Otte, a lawmaker for Chancellor Angela Merkel s ruling conservative party.  Germany has a parliamentary army.  Seven German lawmakers visited the handful of German troops serving in a NATO air surveillance mission at Konya. The delegation was led by NATO s Deputy Secretary General Rose Gottemoeller. There are usually around 25 German soldiers based in Konya although only a handful were present at the base on Friday. Some more arrived with the lawmakers in the NATO plane. Turkey had objected particularly strenuously to the participation of a member of Germany s far-left Left party whom Ankara accuses of supporting terrorists. Repeated refusals by Ankara to let lawmakers visit German soldiers at Incirlik, another base in Turkey, prompted Berlin to relocate those troops to Jordan in July. Turkey and Germany are also at odds over Berlin s refusal to extradite asylum seekers Ankara accuses of involvement in last year s failed coup against Erdogan, while Berlin is demanding the release of an imprisoned Turkish-German journalist. The deterioration in relations has led German Chancellor Angela Merkel to say she will seek to end Turkey s membership talks with the European Union. ",worldnews,"September 8, 2017 ",1
"Spain blocks Catalan independence vote, threatens charges","MADRID (Reuters) - Spain s central authorities moved on Thursday to crush plans by the northeastern region of Catalonia to hold an independence referendum and took steps to prosecute regional lawmakers backing the ballot. A long-running campaign for independence by a group of Catalan politicians, who hold a majority in the regional parliament, came to a head on Wednesday when they approved a law to allow a vote on secession from Spain scheduled for Oct. 1. The country s Constitutional Court, Spain s highest legal authority on such matters, suspended the referendum law late on Thursday to allow judges time to consider whether the vote breaches the country s constitution. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said earlier on Thursday he had appealed to the court to declare the referendum illegal. The constitution states Spain is indivisible.  This referendum will not go ahead,  he said. In a separate move on Thursday, Spain s state prosecutor s office said it would present criminal charges against leading members of the Catalan parliament for allowing Wednesday s parliamentary vote to go ahead. Catalan lawmakers have said they are prepared to go to jail over the issue. The state prosecutor-general, Jose Manuel Maza, told reporters he had also asked the security forces to investigate any preparations by the Catalan government to hold the referendum. This could involve printing leaflets or preparing polling stations. Teachers, police and administrative workers are among civil servants that could risk fines or potentially the loss of their jobs by manning polling stations or taking part in other activities deemed as helping the vote. Polls show the debate over independence in the region is close-run, with those preferring to stay united with Spain slightly outnumbering  independentistas . A majority of Catalans do want the right to hold a referendum, however. Barcelona residents on Thursday had mixed feelings about the possibility of a referendum.   It will never be legal if it s not agreed with the government,  said 53-year-old interior designer Laurent Legard.  This is not the right path.  Dolores, a 55-year-old receptionist who declined to give her surname, disagreed.  We are delighted - we ve been waiting for this moment for many years. It really is a democracy to allow people to give their opinion about how they want to live and how they want their country to be,  she said. Prime Minister Rajoy s recourse to the courts to block any independence referendum now and in a non-binding 2014 vote on a split from Spain has raised hackles in the industrial region.  Any heavy-handedness on behalf of his government to stop leaflet printing or confiscate ballot boxes could trigger social unrest.  Catalan s regional head, Carles Puigdemont, has said the results of the referendum will be binding no matter what the turn-out is. Analysts have said a low turn-out would harm the legitimacy of the result.   Catalonia will declare independence within 48 hours of a  yes  vote, the referendum law states.

Syrian government denies U.N. chemical attack report,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - The Syrian government has denied a U.N. report accusing it of a sarin attack in April that killed scores of people, state media said on Friday. Damascus sent the United Nations a letter  asserting that Syria has not and will not use toxic gases against its people because it does not have them in the first place , state news agency SANA said. U.N. war crimes investigators said this week that Syrian forces have used chemical weapons more than two dozen times during the six-year conflict. The U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Syria said a government warplane dropped sarin on Khan Sheikhoun in insurgent-held Idlib province in April, killing more than 80 civilians. The attack prompted a U.S. missile strike on a Syrian government air base. A fact-finding mission of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) previously identified the attack as containing sarin, an odorless nerve agent. But that conclusion did not assign blame.  The Syrian government has said before that air strikes in the town of Khan Sheikhoun hit a weapons depot belonging to rebel factions. The U.N. investigators dismissed this. President Bashar al-Assad s government has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons in the war and says it only targets militants. In 2013, hundreds of civilians died in a sarin gas attack in the suburbs of the capital Damascus, in an attack that Western states blamed on Assad s government. Damascus blamed rebels. In the wake of the atrocity, the United States and Russia brokered a deal under which Syria joined the international Chemical Weapons Convention. Syria declared it had 1,300 tonnes of chemical weapons or industrial chemical stocks, surrendering it to the international community for destruction. U.N.-OPCW investigators have said that the government continued to use chlorine, which is widely available and hard to trace. Chlorine is not a banned substance, but the use of any chemical is banned under the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention. A series of U.N.-OPCW investigations found that various parties in the war have used chlorine, sulfur mustard gas and sarin. ",worldnews,"September 8, 2017 ",1
"Norway's Merkel, Erna Solberg hopes to beat history in re-election bid","OSLO (Reuters) - Erna Solberg seeks to accomplish something no Conservative Norwegian prime minister has managed for more than three decades: winning a second term. If Norwegians are sufficiently happy with Solberg s last four years in power, they will re-elect her on Sept. 11; if not she will lose to Labour Party leader Jonas Gahr Stoere. Opinion polls show the race is too close to call. Solberg hopes to emulate a European center-right leader with an enviable track record of winning: Angela Merkel, herself seeking a fourth term as Germany s chancellor.  She is absolutely the most important politician in Europe,  Solberg said after taking office in 2013 as she prepared for her first foreign trip as prime minister, to Berlin. Portraying herself as a steady figure who steered western Europe s top oil and gas producer through a two-year slump in energy prices, Solberg has warned voters her defeat would mean a  red-green chaos  of socialists and environmentalists bent on raising taxes. Once known as  Iron Erna  for her tough stance on immigration, Solberg softened her image and broadened her appeal with a 2011 book emphasizing people s needs over the Conservative Party s traditional focus on fiscal prudence. Conservatives hope to capitalize on an easy-going personality that has made Solberg popular beyond her party, as seen in a Sept. 6 poll where 46.3 percent believed her best suited to be prime minister, against Stoere s 39.1 percent. (For a graphic on Norway's parliamentary elections click tmsnrt.rs/2ugJCjo)  There is an enormous focus on her as a person, which has given the party a real boost during the election campaign,  said Associate Professor Tore Bang at BI Norwegian Business School, an expert in public relations and political communication.  The hype around her is atypical for a leader of the Conservative Party. She is seen as a much more folksy politician and has a much broader appeal than Gahr Stoere.  Born on Feb. 24, 1961, in her late teens Solberg was diagnosed with dyslexia. Graduating in political science she was elected to parliament aged 28, becoming deputy party leader in 2002 before taking the top job in 2004. She is Norway s second female prime minister after Labour s Gro Harlem Brundtland, who led three governments in the 80s and early 90s and became known as  the mother of the nation .  As prime minister, Solberg has really strengthened her position as an uncontested party leader. She personifies the party brand and the association between her and the party is comparable to what Gro Harlem Brundtland had in the Labour Party,  said Bang of the BI Norwegian Business School. While the opposition was long favored to win, opinion polls show Solberg and her allies have closed the gap in recent months, taking advantage of an economic rebound.  It s quite apparent that the Conservative Party has looked to Germany and found inspiration in the position Merkel has taken there,  said Johannes Bergh, head researcher of the University of Oslo s National Election Studies program.  It s a comparison that the party really likes. Merkel is very good at winning elections and offers a lot of the same things as Solberg.  The economic upturn, and concerns it could falter, will play well for the prime minister, Bergh said.  The backdrop of this election is that the Norwegian economy is doing well again. There is no real sense of crisis anymore but people are still weary, so offering a stable and predictable Merkel-like leadership is a strategy that seems to have worked well.   If she wins, she plans to continue a policy of cutting taxes on companies and individuals, but her room for maneuver will be tighter as Norway s near-trillion dollar sovereign wealth fund is not expected to grow as the same pace as before. In Norway s fragmented parliament however, where nine parties are expected to win seats, re-election will not guarantee a Solberg government survives another four years. Kaare Willoch, the last Conservative prime minister to win back-to-back elections, in 1981 and 1985, was booted out of office just months into his second term in a disagreement over petrol taxes. In fact, if she were to serve two full terms, Solberg would easily become the longest-serving Conservative prime minister since the introduction of the parliamentary system in the late 19th century.

Kenyan opposition chief to focus on corruption in election re-run,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga says he will make the mismanagement of last month s annulled presidential vote the focus of his new election campaign, linking it to a series of political scandals.  The Supreme Court last week nullified the Aug. 8 election, ruling that incumbent president Uhuru Kenyatta s win by 1.4 million votes was invalid due to flaws in the tallying process.   Right now, we are basically dealing with the rigging of elections, which is basically an extension of corruption,  Odinga told Reuters in an interview on Thursday, repeating his allegation, rejected by the court, that Kenyatta had deliberately manipulated the vote.  Odinga has threatened to boycott the re-run unless a series of demands are met.  The court ruling sent shockwaves through Kenya, East Africa s richest country per capita and a relatively stable ally of the West in a region beset by conflict.  Although it caused political uncertainty, many hope it will eventually reduce the chance of political violence by rebuilding trust in Kenya s battered public institutions.  The election commission set the re-run for Oct. 17, but Odinga reiterated his stance that he would not take part unless some electoral officials were fired and the opposition were given access to voting data that they say will prove their allegation of deliberate rigging. The board has said different staff will be in charge of the re-run, but has not opened up the election records for scrutiny or announced any disciplinary measures.   This election shows that Jubilee (the ruling party) have taken corruption to the stratosphere in our country ... it is very regrettable, it is actually shameful that a government can preside over this fraud.  The judges said Kenyatta was not at fault and the blame lay with the election commission, which had not followed procedures designed to allow a transparent vote. A more detailed ruling is expected this month. Jubilee has also denied manipulating the vote. But Odinga s words may resonate with Kenyans tired of the corruption scandals that have dominated front pages in recent years, including allegations that tens of millions of dollars went missing from the Health Ministry and National Youth Service.  The auditor-general regularly issues scathing reports about missing funds, but action is rarely taken. No top official has been successfully prosecuted.  Odinga, who presents himself as a champion of the poor, built his previous campaign on criticism of high inflation and shortages of the staple maize flour after a regional drought.  He has criticized government borrowing, and promised to lower the deficit by improving revenue collection and slashing graft. He said he would preserve the large infrastructure projects that were the centerpiece of Kenyatta s re-election campaign.  Odinga also plans to substantially reshape Kenya s policy towards its neighbors if he wins, setting a timeline to withdraw Kenyan troops from Somalia and calling for the release of South Sudanese rebel leader Riek Machar, currently under house arrest in South Africa, to participate in peace talks.

Hurricane Irma threatens power losses for millions in Florida,"(Reuters) - Hurricane Irma poses a bigger menace to power supplies in Florida than Hurricane Harvey did in Texas because Irma is packing near 200 mile-per-hour winds (320 km/h) that could down power lines, close nuclear plants and threats to leave millions of homes and businesses in the dark for weeks. Irma s winds rival the strongest for any hurricane in history in the Atlantic, whereas Harvey s damage came from record rainfall. Even as Houston flooded, the power stayed on for most, allowing citizens to use TV and radio to stay apprised of danger, or social media to call for help.  When Harvey made landfall in Texas it made it fully inland and weakened pretty quickly. Irma, however, could retain much of its strength,  said Jason Setree, a meteorologist at Commodity Weather Group. Irma has killed several people and devastated islands in the Caribbean.  Current forecasts put almost the entirety of the Florida peninsula in the path of the storm, which made landfall in the Caribbean with wind speeds of 185 mph (295 km/h). The threat of the Category 5 storm, at the top of the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, is grave enough that electricity generator Florida Power & Light (FPL) plans to shut its two nuclear power plants in the state, and officials warned that it may have to rebuild parts of its power system, which could take weeks.  Most Florida residents have not experienced a major storm since 2005, when total outages peaked around 3.6 million during Hurricane Wilma. Some of those outages lasted for weeks. Setree compared the projected path of Irma to Hurricane Matthew in 2016, which knocked out power to about 1.2 million FPL customers in October. FPL, a unit of Florida energy company NextEra Energy Inc, restored service to most customers affected by Matthew in just two days. But FPL spokesman Chris McGrath said:  With a storm as powerful as Irma, we want customers to prepare for damage to our infrastructure and potentially prolonged power outages.  He said it was too soon to speculate on the number and location of customers Irma could affect.  In a statement this week, FPL estimated about half of its near five million customers - particularly in the trio of populous southeast counties Miami-Dade, Palm Beach and Broward - had not experienced a major hurricane since 2005.  Should Irma s worst fears be realized, our crews will likely have to completely rebuild parts of our electric system. Restoring power through repairs is measured in days; rebuilding our electric system could be measured in weeks,  FPL Chief Executive Eric Silagy said. FPL, Florida s biggest power provider, said it had invested nearly $3 billion since 2006 to strengthen its grid, including placing 60 main power lines underground and installing nearly five million smart meters and other devices. Other publicly traded utilities in the Sunshine State, including units of Duke Energy Corp, Southern Co and Emera Inc, said in statements that they had also invested in intelligent, self-healing devices. Smart meters allow utilities to see outages as they occur, rather than waiting on customer calls, and utilities also use automated devices that can reenergize lines without damage that were taken offline because of contact with trees or other objects, said Jay Apt, director of the Carnegie Mellon Electricity Industry Center in Pittsburgh. Olivia Ross, a spokeswoman for CenterPoint Energy, which serves the greater Houston area, said these devices helped the utility keep the lights on for more people in the aftermath of Harvey as some issues were resolved remotely. But such devices can only do so much. Harvey s outages were limited to 312,000 customers, of which CenterPoint was responsible for about 109,000, as it quickly lost force after landfall and turned into a tropical storm. By contrast, Ross noted, Hurricane Ike in 2008 caused 2.1 million of CenterPoint s customers to lose power when it hit the Texas coast near Houston. ",worldnews,"September 8, 2017 ",1
Hurricane Irma will 'devastate' part of U.S.: emergency services head,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Anticipating that Hurricane Irma will  devastate  part of the United States, U.S. officials were preparing a massive response to the storm, the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) said on Friday. With Irma set to hit Florida as early as Saturday night, parts of Florida was expected to lose electricity for days, if not longer, and more than 100,000 people may need shelter, FEMA Administrator Brock Long warned at a news conference.  Hurricane Irma continues to be a threat that is going to devastate the United States in either Florida or some of the southeastern states,  Long said. Irma was a Category 5 hurricane, the most dangerous measure by the National Hurricane Center, before being downgraded to Category 4 early Friday after pummeling islands in the Caribbean. The United States has experienced only three Category 5 storms since 1851 and Irma is far larger than the last one to hit the United States in 1992, Hurricane Andrew, according to Long. He warned people not to ignore evacuation orders.  They need to get out and listen and heed the warnings,  Long said. Officials have thousands of personnel ready to respond and millions of meals and liters of water in place nearby, Long said. The National Weather Service said that Friday was the last day to evacuate before winds would start to reach unsafe speeds in Florida. Airlines added extra flights from Florida on Thursday before announcing plans to halt service from some southern Florida airports starting Friday afternoon. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price called Irma a  remarkably dangerous storm and the window to get yourself in the right spot ... is closing rapidly.  Price said the main hospital in St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands was closed after being damaged by Irma, and critically ill patients were being evacuated to Puerto Rico or other islands. On Friday, the U.S. House of Representatives voted 316-90 to approve a measure to more than double funding to $15.25 billion for FEMA and local block grants to handle natural disasters after the Senate passed the measure Thursday, 80-17. FEMA s disaster assistance fund could have run out of money Friday without action. President Donald Trump is expected to sign the measure Friday. The measure also extends the life of the National Flood Insurance Program through Dec. 5. It had been set to expire Sept. 30. ",worldnews,"September 8, 2017 ",1
Competing efforts to end South Sudan's war prolong conflict: U.N. panel,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Competing efforts to end South Sudan s civil war allow the government to exploit divisions among international brokers and are unlikely to halt the fighting, a confidential U.N. report said.  South Sudan became the world s newest nation when it gained independence from Sudan in 2011. War broke out in late 2013 and has forced more than a quarter of its 12 million population have fled their homes.   The hostilities in South Sudan continue against a complex backdrop of competing regional and bilateral initiatives to resolve the conflict,  U.N. sanctions monitors said in a report to the Security Council seen by Reuters on Friday.   These efforts suffer from several defects, including inadequate oversight, lack of enforcement and the absence of an integrated, coherent plan for peace.   Among the international bodies involved in trying to bring the warring parties to the table are regional bloc IGAD, the U.N. Security Council, a troika of South Sudan s main Western backers prior to independence, and an African Union panel.  The efforts of these groups are affected by  conflicting interests compounded by underlying rivalries in the region , the panel wrote, in what could refer to the role of leaders such as Uganda s Yoweri Museveni, who deployed troops in 2013 to support the Juba government and opposes an arms embargo.  The government of South Sudan has sought to exploit this division  among the competing efforts, the panel said.  Absent a significant shift toward a more coherent and unified approach  from East African nations, coupled with  broader international support for a single and inclusive political process, current efforts are unlikely to ... halt the violence in South Sudan,  it said. Information Minister Michael Makuei Lueth told reporters in Juba:  There is nothing new in this report.  The leaked report is by a panel mandated to document arms flows and security threats. The proliferation of diplomatic efforts has created an opportunity for parties to  forum shop , the panel wrote, saying this bought the armed groups time to organize military operations and avoid attempts to enforce a settlement.      It noted the military was still able to procure weapons while opposition forces  access to arms  remains limited .  The main opposition figure, Riek Machar, is under house arrest in South Africa and has declined to renounce violence. Kiir continues to buy weapons and government forces continue to attack civilians, the report said.   East African leaders said in June they want the warring sides to recommit to the deal they abandoned more than a year ago. In July, Western donors said the process was no longer viable and froze support for it.  There has been no comment in recent months from IGAD or the African Union about a timeline for resumption of peace talks.  This week the United States imposed sanctions on two senior South Sudanese officials and the former army chief. The Security Council last December vetoed the imposition of an arms embargo recommended by the monitors.  ",worldnews,"September 8, 2017 ",1
Trump visit to Britain still unfixed nine months after PM May's invitation: sources,"LONDON (Reuters) - Nine months after Prime Minister Theresa May invited President Donald Trump for a formal state visit to Britain, no arrangements have yet been made and there is no sign of the visit taking place soon, U.S. and British officials said. Discussions between Washington and London about a Trump visit have continued, said one official who asked not to be named, but so far the White House has not signaled when and how the president wants to proceed. May s invitation to Trump during a visit to Washington a few days after he took office sparked controversy in Britain. Just hours after she left the White House, Trump announced his widely-criticized ban on travel from Muslim-majority countries. Such is the controversy that some officials on both sides of the Atlantic are privately having second thoughts about the visit, worried about street demonstrations that might greet Trump in London and other British cities.  There have been signs of relief in some quarters that he has yet to appear on Her Majesty s schedule,  said a British official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Given Trump s penchant for showmanship and his pre-presidential visits to the two golf courses he owns in Scotland, many Trump-watchers expected Britain to be one of the first stops on any presidential European tour. White House representatives told British officials at the time of the invite that Trump had accepted. But a senior U.S. government official told Reuters in July that Trump had no plans to visit Britain in the near future. A full-scale state visit to Britain involves considerable pomp. Upon arriving in London, the president would be greeted by Queen Elizabeth and other members of the Royal Family at a ceremony near the Houses of Parliament.  Some British opponents of Trump including former Labour Party leader Ed Miliband have promised to organize protests should he visit.  We remain in the same position with the Trump visit   The queen extended an invitation to President Trump to visit the UK, it was accepted, and there is no change to those plans. But a date has not been set,  a spokesman for the British Embassy in Washington said.  We re looking forward to welcoming President Trump to the UK,  the spokesman added. U.S. officials, including Trump aides and spokespeople and representatives of the U.S. Embassy in London, did not respond to detailed emails requesting comment. ",worldnews,"September 8, 2017 ",1
Turkish minister says EU turning negotiations into 'children's game',"TALLINN (Reuters) - Turkey said on Friday the European Union was making a  child s game  out of its membership talks, wrangling over threats to end them, and reminded the bloc of its strategic importance abutting Middle Eastern conflict zones. After trading bitter barbs for months with President Tayyip Erdogan, largely over Turkey s human rights record, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Sunday it was clear Turkey should not join the EU and accession talks should end. Most other EU states reacted cautiously to her comments and said any real discussion would be possible only after German elections on Sept. 24. But some, like Austria, backed Merkel and some officials have suggested suspension of talks.  This is not a children s game at all,  Turkish EU Minister Omer Celik said after meeting EU foreign ministers in Estonia s capital Tallinn.   You cannot talk about suspending or halting the accession negotiations and then restarting it in six months, and that Turkey is a great strategic and important country.  The bloc has been shocked by the scale of Erdogan s purges and the intensity of his crackdown on dissenters - including academics and journalists - after a failed coup last year.  Many EU ministers in Tallinn stressed that Turkey, a NATO ally of 80 million people, was indispensable for security cooperation and keeping a lid on immigration to the bloc from the tumultuous Middle East. French President Emmanuel Macron said separately that Turkey remained a vital partner for the EU. Celik reiterated his call to open more areas of negotiations with the EU.   This approach of  I froze talks, now I restarted them  is not acceptable for us,  he said. The talks started in 2005, viewed by many in Turkey and abroad as a stimulus in themselves to Turkish democratic reform. But they have stalled over opposition from EU states including Cyprus and France, Erdogan s track record on human rights and other issues.  While Austria and Luxembourg were among those who backed Merkel s tougher line on Turkey, Hungary, Lithuania and Britain - which will be leaving the EU - held the opposite view.  All European countries, including the UK, have concerns, serious concerns about human rights in Turkey, about arrests... (and) the treatment of journalists,  British foreign minister Boris Johnson told reporters.  But it s always been my view that we shouldn t push Turkey away. Turkey is a great country and a strategically important country for all of us.   EU states would have to be unanimous to kill off Turkey s bid, but suspension requires only majority backing. EU leaders are expected to discuss the matter in Brussels in October.  ",worldnews,"September 8, 2017 ",1
'Lips and teeth' no more as China's ties with North Korea fray,"BEIJING (Reuters) - When Kim Jong Un inherited power in North Korea in late 2011, then-Chinese president Hu Jintao was outwardly supportive of the untested young leader, predicting that  traditional friendly cooperation  between the countries would strengthen. Two years later, Kim ordered the execution of his uncle Jang Song Thaek, the country s chief interlocutor with China and a relatively reform-minded official in the hermetic state. Since then, ties between the allies have deteriorated so sharply that some diplomats and experts fear Beijing may become, like Washington, a target of its neighbor s ire.  While the United States and its allies - and many people in China - believe Beijing should do more to rein in Pyongyang, the acceleration of North Korea s nuclear and missile capabilities has coincided with a near-total breakdown of high-level diplomacy between the two. Before retiring this summer, China s long-time point man on North Korea, Wu Dawei, had not visited the country for over a year. His replacement, Kong Xuanyou, has yet to visit and is still carrying out duties from his previous Asian role, traveling to Pakistan in mid-August, diplomats say. The notion that mighty China wields diplomatic control over impoverished North Korea is mistaken, said Jin Canrong, an international relations professor at Beijing s Renmin University.  There has never existed a subordinate relationship between the two sides. Never. Especially after the end of the Cold War, the North Koreans fell into a difficult situation and could not get enough help from China, so they determined to help themselves.  A famine in the mid-1990s that claimed anywhere from 200,000 to three million North Koreans was a turning point for the economy, forcing private trade on the collectivized state. That allowed the North a degree of independence from outside aid and gave credence to the official  Juche  ideology of self-reliance.  China fought alongside North Korea during the 1950-53 Korean War, in which Chinese leader Mao Zedong lost his eldest son, and Beijing has long been Pyongyang s chief ally and primary trade partner. While their relationship has always been clouded by suspicion and mistrust, China grudgingly tolerated North Korea s provocations as preferable to the alternatives: chaotic collapse that spills across their border, and a Korean peninsula under the domain of a U.S.-backed Seoul government. That is also the reason China is reluctant to exert its considerable economic clout, worried that measures as drastic as the energy embargo proposed this week by Washington could lead to the North s collapse. Instead, China repeatedly calls for calm, restraint and a negotiated solution. The North Korean government does not provide foreign media with a contact point in Pyongyang for comment by email, fax or phone. The North Korean embassy in Beijing was not immediately available for comment. China s foreign ministry did not respond to a faxed request for comment. It has repeatedly spoken out against what it calls the  China responsibility theory  and insists the direct parties - North Korea, South Korea and the United States - hold the key to resolving tensions.  Until his death in 2011, North Korean leader Kim Jong Il made numerous entreaties to ensure China would back his preferred son as successor.  While then-President Hu reciprocated, the younger Kim, in his late 20s at the time, began to distance himself from his country s most powerful ally.  There s a lot of domestic politics in North Korea where this young leader who isn t well-known, he s not proven yet, especially has to show that he s not in the pocket of Beijing,  said John Delury of Seoul s Yonsei University.  I think he made the decision first to keep Hu Jintao and then (current President) Xi Jinping really at bay.  Within months of coming to power, Kim telegraphed North Korea s intentions by amending its constitution to proclaim itself a nuclear state. The execution of Jang in 2013 sealed Beijing s distrust of the young leader.  Of course the Chinese were not happy,  said a foreign diplomat in Beijing focused on North Korea.  Executing your uncle, that s from the feudal ages.  In an attempt to warm ties, Xi sent high-ranking Communist Party official Liu Yunshan to attend the North s October 2015 military parade marking the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Workers  Party of Korea. Liu hand-delivered a letter from Xi praising Kim s leadership and including congratulations not just from the Chinese Communist Party but Xi s personal  cordial wishes  in a powerful show of respect. Xi s overture has been repaid with increasingly brazen actions by Pyongyang, which many observers believe are timed for maximum embarrassment to Beijing. Sunday s nuclear test, for example, took place as China hosted a BRICS summit, while in May, the North launched a long-range missile just hours before the Belt and Road Forum, dedicated to Xi s signature foreign policy initiative. Mao Zedong s description of North Korea s relationship with China is typically mischaracterised as being as close as  lips and teeth . His words are better translated as:  If the lips are gone, the teeth will be cold,  a reference to the strategic importance of the North as a geographical security buffer. Despite its resentment at the pressure North Korea s actions have put it under, Beijing refrains from taking too hard a line. It said little when Kim Jong Un s half-brother was assassinated in February at Kuala Lumpur s airport. The half-brother, Kim Jong Nam, had been seen as a potential rival for power in Pyongyang and had lived for years in Beijing, then Macau. An editorial in China s influential Global Times warned after Pyongyang s latest nuclear test that cutting off North Korea s oil would redirect the conflict to one between North Korea and China. Zhao Tong, a North Korea expert at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center in Beijing, said North Korea was deeply unhappy with China s backing of earlier UN sanctions.  If China supports more radical economic sanctions that directly threaten the stability of the regime, then it is possible that North Korea becomes as hostile to China as to the United States.

Central African Republic risks return to major conflict: U.N. report,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Deadly ethnic fighting in Central African Republic could descend into a much larger-scale conflict if nothing is done to disarm combatants and defuse tensions, a U.N. report said on Friday. With a fifth of the population displaced since the mainly Muslim Seleka rebels ousted the president in 2013, provoking a backlash from Christian anti-balaka militias, U.N. peacekeepers are struggling to contain simmering violence. The U.N. human rights working group on mercenaries and foreign fighters said it  strongly senses that the possibility of another armed conflict is likely, if foreign armed actors, along with local armed groups, are not effectively dismantled and suppressed.  National security forces are too weak to tackle armed groups and counter the spillover from conflicts in neighboring countries, and U.N. military personnel, who number just over 10,000, have failed to convince locals that they can protect them, the report said. Ugandan and U.S. forces pulled out earlier this year,  declaring  success  against the Lord s Resistance Army, a regional militia notorious for two decades of abducting children to use as fighters and sex slaves. On Thursday, Amnesty International issued its own report detailing what it said was the systematic rape and murder of civilians in ethnic fighting.       If the U.N. s mandate in the Central African Republic is to mean anything, civilians must be better protected,  the rights group s Joanne Mariner said. U.N. peacekeeping chief Jean-Pierre Lacroix said the U.N. mission in Central African Republic (MINUSCA) had to make changes and was  slightly  short of the necessary personnel.  We have currently a troop ceiling which we think is slightly under what we would need,  he said on Friday. MINUSCA s mandate authorizes it to have 10,750 military personnel, a recent U.N. report said there were 10,098 on the ground.      We are seeing a surge in ... very negative and antagonistic messages to the effect that  foreigners  should be eliminated, putting one ethnic or religious component of this country against the other,  Lacroix told reporters in Geneva.  The working group report said the word  foreigners  was constantly used to label Muslims. ",worldnews,"September 8, 2017 ",1
Lebanese army to deploy along entire eastern border: army chief,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon s army will deploy along the country s entire eastern border with Syria and remain stationed there after recently recapturing areas from Islamic State militants, army chief General Joseph Aoun said on Friday. The remarks appeared to confirm comments by the Lebanese Shi ite group Hezbollah that it was handing over points it had controlled along the border to the military.  The army will deploy from now onwards along the extent of the eastern borders, to defend them,  Aoun said at a ceremony commemorating Lebanese soldiers killed by Islamic State. An army offensive last month ended with the militants withdrawing from their last foothold along the border under a ceasefire deal. The Syrian army and Hezbollah fought the jihadists separately on the Syrian side. Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said in July it would be ready to hand over territory it captured if the Lebanese army requested it. Hezbollah led a campaign in the same area that month to oust the Nusra Front jihadist group from their last foothold along the border. Security sources said Hezbollah had begun handing over points it controlled. Iran-backed Hezbollah has played a critical role in vanquishing Sunni Muslim jihadists in the border region during the six-year-long Syrian war, part of its military support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The group, an ally of Lebanese President Michel Aoun, was key to the defeat of militants in the Qalamoun area further south in 2015, and at the Syrian town of Qusair, in 2013. Lebanon s southern border with Israel, a Hezbollah foe, is patrolled by the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. ",worldnews,"September 8, 2017 ",1
Dublin rejects British proposal for post-Brexit Irish border,"TALLINN (Reuters) - Ireland dismissed British proposals for the Irish border after Brexit as unconvincing on Friday, a day after the EU chief negotiator said they amounted to a demand the bloc suspend its laws for Britain. But British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, speaking at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Tallinn, said a solution was  not beyond the wit of man . The border between the Irish Republic and the British province of Northern Ireland is currently open to free flow of goods, being an internal EU frontier. But when Britain leaves the bloc, it will become subject to EU customs regulation.  Establishment of a physical border could revive security concerns, 20 years after a peace deal involving Dublin that ended a long civil conflict in Northern Ireland and led to the end of army and police checkpoints.     Britain has proposed an  invisible border  without border posts or immigration checks between the two after Brexit, but given no firm proposals how the customs frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic would be monitored. EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said on Thursday British proposals would undermine the bloc s single market. He said Britain in effect wanted the EU to  suspend the application of its laws  as a test case for broader EU-British customs regulations.  This will not happen.  Ireland s Foreign Minister Simon Coveney told Reuters on Friday:  The maintenance of an invisible border on the island of Ireland would be a lot easier if Britain were to remain in the customs union.  That is something Prime Minister Theresa May has said would not happen, though her cabinet is split on the issue and some have floated the idea of a transition period after Brexit that would still leave Britain in the EU customs union.  Britain is the one leaving, they have an obligation to try and design unique solutions.... We cannot have a physical border on the island of Ireland again that creates barriers between communities,  Coveney said.  We cannot and will not support that and nor will the European Union,  he said, adding that Britons wanted to avoid a hard border too.  The problem is that the solutions to actually get us there so far haven t been convincing.  Negotiations to extricate Britain from the EU have seen a slow start and Brussels has repeatedly warned that time is running out to answer complex questions before Britain is due to leave in March, 2019. The bloc, which will have 27 member states after Brexit, wants to solve key exit issues before opening talks about any future trade cooperation with Britain. London says divorce talks should run in parallel with discussions about future ties.  But, with slow progress on agreeing Britain s divorce bill, ensuring expatriates  rights and deciding on the Irish border, the EU now doubts it will give a green light in October for starting talks about the post-Brexit order, as had been planned.  The EU worries London may try to use the Irish border as a template for a broader trade pact with the EU after Brexit. It believes Britain s proposals risk affecting the bloc s single market and customs union. The European Parliament s chief Brexit speaker, Guy Verhofstadt, dismissed Britain s plans for an  invisible border  as surreal.  We are nowhere on border issues,  one senior EU official said. But, asked if he was confident that Britain would get a deal with the EU, Johnson said in Tallinn:  Absolutely, with rock solid confidence.  He reiterated London s stance that the divorce talks should run together with discussion about the post-Brexit relationship.   Article 50 makes it very clear that the discussion about the exit of a country must be taken in context with discussion of the future arrangements. And that s what we re going to do,  he said.

Scotland's SNP must come up with 'doable' independence plan after Brexit: Salmond,"GLASGOW, Scotland (Reuters) - Scotland s former first minister believes the independence movement has a three-year window after Britain quits the European Union to push again for seccession, despite the Scottish National Party s losses in an election in June. Salmond, who is still very influential in the movement, said the independence drive could be refreshed by proposing to join the European Free Trade Association, which would give Scotland European single market membership.  The SNP lost a third of its seats in the national election, including Salmond s own seat, in a sign of waning enthusiasm for another Scottish independence referendum after the uncertainties thrown up by Brexit. Despite that, support for independence itself has remained at the 45 percent level it was when it was voted down in 2014 and the SNP still holds 35 of Scotland s 59 seats in the Westminster parliament.  Salmond said Brexit was proving to be disastrous for Britain and would only end in  humiliation . Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to keep EU membership while Wales and most-populous England voted to leave at last year s referendum, straining the ties of the four-nation United Kingdom.   So the SNP were and are right about Brexit, but as we found out to our cost in the election just being right does not necessarily make for popularity. Nor does it absolve us of a responsibility to attempt to create order out of chaos,  he told a Business for Scotland annual dinner.   We have 18 months of Brexit negotiations and after that perhaps a three-year period of transition to get our ducks in a row. Salmond said, in a speech peppered with jibes at the government s Brexit talks, which have faltered in recent weeks. He said that EFTA membership could be a prelude to full EU membership if necessary.   We have to offer something which is doable, feasible and speedily deliverable for the European connections of an independent Scotland,  he said, ",worldnews,"September 8, 2017 ",1
Kenya election campaigns turn personal after court orders fresh polls,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - The president calls the chief justice a cheat. A lawmaker denounces the head of the opposition as the devil and says he needs a whipping. The opposition leader accuses the president of making a public speech while drunk.  The gloves are off as Kenya s ruling party and the opposition battle for votes ahead of new elections, tentatively scheduled for Oct. 17 by the Supreme Court after it voided last month s presidential results. Last Friday s historic decision, the first of its kind in Africa, was welcomed by many as a rare sign of independence from Kenya s judiciary. It means voters will again have to choose between President Uhuru Kenyatta, 55, and veteran opposition leader Raila Odinga, 72.  But others feared that after a relatively peaceful election campaign, it could open the door to political instability, reviving memories of the violence that followed a disputed 2007 election when more than 1,200 people died. Despite being prone to occasional unrest, Kenya is viewed by the United States and other allies as an anchor of stability in the region. East Africa s richest country per capita and main trade route between the coast and the interior, it has avoided the civil wars that for decades plagued neighbors such as Somalia, South Sudan and Uganda.  After the verdict by the Supreme Court ... I m worried about the upsurge of hate discussion amongst Kenyans,  said Francis Ole Kaparo, the chair of the National Cohesion and Integration Commission, the government body in charge of preventing hate speech.  As of yesterday morning we were investigating 273 cases of hate-mongering in the social media. I believe the number has probably doubled as we are sitting here,  he told a press conference. They had less than a third of that number for the whole ten-week campaign period leading up to Aug. 8 elections, he said. Lawmakers from both sides are under investigation. Opposition lawmaker Paul Ongili Owino, whose Twitter account suspended, is among them. Kaparo did not respond to a message seeking more details.  So is ruling party lawmaker Moses Kuria, who gave a fiery speech on Tuesday denouncing Odinga. Kuria is already facing hate speech charges brought by the commission more than a year ago.  Raila is a demon. He needs to be whipped by a man and whipped by a woman. Support us, including all parliamentarians, so we can hold him,  Kuria told cheering crowd in a speech in the Kikuyu language peppered with coarse words in Kiambu county on the outskirts of the capital.   We went and gave birth to a baby (the election). That baby did not die during pregnancy or during delivery. The baby had started to suckle. Raila then came and stuck his finger in the baby s arse and killed it,  he said during the speech, which was filmed and posted on YouTube.  Later, he posted on his Facebook page,  Manhunt is on tonight for the 200,000 people who did not vote and the 70,000 that voted for that other demon.  The biggest worry in Kenya is violence taking on an ethnic dimension, as in 2007. President Kenyatta is from the largest of Kenya s 44 tribes, the Kikuyu, while many of Odinga s supporters believe his Luo ethnic group has been locked out of power. Police denied reports, which were posted online and repeated by opposition politicians, that following Kuria s speech buses had been stopped in the area and passengers questioned about their ethnicity. Reuters was unable to verify the accuracy of those reports. Raphael Tuju, the secretary-general of the ruling Jubilee party, denounced Kuria s speech to a local news channel hours after it was reported.   That is completely out of order and I would not accept that kind of language. I will take it up with him because it is unacceptable,  he said. Tuju did not return calls from Reuters seeking comment on what disciplinary action Kuria might face.  Manoah Esipisu, a presidential spokesman, said  State House does not comment on comments by people like Moses Kuria.   Kuria s speech came days after Kenyatta repeatedly criticized the Supreme Court for nullifying the August election results. Official results showed that Kenyatta had won by a comfortable margin of 1.4 million votes, but the court ordered the poll re-run because it said there were  irregularities  by the election board. In a speech immediately after the ruling, Kenyatta said he disagreed with the ruling but would accept it. But in a public rally later he referred to the judges as  wakora,  a Kiswahili term for a cheat. The next day, Kenyatta promised to  fix  the judiciary.  Esipisu, the spokesman, said the president used the term wakora to criticize a judgment he views as subverting democracy.  Anything that doesn t express the will of the people is wakora,  Esipisu said.  At another rally, Kenyatta told a crowd that Odinga was a  witchdoctor  because he was insisting on being consulted on the date of new elections.  Odinga told Reuters in an interview that the statements were unpresidential.   When the anger settles, we should have a sober campaign without insults,  he said in an interview.  These campaigns will be fought on the basis of serious issues, not who can shout loudest, who can insult more than the other person.  But later he couldn t resist adding a personal dig at Kenyatta, saying that the president was probably drunk.   It was irresponsible for the president to address the nation when he appeared to have taken one too many,  he said.  I think it is an insult to the nation.  Asked about that comment, presidential spokesman Esipisu said:  We don t comment on rubbish.

"EU must be part of U.S. Middle East peace push, Ireland says","TALLINN (Reuters) - Israelis and Palestinians will face more unrest over the next year without a revival of a long-fractured Middle East peace process that the European Union must be part of, Ireland s foreign minister said on Friday. Simon Coveney, who met Israeli and Palestinian leaders less than a month after taking up his post in June, is leading the charge to involve the EU in a fresh attempt at peace talks and overcome divisions that have weakened the bloc s influence.   Speaking to EU foreign ministers at a meeting on Middle East policy in Tallinn on Thursday, Coveney said the bloc had a duty to make its voice heard in any new U.S. initiative as the Palestinians  biggest aid donor and Israel s top trade partner.  My concern is that it will be a much more difficult political challenge in a year s time or in two years  time,  Coveney told Reuters.   If you look at cycles of violence in Gaza, for example, without intervention and new initiatives in my view, we are heading there again,  he said, describing the Israel-Palestinian situation as an  open sore  that could erupt at any time. Coveney said EU governments had to pull together and keep the focus on a two-state solution.  Now is the time for the European Union ... to become more vocal,  said Coveney, who met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in July.  Coveney has also met Jason Greenblatt, Trump s Middle East envoy, and said it was crucial that the EU sought to influence U.S. plans that are being drawn up by Greenblatt and Trump s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner. Coveney said the European Union had a right to be heard because EU governments and the European Commission spend 600 million euros ($724 million) a year on aid to the Palestinians and on projects with Israel.  We cannot simply wait for the U.S. to take an initiative on their own, we should be supportive of them and helping them to shape it and design it in a way that is likely to have international community support,  he said, although he added he still did not know what the U.S. proposals would look like.  In the absence of the U.S. being able to bring forward a new initiative, I think the EU will have to do that itself.  Hurdles for the European Union include its range of positions, ranging from Germany s strong support for Israel to Sweden s 2014 decision to officially recognize the state of Palestine, something Ireland considered three years ago. Coveney said the European Union is also perceived by some in Israel as being too pro-Palestinian, partly because of the EU s long-held opposition to Israeli settlements.     But Coveney said the European Union could build trust with Israel by deepening ties in trade, science, scholarships for students and to pursue what he called  a positive agenda .  The EU aims to hold a high-level meeting with Israel to broaden trade and other economic links later this year, although a date is still pending. It would be the first such meeting since 2012.

Erdogan urges U.S. to review 'political' charges against Turkish ex-minister,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan urged the United States on Friday to review charges against a Turkish former minister for violating U.S.-Iran sanctions, saying Ankara had never agreed to comply with the embargo and the prosecution was politically motivated.  There are very peculiar smells coming from this issue,  Erdogan said. Former economy minister Zafer Caglayan and the ex-head of a state-owned Turkish bank were charged with conspiring to violate the sanctions by illegally moving hundreds of millions of dollars through the U.S. financial system on Tehran s behalf. The indictment, announced this week, marked the first time an ex-government member with close ties to Erdogan had been charged in an investigation that has strained ties between Washington and Ankara.  For the moment, it is impossible to evaluate this within legal logic,  Erdogan told reporters at Istanbul s Ataturk airport.  I see this step against our former economy minister as a step against the Turkish Republic.  We didn t decide to impose sanctions on Iran. We have bilateral ties with Iran, sensitive relations,  he said, adding he had told former U.S. President Barack Obama as much, when the sanctions were in force.  We said to the relevant people, we said we would not take part in sanctions... These steps are purely political.  Prosecutors in New York said on Wednesday they had charged Caglayan and former Halkbank general manager Suleyman Aslan and two others with  conspiring to use the U.S. financial system to conduct hundreds of millions of dollars  worth of transactions on behalf of the government of Iran and other Iranian entities, which were barred by United States sanctions.  The charges stem from the case against Reza Zarrab, a wealthy Turkish-Iranian gold trader who was arrested in the United States over sanctions evasion last year. He has pleaded not guilty. Reuters was not able to reach Caglayan or Aslan for comment. Relations between Washington and NATO ally Turkey, an important partner in tackling the Syrian conflict, were strained after a failed coup against Erdogan in July last year and the president s subsequent crackdown on opposition.

"Factbox: Humanitarian crisis in Bangladesh as 270,000 Rohingya flee Myanmar","(Reuters) - About 270,000 Muslim Rohingya fleeing violence in Myanmar have sought refuge in Bangladesh in the past two weeks, a spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said on Friday.  This has brought to 357,000 the number of Rohingya who have sought refuge in Bangladesh since October 2016. The exodus has put pressure on aid agencies and communities already helping hundreds of thousands of refugees from previous violence in Myanmar. Following are some details on the crisis gathered from U.N. sources working in the Cox s Bazar district of Bangladesh, on the Myanmar border. - The number of new arrivals has increased considerably in part because of a survey carried out on Sept. 6 and 7, when inter-agency teams visited host communities previously left out of calculations. About 75,000 people were identified in previously unvisited communities at nine locations.  - There is immediate need for food for the majority of the new arrivals, who do not have, or have finished, their own supplies, and are getting food from host communities or refugees who came across the border last year. - Most of the food being distributed is high-energy biscuits with 47,522 new arrivals getting them. Supplies of rice are scheduled to go out from Sept. 9. - Water is scarce while sanitation and hygiene facilities in all makeshift settlements and refugee camps, especially at Shamlapur and Leda, where the number of fresh arrivals is increasing rapidly, are stretched. Limited space to build new facilities is a chronic problem. - There are serious concerns about malnutrition, especially among children under five and pregnant or lactating women, some of whom are being enrolled in targeted feeding programs.  - Many pregnant women are very hungry, some having not eaten for several days. Seven babies have been born. - There is also a need for safe spaces for women with eight reported cases of gender-based violence, including 2 cases of sexual violence. - As of Sept. 7, a total of 299 unaccompanied asylum-seeking children have been identified and registered since Aug. 25. - An estimated 51,100 children need schooling.

Turkish court orders release of pro-Kurdish party's former spokesman: party official,"ANKARA (Reuters) - A Turkish court has ordered the release of a parliamentarian who was the former spokesman for Turkey s pro-Kurdish opposition party, a party official said on Friday. The court ruled that Ayhan Bilgen be released after a monthly review of his detention since he was arrested in the southern city of Diyarbakir over accusations that he was a member of an armed terrorist group, the official told Reuters. Bilgen had served as spokesman and head of the pro-Kurdish Peoples  Democratic Party s (HDP) parliamentary group. The ruling comes amid growing concern among opposition parties, human rights groups and Turkey s Western allies that President Tayyip Erdogan is using a crackdown on suspected supporters of last year s failed coup to muzzle dissent. Since the failed coup, some 50,000 people have been arrested and more than 150,000 sacked or suspended from the military, civil service and private sector.     Nine HDP deputies are jailed pending trial, more than 70 elected mayors from the HDP s southeastern affiliate have been remanded in custody in terrorism-related investigations, and their municipalities taken over by state officials. Thousands of party members have also been arrested. The Turkish government says the HDP is an affiliate of the militant Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged a three-decade insurgency against the Turkish state and is considered a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. The HDP denies direct links. Turkey s parliament has also stripped four HDP lawmakers, including the party s co-chairwoman Figen Yuksekdag, of their parliamentary status, reducing the presence of the country s third-largest party in the 550-seat assembly. The HDP had 59 lawmakers elected to parliament in the November 2015 general election. The party s co-leader Selahattin Demirtas has also been in jail since November 2016.

Macron hurls challenge to Europe - reform or decline,"ATHENS (Reuters) - Europe risks subjugation to China and the United States unless it becomes more sovereign and democratic, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday in a speech underlining the scale of his ambition to reform the European Union. In a speech delivered symbolically on the Athens hill where ancient Greeks gave birth to democracy a few thousand years ago, Macron, a fervent europhile, said the continent would face its demise without a radical overhaul of its governance.   In order not to be ruled by bigger powers such as the Chinese and the Americans, I believe in a European sovereignty that allows us to defend ourselves and exist,  Macron said at the top of the hill of Pnyx, with the spectacular backdrop of the Parthenon temple in the sunset.  Are you afraid of this European ambition?  Elected four months ago, the 39-year-old leader wants a giant leap in European cooperation which, at the economic level, would see the creation of a euro zone budget, finance minister and parliament.  Macron said more democratic institutions would help respond to a populist wave which has seen the rise of far-right leaders such as Marine Le Pen, whom he defeated in May, and helped fuel  the successful Brexit campaign which led to Britain s vote to leave the EU. He said he would unveil a  road map  for the EU in a few weeks, after Germany s Sept. 24 election, and wanted European leaders to agree before the end of the year to launch public debates in the first half of 2018 during which citizens will be able to discuss their vision for the bloc.  I don t want a new European treaty discussed behind closed doors, in the corridors of Brussels, Berlin or Paris,  Macron said. These debates - so-called  democratic conventions , which he proposed during his French presidential campaign - would help lay the foundations of Europe for the next 10 to 15 years. Macron also said he backed the idea of giving Britain s 78 seats in the European Parliament to pan-EU representatives elected by all of the EU s citizens after Brexit.

Malaysia ready to provide temporary shelter for Rohingya fleeing violence,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia s coast guard will not turn away Rohingya Muslims fleeing violence in Myanmar and is willing to provide them temporary shelter, the maritime agency s chief said on Friday. Rohingya insurgents attacked several police posts and an army base in Myanmar on Aug. 25. The ensuing clashes and a  military counter-offensive have killed at least 400 people and triggered an exodus of more than 160,000 to neighboring Bangladesh. Malaysia, hundreds of km (miles) to the south on the Andaman Sea, is likely to see more boat people from Myanmar in coming weeks and months because of the renewed violence, said Zulkifli Abu Bakar, the director-general of the Malaysia Maritime Enforcement Agency. However any such voyage would be hazardous for the next few months, because of the annual monsoon.   We are supposed to provide basic necessities for them to continue their journey and push them away. But at the end of the day, because of humanitarian reasons, we will not be able to do that,  Zulkifli told Reuters, adding that no fresh refugees had been seen yet. Malaysia, a Muslim-majority nation already home to more than 100,000 Rohingya refugees, will probably house the new arrivals  in immigration detention centers, where foreigners without documents are typically held, he said. Malaysia, which has not signed the U.N. Refugee Convention, treats refugees as illegal migrants. Thailand has also said it is preparing to receive people fleeing the fighting in Myanmar. Malaysia will send a humanitarian mission to help refugees seeking shelter at the Bangladesh-Myanmar border, Prime Minister Najib Razak said. The mission, to be led by the Malaysian armed forces, is a  manifestation of Malaysia s strong objection of the continued suppression of the Rohingya community by the Myanmar security forces,  Najib said in a statement. The mission will leave on Saturday to review the situation in refugee camps. Malaysia Airlines and Malindo Air will help in the distribution of aid, the statement added. Malaysia will hold talks with Bangladesh to set up a military hospital at the border, Najib added.  There are about 59,000 Rohingya refugees registered with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Malaysia although unofficial numbers are almost double.  In 2015, mass graves were exhumed at jungle camps on the border between Thailand and Malaysia that were thought to be mainly Rohingya victims of human traffickers. ",worldnews,"September 8, 2017 ",1
"Stop fighting over Brexit and get real, Jim O'Neill tells UK","LONDON (Reuters) - The British government should stop dreaming about having its own way in Brexit negotiations and start to get more realistic about the likely outcome of divorce talks with the European Union, said Jim O Neill, a former Goldman Sachs economist. Prime Minister Theresa May, who quietly opposed Brexit ahead of the referendum, has formally notified the bloc of Britain s intention to leave and divorce talks are under way. A botched gamble on a snap election in June undermined May s authority inside her own Conservative Party and some EU diplomats say the British negotiating stance remains both unrealistic and unclear. O Neill, who coined the term  BRIC  in 2001 to describe how the economic clout of Brazil, Russia, India and China would challenge the West s dominance, told BBC radio that divisions inside the Conservatives were driving Brexit policy.  The divisions between our political parties, particularly inside the ruling Conservative one, continue to dominate the policy discussion and it is very unfortunate and I wish it would change,  said O Neill. In the June 23, 2016 referendum, voters in the United Kingdom backed leaving the EU by a margin of 51.9 percent to 48.1 percent. O Neill, who resigned from his job as a Treasury minister in May s government a year ago, said that the British negotiators  attempt to cherry pick an exit deal was unrealistic.  The last thing the EU wants for a big country to leave and for there to be no consequences because at some point there would be others that might think:  Well if it s that easy and you can get away from the worst bits but keep the good bits, then I ll have some of that too ,  he said.  It frequently seems our negotiators don t seem to appreciate that,  O Neill said. May says she will make Brexit a success and that she hopes the EU will agree to a deal that allows both sides to continue to trade as freely as possible. ",worldnews,"September 8, 2017 ",1
Singapore decried for 'harassment' of anti-death penalty activists,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore should end harassment of peaceful activists, Human Rights Watch has said, after participants at a candlelight vigil for a man being executed for drug trafficking were stopped from leaving the country. On July 13, about 10 people, including opponents of the death penalty and relatives Prabagaran Srivijayan, 22, attended the vigil outside Changi Prison in support of the man, who was to be hanged early the next morning. The man, who was executed on July 14, was convicted of trafficking 22.4 grams of heroin into Singapore.  During the vigil, participants said they were approached by police and told that a police report had been filed and that they were to remove the candles.  The police removed the candles and photographs of Prabagaran but the participants say they were not asked to disperse. Assemblies and processions for a cause in public places without a permit is a criminal offense in Singapore. Anyone convicted of organizing such an assembly faces penalties of up to S$10,000 ($7,440) in fines and up to six months in jail. The Singapore government has said that the law is required to provide for the individual s rights for political expression without compromising on  order and safety . Among those at the vigil were a journalist, who is an activist against capital punishment, an editor of independent online blog  Online Citizen  and a filmmaker whose most recent work focused on the detention in 1987 of political activists under Singapore s Internal Security Act. The three said in social media postings that they had been prevented from leaving the country, and had been told that they were required to stay in Singapore to assist police with an investigation. As of Friday afternoon, police were not able to respond to requests by Reuters for comment. Human Rights Watch said the government should respect the right of free speech and assembly.  The government should end its harassment of activists campaigning against capital punishment and respect their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly,  the group said in a release on Thursday. None of the three had been arrested or charged, Kirsten Han, the activist and journalist, told Reuters. ",worldnews,"September 8, 2017 ",1
Hard Irish border post-Brexit would be risk to peace: Coveney,"TALLINN (Reuters) - A physical border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland after Brexit would risk decades of peace negotiations, and Britain s solutions so far are not sufficient, Ireland s Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said on Friday.   We cannot have a physical border on the island of Ireland again that creates barriers between communities, that will create tension, that will undermine the peace process that has taken 30 years to build,  Coveney told Reuters.  The problem is that the solutions to get us there so far haven t been convincing,  he said in the margins of an EU foreign ministers  meeting in Tallinn, referring to Britain s proposals.  The issue of how the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland will fare after Britain leaves the European Union is sensitive given the decades of violence over whether the province should be part of Britain or Ireland.

Israel's Sara Netanyahu may face indictment: attorney general,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel s attorney general is considering indicting the wife of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Sara, on suspicion of using state funds for personal dining and catering services amounting to some $100,000, the justice ministry said on Friday. The ministry statement said the attorney general was considering prosecuting Sara Netanyahu for offences that include fraudulently procuring items, fraud and breach of trust. A post on the prime minister s Facebook page published late on Thursday in response to media reports about a forthcoming announcement by Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit, said the claims against Sara Netanyahu were  absurd and will be proven to be unfounded . It was unclear what political impact Friday s announcement might have on Netanyahu, who himself is under investigation in two corruption cases.  One of those, known as Case 1000, involves gifts that the prime minister and his family may have received from businessmen, while Case 2000 deals with alleged efforts by him to secure better coverage from an Israeli newspaper publisher. Netanyahu - who has been prime minister for 11 years over four terms - has denied any wrongdoing.  Netanyahu leads a relatively stable coalition government and presides over a buoyant economy. His conservative Likud party has rallied behind him in the absence of clear rivals for the leadership, rebuffing calls for his departure from the center-left opposition. Likud s religious-nationalist coalition partners, seeing no threat to their agenda with Netanyahu as prime minister, are likewise sticking with him for now. In a case dubbed  the meals-ordering affair  by the Justice Ministry, Sara Netanyahu with help from an aide allegedly created a false impression between 2010-2013 that no cooks were employed at the prime minister s official residence, while indeed there were, according to the ministry statement. This was done, the statement said, to procure state funding for outside catering that would have been covered had there been no chef.  In this way, hundreds of meals from restaurants and chefs worth 359,000 shekels ($102,399) were received from the state fraudulently,  said the justice ministry statement. Sara Netanyahu has the option to plead her case in a hearing with the attorney general. ",worldnews,"September 8, 2017 ",1
"U.N. says 270,000 Rohingya fled Myanmar in past two weeks","GENEVA (Reuters) - An estimated 270,000 Rohingya refugees have fled Myanmar in the past two weeks and sought refuge in Bangladesh, where two existing refugee camps are  bursting at the seams , the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR said on Friday.  The exodus of the minority Rohingya was triggered by insurgent attacks on Aug. 25 and an army counter-offensive. Myanmar says its forces are fighting a legitimate campaign against terrorists responsible for a string of attacks on the police and army since last October. Officials blame Rohingya militants for killing non-Muslims and burning their homes.  The two refugee camps in Cox s Bazar in southeast Bangladesh   home to nearly 34,000 Rohingya refugees before this influx   are now bursting at the seams. The population has more than doubled in two weeks, totaling more than 70,000. There is an urgent need for more land and shelters,  UNHCR said in a briefing note for reporters in Geneva.  The vast majority are women, including mothers with newborn babies, families with children. They arrive in poor condition, exhausted, hungry and desperate for shelter.  The United Nations was expecting a total refugee influx of 300,000, up from a previous estimate of 120,000, an official told Reuters on Wednesday. The International Organization for Migration said the estimate of new arrivals had increased considerably partly because of an assessment on Sept. 6, when humanitarian workers visited more locations, and found 75,000 newly arrived people in nine locations.  There were 130,000 people in the registered refugee camps and three makeshift settlements, 90,000 in host communities, and  nearly 50,000 in new spontaneous settlements which are expanding quickly with people still searching for space to make temporary shelters , an IOM statement said.      While most of Rohingya refugees arrive on foot, mostly walking through the jungle and mountains for several days, thousands are braving long and risky voyages across the rough seas of the Bay of Bengal,  UNHCR said. At least 300 boats arrived in Cox s Bazar on Wednesday, IOM said.  ",worldnews,"September 8, 2017 ",1
"Pierre Berge, who co-founded Yves Saint Laurent fashion house, dies","PARIS (Reuters) - French businessman and art patron Pierre Berge, who co-founded the Yves Saint Laurent fashion house, has died at age 86 following a long illness, his foundation said on Friday.  Berge was the partner of the late designer Yves Saint Laurent, with whom he founded the label in 1961. He died on Friday at his home in Saint-Remy-de-Provence in southern France. Berge, who ran the Yves Saint Laurent house until 2002, was  a passionate art collector and opera lover. Socialist President Fran ois Mitterrand put him in charge of the newly-built Bastille Opera in Paris in 1988.  Pierre Berge was a true prince of the arts and culture,  former culture minister Jack Lang said. In 1994, Berge, a longtime campaigner for gay rights, created Sidaction, a fund-raising organization dedicated to AIDS research and treatment. He was also a founder of the French weekly Courrier International and the gay magazine Tetu and the chairman of the supervisory board at Le Monde newspaper as one its main shareholders. Berge was due to inaugurate two museums dedicated to Yves Saint Laurent in Paris and Marrakech this autumn. ",worldnews,"September 8, 2017 ",1
Philippines' Duterte says no peace talks without communists' ceasefire,"MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Friday ruled out a resumption of stalled peace talks with communist rebels if they do not stop guerrilla attacks, two days after lawmakers ousted the last leftist from his cabinet. An angry Duterte in May ordered the scrapping of formal peace talks with the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) after the military said fighters from the CPP s military wing, the New People s Army, stepped up offensives in the countryside.  There will be no talks until you declare a ceasefire, period,  he said in a speech in his home city of Davao.  And if you say you want another war, be my guest.  Duterte gave two cabinet positions to left-wing activists recommended by the CPP when he assumed power last year to show his commitment to ending nearly five decades of conflict, in which more than 40,000 people have been killed. The legislature s Commission on Appointments on Wednesday rejected the appointment of leftist Rafael Mariano as agrarian reform minister.  Mariano s exit came less than a month after the same panel ousted Judy Taguiwalo, another leftist, as social welfare minister, in what some commentators say is a move by Duterte s allies to punish the CPP.  But Duterte s office in both cases expressed disappointment the ministers had not been approved. In the Philippines, all ministers must be approved by the house panel, but the process can take more than a year. The president is furious about repeated attacks by the communist rebels who, he said, have killed many soldiers and police. He is also angered by what he sees as duplicity by the CPP s exiled political leaders, to whom he says he has made many concessions and has shown good faith by making the peace process a top priority for his administration. The rebels  chief negotiator, Luis Jalandoni, has said the government s demand to stop guerrilla attacks is  ridiculous  because soldiers are attacking villages where rebels are based.

Control of information shifts up a gear in run-up to Cambodia election,"PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Critics of Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen have grown used to following upstart news service Fresh News to find out what the government s next target might be. From treason accusations against detained opposition leader Kem Sokha to the tax demand against the now-shuttered Cambodia Daily to allegations against the recently expelled U.S. National Democratic Institute, it was on Fresh News first. Its rise, just as pressure is growing on more critical media, reflects a shift in control of information in the run-up to next year s general election at the same time as a crackdown on Hun Sen s opponents.  If any news needs to be reported, I may contact the prime minister or the prime minister may contact me,  37-year-old Fresh News chief executive Lim Chea Vutha told Reuters. Lim rejected accusations it publishes unsubstantiated reports to serve the government s interest and said it was just ambitious to break news the same as any major news agency. Cambodia has long had one of Southeast Asia s most open media environments, but journalists with publications critical of the government say work is becoming tougher than during any period of Hun Sen s more than three-decade rule.  This means an imbalance of information,  said Pa Nguon Teang, head of the partly EU-funded Voice of Democracy radio station, banned from broadcasting to its estimated 7.7 million listeners last month and now trying to publish via Facebook. Eighteen other radio stations were ordered off air while channels were also forbidden from rebroadcasting the U.S.-funded Voice of America and Radio Free Asia. The Cambodia Daily newspaper, whose editor described it as  a burr in Hun Sen s side  since it was started 24 years ago, was forced to close by a crippling $6.3 million tax bill   news of which first appeared on Fresh News.  The three-year-old publication also published the video that formed the basis for arresting opposition leader Kem Sokha for treason charges his lawyers dismiss as nonsense.  It s not fresh news, it s not even fake news, it s bad news - bad news for the future of Cambodia,  said Mu Sochua, a deputy of Kem Sokha in his Cambodia National Rescue Party. Cambodia is not the only Southeast Asian country where the media is under pressure, with journalists and bloggers in Thailand, the Philippines, Myanmar and Vietnam facing everything from verbal threats to arrest to violence. Hun Sen has said his attitude to media he does not like is no different to that of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has branded some liberal U.S. news organizations  fake news  and has refused to take questions from their reporters. For Hun Sen, a 65-year-old former Khmer Rouge soldier, critical media are  like children challenging their father , said Huy Vannak, president of the partly state-funded Union of Journalist Federations of Cambodia.  They only mock his good faith to the nation. That s why he s not tolerant,  he said. Praised openly by Hun Sen, Fresh News now has more than 100 employees. At the company s ninth-floor offices near a busy Phnom Penh junction, signs tell journalists  the first enemy of success is laziness . Facebook is one of the main channels for Fresh News to publish and has also been embraced by Hun Sen since the opposition almost won the 2013 election, partly with the help of their social media strategy. While declining to give company financial details, Lim said he received no money from the government. A government spokesman said there was no funding for Fresh News or anyone publishing on social media beyond official accounts.  Lim said he was supported only by advertising. Flipping through his mobile phone, he showed ads for everything from Range Rover to Coca-Cola to local businesses thriving in an economy growing at around 7 percent a year. But business and government are entwined in Cambodia and the leadership and its family members control many of Cambodia s biggest enterprises - including media businesses. Hun Sen s oldest daughter, Hun Mana, chairs Kampuchea Thmey Daily and Bayon TV and Radio among at least a dozen other firms. Senate president and the deputy leader of the ruling Cambodia People s Party, Say Chhum, owns Rasmei Kampuchea, Cambodia s most popular newspaper. According to a 2015 study, media organizations with politically affiliated owners accounted for 41 percent of print readership and 63 percent of television viewership. Of those owners, eight out of 10 were close to the ruling party. Businesses won t give advertising to media seen as pro-opposition because it won t help them, said Huy Vannak.  The government doesn t need to sponsor you when your content is positive. Business will come to you,  he said. Despite international awards for its reporting, the Cambodia Daily was not a big commercial success. By the end, it said it was barely breaking even and had no hope of paying a tax bill it disputed before the Sept. 4 deadline set by government. The paper appeared to get limited sympathy from Lim.  It s the right of the government to shut it down,  he said.  As we reported, it s a legal matter.  ",worldnews,"September 8, 2017 ",1
Three vehicles torched in long-running South African taxi war,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - One Uber vehicle and two other taxis were torched in South Africa s main business district on Thursday night in a feud over fares, but no one was injured, Uber and police said on Friday. The vehicles were set alight in the wealthy Sandton district near the Gautrain station, a popular pick-up point for taxis where previous attacks on Uber vehicles have taken place. It was not clear who torched the vehicles.  Uber [UBER.UL] drivers around the world have faced threats and protests from regular taxi operators, who say cheap fares from Uber drivers are forcing them out of business.  All the drivers of the cars escaped unharmed. It is suspected that the incident is related to the ongoing fight between the metered taxis and the Ubers,  police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said. A fourth car had its back window smashed in, he said. On Friday, police officers patrolled the street outside the Gautrain station, which is opposite the Reuters offices. Samantha Allenberg, Uber s communications head for Africa, said only one of the torched vehicles belonged to Uber. One of the torched vehicles was likely from a different ride-hailing service, Allenberg said.  We really need the government to do more here. The violence and intimidation is simply unacceptable,  she said. Uber has met the minister of transport and law enforcement agencies several times over similar incidents, she said. Footage of the burning vehicles circulated on social media.  Transport Minister Joe Maswanganyi said those behind the violence and intimidation would face the law.    More than 6,000 vehicles use the e-hailing Uber application to find customers in South Africa, where the service has grown swiftly as public transport has not kept up with the rising population in sprawling cities. Uber operates in more than 600 cities and has faced protests in France, Brazil and Hungary, and Uber drivers have been threatened or attacked in Kenya, Costa Rica, and Australia.

Suu Kyi says Myanmar trying to protect all citizens in strife-torn state,"YANGON/COX S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi said on Thursday her government was doing its best to protect everyone in the strife-torn state of Rakhine, as the estimated number of Rohingya Muslims who have fled to Bangladesh leapt by 18,000 in one day, to 164,000. Suu Kyi did not refer specifically to the exodus of the minority Rohingya, which was sparked by insurgent attacks on Aug. 25 and an army counter-offensive, but said her administration was trying its best to take care of all citizens. Western critics have accused Suu Kyi of not speaking out for the Rohingya, some 1.1 million people who have long complained of persecution and are seen by many in Buddhist-majority Myanmar as illegal migrants from Bangladesh.  Some have called for the Nobel Peace Prize she won in 1991 as a champion of democracy to be revoked.  We have to take care of our citizens, we have to take care of everybody who is in our country, whether or not they are our citizens,  Suu Kyi said in comments to Reuters Television s Indian partner, Asian News International.  Of course, our resources are not as complete and adequate as we would like them to be but, still, we try our best and we want to make sure that everyone is entitled to the protection of the law,  she said during a visit by Indian Prime Narendra Modi to Yangon. Suu Kyi on Tuesday blamed  terrorists  for  a huge iceberg of misinformation  on the strife in the northwestern state of Rakhine but made no mention of the Rohingya who have fled. She has come under increasing pressure from countries with Muslim populations, and this week U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned there was a risk of ethnic cleansing in Myanmar that could destabilise the region. In Washington, the U.S. State Department on Thursday voiced its concern  following serious allegations of human rights abuses including mass burnings of Rohingya villages and violence conducted by security forces and also armed civilians .  We urge all in Burma including in the Rakhine state to avoid actions that exacerbate tensions there,  State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters. The U.S. ambassador has met Myanmar officials to discuss  allegations of violence conducted by both the security forces and civilians  and access for humanitarian groups, she said. Myanmar has said it is negotiating with China and Russia to ensure they block any Security Council censure over the crisis.  Suu Kyi said the situation in Rakhine has been difficult for many decades and so it was  a little unreasonable  to expect her administration, which has been in power for 18 months, to have resolved it already. Myanmar says its forces are fighting a legitimate campaign against terrorists responsible for a string of attacks on the police and army since last October. Officials blame Rohingya militants for killing non-Muslims and burning their homes.  We need to wipe out the threat of the terrorism in those regions,  Ko Ko Hlaing, a presidential adviser of the previous government said on Thursday at a forum arranged by military-owned media to discuss the crisis. He said rehabilitation and development are important and the citizenship issue must be settled, but the first priority needed to be  the detoxification of dangerous ideology of extremism .  Suu Kyi s spokesman, Zaw Htay, on Thursday posted what he said were  photos of Bengalis setting fire to their houses . The pictures of several sword-wielding women wearing headscarfs and men in Islamic prayer caps, or  Kufi , setting a house on fire, which were published in one of the country s leading newspapers, were also shared widely by the military.  These photos showing that Bengalis are torching their houses emerge at a time when international media have made groundless accusations of setting fire to Bengali houses by the government security forces and the killings of Bengalis,  said the Eleven Media daily But the photographs sparked controversy on social media with many people who identified themselves as Myanmar Muslims saying they appeared staged.  Rights monitors and Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh say the Myanmar army has been trying to force them out of Rakhine state with a campaign of arson and killings. Boatloads of exhausted Rohingya continued to arrive in the Cox s Bazar region of neighbouring Bangladesh on Thursday. The latest estimate by U.N. workers operating there put arrivals in just 13 days at 164,000, up from 146,000 from the day before. U.N. officials in Bangladesh now believe the total number of refugees from Myanmar since Aug. 25 could reach 300,000, said Dipayan Bhattacharyya, who is Bangladesh spokesman for the World Food Programme (WFP). [nL4N1LN4N3] The surge of refugees - many sick or wounded - has strained the resources of aid agencies and communities already helping hundreds of thousands from previous spasms of violence in Myanmar. Many have no shelter, and aid agencies are racing to provide clean water, sanitation and food.  Many refugees are stranded in no-man s land between the border with Myanmar,  medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said in a statement.   Even prior to the most recent influx, many Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh lived in unsafe, overcrowded and unhygienic conditions, with little protection from the elements.  It said more nurses, midwives and doctors had been brought in to tackle violence-related injuries, severely infected wounds and obstetric complications.  (Corrects title of U.N.

"Children, teenagers among wounded Rohingya in crammed Bangladesh hospital","CHITTAGONG, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Mohammed Idrees, a 10-year-old Rohingya boy, does not remember how he landed at the hospital in Bangladesh with a part of his right ear blown off.  But he says he won t return to his home country, neighboring Myanmar, until there is peace. Idrees is one of around 60 badly injured Rohingya Muslims admitted to the hospital in Chittagong since violence flared in Rakhine state in the northwest of Myanmar in late August.  Rohingya insurgents attacked several police posts and an army base on Aug 25, leading to a military crackdown that has resulted in the deaths of at least 400 people and sent 146,000 people fleeing to Bangladesh. Apart from creating a humanitarian crisis, the unrest has also brought waves of international criticism of Myanmar s leader, the Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, for not speaking out for a minority that has long complained of persecution. The Rohingya are denied citizenship in Myanmar, a mainly Buddhist country. Almost all the Rohingya being treated at the Chittagong Medical College Hospital, the largest in southeast Bangladesh, have been injured by gunshots or bomb blasts, according to a hospital document given to Reuters. Around a third of the total injured are teenagers or younger, including a six-year-old boy. The Myanmar military has repeatedly said that it has been targeting only insurgents in the crackdown.  Ajoy Kumar Dey, who is in charge of the hospital, said he had not seen similar wounds during previous influxes of Rohingya from Myanmar. He said the large number of young men and children, like Idrees, underlined the gravity of the situation in Rakhine.   I don t remember what happened to me, but I want to go see my mother,  Idrees said, lying on his bed in a soiled white shirt and a checked longyi, a Myanmar-style sarong. His head was bandaged and he was clutching the hand of his father, sitting by his side.  It hurts a lot.  He cried as his father, Mohammed Rasheed, described how Myanmar security forces sprayed bullets into their village, Kyauk Chaung, on the morning of Aug. 25. One bullet took off a chunk of Idrees  ear as his family crouched behind a canal near their house. Six fellow villagers from Kyauk Chaung died in the hour-long shooting, said Rasheed.  A bleeding Idrees was carried on a bamboo stretcher over some hills near the border to reach Bangladesh the same night. His mother, three sisters and a brother arrived on Sunday.  We are lucky all of us are alive,  said Rasheed. Across the ward, a Rohingya man with bullet wounds in one shoulder, the back of a thigh and a shin, writhed in agony. A plastic nasal pipe was helping him breath. The government hospital in Chittagong is usually crowded at the best of times; now it is receiving twice as many people as it has beds - many of them Rohingya with shattered faces, shredded legs and damaged eyes who are fighting for their lives. Around two dozen young Rohingya men, some groaning in pain, were laying on blue hospital mattresses on the floor of a corridor on Wednesday, their legs or hands heavily plastered. Zaw Htay, Aung San Suu Kyi s spokesman, said Thursday that Myanmar was in discussions with Dhaka on what to do about what he said were  terrorists  in the hospital, a charge the Myanmar military made earlier in the week.  The Bangladeshi foreign secretary, Shahidul Haque, denied being contacted by Myanmar about militants being treated at the hospital.  However, he said that Bangladesh had previously handed over two  terrorists  after being given their names by Myanmar. He did not provide further details, but said Bangladesh would hand any terrorists to Myanmar if it provided more names and the individuals could be found. A United Nations source said that on Sept. 3 alone, 31 Rohingya with bullet injuries and six with burn injuries were admitted to the Chittagong hospital.  There have been many people who have come with bullet wounds on the backs of their bodies,  said H.T. Imam, a political adviser to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh.  That is most reprehensible. This is a killing mission, plain and simple.  Myanmar officials have said the country has the right to defend itself from attack, adding that security personnel were told to keep innocent civilians from harm. Rohingya who have fled to Bangladesh are in urgent need of medical and humanitarian assistance given the massive scale of the influx, Doctors Without Borders said Wednesday.  Many of the arrivals have serious medical needs, such as violence-related injuries, severely infected wounds, and advanced obstetric complications,  Pavlo Kolovos, the humanitarian group s head in Bangladesh, said in a statement.  Without a scale-up of humanitarian support, the potential health risks are extremely concerning.  One such person with severe injuries is Mohammed Jubair, 21, who, according to doctors treating him in the burns and plastic surgery department, is on his deathbed. The right side of Jubair s face has been smashed up completely; the left has severe burns, as does his lower body. He was fleeing his village in Rakhine with his five-year-old sister when Myanmar forces in a helicopter hurled a bomb at them on Aug. 26, killing the girl on the spot, according to his older brother, Nur Mohammed.  Unlike me, my brother was carrying our young sister as we fled to the hills when the army came and started setting our houses on fire,  he said.  I could move ahead faster, now Allah save my brother.  Like the attack on the village reported by Rasheed, it was not possible to independently verify Mohammed s account.

China's tighter drone rules send new pilots flocking to school,"BEIJING (Reuters) - A buzz fills the sky above a flight base in northern Beijing, as pilots practise take-offs and landings ahead of tests to qualify for a license - to fly drones. Drone enthusiasts in China, the world s top maker of consumer unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), are scrambling for licenses after the government adopted strict rules this year to tackle incidents of drones straying into aircraft flight paths.   A drone is not a toy,  said Yang Nuo, the principal of the  drone training school in the Chinese capital, who expects more students to sign up in a drive to boost flying skills.  It involves complicated aerial theoretical knowledge.   Gao Huiqiang, 32, said his construction company told him to seek a license.  Since the laws on drones are tightening and a legal framework is being built, they told me to come and get the license first,  he added. In June, China set an end-August deadline for owners of civilian drones to register crafts up to a certain weight under their real names. Last week, a test-flight base opened in the commercial hub of Shanghai, which requires civilian drones to fly below 150 m (492 ft), the official news agency s Xinhuanet website said. Others have balked at the idea of spending around 10,000 yuan ($1,534) for an official qualification, particularly as uncertainty surrounds future regulations.  They don t know when the next regulation will be introduced,  said Hao Jiale, the manager at a DJI drone store.  Some people want to wait and see.  Privately-held SZ DJI Technology Co Ltd, based in the southeastern city of Shenzen, had a roughly 70 percent share of the global commercial and consumer drone market, according to a 2016 estimate by Goldman Sachs and Oppenheimer analysts. Despite the curbs, prospects for growth look bright. China s camera drone market will see a compound annual growth rate of 68 percent in five years, with shipments reaching 3 million units by 2019, up from 40,000 in the third quarter of 2015, tech research firm IDC said last year.   More than 120,000 drones have been registered in China, Xinhuanet said, compared to just 77,000 registered users in the United States.    ",worldnews,"September 5, 2017 ",1
Hungarian PM Orban says will fight after EU ruling on migrant quota,"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary will not change its anti-immigration stance after the European Union s top court dismissed a challenge against migrant quotas, Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Friday. The EU s highest court ruled on Wednesday that member states must take in a share of refugees who reach Europe, dismissing the challenge by Slovakia and Hungary and re-igniting an east-west row that has shaken EU cohesion.  We must take note of the ruling as we cannot erode the foundation of the EU - and respect of law is the foundation of the EU - but at the same time this court ruling is no reason for us to change our policy, which rejects migrants,  Orban told state radio. The Mediterranean migrant crisis of 2015 flooded the Balkans, Italy and Greece with migrants, which prompted the EU to impose mandatory quotas on its member countries for relocating asylum seekers. The flow of migrants has receded, easing pressure to force compliance on nationalist leaders like Orban, who is benefiting from his tough anti-immigrant policies as elections approach in 2018. Now that the legal challenge has failed, Orban said he would pursue a political fight to force the EU to change its mandatory migrant quotas.  The whole issue raises a very serious question of principles: whether we are an alliance of European free nations with the Commission representing our joint interests, or a European empire which has its center in Brussels and which can issue orders,  Orban said. He said EU countries which let in migrants, unlike Hungary, decided to do so of their own will and now they cannot ask Hungary to take a part in correcting their mistake.  It is not us Hungarians who question the rules of the club, but the Commission had changed the rules and this is unacceptable,  Orban added. He said that unlike some of the major member states of the EU, whose colonial legacy has made them  immigrant countries , Hungary did not have a colonial past.  These countries with colonial legacy, which have become immigrant countries by now, want to impose on us Central Europeans their own logic ... but Hungary does not want to become an immigrant country,  Orban said. At the same time, he said Hungary was committed to EU membership, because Hungarians had decided in a referendum to join the bloc in 2004.  No government can lead Hungary out of the EU as it was the Hungarian people which decided to be inside and this is right.  ",worldnews,"September 8, 2017 ",1
Minor New Zealand parties in focus as hotly contested election gets tighter,"WELLINGTON (Reuters) - The rising popularity of New Zealand s Labour Party in hotly contested elections is making it less likely that the nationalist New Zealand First Party will play kingmaker, poll averages released on Friday show. The uncertainty over which combination of parties will decide the next government is worsening an already topsy-turvy election, previously seen as a slam dunk for the center-right National Party, which has ruled for almost a decade. Since taking over as leader last month, charismatic politician Jacinda Ardern has almost single-handedly changed the chances of her Labour Party at the Sept. 23 election.  When I go out and knock on doors...there is a feeling for change, there is,  Marama Fox, a leader of the M ori Party, said at a televised debate between leaders of smaller parties, referring to Labour s newfound popularity.  Fox s party, which campaigns for the rights of indigenous New Zealanders, could play a crucial role in determining the next government. Though it has been in a coalition with National for nine years, Fox said she could work with Labour. Support for newly invigorated Labour rose to 41.8 percent in opinion polls, nudging above the National Party s 41.1 percent, figures released by media showed. That put the center-left opposition party closer to being able to form a government with the Green Party, polling at around 5.4 percent, and the M ori Party, which posted support of about 1.2 percent.  Alternatively Labour could join forces with New Zealand First, which slipped to 7.9 percent and had previously been thought likely to determine which major party governed. Green Party leader James Shaw would not rule out a deal with New Zealand First, but expressed reluctance, as the party s outspoken leader would not commit to either National or Labour.  He s a bad date,  Shaw said of Peters  last-minute decision to skip the debate.  He s stood us up tonight... he s completely unreliable and you don t know which way he s going to go.  But if the Green Party fell further, sinking below the support threshold of 5 percent for seats in parliament, that would put New Zealand First in an even stronger position.  It is really unusual... it s all about which pieces land where,  said Grant Duncan, political analyst at Auckland University. Minor parties often have an outsize role in New Zealand s proportional representation system, in which a party, or combination of parties, needs 61 of Parliament s 120 members - usually about 48 percent of the vote - to form a government.

Bahrain rejects Amnesty report citing crackdown on dissent,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Bahrain condemned as inaccurate a report by the Amnesty International rights group accusing the Bahraini government of crushing dissent and violently cracking down on protests over the last year. Amnesty said in a report on Thursday that it had documented how the Bahraini government, from June 2016 to June 2017, had arrested, tortured, threatened or banned from travel at least 169 activists and opponents or their relatives.  It also accused in particular Britain and the United States, who both have military facilities in Bahrain, of turning a blind eye to abuses.  Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) of Kingdom of Bahrain regrets inaccuracies contained in Amnesty International s report,  the ministry said on its twitter account.  It gave no details.  MoFA stresses commitment of Kingdom of Bahrain to respect and promote freedoms and human rights principles.  Amnesty International said it had documented security officers beating protesters, firing tear gas, shotguns and semi-automatic rifles directly at protesters and driving armored vehicles and personnel carriers into protests. Bahrain has been a flashpoint since the Sunni-led government put down Arab Spring protests in 2011. The kingdom, most of whose population is Shi ite, says it faces a threat from neighboring Shi ite theocracy Iran. Entitled  No one can protect you: Bahrain s year of crushing dissent , the Amnesty report said at least six people had been killed, including a child, in the crackdowns. Bahrain has intensified a crackdown on critics, shutting down two main political groups, revoking the citizenship of the spiritual leader of the Shi ite Muslim community and jailing rights campaigners.

India bars 'unruly' passengers from flying for three months to over two years,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has issued new norms barring unruly passengers from flying for a minimum of three months to more than two years depending on the nature of the misdemeanor, the government said on Friday. The federal government has issued a no-fly list of unruly passengers after a lawmaker admitted assaulting an official from state-owned carrier Air India. The new rules will be applicable to foreign carriers as well, the government said in a statement, adding that unruly behavior has been categorized in three levels - verbal, physical and life threatening.  The concept of no-fly is based on safety of other passengers, crew and the aircraft, and not just on the security threat,  the government said. ",worldnews,"September 8, 2017 ",1
Russia says its air strike kills several top Islamic State commanders in Syria,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Russian air strike has killed around 40 Islamic State fighters, including four senior commanders, near the eastern Syrian city of Deir al-Zor, Russia s defense ministry said on Friday. The strike, carried out by Su-34 fighter-bombers and Su-35 fighters, came after an intelligence report on Sept. 5 showed that top Islamic State commanders were meeting at a secret underground command post in the vicinity of Deir al-Zor, the ministry said on its Facebook page. Among those killed was Abu Muhammad al-Shimali, who oversees foreign fighters at IS, it said. The defense ministry also said it had evidence that Gulmurod Khalimov, Islamic State s  minister of war , was present at the meeting in the bunker and had been fatally wounded in the strike and evacuated to the al-Muhasan area, 20 km (13 miles) southeast of Deir al-Zor. Khalimov, the U.S.-trained commander of Tajikistan s elite police force, defected to Islamic State in April 2015 and later posted a video address, vowing to return home to establish sharia law in his Central Asian nation and to take jihad to Russia and the United States. A top official at Tajikistan s national security service told Russia s RIA news agency that Moscow had been asked to provide details proving Khalimov s elimination. On Tuesday Syrian government forces, supported by Russian air strikes and cruise missile launches, reached troops besieged for years by Islamic State in Deir al-Zor, the militants  last major stronghold in Syria.

Sweeping change in China's military points to more firepower for Xi,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China s military is preparing a sweeping leadership reshuffle, dropping top generals, including two that sources say are under investigation for corruption. The changes would make room for President Xi Jinping to install trusted allies in key positions at a key party congress that begins on Oct 18. A list of 303 military delegates to the Communist Party Congress, published by the army s official newspaper on Wednesday, excluded Fang Fenghui and Zhang Yang, both members of the Central Military Commission. The commission is China s top military decision-making body. Reuters reported this week that the 66-year-old Fang, who accompanied Xi to his first meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump in April, is being questioned on suspicion of corruption. Three sources familiar with the matter said Zhang, the director of the military s Political Work Department, is also the subject of a probe. China s Defense Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. The personnel changes herald a clean sweep of the top-ranking generals heading up the department. All three of Zhang s deputies - Jia Tingan, Du Hengyan and Wu Changde - were also missing from the list of congress delegates.  This is a very clear message: they re out,  said Cheng Li, an expert on Chinese elite politics at the Brookings Institution.  Their political careers have come to an end.  On Friday, news reports carried by the People s Liberation Army Daily and the official news agency Xinhua abruptly referred to the navy s political commissar, Miao Hua, as the Political Work Department director, despite no official announcement of Zhang being replaced in his role. The department is in charge of imbuing political thought and makes military personnel decisions in a similar vein to the Communist Party s Organisation Department. The Political Work Department used to be headed by Xu Caihou, who along with a fellow former vice-chairman of the military commission, Guo Boxiong, was accused of taking bribes in exchange for promotions. Guo was jailed for life last year, while Xu died of cancer in 2015 before he could face trial. Also among the key omissions from the list published Wednesday were Du Jincai, who was replaced as the military s anti-corruption chief in March, and Cai Yingting, who left his post as head of the PLA Academy of Military Science in January. Taking into account officials who are likely to retire, as many as seven of the 11 spots on the military commission may be vacated, strengthening talk in Chinese political circles that the body may be streamlined.  Xi, who is commander-in-chief of China s armed forces, currently chairs the commission, which also comprises two vice-chairmen and eight committee members.  Two sources familiar with the matter said the commission may be cut down to Xi and four vice-chairmen, doing away with committee members and streamlining reporting lines.  Li, the Brookings expert, said that among those likely to be central to the army s refreshed leadership were Li Zuocheng, who took over from Fang as chief of the Joint Staff Department last month, Miao and the three commanders of the army s ground, air and naval forces: Han Weiguo, Ding Laihang and Shen Jinlong.  The fact that all five were newly-appointed this year and none were members of the Communist Party s 200-odd strong Central Committee, Li said, reflected the extent to which Xi was rejuvenating the leadership as part of his years-long drive to modernize the military and make it more ready for combat.  This is really a major step from Xi Jinping to consolidate his authority to promote the young, those who have some professional experience,  but are  not corrupted, and certainly not belonging to the factions of Guo Boxiong and Xu Caihou,  he said.

"Taiwan's new premier vows to 'build country', scrap investment hurdles","TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan s new premier, William Lai, vowed on Friday to work towards luring greater investment to the self-ruled island, while sticking to the policies of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party. Lai, formerly the mayor of the southwestern city of Tainan, made the remarks at a cabinet transition ceremony following the resignation this week of his predecessor, Lin Chuan..  The cabinet reshuffle, at a time of low public approval ratings for President Tsai Ing-wen, will give the government an opportunity to push through legislation with less resistance.  Ratings for Tsai shrank to below 30 percent by August, a survey by a private foundation showed, down from nearly 70 percent soon after her landslide election victory in 2016.  My main responsibility is to build the country, expand the economy and look after the people,  said Lai, adding that his cabinet would press on with reforms in areas ranging from the energy industry to labor, pensions and tax, while  eliminating obstacles for investment . He added,  these will have a pragmatic strategy and will be solved in a steadfast way.  Dissatisfaction with labor and pension reforms are seen to have weighed on Tsai s ratings, sparking occasional protests. The reshuffle brought several new key appointments, though most of the other ministry-level positions stayed unchanged.  The financial supervisory commission gets a new chief, Wellington Koo, while acting economics minister Shen Jong-chin was confirmed in the role. A new vice premier and secretary-general were also appointed to the cabinet, or executive yuan.   Lai, a member of Tsai s independence-leaning party, won a landslide reelection in 2014 in Tainan, home to the plants of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) and other technology firms.  The Harvard-educated Lai is expected to take a cautious stance in the transition, as shown by his modest personnel changes, analysts say.    Lai brings an effective administrative style, and will seek to keep the agenda on track,  said Edward Yang, an associate professor at National Taiwan Normal University.  His popular style also contrasts with that of Lin, who was seen as a less effective communicator, Yang added. The DPP is striving to shore up its popularity ahead of local elections next year in which it faces off against its main rival, the China-friendly Kuomintang (KMT) party.  Local election results are seen as a harbinger for the presidential election in 2020. ",worldnews,"September 8, 2017 ",1
Most South Koreans doubt the North will start a war: poll,"SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea has ratcheted up international tension and fear with its sixth and largest nuclear test on Sunday, but South Koreans feel increasingly doubtful it would start a war, a poll showed on Friday. A Gallup Korea survey found that 58 percent of South Koreans felt there was no possibility North Korea will cause a war, while 37 percent said they thought it would. Gallup Korea began asking South Koreans the question in 1992, and the percentage of respondents this time who thought the North would not start a war was the second highest since then. In the first poll in 1992, 69 percent of those questioned thought the North would start a war while only 24 percent thought it would not. The survey released on Friday showed South Koreans were considerably less concerned about war compared with June 2007, nine months after North Korea conducted its first nuclear test, in September 2006. In 2007, 51 percent of respondents said they expected a war, while 45 percent did not. North Korea says it needs to develop weapons to protect itself against U.S. aggression. It has been steadily pursuing its nuclear and missile programs in defiance of international condemnation and has threatened more action in response to any new U.N. sanctions and U.S. pressure. Despite the North s fiery rhetoric, South Koreans are generally calm, going about their lives with no sign of panic.  The survey results show South Koreans have likely grown accustomed to its repeated threats of provocation after over 60 years in a ceasefire state,  Gallup Korea said in a statement. South Korea and the United States are technically still at war with North Korea after the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce, not a peace treaty. The poll also found that 60 percent of those surveyed believed South Korea should arm itself with nuclear weapons while 35 percent disagreed.  Those in their twenties were most opposed to the idea of acquiring nuclear weapons, while respondents 50 and above said the South should have them. Gallup also said 59 percent of respondents were against the idea of the United States attacking North Korea first should North Korean provocations continue, while 33 percent said it should. Gallup Korea said the poll was carried out from Sept. 5 to 7. A total of 1,004 South Koreans over the age of 19 were polled by telephone, it said.  The survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percent. ",worldnews,"September 8, 2017 ",1
Pope Francis to bless Colombia's war victims,"VILLAVICENCIO/BOGOTA, Colombia (Reuters) - Thousands of victims of Colombia s five-decade war will seek blessings, guidance and a path to forgiveness from Pope Francis on Friday, during his visit to a region that for years has been known as an epicenter of violence.  The Argentine pope has received a rapturous welcome in Colombia, a majority Roman Catholic nation, bringing with him a message of peace and unity as he seeks to strengthen faith and heal the scars of civil war. In the city of Villavicencio, Francis will hold a prayer meeting with 6,000 survivors of a brutal conflict that has left millions scarred by kidnappings, massacres, rape, land mines and displacement. He will also bless the Cross of Reconciliation, a plain white memorial to the victims, and hear personal testimonies of those who have suffered.  There has been too much hatred and vengeance. The solitude of always being at loggerheads has been familiar for decades, and its smell has lingered for a hundred years,  the leader of the world s 1.2 billion Roman Catholics said on Thursday.  We do not want any type of violence whatsoever to restrict or destroy one more life,  added the pontiff, who delayed visiting Colombia until a peace deal between the government and Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels was in effect. Colombians have suffered from war between right-wing paramilitaries, Marxist rebels, and government forces since 1964. More than 220,000 have been killed and millions more displaced as the war spilled into towns and rural communities. The 80-year-old Francis will also beatify two victims as martyrs.  He will take the first step to make saints of Pedro Maria Ramirez, a priest who was killed in 1948 during the period of political violence known as  La Violencia,  and Bishop Jesus Emilio Jaramillo, killed in 1989 by the National Liberation Army (ELN) for suspected collaboration with the military. The pontiff wants his message of reconciliation to resonate with the war victims and he urged his Church to help spread the message.  You are not bureaucrats, nor politicians, you are pastors,  he said, addressing bishops in Bogota.   In Villavicencio - the capital of central Meta province, a vast cattle ranching area which has been a hotbed of paramilitary and rebel violence - Francis will see a destroyed statue of Christ brought from western Choco province for his visit. The effigy was recovered from a church attacked by the FARC in 2002 in the rain forest village of Bojaya. About 80 people were killed as they sought refuge from rebel bombings inside the humble church. The plaster figure, without arms or legs, has become an enduring symbol of the bloody war.  Forgiveness is pivotal if Colombia is to forge lasting peace, break cycles of revenge and rebuild once-hostile communities.   But Colombians are deeply polarized as they prepare to receive 7,000 former fighters of the FARC into society and aim to repair divisions from the war. Many are furious that under last year s peace deal, FARC leaders accused of kidnapping, displacements and murder will avoid jail sentences and instead may receive seats in congress as members of a civilian political party. But at least during the pope s visit, people seem willing to forgive.  I ll be up at 3 a.m. to queue. It s so emotional, just to see him on television makes me tearful,  said Francis Alvarez, a 59-year-old housewife, who hopes to attend the Mass in Villavicencio.  It will consolidate peace in this region that s been so forgotten.  ",worldnews,"September 8, 2017 ",1
Singapore man and woman arrested for 'terrorism-related' activity,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Police in Singapore have arrested a man suspected of planning to join Islamic State-linked fighters in the Philippines and a woman who was in contact with foreign militants, the government said on Thursday. Singapore, regarded as the most stable country in Southeast Asia, has become increasingly concerned about the risks of radicalization among its Muslim minority. At least 14 radicalized Singaporeans have been put under restriction or detention orders under a tough internal security law since 2015, up sharply from 11 cases between 2007 and 2014, the government said in June. The man arrested was identified as Imran Kassim, 34. The Ministry of Home Affairs said he had tried to make his way to Syria to join Islamic State fighters at least twice, and had been prepared to attack members of the Singaporean armed forces. More recently, he had intended to join militants who seized control of Marawi City in Philippines this year, the ministry said in a press release. Imran s arrest came as a result of information given to police by  people close to him . Authorities have mounted a campaign to encourage family members, friends and neighbors to report on anyone they fear was in danger of becoming radicalized. The woman who was arrested was identified as Shakirah Begam binte Abdul Wahab, a 23-year old administrative assistant. The ministry said she had been in contact with several foreign fighters since 2013.   Shakirah has demonstrated a propensity to engage in risky behavior which renders her vulnerable to adverse influence and recruitment by terrorists who belong to a group that poses a security threat to Singapore , the ministry said. She was put under a restriction order, which means suspects are monitored and their movements are restricted. A child care worker arrested in June is the only Singaporean woman to have been placed in custody under the Internal Security Act, which allows for detention without trial. An auxiliary policeman who was suspected of becoming radicalized was also arrested in June. ",worldnews,"September 7, 2017 ",1
Rohingya say their village is lost to Myanmar's spiraling conflict," (Story refiles to add dropped word  not , in paragraph 10, in the September 7th story) By Simon Lewis KUTAPALONG, Bangladesh (Reuters) - The villagers said the soldiers came first, firing indiscriminately. Then came civilians, accompanying the soldiers, to loot and burn. Now in Bangladesh, 20 Muslims and Hindus gave interviews in which they recounted how they were forced out of their village of Kha Maung Seik in Myanmar s Rakhine State on Aug. 25.  The military brought some Rakhine Buddhists with them and torched the village,  said Kadil Hussein, 55.  All the Muslims in our village, about 10,000, fled. Some were killed by gunshots, the rest came here. There s not a single person left.  Hussein is staying with hundreds of other new arrivals at the Kutapalong refugee settlement, already home to thousands of Rohingya who fled earlier. Nearly 150,000 Rohingya have arrived in Bangladesh since Aug. 25, when insurgents of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army launched attacks on security forces in Rakhine State. Reuters interviewed villagers from Kha Maung Seik and neighboring hamlets, who described killings and the burning of homes in the military response to the insurgent attacks. Reuters has been unable to verify their accounts. Access to the area has been restricted since October, when the same insurgent group attacked police posts, killing nine. Myanmar says its forces are in a fight against  terrorists . State media has accused Rohingya militants of burning villages and killing civilians of all religions. Myanmar does not recognize the 1.1 million Rohingya as citizens, labeling them illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.  The refugees from Kha Maung Seik, and from numerous other villages across the north of Rakhine State, say Myanmar forces and ethnic Rakhine Buddhists are intent on forcing them out. One refugee, Body Alom, 28, said he hid in forest with thousands of others when the soldiers arrived. He waited for hours before emerging to look for his family. He says he saw corpses in paddy fields, and eventually found his mother and brother dead with gunshot wounds. Two other villagers said they saw bodies in the fields.  It wasn t safe, so I just left them,  he said.  I had no chance to give them a burial.  A military official denied that Buddhist civilians were working with authorities and instead accused Muslims of attacking other communities.  The military arrived at the village later but did not find any bodies,  said the military source, who declined to be identified as he is not authorized to speak to media. Another military source in the state capital, Sittwe, said Kha Maung Seik was in the conflict zone and clear information about what happened had yet to emerge. The main village of Kha Maung Seik was home to a mixed community, with Rohingya Muslims in the majority along with about 6,000 Rakhine Buddhists, Hindus and others. The village is known to the Rohingya as Foira Bazar for its market of about 1,000 shops where everyone did business. But relations have been strained for some time. A government plan to grant Hindus citizenship, violence in the state in 2012 and October, and an identity card scheme that the Rohingya rejected as it implied they were foreign, all contributed to tension, the refugees said. Since October, more soldiers were posted near the village, with border police. Patrols went house-to-house arresting anyone suspected of having militant links, they said. Abu Kalam, 31, showed Reuters welts on his back, arms and legs, and what he said were cigarette burns on his arms. He said he was detained by the military last month, before the attacks, as he was working in his vegetable patch with a knife.  After October, the military told us not to have knives. When they saw me using one they arrested me,  he said, adding he was kept in a barracks for six days.  They regularly tortured me, asking  are you connected with al-Yaqin? ,  he said, using another name for the rebels. Villagers in Kha Maung Seik say they heard shooting at 2 a.m. on Aug. 25. A military source in Maungdaw town and two Muslim residents said militants attacked a police post near the village that night. According to the military source, the rebels attacked with grenades then turned their attention to a Hindu neighborhood. Four Rohingya villagers separately gave Reuters accounts of how, at about 5 a.m., soldiers entered the village, firing indiscriminately. Thousands fled.  I was at the front of a big group running for cover, but I looked back and could see people at the back getting shot,  said Abul Hussein, 28. Later, grenades and mortar bombs were fired into the forest, according to Hussein and three other villagers.  I saw a mortar hit a group of people. Some died on the spot,  he said. From the forest, residents watched military and civilians loot and burn houses. Civilians helped gather bodies, according to Body Alom and two other villagers.  They collected the bodies, searching for belongings,  said Body Alom.  They took money, clothes, cows, everything. Then they burned the houses.  Members of Myanmar s small Hindu community seem to have been caught in the middle. The military source said some Hindus from Kha Maung Seik were unaccounted after the militant attack. A group of Hindu women refugees in Kutapalong said they saw eight Hindu men killed by Buddhist Rakhines after they refused to attack Muslims.  They asked my husband to join them to kill Rohingya but he refused, so they killed him,  said Anika Bala, 15. Six months pregnant, she said Muslims helped her get to Bangladesh. After seeing their homes burned, Kha Maung Seik s Muslim leaders decided it was too dangerous to stay.  We thought we might be able to return and live with other types of people,  said Mohammed Zubair, 30, assistant to the village chairman.   But we realized that s not possible.  About 100 men decided to stay and fight, Body Alom said.   One said to me  If I have to die, I will die here .  ",worldnews,"September 7, 2017 ",1
"Hurricane, storm surge warnings issued for Florida ahead of Irma: NHC","(Reuters) - Hurricane Irma, one of the most powerful Atlantic storms in half a century, has triggered hurricane and storm surge warnings for south Florida and the Florida Keys, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said on Thursday. Irma, which is about 585 miles (940 km) east-southeast of Miami, Florida, packing maximum sustained winds of 165 miles per hour (270 kph), will continue to bring life-threatening wind, storm surge, and rainfall hazards to the Turks and Caicos Islands and the Bahamas through Saturday, the NHC said. Irma should maintain a west-northwestward trajectory but slow down during the next 36 hours, it added. ",worldnews,"September 8, 2017 ",1
Hurricane Irma kills five as it sweeps through island of Saint Martin,"AMSTERDAM/PARIS (Reuters) - Hurricane Irma has killed at least five people and left a trail of destruction on the part-French, part-Dutch Caribbean island of Saint Martin, government officials in France and the Netherlands said on Thursday. Packing winds of around 175 mph (290 kph), the storm lashed several small islands in the northeast Caribbean, including St  Martin and St Barthelemy, tearing down trees, flattening homes and causing widespread damage. French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe on Thursday said four bodies had been recovered on the French side of the island, revising down an earlier death toll.  The death toll is still uncertain because clearing operations are under way,  Philippe told a news conference at a crisis centre in Paris. About 50 people have been injured.  There is considerable damage,  Philippe said, adding that local authorities in Saint Martin said 95 percent of the houses there had been damaged, and 60 percent were uninhabitable.  There is no electricity, no drinkable water, gasoline is unavailable.  Philippe said the government would on Friday declare a state of emergency, facilitating insurance compensation. Government officials in the Netherlands said the hurricane had caused enormous devastation on the Dutch side of the island, killing one person and injuring several others. The Dutch navy, which has two ships stationed off the coast, tweeted images gathered by helicopter showing damaged houses, hotels and boats. Sint Maarten, as it is known in Dutch, is an independent nation within the Kingdom of the Netherlands with a population of around 40,000 people, about the same as on the French side of the island. Images of the Dutch side s Juliana Airport showed the landing strips appeared intact, although the navy said the airport was unreachable for now. ",worldnews,"September 7, 2017 ",1
U.S. airlines scramble to evacuate residents ahead of Hurricane Irma,"(Reuters) - Airlines were racing against the clock to clear as many customers as possible from the likely Florida path of Hurricane Irma, as social and political pressure mounted for carriers to play a bigger role in aiding evacuations. As the powerful storm threatened to rip through the Florida coast by Sunday, airlines ramped up the number of flights available out of south Florida airports, where operations were likely to temporarily cease through the weekend and beyond.  But flights out of the area remained extremely limited. At Miami International Airport, many outbound flights were canceled, leaving residents scrambling to rebook to anywhere outside the path of the storm.  American Airlines, which has one of the larger operations in south Florida, said on Thursday it had added 16 flights out of Miami, amid more than 2,400 forced cancellations through Monday. Delta Air Lines Inc said it had upsized aircraft and added flights to increase the number of available outgoing seats by 2,000. United Airlines added six flights out of Miami to its hubs, including Newark, New Jersey, and Chicago O Hare. All three carriers said they planned to mostly wind down south Florida operations by Friday evening. In areas already pummeled by the powerful storm, flight operations had been rolled back and halted altogether.  A Delta-operated flight from New York to San Juan, Puerto Rico, and back, made headlines for narrowly avoiding the storm in a mission to evacuate another plane-full of passengers from the area ahead of Irma s landfall.  Flight-tracking website FlightRadar24.com saw the plane land for one last departure in the U.S. territory located squarely in the path of Irma s landfall, fill with passengers, and make its successful flight back to New York on Wednesday. Other airlines had already ceased operations in the region. PRICE-GOUGING  As residents sought to secure last-minute flights out of the dangerous Category 5 storm s path, airlines faced accusations of trying to capitalize on the panic and chaos by price gouging.   Under pressure from some members of Congress following social media reports, airlines have taken the unusual step of publicly announcing price caps on tickets out of areas in Irma s course. Early on, carrier JetBlue capped flights out of the area at $99, and other carriers followed suit, capping fares at between $99 and $399 a ticket.  But while airlines offered some cheap flights out of south Florida after complaints, passengers said that did little good if all the flights were fully booked or canceled.                         Medical student Eric Slabaugh said he was dismayed by ticket prices over $2,000 when he started looking for flights earlier this week. He got a ticket to Detroit for $700, he said,  because nobody wants to go there.                          Publix can t charge $50 for a case of water without getting accused of price gouging, but airlines can charge 50 times the price of a normal ticket. I don t think that s fair,  Slabaugh said. Airlines  customer service practices have come under fire in recent months, and just last year, U.S. carriers were cleared in a federal investigation regarding exorbitant fare mark-ups in the wake of a deadly Amtrak derailment that drove up demand for air travel on some routes.  Senator Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat who had been pressuring airlines to aid in evacuating Florida residents, spoke with airline executives on Thursday and urged them to add more flight outs of Florida.   His office said Nelson is  pleased  airlines were doing everything they could to  help get impacted Floridians to safety.  The Federal Aviation Administration is holding twice daily phone calls with airlines to talk about airport conditions, but does not plan to close the Miami airport on Friday, officials said. Airlines are still planning for airport closures, however, and said they expect their operations to be impacted in the region at least through the weekend.  Also affected by the storm, Carnival Cruise Lines, which has major operations out of Florida ports, said on Thursday it had canceled four of its Caribbean cruises, though it still planned to operate several more under modified itineraries.

Six farmers killed in apparent land dispute in Peru's Amazon,"LIMA (Reuters) - Six farmers were shot dead in the Peruvian Amazon by a group of masked men in an apparent dispute over land rights, a police officer and a tribal leader said on Thursday. Five bodies, one with hands and feet bound, had been thrown in a river and a sixth was found by the side of an unpaved road in the jungle region Ucayali, police officer Raul Huari said. The victims were part of a community of peasant farmers that had refused to leave the lands they work on when pressured by oil palm growers, said Robert Guimaraes, the head of an indigenous federation in Ucayali. Witnesses testified that a group of between 30 and 40 men carrying shotguns tried to kill some 20 farmers altogether, Huari said.  They said they showed up, surrounded them and just started shooting. Fortunately, some managed to escape,  he said.  In my 24 years of working I ve never seen anything like this.  Huari said the murders appeared to be linked to a land dispute, and a special police unit and prosecutors were carrying out investigations. The murders occurred on Sept. 1, marking the three-year anniversary of the killing of four indigenous activists who had faced threats from loggers in a different part of Ucayali. After the 2014 murders, which came as Peru was hosting a global environmental summit, the government promised to do more to protect remote Amazonian villages that often lack land titles from violent clashes with squatters. Guimaraes said native communities continue to face violent threats in Ucayali and that no one has been convicted for the 2014 murders. Peru s culture and interior ministries did not respond to requests for comment. The native Shipibo community of Santa Clara de Uchunya, which lives near where the farmers killed, has tried to repel oil palm growers from their lands for years, said Guimaraes.

Uganda in anti-online pornography drive seen by critics as diversion,"KAMPALA (Reuters) - Uganda is launching a drive against online pornography that critics condemn as a diversion from deeper problems of graft, unemployment and crumbling social services facing President Yoweri Museveni. The campaign is the latest salvo in a culture war between  conservatives fighting what they see as foreign moral influences promoting criminality and a more liberal, often younger population.   This is an invasion, it s Western culture,  said Simon Lokodo, a 59-year-old Catholic priest who serves as minister of ethics and integrity.  Over consumption of pornography ... the consequences are very dire,  he told Reuters this week.  The government had released 2 billion shillings ($556,000) to his office to combat online pornography. Some money would go to pornography-blocking software, he said.  Some Ugandans expressed anger at the cost of the ban, saying it served only to divert public attention from failures of President Museveni s government. Critics of Museveni, who has ruled for 31 years, say he presides over widespread corruption and human rights abuses.  Parliament is considering a removing a constitutional age cap to allow Museveni to serve longer. He is also widely considered to be grooming his son, a presidential adviser and the former commander of an elite military unit, to succeed him.  Andrew Karamagi, a rights activist and lawyer in Kampala, said he could not understand government obsession with  what people watch, who sleeps with whom, how and when , while it struggled to fund social services such as hospitals and schools. Uganda s only radiotherapy machine broke down last year and hasn t been replaced due to funding shortages. Drug shortages are common in public hospitals where and in dilapidated public schools poorly-paid teachers often don t show up for class.   The regime ... does not have the moral authority to combat pornography,  Karamagi said.  They are themselves an obscenity.   ",worldnews,"September 7, 2017 ",1
Pope says Colombia must confront inequality to secure lasting peace,"BOGOTA (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Thursday urged Colombians to shun vengeance after a bloody 50-year civil war but said leaders had to enact laws to end the  darkness  of injustice and social inequality that breeds violence. At the last event of a packed day, the Argentine pontiff said Mass for a crowd estimated by Colombian authorities at just over a million people in Bogota s sprawling Simon Bolivar Park. Under a light drizzle, he ended the day as he had begun it, urging Colombians in his homily to put their differences behind them and beware  the darkness of thirst for vengeance . Hours earlier, at the start of his first full day in the country, he had told government leaders in the courtyard of the presidential palace that all Colombians should see peace as a long-term commitment and not allow it to be weakened by partisan politics. Colombians are deeply polarized as they prepare to receive 7,000 former fighters of the FARC guerrilla group into society and aim to repair divisions after a war that killed more than 220,000 people and displaced millions over five decades. Many Colombians are furious that under the 2016 peace deal, FARC leaders accused of kidnapping and murder will avoid jail and may receive seats in congress as members of a political party. President Juan Manuel Santos, who attended both events and is the architect of the peace accord, has an approval rating of about 24 percent. In both speeches, Francis denounced the social inequality that still plagues Colombia, which has extreme poverty in some rural areas. At the morning event, he told leaders that  just laws  were needed to  resolve the structural causes of poverty that lead to exclusion and violence , calling social inequality  the root of social ills.  In the evening the leader of the world s Roman Catholics  told Colombians huddled on wet fields:  Here, as in other places, there is a thick darkness which threatens and destroys life - the darkness of injustice and social inequality.  As part of the peace agreement, the government agreed with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) to distribute more land to poor rural communities and to invest and bring development to war-torn areas. The FARC, which began as a peasant revolt in 1964, has also pledged to help subsistence farmers switch from illegal crops like coca, the raw material that makes cocaine, to food.  We want to hear the message of love and peace, so that we open our hearts and leave hatred behind,  said 54-year-old William Soacha, a clothes salesman, waiting with his family under the rain for the pope s Mass to begin. The 80-year-old pope, who showed signs of fatigue by Thursday night, has received a tumultuous welcome since his arrival on Wednesday, with his motorcade having to stop or slow down often because of crowds mobbing the  popemobile . In his speech at the presidential palace, the pope quoted from the 1982 Nobel Prize acceptance speech of Colombian writer Gabriel Garcia Marquez about life and love being the proper response to oppression. In an apparent reference to the late author s best-known work,  One Hundred Years of Solitude , he added:   There has been too much hatred and vengeance. The solitude of always being at loggerheads has been familiar for decades, and its smell has lingered for a hundred years; we do not want any type of violence whatsoever to restrict or destroy one more life,  he said. He also prayed in the colonial cathedral before a painting of Our Lady of Chiquinquira, the patron saint of overwhelmingly Catholic Colombia, before addressing a raucous crowd of young people.  He left a message in the cathedral s visitor book, writing:  I come here as a witness of peace, of the peace that God wants for Colombia. This will be possible with the efforts of all.  He will visit the cities of Villavicencio, Medellin and Cartagena before leaving for Rome on Sunday night. ",worldnews,"September 7, 2017 ",1
Victims of Colombia's civil war seek healing from pope,"VILLAVICENCIO (Reuters) - Blanca Real traveled 17 hours by canoe and bus from Colombia s eastern plains to listen to a message of peace by Pope Francis, in the hope he can heal her pain decades after she and her family survived a massacre.  Real, 44, is one of thousands of victims of Colombia s half-century of conflict that will seek blessings and guidance from the pontiff on Friday during his visit to the rural town of Villavicencio. The Argentine pope, leader of the world s Roman Catholics, is visiting Colombia with a message of national reconciliation, as the country tries to heal the wounds left by the conflict and deep polarization over a peace deal agreed last year. After visiting the capital Bogota on Wednesday and Thursday, Francis will travel to Villavicencio, where he will lead a prayer event with some 6,000 victims from around the Andean nation.  Villavicencio, a mid-sized city and the capital of the cattle ranching province of Meta in central Colombia, is ringed by vast plains which until recently were host to combat between leftist guerrilla groups and right-wing paramilitaries.  It will be comforting to get rid of this pain that we ve suffered for so many years,  said Real, who survived a 1998 paramilitary massacre in Puerto Alvira, Meta province and was later displaced from her farm by rebels from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). Paramilitary groups, which officially demobilized back in 2006 but remain active across Colombia, were formed in the 1990s as private security forces to protect wealthy cattle ranchers and landowners from the FARC.  But they soon morphed into cruel drug-trafficking armies that massacred communities as they battled the FARC for territory.    If I don t forgive and take away the pain I have in my heart, I will never be able to be happy,  said Real, who lost friends among the 18 killed in the massacre. A small group of victims and perpetrators - including civilians, former guerrillas and soldiers - are scheduled to speak at the event. Violence between the rebels, paramilitaries and armed forces has killed more than 220,000 people and displaced millions more. Other victims said that, despite the papal visit, there remained challenges.  For my wounds to heal, to forgive these people, they need to stop hurting me, but they continue to do things in my area,  said Ana Delia Cundumi, head of a victims  group from the southeastern jungle province of Guaviare.  We are still seeing blood spilled in our land because of these people,  she said.  We are still threatened.   Francis has staunchly supported the peace deal between the government and the FARC, but delayed his visit to Colombia until implementation was in full swing. The FARC has now disarmed and converted into a political party. Remaining rebel group the National Liberation Army (ELN), founded by radical Roman Catholic priests in 1964, is in peace talks with the government. The two sides announced a bilateral ceasefire this week, set to last at least into January 2018.   ",worldnews,"September 8, 2017 ",1
Venezuelan bishops tell pope of 'truly desperate' situation,"BOGOTA (Reuters) - Venezuela s Roman Catholic Church leaders said on Thursday they would tell Pope Francis of the  truly desperate  humanitarian crisis in their country at a meeting they hoped would throw a spotlight on problems caused by political deadlock. The Argentine pontiff is visiting Colombia and had asked bishops from neighboring Venezuela to meet with him and brief him on the situation. The short meeting took place after the pope s Mass on Thursday night. Cardinal Jorge Urosa Savino, the archbishop of Caracas, told reporters ahead of the meeting that his country was mired in  a truly desperate situation. There are people who eat garbage and there are people who die because there is no medicine.   We want to remind the pope of this again ... because the government is doing everything possible to establish a state system, totalitarian and Marxist,  Urosa said. On Wednesday, Francis told reporters he hoped Venezuela could find stability.  Venezuela has been convulsed by months of near-daily demonstrations against leftist President Nicolas Maduro, who critics say has plunged the oil-rich country into the worst economic crisis in its history and is turning it into a dictatorship. Maduro has said that he is the victim of an  armed insurrection  and an  economic war  by U.S.-backed opponents seeking to gain control of the OPEC member s oil reserves. World bodies and foreign governments have expressed concern about the shortage of food and medicine in Venezuela and called for political dialogue between Maduro and the opposition. Church leaders in Venezuela have made a series of highly critical speeches since late last year. The Vatican mediated in talks between the government and opposition in 2016 that ultimately broke down. Venezuela s crisis has also sparked an increase in border crossings to Colombia, which is struggling to supply social services for the migrants.   This meeting is a real gift that the pope is giving to all of the Venezuelan people through the bishops who are here,  said the archbishop of Merida, Cardinal Baltazar Porras Cardozo.

Trump: 'Sad day' for North Korea if U.S. takes military action,"WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he would prefer not to use military action against North Korea to counter its nuclear and missile threat but that if he did it would be a  very sad day  for the leadership in Pyongyang. Trump again pointedly declined to rule out a U.S. military response following North Korea s sixth and most powerful nuclear test as his administration seeks increased economic sanctions, saying Pyongyang was  behaving badly and it s got to stop.   Military action would certainly be an option. Is it inevitable? Nothing is inevitable,  Trump said during a news conference. I would prefer not going the route of the military,  Trump said.  If we do use it on North Korea, it will be a very sad day for North Korea.  Even as Trump has insisted that now is not the time to talk to North Korea, senior members of his administration have made clear that the door to a diplomatic solution remains open, especially given the U.S. assessment that any pre-emptive strike would unleash massive North Korean retaliation. While Trump talked tough on North Korea, China agreed on Thursday that the United Nations should take more action against Pyongyang but also kept pushing for dialogue to help resolve the standoff. North Korea, which is pursuing its nuclear and missile program in defiance of international condemnation, said it would respond to any new U.N. sanctions and U.S. pressure with  powerful counter measures , accusing the United States of aiming for war. The United States wants the U.N. Security Council to impose an oil embargo on North Korea, ban its exports of textiles and the hiring of North Korean laborers abroad, and to subject leader Kim Jong Un to an asset freeze and travel ban, according to a draft resolution seen by Reuters on Wednesday. Pressure from Washington has ratcheted up since North Korea conducted its nuclear test on Sunday. That test, along with a series of missile launches, showed it was close to achieving its goal of developing a powerful nuclear weapon that could reach the United States.  Given the new developments on the Korean peninsula, China agrees that the U.N. Security Council should make a further response and take necessary measures,  Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters.  Any new actions taken by the international community against the DPRK should serve the purpose of curbing the DPRK s nuclear and missile programs, while at the same time be conducive to restarting dialogue and consultation,  he said, referring to North Korea by the initials of its official name, the Democratic People s Republic of Korea. China is by far North Korea s biggest trading partner, accounting for 92 percent of two-way trade last year. It also provides hundreds of thousands of tonnes of oil and fuel to the impoverished regime. Trump has urged China to do more to rein in its neighbor, which was typically defiant on Thursday.  We will respond to the barbaric plotting around sanctions and pressure by the United States with powerful counter measures of our own,  North Korea said in a statement by its delegation to an economic forum in Vladivostok, in Russia s Far East. A U.N. Security Council diplomat said the U.S. draft was  the  cutting room floor  resolution, it s everything  and that Russia had questioned what leverage it would leave the Security Council if North Korea continued to conduct nuclear and ballistic missile testing.    Russia and China are not on board with the content of the resolution,  the diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The United States has said it wants the draft resolution to be voted on Monday. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and South Korean President Moon Jae-in spoke in Vladivostok and agreed to try to persuade China and Russia to cut off oil to North Korea as much as possible, according to South Korean officials. North Korea accused South Korea and Japan of  dirty politics.  North Korea says it needs its weapons to protect itself from U.S. aggression. South Korea and the United States are technically still at war with North Korea after the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce, not a peace treaty. While successive U.S. administrations have insisted they will never recognize North Korea as a nuclear-armed state,  Trump declined to answer a question on Thursday on whether he would accept a situation where Pyongyang would be deterred and contained from using its nuclear arsenal, saying he did not want to disclose his negotiating strategy. A senior U.S. official said afterwards it was unclear whether the Cold War-era deterrence model that Washington used with the Soviet Union could be applied to a rogue state like North Korea. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there was grave risk that North Korea could  miscalculate  the U.S. response to its weapons testing and warned Pyongyang not to under-estimate Washington s resolve. South Korea installed the four remaining launchers of a U.S. anti-missile Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system on a former golf course south of its capital, Seoul, early on Thursday. Two launchers had already been deployed. More than 30 people were hurt when about 8,000 police broke up a blockade near the site by about 300 villagers and members of civic groups opposed to the deployment, fire officials said. The deployment has drawn strong objections from China, which believes the system s radar could be used to look deeply into its territory and will upset the regional security balance. Mexico on Thursday said it had declared the North Korean ambassador persona non grata in protest at the country s nuclear tests and gave him 72 hours to leave the country, an unusually firm step that moved it closely into line with Washington.  North Korea s nuclear activity is a serious risk for international peace and security and represents a growing threat to nations in the region, including fundamental allies of Mexico like Japan and South Korea,  the Mexican government said.  However, an official at the Mexican foreign ministry noted that President Enrique Pena Nieto s government was not breaking diplomatic ties with North Korea. ",worldnews,"September 7, 2017 ",1
Mexico expels North Korean ambassador over nuclear tests,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The Mexican government on Thursday said it had declared the North Korean ambassador to Mexico persona non grata in protest at the country s nuclear tests, an unusually firm step that moved it closely into line with Washington. In a statement, the government said it had given Kim Hyong Gil 72 hours to leave Mexico in order to express its  absolute rejection  of North Korea s recent nuclear activity, describing it as a grave threat to the region and the world. Mexico has traditionally sought to steer clear of diplomatic ructions, but in the past few months it has adopted robust language to condemn the governments of Venezuela and North Korea as they descended into increasing international isolation. Facing a rocky relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump due to his threats to tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Mexico has backed him diplomatically on issues that imply no great political cost for the government.  North Korea s nuclear activity is a serious risk for international peace and security and represents a growing threat to nations in the region, including fundamental allies of Mexico like Japan and South Korea,  the Mexican government said. Mexico s step follows a tide of international condemnation of North Korea for repeated missile launches in recent weeks that intensified again following a nuclear test on Sunday. An official at the Mexican foreign ministry noted, however, that President Enrique Pena Nieto s government was not breaking diplomatic ties with North Korea. ",worldnews,"September 7, 2017 ",1
"Trump may have to settle for deterring, not disarming, North Korea","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump, like his predecessors, may find that neither negotiations nor economic and military pressure can force North Korea to abandon its nuclear program, and that the United States has no choice but to try to contain it and deter North Korean leader Kim Jong Un from ever using a nuclear weapon. North Korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test on Sept. 2, describing it as an advanced hydrogen bomb for a long-range missile, a dramatic escalation of its stand-off with the United States and its allies. U.S. officials declined to discuss operational planning, but acknowledge that no existing plan for a preemptive strike could promise to prevent a brutal counterattack by North Korea, which has thousands of artillery pieces and rockets trained on Seoul. In an implicit recognition that the military options against the North are unpalatable at best and pyrrhic at worst, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis last week told reporters:  We are never out of diplomatic solutions.  U.S. and Asian officials believe it is necessary to try negotiations and more economic pressure but concede these are unlikely to curb, let alone eliminate, the nuclear and missile programs that North Korean considers essential to its survival. That leaves Washington and its allies in South Korea, Japan and elsewhere with an unwelcome question: Is there any way to live with a nuclear-armed North Korea, one that is contained and deterred from using its nuclear weaponry? Trump declined to answer that question at a news conference on Thursday, saying he would not disclose his negotiating strategy publicly and adding it would be a  very sad day  for North Korea if the U.S. military settles the matter.   Military action would certainly be an option. Is it inevitable? Nothing is inevitable,  Trump said.  Still, a senior Trump administration official said it is unclear whether the Cold War-era deterrence model that Washington used with the Soviet Union could be applied to a rogue state like North Korea, adding:  I don t think the president wants to take that chance.   We are very concerned that North Korea might not be able to be deterred,  the official said, speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity shortly after Trump s remarks. Among the U.S. options to strengthen its deterrent is the long-planned modernization of America s aging nuclear forces that would assure that North Korea would be destroyed if it fired a nuclear-tipped missile at the United States, a U.S. military base, Japan, or South Korea. Another is stepped-up investment in U.S. missile defenses, particularly testing, research and development of technologies that could defeat a significant number of incoming missiles. Both steps would need to avoid triggering new arms races with Beijing and Moscow, experts say. Another factor weighing on Pentagon planners is their readiness for a major conventional conflict after 16 years of war in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and elsewhere. There has been no sign the White House, which has been cool to the idea of talks and hopes pressure can change the North s calculus, is ready to settle for a containment strategy. Despite pessimism about talks, a U.S. official speaking on condition of anonymity said there was a chance that economic pressure, especially from China, combined with an agreement to negotiate could convince Pyongyang to limit its nuclear arsenal or even sign the 1996 Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty.  Signing the CTBT would given the North tacit admission to the nuclear club but end its testing program,  the official said.  That, along with assured destruction, might be the best that could be done.  The remaining question, however, is whether Trump would be willing to settle for that.  Discipline and steadiness are not words one usually uses in a sentence that also has the name Donald Trump,  said Robert Einhorn, a former State Department official who negotiated with North Korea and is now at the Brookings Institution think tank.  Would he over time recognize that he may have no choice?  Frank Jannuzi, president of the Mansfield Foundation, which promotes U.S.-Asia relations, is more optimistic.  Does he have the patience to manage a difficult process of deterrence and containment against the (North) rather than doing something impulsive? I think so,  he said.  Some of his deals have taken years to come to fruition.  ",worldnews,"September 7, 2017 ",1
EPA chief says ready to further relax fuel standards due to hurricanes,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is preparing for Hurricane Irma s landfall on the U.S. East Coast by securing vulnerable toxic waste sites and easing gasoline standards to ensure steady fuel supplies, its chief told Reuters on Thursday. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt declined to say whether he believed claims by scientists that the second powerful storm to affect the United States in two weeks may have a link to warmer air and water temperatures resulting from climate change.  The most we can do is help people in these areas by monitoring drinking water and respond to real and tangible issues,  he said in a brief telephone interview. Hurricane Irma is expected to make landfall in Florida as early as Friday after slamming Caribbean islands with 185 mph winds, only days after Hurricane Harvey triggered record flooding in Texas that killed scores of people. The EPA said has issued waivers on certain federal requirements for the sale, production and blending of gasoline to avoid supply shortfalls in the aftermath of Harvey and as Hurricane Irma approaches Florida. Pruitt said he spoke with Florida Governor Rick Scott about potentially issuing more waivers on gasoline requirements if the need arises after Irma.  EPA will grant additional waivers if requested,  he said. He said the agency is also evaluating 80 Superfund toxic waste sites from Florida to North Carolina to identify those at risk of flooding. The EPA has yet to finish assessing the impact of Harvey on Texas Superfund sites - heavily contaminated former industrial zones - amid widespread flooding. On Saturday, the agency said 13 sites were flooded or damaged, but the full impact on surrounding areas was not immediately clear. Pruitt said the agency is also continuing to seek additional information about explosions last week at French chemical company Arkema s  flooded plant in Crosby, Texas, which sickened more than a dozen law enforcement personnel and prompted an evacuation of the surrounding area.

Trump offers to mediate talks on Qatar crisis,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday said he would be willing to step in and mediate the worst dispute in decades among the U.S.-allied Arab states and Qatar, and said he thinks a deal could come quickly.  If I can help mediate between Qatar and, in particular, the UAE and Saudi Arabia, I would be willing to do so, and I think you would have a deal worked out very quickly,  Trump said at a joint news conference with Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain cut diplomatic and trade links with Qatar on June 5, suspending air and shipping routes with the world s biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas, which is home to the region s biggest U.S. military base. The nations say Doha supports regional foe Iran and Islamists, charges Qatar s leaders deny. Kuwait has been trying to mediate the dispute.  What is important is that we have stopped any military action,  Sheikh Sabah said. While both sides in the dispute have ruled out the use of armed force, some ordinary Qataris have said they worry about the possibility of military action, given the ferocity of the criticism their country has received from media in the four Arab states. Sheikh Sabah said he had received a letter from Qatar that expressed willingness to discuss a list of 13 demands from its neighbors.  We know that not all of these 13 demands are acceptable,  Sheikh Sabah said, referring specifically to issues that affected Qatari sovereignty.  A great part of them will be resolved,  he said. For its part, Doha said Trump had called Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani to discuss mediation efforts. Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani told Al Jazeera TV that any mediation had to come  without conditions , reiterating that Doha would not negotiate while transport links with neighbors remained cut. The Arab powers responded with a joint statement accusing Qatar of putting preconditions on negotiations which it said showed a lack of seriousness in resolving the dispute. The four countries reiterated an accusation that Qatar continued to finance terrorism and interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. Qatari officials have repeatedly said the demands are so draconian that they suspect the four countries never seriously intended to negotiate them, and were instead seeing to hobble Doha s sovereignty. At the same time, they have said Qatar is interested in negotiating a fair and just solution to  any legitimate issues  of concern to fellow Gulf Cooperation Council member states. The joint statement praised what the countries called Trump s firm assertion that the only way to resolve the crisis was by stopping the support and financing of terrorism  and his unwillingness to resolve the crisis unless this is achieved . They expressed regret about the Kuwaiti emir s comment about stopping military intervention.  The military option was not and will not be (used) in any circumstance,  the statement said.

Togo forces fire tear gas to disperse Gnassingbe opponents,"LOME (Reuters) - Togo security forces fired tear gas at hundreds of anti-government protesters carrying out a late night sit-in at an intersection in central Lome as part of a bid to end the 50-year-old Gnassingbe family dynasty, witnesses said on Thursday. The move to disperse the crowds comes after two days of mass country-wide protests involving tens of thousands of people that have amounted to the biggest challenge to Faure Gnassingbe s rule since he succeeded his late father 12 years ago. In the past, security forces have violently suppressed protests, killing at least two people during an opposition march in August and hundreds after the contested election in which Gnassingbe took power in 2005. But up until late on Thursday, police officers armed with  batons had watched passively at protesters wearing the red, pink and orange T-shirts of the opposition, who danced and blew whistles as they wound through the streets of the capital Lome. It was not immediately clear how the opposition would respond to the security forces  intervention with tear gas late on Thursday. The head of the main ANC opposition party, Jean-Pierre Fabre, had earlier pledged to remain seated on the tarmac of the Dekon crossroads until Gnassingbe left power.  We want the end of this 50-year-old Gnassingbe regime. Enough is enough,  Kodjo Amana, a 42-year-old baker, shouted over a chanting crowd earlier in the day. The protests in the West African country of 8 million people have proceeded despite widespread reports of network outages confirmed by non-governmental organization Internet Without Borders. Other African incumbents in Gabon and Cameroon have used network cuts to control criticism and suppress protests at sensitive times. Residents said that text messages had also been blocked on Thursday. The communications minister could not be reached for comment, although another minister said earlier this week that the cuts had been carried out for security reasons.    The president s father Gnassingbe Eyadema seized power in a coup in 1967, a few years after the territory known as  French Togoland  that was once in German hands became independent from colonial power France. The current president this week sought to appease opponents by tabling a draft bill to reform the constitution and reintroduce a two-term limit that his father scrapped in 2002. But opposition leaders are skeptical about the implementation of the reforms that the government has stalled on for more than a decade and Prime Minister Komi Selom Klassou confirmed on Thursday that the term limits would not apply retroactively. That could mean that Gnassingbe, 51 and currently in his third term, could remains in power for two more mandates from the next election, until 2030. Gnassingbe sent a Tweet from his official account on Thursday, saying that he had met with the U.N. Special Representative for West Africa and the Sahel, Mohammed Ibn Chambas, on the subject of reforms. A spokesman for the latter confirmed the meeting without elaborating on its content. State TV said Thursday evening that parliament, which still needs to approve the bill, will meet for an emergency session on September 12. However, if the protests resume, analysts say Gnassingbe may find himself isolated amid growing criticism of autocratic rule in West Africa.  The president s position is very fragile and we do not think his peers in ECOWAS or his friends in Europe will help him if things get ugly,  said the head of research at NKC African Economics, Francois Conradie. Togo, a regional financial hub that aspires to be an African Singapore, is at odds with West African neighbors which mostly have laws restricting presidential mandates. The government, along with Gambia s, voted in 2015 against introducing them across the 15 members of the ECOWAS regional body which Gnassingbe currently chairs. Since then, Gambia s longtime leader Yahya Jammeh has been voted out of power. African rulers, notably in Rwanda, Burundi and Burkina Faso, have moved to drop term limits in recent years in order to remain in power. In some cases this has sparked strong opposition that has led to violent unrest; in others, leaders have been driven from power, as happened in Burkina Faso. ",worldnews,"September 7, 2017 ",1
Germany's FDP party leader 'can't imagine' three-way coalition,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Christian Lindner, leader of Germany s pro-business Free Democratic Party (FDP), distanced himself from a possible three-way coalition with Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives and the pro-environment Greens after the Sept. 24 election. Lindner told German magazine Focus in an interview published Friday that he saw big hurdles to reaching agreement with the Greens on immigration and energy policies, reducing the prospects for a so-called Jamaica coalition of the conservatives, Greens and the FDP.   In the meantime, I can t imagine a Jamaica coalition,  Lindner told the magazine.  Merkel s conservatives were at 37 percent in the latest Infratest dimap poll, versus 21 percent for the Social Democrats (SPD), their lowest reading since early January. The anti-immigration, euro-hostile AfD came in unchanged at 11 percent, making it the third-strongest political force, followed by the radical Left party with 10 percent and the FDP at 9 percent, while the Greens scored 8 percent. The fractured political landscape could make it hard to form a viable alliance other than the current grand coalition between Merkel s CDU/CSU and the SPD.  Political experts say they are skeptical that the other possible option - the Jamaica coalition - could work, given significant differences between the parties and the fact that such an alliance has never been tested on the federal level. Lindner s comments to the magazine underscored the problems facing such a coalition.  Meanwhile, Sahra Wagenknecht, head of the radical Left party, signaled her willingness to compromise with the SPD to permit the possibility of a so-called  red, red, green  coalition among the SPD, Left and Greens.  Of course there can be compromises,  Wagenknecht told the RND chain of newspapers, citing labor law and inheritance taxes as possible areas where the Left party would be willing to make concessions.

Florida cites complaints over Chevron gas prices as shortages mount,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi said on Thursday her office had received 45 complaints of inflated prices at Chevron Corp branded gasoline stations in the southern part of the state, as shortages worsened ahead of Hurricane Irma s expected U.S. landfall this weekend. More than 1,800 gas stations - more than a quarter of the state s total - were without fuel late Thursday, up from 1,200 Wednesday, ahead of Irma, which is battering the Caribbean with winds at speeds of around 185 miles per hour (300 km per hour). The storm is expected to hit Florida on Sunday.  Gasoline prices in Florida have risen sharply in the last week, with the average cost of a regular gallon of gas hitting $2.725 on Thursday, according to motorists advocacy group AAA. Suppliers and terminal operators said demand has soared as motorists in coastal areas flee. Shortages were more acute in southern Florida, according to Gasbuddy.com. More than 40 percent of stations in the Miami-Fort Lauderdale area were without fuel and around 30 percent were empty in the West Palm Beach-Fort Pierce areas, said Patrick DeHaan of Gasbuddy.com.  So Chevron, if you re watching me right now, you need to call us and tell us why your prices are inflated in south Florida,  Bondi said on Fox News.  Chevron has said several times this week it has no tolerance for price gouging at its stations. No retail outlets in Florida are directly owned by the company. The company reiterated that on Thursday, saying consumers should report price gouging to Bondi s office.   Our fuel supply agreements with independently owned Chevron and Texaco stations in the state and elsewhere require them to comply with all laws,  spokesman Braden Reddall said in a statement.   Port Everglades, the major point of fuel delivery for south Florida, is set to close Friday evening. At Tampa Bay, three ships made deliveries Thursday morning, unloading 1.2 million gallons each, said Samara Sodos, a spokeswoman for the port, adding that the port received five deliveries on Wednesday. One terminal operator, speaking on condition of anonymity, said his terminal typically loaded 25,000 to 30,000 barrels a day onto trucks every day, and expected to hit 40,000 to 45,000 on Thursday.  Concerns about shortages spread beyond Florida as Caribbean fuel terminals closed and residents began evacuating other coastal U.S. states, including Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina. Georgia said on Thursday it will close its ports Friday night because of Irma. ",worldnews,"September 7, 2017 ",1
Egypt blocks Human Rights Watch website amid widespread media blockade,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt has blocked the website of Human Rights Watch just one day after the organization released a report on systematic torture in the country s jails. Reuters attempted to access the website late on Thursday but was unsuccessful.   Egyptian authorities keep insisting that any incidents of torture are isolated crimes by bad officers acting alone, but the Human Rights Watch report proves otherwise,  Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, said on Thursday.  The report titled  We Do Unreasonable Things Here , based on the accounts of 19 former detainees and the family of another, claimed Egyptian authorities used arbitrary arrests, enforced disappearances, and torture.   Rather than address the torture crisis in Egypt, the authorities have blocked access to a report that documents what many Egyptians and others living there already know.  Egypt s foreign ministry lambasted the report in a statement on Wednesday, saying it defamed the country and ignored progress made on human rights in recent years.  The report ... is a new episode in a series of deliberate defamation by such organization, whose politicized agenda and biases are well known and reflect the interests of the entities and countries sponsoring it,  said Foreign Ministry spokesman Ahmed Abu Zeid.  Egypt first blocked access to a number of news websites including Al Jazeera and Huffington Post Arabic in May after similar actions by its Gulf allies Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. But since, hundreds of other news sites and blogs have been wiped from Egyptian screens with the most recent count according to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression, a non-government organization tracking the affected sites through software that monitors outages, at 424. Journalists see the campaign against them as a step toward banning all but the most state-aligned media, effectively reversing the private media boom that flourished in the final decade of former president Hosni Mubarak s rule and which they say helped push him from power in 2011. The government has offered no comment on the reason behind the blockages. ",worldnews,"September 7, 2017 ",1
Hurricane Irma worsens Latin America's fuel supply crunch,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Monster Hurricane Irma has shut down oil terminals across the northern Caribbean, worsening a fuel supply crunch in Latin America which is struggling to meet demand since Hurricane Harvey disrupted shipments from the U.S. Gulf Coast last month. Latin America had been scrambling for almost two weeks to find oil cargoes because of Harvey, which caused massive flooding in Texas and Louisiana, shutting down ports, refineries and production platforms. Irma, which is being followed by two hurricanes in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, was affecting Caribbean refineries, terminals and storage facilities. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Irma is the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean and one of the five most forceful storms to hit the Atlantic basin in 82 years. The Caribbean has the capacity to store more than 100 million barrels, which is crucial for those nations because of limited ability to refine crude, and also as supply for South American nations including Brazil, Venezuela and Colombia.  Several oil trading firms had moved a portion of their U.S. fuel inventories to the Caribbean ahead of Harvey so they could keep selling cargoes to Latin America, traders from two companies told Reuters.  Those barrels are now locked in terminals in St. Eustatius, Puerto Rico, the Bahamas and the U.S. Virgin Islands, as Irma, a Category 5 storm with winds of 185 mph (295 kph), was expected to hammer the region for several more days as it moves west-northwest.   Irma is arriving at a bad moment. Not all oil storage facilities in the Caribbean have closed, but vessel traffic is difficult in the middle of the storm. It will get worse before getting any better,  said a trader from an oil firm that rents tanks in St. Croix. Buckeye Partners LP (BPL.N), the largest owner of oil storage facilities in the Caribbean with 41.1 million barrels of capacity, shut its Puerto Rico terminal on Wednesday. It also plans to close BORCO, its largest terminal in the Bahamas that can store up to 26.2 million barrels, by the end of the day on Thursday, a source familiar with terminal operations said. Also in the Bahamas, Statoil s (STL.OL) South Riding Point terminal was open on Thursday, the company said. But traders added that plans to halt marine operations would likely start later on Thursday.  NuStar Energy LP (NS.N), which on Tuesday closed its 13-million-barrel Statia terminal on the small island of St. Eustatius, said several tanks and other equipment were damaged in the hurricane, so no restart date has been set. Firms using tanks in closed terminals in St. Eustatius, St. Croix, Bahamas and Puerto Rico include traders Vitol, Glencore (GLEN.L), Novum Energy and Freepoint Commodities, and oil firms PDVSA from Venezuela, China s Sinopec (600028.SS), Russia s Rosneft (ROSN.MM) and Lukoil (LKOH.MM), U.S. Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L), according to the sources and Reuters vessel data. As traders worry about Irma s impact on inventories, others see longer-term potential consequences from this or other storms, as both Jose, now in the Atlantic Ocean, and Katia, off Mexico s coast, continued moving on Thursday after strengthening to hurricanes.  If a hurricane with Irma s intensity strikes a terminal tank farm, the force of the storm at the eye wall will have destructive impact on the storage tanks, which are typically not designed to withstand those forces,  said Ernie Barsamian, chief executive officer of the Tank Tiger, a terminal storage clearinghouse. Mexican state-run oil company Pemex said on Thursday that its facilities have not been hit so far, but it keeps monitoring Katia s path to decide if further action was needed. Fuel importers such as Mexico and Brazil have secured supplies in recent days from the U.S. East Coast, Europe and the Caribbean, according to traders, regulators and oil firms. But those options are running short amid growing regional demand and limited offers from Texas refiners as ports have been slow to reopen for large vessels. The only option that traders see for desperate buyers in the coming days is to divert fuel cargoes from countries such as Brazil, which bought diesel in excess, or Venezuela, which cannot pay for all the fuel floating near its ports because of the country s fiscal problems. At least three fuel cargoes have been diverted from Venezuela since last week, according to Reuters data. All of them have changed their destinations to Panama, likely to pass the Canal before discharging in South America.   Companies from Uruguay, Ecuador, Peru and Costa Rica are seeking spot cargoes of diesel, gasoline, aviation gasoline, asphalt and components on the open market, but few providers are willing to participate, traders said.  I cannot use my inventories in the Caribbean at this moment to supply third parties,  one trader said. Dominican Republic refining firm Refidomsa, which declared force majeure last week on deliveries, has been rationing fuel from its 34,000-barrel-per-day Haina refinery, giving it enough inventory for 20 days.  Most Caribbean refineries are dependent on U.S. light oil since large regional crude producers such as Mexico and Venezuela have cut exports to some neighbors. ",worldnews,"September 7, 2017 ",1
Florida nuclear plants to shut ahead of Hurricane Irma,"(Reuters) - Electricity generator Florida Power & Light said on Thursday it will shut its two nuclear power plants before Irma comes ashore as a very powerful hurricane. FPL, a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Inc, generates enough power for about 1.9 million homes at the Turkey Point and St. Lucie plants, which are both along Florida s Atlantic Coast, about 20 feet (6 meters) above sea level.  We will safely shut down these nuclear plants well in advance of hurricane-force winds, and we ve finalized plans for that shutdown,  FPL spokesman Rob Gould told a news conference. The company will adjust the plans as necessary,  depending upon the path of the storm,  Gould said. He would not comment on exactly when the plants would be taken down or how long they could be shut.  The Energy Department said late on Thursday that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission expects Turkey Point to close on Friday evening and St. Lucie to shut about 12 hours later, depending on the storm s path.  Irma, a Category 5 hurricane at the top of the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, is packing winds of up to 180 miles (290 km) per hour. Present forecast models are showing it hitting the tip of Florida on Sunday morning and raking the whole state as it moves north over the peninsula the following couple of days, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said. FPL says it has invested $3 billion to protect its electricity grid since 2005, when the last major hurricane damaged power facilities in Florida. But no grid is hurricane-proof, and if Irma stays on its path, many FPL customers will lose power, Gould said. The company, which serves about 10 million power customers across nearly half of Florida, may have to physically rebuild parts of the power system, Gould said. This could take weeks or longer  if Irma s worst fears are realized,  he said.   Gould said FPL might have to turn off some substations ahead of any major flooding, a technique that could help the company restore power faster once any floodwaters recede, rather than keeping them on and allowing the storm to damage them. FPL s nuclear plants are protected by thick concrete and reinforced steel and like many plants around the world were bolstered further after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan, Gould said.  A series of explosions and meltdowns occurred at the Fukushima nuclear plant after a massive earthquake unleashed a powerful tsunami that shut the facility s cooling systems and led to meltdowns.

German citizen on trial in Turkey on political charges: media,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A 49-year-old woman has become the first German citizen to stand trial in Turkey on allegations of supporting U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkish authorities blame for a failed military coup last year, German media reported. Broadcasters WDR and NDR and daily newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung said the trial began in the southern Turkish city of Karaman on Thursday and cited the indictment as saying the woman faced several years in prison. They said the woman, whom they did not name, was born in Turkey but had lived in southwest Germany for more than 20 years and had been a German citizen for 15. She had been arrested in Turkey in August 2016 and released in September after pressure from Germany s foreign ministry but was not allowed to leave the country, they said. Earlier on Thursday, the ministry confirmed that another German citizen detained in southern Turkey last week had been released but banned from travel. Turkey s Dogan news agency said the man and his German partner had been detained while on holiday in Antalya. The partner had already been freed after questioning. Dogan said the couple had also been held as part of investigations into Gulen and Kurdish militants in Syria. Gulen has denied any link to the failed coup. Thursday s release means 10 German citizens remain in Turkish detention on political charges. The arrests have raised tensions between Ankara and Berlin and led Chancellor Angela Merkel to call for a review of relations and of Turkey s EU accession talks. The detainees include dual German-Turkish citizen Deniz Yucel, who has been held for more than 200 days. ",worldnews,"September 7, 2017 ",1
"Home Depot, Lowe's ship emergency material to Florida ahead of hurricane","CHICAGO (Reuters) - Home improvement retailers Home Depot Inc and Lowe s Inc said on Wednesday they have started shipping emergency material to Florida in anticipation of Hurricane Irma, even as they continue recovery efforts after Hurricane Harvey in Texas. Irma, which hit the Caribbean island of St. Martin on Wednesday, is expected to make landfall in Florida during the weekend but its precise trajectory remained uncertain. Irma could become the second powerful storm to thrash the U.S. mainland after Harvey killed more than 60 people and caused as much as $180 billion in damage after hitting Texas late last month.  This is unusual because we are now juggling two different storms in two different phases. One is approaching while the other market is in the recovery phase,  Home Depot spokesman Matthew Harrigan told Reuters. Home Depot is following the  same script  preparing for Irma as it did for Harvey. The retailer s merchandising and supply chain teams have previously dealt with different weather-related disasters at once, Harrigan said without giving specific examples. Before Harvey hit Texas, the world s largest hardware and home improvement chain activated its disaster-response plan, asked managers to freeze prices in stores around the region and move storm related merchandise to the front of the store. It followed a plan honed over many hurricane seasons to minimize disruptions, deliver essential material to affected areas and capitalize on a surge in demand for products once repairs begin. Home Depot said it takes up to two months to open stores that are hit hard by a hurricane. Stores that are minimally impacted are usually opened within a few days. Both Home Depot and Lowe s had activated a hurricane command center during Harvey that is now continuing to monitor the path of Irma and mobilizing resources such as supplies. Home Depot said it has despatched 300 truckloads to Florida so far. Rival Lowe s said it has sent 400 truckloads of hurricane prep material including flashlights, batteries and weather radios to Florida. Analysts have said investments in logistics and supply chain by home improvement chains during a weather-related disaster typically brings about 10 to 15 times more in sales. Shares of both Home Depot and Lowe s traded up nearly 2 percent on Wednesday morning. ",worldnews,"September 6, 2017 ",1
FEMA may run out of funds on Friday: senators,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency will run out of disaster assistance funding on Friday unless Congress approves more money, two Florida senators warned on Thursday. As Hurricane Irma barrels through the Caribbean on its way to an expected landfall on Florida on Sunday, the Senate approved a measure 80 votes to 17 to more than double funding to $15.25 billion to FEMA and local block grants to handle natural disasters. The House is expected to approve the measure later this week. It already approved $7.85 billion on Wednesday.  FEMA is stretched, and, of all things, FEMA runs out of money unless we act by tomorrow,  Democrat Senator Bill Nelson said in a speech on Thursday, following a letter he wrote with Republican Senator Marco Rubio to congressional leaders warning that more funds were needed. The bill also extends the National Flood Insurance Program through Dec. 8 that was set to expire on Sept. 30. The government-subsidized insurance program helps homeowners in flood-prone areas receive coverage. It is nearly $25 billion in debt and members of both parties want to reform it. FEMA declined on Thursday to say how much remained in its Disaster Relief Fund, which had just over $1 billion on hand as of Tuesday, less than half the $2.1 billion it had last week. The agency has received a record number of disaster assistance requests from victims of Hurricane Harvey.  We re not going to let money get in the way of saving lives,  FEMA director Brock Long told broadcaster CBS on Wednesday.  Congress knows what they need to do.  David Lapan, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees FEMA, also declined to say on Thursday when the fund would be depleted, but said it would not be long without congressional action. On Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump approved a major disaster declaration for the U.S. Virgin Islands, which makes residents eligible for FEMA and other government grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs. In response to Irma, FEMA said staff had been deployed to the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico and more than 1,000 personnel were ready to respond in Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina and Georgia. Provisions include millions of liters of water, meals, medical equipment and generators. ",worldnews,"September 7, 2017 ",1

Gbagbo allies behind attacks in Ivory Coast: interior minister,"ABIDJAN (Reuters) - A group of allies of Ivory Coast s former president Laurent Gbagbo, including at least one living in exile in neighboring Ghana, are behind a wave of attacks on security installations this year, the interior minister said on Thursday. Thirty-five people, a number of them soldiers, have been arrested for involvement in the violence, according to a statement released by Sidiki Diakite following a meeting of the National Security Council. Francophone West Africa s biggest economy has been shaken by army mutinies, violent protests by former rebels and a spate of attacks on prisons and police stations this year.  The attacks have raised fears over its long-term stability, more than six years after a prolonged crisis ended in a civil war that killed more than 3,000, when Gbagbo refused to cede a 2010 election to current President Alassane Ouattara.   Most of the people were already implicated in similar attacks around 2012 to 2014,  Diakite said.  Arrested and imprisoned, they were freed in the spirit of political dialogue and reconciliation.   Previously, much of this year s violence has been blamed on disgruntled former members of the rebel group that helped Ouattara dislodge Gbagbo, but former fighters loyal to Gbagbo have been blamed for attacks in the past, including several that killed 10 soldiers in the commercial capital Abidjan in 2012 and other deadly attacks near the Liberian border in 2014. Gbagbo was captured in April 2011 and is on trial at the International Criminal Court on war crimes charges, but many of his allies have been pardoned.  It is clear that the clemency offered them with a view to peace and reconciliation was not understood by them, and so they continue to pose a threat,  the minister said. Ghanaian government officials were not immediately available to comment on the allegations. Ivory Coast has accused Accra in the past of not doing enough to track down Gbagbo supporters. Ouattara has won praise for helping Ivory Coast recover from a decade of crisis to become Africa s fastest growing economy, but thousands of weapons left over from the war are still in circulation and the army is crippled by internal divisions. If Gbagbo s allies are behind recent attacks, Ivory Coast faces the prospect of instability from both them and the rebels they fought as it approaches what is likely to be a hotly contested election to choose Ouattara s successor in 2020.

Israel hits Syrian site said to be linked to chemical weapons,"BEIRUT/JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel attacked a military site in Syria s Hama province early on Thursday, the Syrian army said, and a war monitoring group said the target could be linked to chemical weapons production.  The air strike killed two soldiers and caused damage near the town of Masyaf, an army statement said. It warned of the  dangerous repercussions of this aggressive action to the security and stability of the region .  The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the war, said the attack was on a facility of the Scientific Studies and Research Centre, an agency which the United States describes as Syria s chemical weapons manufacturer. It came the morning after U.N. investigators said the Syrian government was responsible for a sarin poison gas attack in April.  Syria s government denies using chemical arms. In 2013 it promised to surrender its chemical weapons, which it says it has done.  The Observatory said strikes also hit a military camp next to the center that was used to store ground-to-ground rockets and where personnel of Iran and its ally, the Lebanese Hezbollah group, had been seen more than once.  An Israeli army spokeswoman declined to discuss reports of a strike in Syria. Syria s foreign ministry has sent letters to the U.N. Security Council protesting against Israel s  aggression  and saying anyone who attacked Syrian military sites was supporting terrorism, Syrian state TV reported. In an interview in Israel s Haaretz daily last month on his retirement, former Israeli air force chief Amir Eshel said Israel had hit arms convoys of the Syrian military and its Hezbollah allies nearly 100 times in the past five years.  Israel sees red lines in the shipment to Hezbollah of anti-aircraft missiles, precision ground-to-ground missiles and  chemical weapons.     The reported attack took place on the 10th anniversary of Israel s destruction of a nuclear reactor in Syria.   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is due to address the U.N. General Assembly on Sept. 19, and is widely expected to voice Israel s concern over what it sees as attempts by Iran to broaden its military foothold in Syria and threats posed by Hezbollah Israeli officials have said that Russia, another ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and Israel maintain regular contacts to coordinate military action in Syria.  Some Israeli commentators saw the latest strike - a departure from the previous pattern of attacks on weapons convoys - as a show of Israeli dissatisfaction with the United States and Russia.  Last month, Netanyahu met Russian President Vladimir Putin, but came away without any public statement from Moscow that it would curb Iranian influence.     Hezbollah and Israel fought a brief war in 2006 in which more than 1,300 people died. Both have suggested that any new conflict between them could be on a larger scale than that one.  Hezbollah has been one of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad s most important allies in the war and last month its leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said he had recently traveled to Damascus to meet the Syrian president.  Israel is conducting military exercises in the north of the country near the border with Lebanon.  Yaakov Amidror, a retired Israeli general and former national security adviser, told reporters he assumed Thursday s strike was linked to Nasrallah s visit to Damascus.   Weapons systems have been transferred from this organization (the Scientific Studies and Research Centre) into the hands of Hezbollah during the years,  he said.  In May, an official in the military alliance backing Assad said that Hezbollah drew a distinction between Israel striking its positions in Syria and at home in Lebanon.  If Israel strikes Hezbollah in Lebanon, definitely it will respond,  the official said. The Syrian army statement said the Israeli strike came at 2:42 a.m. (2342 GMT) from inside Lebanese airspace. It said it had been launched in support of Islamic State.  Jets flying over Lebanon overnight broke the sound barrier and Lebanese media reported that Israeli warplanes had breached Lebanese airspace.  The Observatory reported that seven people were killed or wounded in the strike.   The factory that was targeted in Masyaf produces the chemical weapons and barrel bombs that have killed thousands of Syrian civilians,  Amos Yadlin, a former head of Israeli military intelligence, said in a tweet.  The strike sent a message that Israel would not let Syria produce strategic weapons, would enforce its own red lines, and would not be hampered by Russian air defense systems in Syria, he added.  The U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Syria said on Wednesday a government jet dropped sarin on Khan Sheikhoun in Idlib province in April, killing more than 80 civilians, and that government forces were behind at least 27 chemical attacks. U.S. President Donald Trump said he had not heard a report that Syria had used chemical weapons again.  But nothing would change. We would be extremely upset if he was using chemical weapons,  he said in response to a question at a news conference in Washington.  As far as Syria is concerned, we have very little to do with Syria other than killing ISIS. What we do is we kill ISIS.  ",worldnews,"September 7, 2017 ",1
EU's Barnier worried by UK's post-Brexit plan for Irish border,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union s chief Brexit negotiator said on Thursday he was worried by Britain s plans for the border arrangement with Ireland after it leaves the EU and urged London to come up with  creative proposals . The comments from Michel Barnier highlighted the gulf between the two sides on one of the trickiest issues thrown up by Brexit - how it will affect the currently seamless movement of people and goods between the Republic of Ireland, which is an EU member, and British-ruled Northern Ireland. Britain said last month that there should be no border posts or immigration checks along the 500 km (300 mile) frontier after Brexit. Some 30,000 people make the crossing each day, and businesses from farming to brewing depend on easy movement of goods between north and south. While Brussels and Dublin also say they want to keep an open border, they say Britain has failed to explain how it would square this with its stated intention to leave the EU s customs union.  What I see in the UK s paper on Ireland and Northern Ireland worries me,  Barnier told a news conference in Brussels.  The UK wants the EU to suspend the application of its laws, its customs union and its single market at what will be a new external border for the EU, and the UK wants to use Ireland as a kind of test case for the future EU-UK customs relations. This will not happen,  Barnier said. The EU is also concerned that Britain could use the border between the two Irelands as a way to circumvent tariffs that could be imposed in a post-Brexit EU-UK trade deal. Barnier s remarks coincided with the publication of a set of  principles from the European Commission, the EU s executive, on how the Irish issue should be dealt with. It explicitly stated that the  onus to propose solutions  on Ireland fell on Britain. The paper also made it clear that a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland should be avoided to protect peace on the island. It said that  any physical border infrastructure  should be ruled out, but that required  flexible and imaginative solutions . Nearly three months into Brexit talks, EU and Britain negotiators have made little progress on the Irish border and the other issues - expatriate citizens  rights and the bill that London should pay its EU partners to settle existing financial commitments - that Brussels wants broadly solved before talks on a future trading relationship can start.  The Irish government called on Britain to make  substantive commitments  and provide  workable solutions . Prime Minister Leo Varadkar reiterated that for all sides to achieve their aim of avoiding a hard border, Britain needed to stay in the customs union or in a similar arrangement for at least a post-Brexit transition phase. Britain seized on the EU comments about the need for an open border as evidence that British and EU objectives were  closely aligned .  In particular the commitment to avoid any physical infrastructure at the border is a very important step forward,  a government spokesman said, adding that the position papers from both sides  clearly provide a good basis on which to continue to make swift progress.

Exclusive: Chile expects to soon clinch Argentina energy swap deal,"VINA DEL MAR, Chile (Reuters) - Chile expects to close an energy swap deal with Argentina in the days ahead, Chilean Energy Minister Andres Rebolledo said in an interview on Thursday, the latest example of increasing economic integration between the South American nations. The neighboring countries are also negotiating the locations for five additional transmission line interconnection points, with an agreement expected as early as January, the minister told Reuters.  We made a proposal to Argentina and we are very close to reaching an agreement,  Rebolledo said, referring to the energy swap.   I think we can have an agreement in the next couple of days or if not, over the next few weeks,  he added. Chile and Argentina share a 3,300-mile (5,300-kilometer) border running north to south along the rugged terrain of the Andes mountains. The deal would allow both countries to send natural gas or electricity at one point of the frontier and obtain needed supplies at another border point. In 2016, Chile exported 100 gigawatt-hours of electricity to Argentina and 361 million cubic meters of gas, worth nearly $100 million. The deal is the latest episode in a larger economic and diplomatic rapprochement between the neighboring South American countries that have often had frosty relations. Since conservative Argentine President Mauricio Macri came to power in 2015, the two nations have signed free trade deals and begun transporting gas between the nations, among several other measures. Rebolledo, who spoke with Reuters on the sidelines of the Energy and Climate Partnership of the Americas (ECPA) meeting in the coastal city of Vina del Mar, said Chile and Argentina are planning to add five new electricity interconnection points in the coming years. For this, he said the countries commissioned studies with financial support from the Development Bank of Latin America (CAF) to define the geographic points that would make the project most efficient.  In January we will probably have the result (of the study), with the map of the five main points where there is supply and demand on the other side, and where it is best to put the transmission lines,  he said. Chile is currently undergoing a broader transmission buildout. In August, Rebolledo told Reuters that the government hopes to have a formal proposal to pitch to investors for a line connecting northern Chile with southern Peru by the end of the current government in March.

U.S. requires enhanced screening of cargo from Turkey,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Transportation Security Administration said on Thursday it is issuing a new security directive requiring enhanced screening of cargo from Turkey. The change was  to adequately address emerging threats to cargo and raise the baseline for global aviation security,  TSA spokesman Michael England said.  The directive mandates voluntary measures already in use by Turkey and will ensure  cargo flying to the United States is screened and secured in accordance with the Air Cargo Advance Screening Program,  he said. Officials said the decision to impose the security directive and an emergency amendment was made after an incident in Australia and came in response to intelligence reports. In July, an Australian man sent his unsuspecting brother to the Sydney airport to catch an Etihad Airways flight carrying a home-made bomb disguised as a meat mincer built at the direction of a senior Islamic State commander, police said. Detailing one of Australia s  most sophisticated  militant plots, police said two men, who have been charged with terror-related offences, also planned to build a device to release poisonous gas in a public area. High-grade military explosives used to build the bomb were sent by air cargo from Turkey as part of a plot  inspired and directed  by the militant Islamic State group, police Deputy Commissioner National Security Michael Phelan said in August. The plot targeted an Etihad Airways flight on July 15, but the bomb never made it past airport security, he said. ",worldnews,"September 7, 2017 ",1
May's government pushes Brexit bill to avoid 'chaotic' departure,"LONDON (Reuters) - Brexit minister David Davis called on parliament on Thursday to back legislation to sever Britain s political, financial and legal ties with the European Union, saying that opposing the bill would lead to chaos. At a rowdy session of parliament, Davis accused the opposition Labour Party of pursuing a  cynical and unprincipled  path by challenging the repeal bill, or EU withdrawal bill, designed to disentangle Britain from more than 40 years of EU lawmaking. Labour, in turn, said the government was using the bill to give itself wide-ranging powers and a  blank cheque  to do away with laws if ministers did not like them, threatening the rights of ordinary Britons. The legislation is a vital stepping-stone towards Britain s departure from the EU in March 2019. It faces stormy debate and a likely barrage of attempted amendments as Prime Minister Theresa May, weakened by the loss of her majority in a June election and criticized by Brussels over her Brexit strategy, attempts to steer it through parliament.  Without this legislation a smooth and orderly exit is impossible ... To delay or oppose the bill will be reckless in the extreme,  Davis told lawmakers, describing support for a proposed amendment by Labour as a  vote for a chaotic exit . Labour s Brexit spokesman, Keir Starmer, said several clauses in the bill amounted to a  power grab  by government. He said it would prevent Britain from remaining in the EU s single market and customs union during a transition phase, as Labour now argues should happen.  That we are leaving (the EU) is settled, how we leave is not. This bill invites us to surrender all power and influence over that question to the government and to ministers. That would betray everything we have been sent here to do,  Starmer said.  Unless the government makes a very significant concession before we vote on Monday Labour will table, and has tabled, a reasoned amendment and will vote against the bill.      The legislation seeks largely to  copy and paste  EU law into British legislation to ensure the UK has functioning laws and the same regulatory framework as the bloc at the moment of leaving it, something that may offer some reassurance for companies. Davis said it would allow the British government and parliament to become  masters of our own laws , and promised concerned lawmakers that ministers would not use the wide-ranging powers to make  substantive changes  to law. To vote down the bill, Labour would need to convince EU supporters in May s Conservatives to side with them, but some more vocal pro-EU Conservative lawmakers have now said they will vote with the government after asking for reassurance that parliament will be able to scrutinize any changes to the law. May has also promised to listen to the concerns of lawmakers, but warned that delaying or hindering the bill with amendments would slow  vital  legislation.  The repeal bill helps deliver the outcome the British people voted for by ending the role of the EU in UK law, but it s also the single most important step we can take to prevent a cliff-edge for people and businesses, because it provides legal certainty,  she said in a statement.

Russian and Japanese leaders 'decisively condemn' North Korean tests,"VLADIVOSTOK (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday after talks with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that the two leaders  decisively condemned  North Korean weapons tests.    We decisively condemned North Korea s launch of a medium-range ballistic missile that flew over Japan s territory on August 28, as well as the new nuclear tests conducted on September 3,  Putin said in a statement. Putin reiterated that the crisis around North Korea should be resolved only by political means, and that it posed a threat to peace and stability in the region. He called for it to be resolved through a road map proposed by Moscow and Beijing. Putin also said he and Abe discussed the prospect of joint economic activities by their countries on the disputed Kurile islands.  The islands, called the Northern Territories in Japan and the Southern Kuriles in Russia, were seized by Soviet forces at the end of World War Two, when 17,000 Japanese residents were forced to flee. Putin said he and Abe discussed the prospect of a peace treaty officially ending World War Two hostilities, which has never been signed because of the territorial dispute. Putin did not say how close the two countries were to such an agreement. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov later said there could not be a timeframe for concluding a treaty.  This is a very complicated and sensitive issue,  he said.   Russia and Japan are steadily building up mutual trust, mutually beneficial cooperation, which cannot but promote the creation of a favorable atmosphere for finding a solution for the peace treaty.

"Georgia governor orders evacuation of Savannah, coast ahead of Irma","(Reuters) - Georgia Governor Nathan Deal issued a mandatory evacuation order on Thursday for the state s coast, including historic Savannah, as deadly Hurricane Irma rolled toward Florida and the southeastern United States. The evacuation order for areas east of Interstate 95 and some areas to its west takes effect Saturday at 8 a.m., Deal said in a statement. The governor also authorized up to 5,000 Georgia National Guard members to respond to the storm and expanded a state of emergency to 30 southeast Georgia counties. The order affects the cities of Savannah and Brunswick in Georgia, which has not been hit by a Category 3 hurricane or higher since 1898, according to WSB-TV.  I encourage all Georgians in our coastal areas that could be impacted by this storm to evacuate the area as soon as possible,  Deal said in a statement. Irma, one of the most powerful Atlantic storms in a century, plowed past the Dominican Republic toward Haiti on Thursday after devastating a string of Caribbean islands and killing at least 10 people. Irma will likely hit Florida as a powerful Category 4 storm on Sunday, with storm surges and flooding beginning within the next 48 hours, according to the NHC. Gas shortages in the  Miami-Fort Lauderdale area worsened on Thursday, with sales up to five times the norm. The storm s exact path is uncertain, but it could affect Georgia and the Carolinas early next week. ",worldnews,"September 7, 2017 ",1
South Sudan judges end strike to return to huge legal backlog,"JUBA (Reuters) - South Sudanese judges ended a five-month strike without a pay deal on Thursday, saying they had to clear a massive backlog of cases. President Salva Kiir, who in July sacked several striking judges, has told union representatives he would resolve their demands in the near future, Arop Malueth of the Judges and Justice Union said. The strike was over salaries that the judges say have been rendered practically worthless by hyperinflation in a country in civil war since 2013.  Courts already faced a huge backlog as the nation of 12 million people only had 274 judges on the payroll in the last government budget. Some have since resigned, some are off sick and others are on leave, the union said.  This strike has gone for five months but nothing has been done by the authorities and our citizens have been suffering every day because the courts are closed,  Malueth told Reuters. The union s general assembly agreed on Wednesday to return to work on Sept. 11. War has brought famine and forced more than a quarter of South Sudan s population to flee their homes, creating Africa s biggest refugee crisis since the Rwandan genocide in 1994.

Austria's Freedom Party criticizes ECJ ruling on migrant quotas,"VIENNA (Reuters) - The leader of Austria s far-right Freedom Party (FPO) on Thursday criticized the European Union s top court for upholding Brussels  right to force member states to take in asylum-Seekers, calling the quota system an  immigration program . Heinz-Christian Strache, whose anti-immigrant party could become kingmaker in next month s parliamentary election, took sides with Hungary s Prime Minister Viktor Orban.   It simply cannot be that states lose their right to self-determination and decision-making when it comes to receiving (asylum-seekers),  Strache said in a panel discussion in Vienna. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) dismissed complaints by Hungary and Slovakia against the quota system on Wednesday. The European Commission said it might seek fines at the ECJ within weeks for Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic unless they take people from Italy and Greece.      The (EU) program is not a refugee program but an immigration program,  said Strache, who has repeatedly called for  zero and minus immigration .     The veteran party chief drew attention to remarks by U.N. peace talks mediator Staffan de Mistura.   The U.N. Special Representative pointed out the war in Syria is over,  Strache said.  We all know, asylum is a temporary protection, which applies for as long as there is persecution. But if that s no longer the case, one actually has to take care of going back home.  The Freedom Party s popularity rose to a high during Europe s migration crisis in 2015, when it denounced the government s decision to open Austria s borders to hundreds of thousands of migrants. It led polls for more than a year, until Sebastian Kurz took the helm of the conservative People s Party in May. Kurz, who also has a hard stance on migration, has been leading polls ahead of the Oct. 15 election with just over 30 percent. The Freedom Party and center-left Social Democrats trail with around 25 percent each. Austria s system of proportional representation is likely to produce another coalition government, and observers say Kurz s and Strache s parties are likely to join forces.

South Africa's Tutu asks Myanmar's Suu Kyi to help Rohingya,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Retired South African cleric and anti-apartheid campaigner Archbishop Desmond Tutu urged Myanmar leader and fellow Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi on Thursday to intervene to help Rohingya Muslims fleeing her country. Western critics have accused Suu Kyi of not speaking out for the Rohingya, who have been fleeing to neighboring Bangladesh, following an army counter-offensive against militant attacks. Tutu said in an open letter to Suu Kyi that:  I am now elderly, decrepit and formally retired, but breaking my vow to remain silent on public affairs out of profound sadness about the plight of the Muslim minority in your country, the Rohingya.   My dear sister: If the political price of your ascension to the highest office in Myanmar is your silence, the price is surely too steep ... We pray for you to speak out for justice, human rights and the unity of your people. We pray for you to intervene,  Tutu wrote. Tutu, 85, has been living with prostate cancer for nearly two decades and has largely withdrawn from public life. The Rohingya comprise some 1.1 million people who have long complained of persecution and are seen by many in Buddhist-majority Myanmar as illegal migrants from Bangladesh.  We have to take care of our citizens, we have to take care of everybody who is in our country, whether or not they are our citizens,  Suu Kyi said earlier on Thursday in comments to Reuters Television s Indian partner, Asian News International. Suu Kyi, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 as a champion of democracy, did not refer specifically to the exodus of the minority Rohingya. ",worldnews,"September 7, 2017 ",1
Bosnian forensics experts search ravine for victims of 90s war,"SARAJEVO (Reuters) - Forensic experts began searching a ravine in central Bosnia on Thursday for the remains of around 60 Bosnian Muslims and Croats killed by Serb forces early in the 1992-95 war. The search began hours after the Bosnian war crimes court ordered the exhumations at Mount Vlasic where between 160 and 220 prisoners of war were shot dead on Aug. 21, 1992. Bosnian Serbs told the prisoners from detention camps for non-Serbs near the town of Prijedor that they would be released in a prisoner exchange but instead drove them away by bus, lined them up by the edge of a ravine and shot them. Only a dozen survived what has become known as the Koricani Cliffs massacre, by tumbling or jumping down the steep ravine. The 1992-95 war claimed 100,000 lives. The killings were part of a wave of ethnic cleansing by rebel Bosnian Serb forces who were trying to create a Serb statelet by removing Bosniaks - Bosnian Muslims - and Croats from the area. The remote site is believed to be a secondary mass grave, meaning the bodies were removed from the execution site to this location some time later in an attempt to hide the crime, Amor Masovic, the head of a regional Commission for Missing Persons, told Reuters. Forensic experts have already unearthed skeletal remains from two other secondary mass graves and have established the identities of 117 victims of the massacre whose bodies were mainly incomplete due to removal. Eleven Bosnian Serb ex-policemen were convicted for the crime at Koricanske Stijene, including Dargo Mrdja who was jailed for 17 years by the Hague-based U.N. war crimes court. The remainder were convicted by the Bosnian war crimes court. ",worldnews,"September 7, 2017 ",1
Russian court tells Aeroflot it cannot tell stewardesses what size clothing to wear,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - A court on Wednesday ruled that Russian airline Aeroflot cannot tell staff what size clothing to wear after a stewardess complained she had been taken off international routes because she did not fit into the regulation-size uniform. The stewardess, Yevgenia Magurina, said she had been transferred to lower paying domestic flights because she exceeded what she said was Aeroflot s maximum uniform size of 48. On Wednesday, Magurina partially won her appeal in a Moscow court against an earlier court decision which had gone against her. The court ordered Aeroflot to pay Magurina the amount she deemed her salary had been docked as a result of the regulation - around 17,000 rubles  ($296.53) - and to pay her compensation for moral suffering of 5,000 roubles, TASS reported.   The court however did not rule that Aeroflot s actions were discriminatory. Magurina said after the decision she was satisfied with what she called  a victory  even though the court had not found Aeroflot guilty of discrimination.  Thank God we have solved this issue inside our country. We were ready to go further and of course it would have been a shame for Russia to expose such things outside of the Russian Federation,  she told reporters.  After the ruling, Aeroflot said it was satisfied that the court did not rule it was discriminating against employees, TASS news agency reported, and would look at amending its staff regulations once it had fully studied the court s decision.

France paying close attention to U.N. report on chemical attacks in Syria,"PARIS (Reuters) - France said on Thursday it was paying close attention to evidence from a U.N. investigation that shows Syrian forces used chemical weapons in different attacks in 2017 and before. French President Emmanuel Macron said in May, barely two weeks after his inauguration, that the use of chemical weapons in Syria would represent a red line and result in reprisals.     U.N. war crimes investigators said on Wednesday that Syrian forces have used chemical weapons more than two dozen times during the country s six-year civil war, including a deadly attack that led to U.S. air strikes on government planes. Syrian government forces carried out chemical attacks seven times between March 1 and July 7, according to the U.N. investigation, suggesting attacks would have taken place after Macron s warnings.   We are paying extremely close attention to the consistent evidence revealed by the commission regarding different types of chemical attacks on 2017,  a foreign ministry spokeswoman said in response to a question on what Paris would do if its red line had been crossed.   She said the foreign ministry called for those behind the April 4 sarin attack on Khan Sheikhoun in Idlib province, which killed more than 80 civilians, to be held to account.

"German citizen freed in Turkey but banned from leaving, Dogan reports","ISTANBUL (Reuters) - A Turkish court has ordered a German citizen who was detained in southern Turkey last week to be released but banned him from leaving the country, the news agency Dogan reported on Thursday. The released man and his German partner were detained while on holiday in Antalya, a popular tourist destination. The partner had already been freed after questioning, Dogan said. A spokeswoman for Germany s Foreign Ministry confirmed the man had been freed.  He is banned from leaving the country,  she said. Dogan said the couple had been held as part of investigations into a network of supporters of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, who is blamed by Turkish authorities for a failed military coup last year, and Kurdish militants in Syria. Gulen has denied any link to the failed coup. Thursday s release means 10 German citizens remain in Turkish detention on political charges.  The arrests have raised tensions between Ankara and Berlin and led Chancellor Angela Merkel to call for a review of relations and of Turkey s EU accession talks. The detainees include dual German-Turkish citizen Deniz Yucel, who has been held for more than 200 days. ",worldnews,"September 7, 2017 ",1
Mongolian parliament ousts prime minister in latest reshuffle,"ULAANBAATAR (Reuters) - Mongolia s parliament voted to oust Prime Minister Jargaltulga Erdenebat, its website said late on Thursday, after his ruling Mongolian People s Party (MPP) was defeated in a July presidential election. No prime minister of Mongolia, a thinly populated and mineral-rich country sandwiched between Russia and China, has completed a four-year term since 2004. Of 73 members of parliament attending the vote, 42 were in favor of Erdenebat s removal. The outgoing prime minister noted that the country had seen 13 governments in the last 25 years.  The resignation of a government in a democratic parliament is a normal occurrence, but it can be harmful if a good thing goes beyond its norms,  Erdenebat said in a statement on parliament s website.  A former Soviet satellite, Mongolia transitioned to a parliamentary democracy in 1990.     I believe that dismissing government is a mistake that hinders the development of the country, rather than a positive mechanism of accountability,  Erdenebat said. The MPP gained power in mid-2016 in elections in which it won 65 of parliament s 76 seats. It is expected to hold a party congress to choose new leadership, said Dale Choi, an analyst and head of Altan Bumba Financial Group in Ulaanbaatar.  I don t think it means instability  for the government, he said.  I think it means internal party politics. It s clearing the party s decks after a monumental, unexpected presidential loss.  Last month, some 30 members of the parliament, or State Ikh Khural, signed a petition calling for Erdenebat s resignation in the aftermath of the presidential vote, which was won by populist former martial arts star and businessman Khaltmaa Battulga of the opposition Democratic Party. The defeat was seen as a rejection of the MPP government s austerity policies and a reaction to allegations of corruption. In Mongolia s parliamentary democracy, the prime minister is the leader of the government, and the president has limited powers including the ability to veto legislation and to propose laws to parliament. Higher coal prices this year have helped the resource-dependent economy gain momentum. But earlier this year, a slump in foreign investment and declining commodity prices forced Mongolia to agree to a $5.5 billion economic bailout led by the International Monetary Fund, to relieve fiscal strains and try to restore investor confidence.

Vocal critic of Tanzanian president seriously hurt in gun attack,"DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - Tanzanian opposition lawmaker Tundu Lissu, a fierce critic of President John Magufuli s government, was seriously wounded in a gun attack on Thursday, police and party officials said. Magufuli condemned the shooting and ordered the country s security forces to investigate the incident. Lissu underwent emergency surgery after being shot in the abdomen and other parts of the body by unknown gunmen outside his residence in the administrative capital Dodoma, they said.  Lissu has suffered multiple gunshot wounds and is being treated at the main public hospital in Dodoma,  said Tumaini Makene, spokesman for the main opposition CHADEMA party.  We strongly condemn this attack and are closely monitoring his condition,  the party said in a separate statement. James Kiologwe, a doctor at Dodoma regional hospital, said Lissu was in stable condition. Police said an investigation had been launched into the attack on Lissu, a senior lawyer and CHADEMA s parliamentary chief whip. Police said they did not know what had motivated the attack and the suspects were still at large.  I have been saddened by reports of the shooting of Hon. Tundu Lissu. I pray for his quick recovery,  Magufuli said on Twitter.  Law enforcement agencies should hunt down all those involved in this barbaric act and bring them to justice.  Lissu is a vocal opponent of Magufuli and has been arrested on several occasions and charged with incitement. He was detained most recently in July after having called Magufuli a dictator. He was subsequently released.  The authorities must take steps to reassure Tanzanians and the world that this shooting was not politically motivated,  rights group Amnesty International said in a statement.

Germany sees jump in citizenship applications from U.S.,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German consulates in the United States have seen a significant rise in requests for citizenship since November 2016, when Donald Trump was elected president, data collected by the German foreign ministry shows. Total citizenship applications - including those filed by U.S. citizens already living in Germany - are reported yearly, with data for this year not expected until summer 2018. However, German consulates receive citizenship requests filed overseas, including those filed by former Germans who were stripped of their citizenship during the Nazi era.  The German government s offices in the United States are currently seeing a significant increase in legal queries related to citizenship issues,  the German interior ministry said in response to an official query by the Greens party. Applications do not ask why an applicant wants to become a citizen, so the reasons for the increase are a matter of conjecture. But applications by German stripped of citizenship during the Nazi era and their descendants rose sharply after the U.S. election in early November. Such applications climbed from 92 in October 2016 to 124 in November, 144 in December and 159 in January 2017. At least 100 people living in the United States have applied every month through June.   Data from the German foreign ministry showed that, all told, 1,190 such applicants sought citizenship in the first eight months of 2017, compared with 792 in the full year of 2016.     Germany has also seen a surge in British nationals applying for German citizenship since the country voted to leave the European Union last year. The Federal Statistics Office said a total of 110,400 foreigners took up German citizenship last year, a 2.9 percent increase from the previous year, with Britons making up the largest share of the increase.

The ultra-hardline Islamic State closed this school and  many others in northern Syria after it seized control of the region in 2014, three years into the country s civil war. Instead it taught children extremist thought in mosques. But now that the group has been ousted from most territory it held in and around Raqqa by a U.S.-backed military alliance, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a growing debate over education points to the ethnic tensions expected to follow. What is taught in areas under the control of the SDF, which includes Arab militias but is dominated by the Kurdish YPG, is one of many questions over how predominantly Arab parts of northern Syria will be run as they come into the Kurdish fold. Schools around Raqqa will this year teach a new curriculum that is based on old textbooks but erases the Baathist ideology of President Bashar al-Assad, a decision agreed on by Arab and Kurdish teachers alike. But an official in the SDF has floated the immediate introduction of Kurdish lessons in Raqqa schools, an idea that makes local officials bristle. In contrast with other areas under SDF control that have for years taught Kurdish, there are no plans yet to teach the language in mostly Arab Raqqa.  Officials say it would need broad consensus, hinting at concerns that its introduction too quickly would cause unrest.  We wouldn t object to Kurdish teaching. But if it s imposed on schools then there will be problems,  Ahmed said. The YPG has held areas of northeast Syria since early in the six-year-old war which are now under a self-run administration opposed by Assad, who holds the main population centers in the west and is also advancing against Islamic State, and Turkey, a YPG foe which borders Syria. Raqqa is likely to join the administration, officials say. All ethnic groups are represented in the local bodies that run majority Arab regions captured by the SDF as it ousted IS fighters but critics say Kurds dominate decision-making. Reuters interviews with SDF officials and local authorities suggest resentment over Kurdish power is brewing over education plans. A senior SDF adviser and coordinator with the U.S. coalition said he believed Kurdish would be taught to Kurdish pupils around Raqqa this year, following the model for other schools in SDF territory.  No one has opposed this ... every (ethnic) group has the right to study in its own language,  Amed Sido said via the internet. Officials in the Raqqa Civil Council, the newly-formed local governing body, were taken aback.  No, that won t happen without consultations with us and agreement in the council,  Ammar Hussein, an education committee official, said at its office in the town of Ain Issa.  For now it s in Arabic, with English and French lessons.  Echoing several council members, he said Kurdish would be taught only if families requested it, there were enough qualified teachers and the Arab-Kurdish council approved it.  If the people here agree ... there won t be any objection,  said Ali Shanna, another education committee official.  But the Kurd knows the Kurdish language, why does he need to learn it?   A former Kurdish teacher privately derided Shanna s comments.  I hate that attitude. It s ignorance, it s the same thinking as Daesh (Islamic State),  said the teacher, who had been jailed under Assad for writing a Kurdish-language journal. The sensitivity over language has already caused unrest in Hasaka to the northeast, an area controlled for years by the YPG where a new curriculum is taught in Arabic and Kurdish, both now official languages. In demonstrations reported by a monitoring group, protesters called for Arab children not to have to learn Kurdish. Mostafa Bali, an SDF official, said there was no intention to force Kurdish on Arabs, or to suppress Arabic.  We don t support racism over language. But there are many Kurds who would like to see Arabic teaching banned in Kurdish areas as revenge for the Baath (teaching),  he said. The Baathist curriculum championed Arab nationalism over ethnic identity. Kurdish pupils were punished for speaking their mother tongue in school playgrounds. Now, even in some Arab-majority towns, Kurds are taught Kurdish. Officials in Raqqa are determined to do things their way, regardless of what they say are potential military threats from Assad or neighboring Turkey.  We won t let Turkey or anyone else interfere in our internal affairs. We decide what we ll teach or not teach,  Leila Mostafa, the Kurdish co-president of the Raqqa Civil Council said. At Hazima school, teachers worry about both the legacy left by Islamic State and Assad, and future political upheaval.  One kid turned up singing Islamic State chants,  teacher Ahmed Saoud said.  The teachers say  racist  Baathist modules help fuel Syria s conflict and are anxious to begin the new curriculum.  It s urgent we start teaching. The next phase will be difficult - there ll be a reckoning between factions,  Ahmed al-Ahmed said, without specifying which groups he was referring to.  A reckoning, in general.

Former guerrilla coalition gets mandate to form Kosovo government,"PRISTINA (Reuters) - Ramush Haradinaj, a former guerrilla fighter who has twice stood trial for war crimes, was chosen on Thursday to form a new government in Kosovo, ending a political deadlock that has persisted since elections on June 11. President Hashim Thaci gave Haradinaj the mandate after his coalition struck an agreement with a smaller party that paved the way for them to take power. Haradinaj s coalition comprises parties made up of former guerrillas who fought Serbian forces in 1998 and 1999. That campaign led to accusations of war crimes against him, but he was acquitted twice by a United Nations war crimes tribunal. The coalition signed an agreement on Monday with the smaller New Alliance for Kosovo (AKR) party to put together a new government, an agreement that gives them 62 seats in the 120-seat parliament [nL8N1L42QO. The AKR is led by Behgjet Pacolli, whom media call the richest man in Kosovo.  Haradinaj is expected to present his program to parliament on Saturday, after which the government should be elected.   The new government will confront unemployment running at 30 percent and uncertain relations with Kosovo s neighbors, especially Serbia, a precondition for both countries to move forward in their efforts to join the European Union. It must also reform health and education and the tax administration system as well as include representatives of some 120,000 Kosovo Serbs who do not recognize independence. Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, almost a decade after NATO air strikes drove out Serbian forces that had been accused of expelling and killing ethnic Albanian civilians in a two-year counter-insurgency.

Exiled Chinese tycoon Guo seeking asylum in U.S.,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Guo Wengui, an exiled Chinese billionaire who has accused some of the most senior officials of China s Communist Party of corruption, has applied for political asylum in the United States, his lawyer said. Thomas Ragland, a Washington-based lawyer, said Guo, who lives in New York and is in the United States on a tourist visa expiring this year, applied for asylum on Wednesday because he feared his accusations had made him a  political opponent of the Chinese regime .  This step was taken because of his very real concerns of his safety and risks he would face from the Chinese regime because of his videos, his Twitter posts, the things that he s said and written,  Ragland told Reuters by phone on Thursday.  Guo, who is also known as Miles Kwok, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said he was unaware of the situation when asked about it at a daily news briefing in Beijing earlier on Thursday. Guo, who left China in 2014, has emerged as a political threat to China s government in a sensitive year, unleashing a deluge of corruption allegations against high-level officials of the ruling party through Twitter posts and video blogs. The businessman has made it clear that he wants to disrupt an important Communist Party congress, which is held every five years and due to begin on Oct. 18. Despite providing scant evidence to back up his accusations, Guo s standing as a former billionaire insider with ties to senior intelligence officials has meant his online video streams and prolific tweeting command attention, as well as the ire of Beijing. Interpol issued a global  red notice  for Guo s arrest in April, at Beijing s request, while articles in China s state-controlled media have accused him of crimes including bribery, fraud, and embezzlement. Guo denies the accusations. Guo is also being sued for defamation in the United States by several Chinese individuals and companies, including the HNA Group conglomerate. Ragland said Guo feared that China could soon file criminal charges against him that were politically motivated and request American authorities to cancel his visa.  Filing an application for asylum, Ragland said, triggers protections both under U.S. and international law that would allow Guo to remain in the country for the duration his application was being processed, the national average for which is two to three years.

"Exclusive: U.N. expects up to 300,000 Rohingya could flee Myanmar violence to Bangladesh","COX S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Up to 300,000 Rohingya Muslims could flee violence in northwestern Myanmar to neighboring Bangladesh, a U.N. agency official said on Wednesday, warning of a funding shortfall for emergency food supplies for the refugees. According to estimates issued by United Nations workers in Bangladesh s border region of Cox s Bazar, arrivals since the latest bloodshed started 12 days ago have already reached 146,000. Numbers are difficult to establish with any certainty due to the turmoil as Rohingya escape operations by Myanmar s military. However, the U.N. officials have raised their estimate of the total expected refugees from 120,000 to 300,000, said Dipayan Bhattacharyya, who is Bangladesh spokesman for the World Food Programme.   They are coming in nutritionally deprived, they have been cut off from a normal flow of food for possibly more than a month,  he told Reuters.  They were definitely visibly hungry, traumatized.   The surge of refugees, many sick or wounded, has strained the resources of aid agencies and communities which are already helping hundreds of thousands displaced by previous waves of violence in Myanmar. Many have no shelter, and aid agencies are racing to provide clean water, sanitation and food. Bhattacharyya said the refugees were now arriving by boat as well as crossing the land border at numerous points. Another U.N. worker in the area cautioned that the estimates were not  hard science , given the chaos and lack of access to the area on the Myanmar side where the military is still conducting its  clearance operation . The source added that the 300,000 number was probably toward the worst-case scenario.  The latest violence began when Rohingya insurgents attacked dozens of police posts and an army base. The ensuing clashes and a military counter-offensive killed at least 400 people and triggered the exodus of villagers to Bangladesh. In a letter to the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed concern that the violence could spiral into a  humanitarian catastrophe . Based on the prediction that 300,000 could arrive, the WFP calculated that it would need $13.3 million in additional funding to provide high-energy biscuits and basic rice rations for four months. Bhattacharyya called for donors to meet the shortfall urgently.  If they don t come forward now, we may see that these people would be fighting for food among themselves, the crime rate would go up, violence against women and on children would go up,  he said.

EU tells Britain to protect data or delete them after Brexit,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union wants Britain to protect data it has in storage on continental Europeans after Brexit and maintain bans on cheap imitations of locally branded EU produce like cognac or Parma ham. The proposals were among those made in further position papers published by the European Commission s Brexit negotiators on Thursday for consultation with the other 27 EU member states which offered a glimpse of thinking in Brussels about future trade ties with Britain, despite an EU refusal to start talks. The British government has voiced frustration at the refusal of EU negotiators to open discussions on a future free trade pact until London makes concessions on elements that must be settled to avoid legal chaos when Britain leaves in March 2019. However, in spelling out what it wants to happen on some issues on Brexit Day, the Union is having to say what it wants after that point - for example, on the protection of personal data gathered on either side of the English Channel under EU law or on trademarks and other intellectual property. The paper on data protection says Britain may continue to use data gathered before exit day once it has left the EU as long as it continues applying the same level of protection, otherwise it must destroy the data. Britain will also lose access to EU  networks, information systems and databases  on the day it leaves, the paper says. That would include, for example, the information system underpinning the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) scheme. It makes no mention of how data could continue to flow after Brexit, unlike the British paper which sought continued close collaboration with the EU on data protection once Britain quits the bloc. In a separate paper on intellectual property, the EU said Britain must have legislation in place to keep on protecting locally branded produce under the Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) scheme. The PGI system identifies products as originating from a particular region, like Cornish pasties or Roquefort cheese, meaning others cannot market imitations with that same name.

Three policemen killed in Peru in drug-trafficking region: government,"LIMA (Reuters) - Three Peruvian policemen were killed in an attack on patrol vehicles in a drug-trafficking region controlled by a remnant band of Shining Path rebels, the interior ministry said on Thursday. Authorities are investigating the attack, which occurred late on Wednesday in the jungle region known as the VRAEM, where most of Peru s cocaine is produced, the ministry said. The Maoist-inspired Shining Path largely ended its armed rebellion in the 1990s on orders from the group s leaders.  But a faction that refused to put down its weapons occasionally ambushes state security forces in the region, where rebels work with drug traffickers. So far this year, nine police or military officers have been killed in the VRAEM in a sign the Shining Path faction has regrouped after two top leaders were killed in 2013, said Peruvian security analyst Pedro Yaranga.  This is going to continue,  he said. Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski called the latest incident a  cowardly attack  and the interior ministry said it would increase security operations in the region.

German election chief urges action to ensure vote software can't be hacked,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany s election chief has urged state officials to address vulnerabilities in vote collation software, just weeks before a Sept. 24 election that officials fear could be subject to foreign interference. Germans will vote on paper at polling stations or by mail in advance and the ballots will be counted and entered into a computer system, but two news reports published on Thursday cited concerns about the software, particularly the lack of an authentication step when results are transmitted. Die Zeit said Martin Tschirsich, a 29-year-old computer expert, had been able to find passwords on the internet to gain access to the maintenance program for the  PC-Wahl  (PC-Election) software, which would allow it to be manipulated.  The election is not secure. It can be hacked,  he told the weekly newspaper. Similar concerns were raised by another IT expert in the online version of Der Spiegel magazine. The reports come after repeated warnings from government officials that Russia could try to interfere in the election. French and U.S. intelligence officials say Moscow sought to influence recent votes there.  Russia denies the accusations. Responding to the media reports, Federal Election Director Dieter Sarreither said he was familiar with the problems identified and had asked state officials and the software company, vote-iT, to take steps to shore up security. vote-iT had no immediate comment. The measures Sarreither demanded include the mandatory installation of software patches and the development of new steps aimed at ensuring the authenticity of the election results sent digitally, perhaps through telephone calls. That would ensure that any errors in data transmission are recognized and corrected before preliminary election results are released, Sarreither said, adding that actual results could not be manipulated as they were based on paper ballots. The security of the data was more important than the speed with which results were released, his office said. Germany s federal cyber protection agency, BSI, said it had worked closely with election officials and the software manufacturer to improve the security of election results.  In the future, only information technology based on BSI-certified software should be used for election processes,  BSI chief Arne Schoenbohm said. ",worldnews,"September 7, 2017 ",1

U.S. charges former Turkish minister with Iran sanctions evasion,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors have charged a former Turkish economy minister and the ex-head of a state-owned bank with conspiring to violate Iran sanctions by illegally moving hundreds of millions of dollars through the U.S. financial system on Tehran s behalf. The indictment marks the first time an ex-government member with close ties to President Tayyip Erdogan has been charged in an investigation that has strained ties between Washington and Ankara. Ex-minister Zafer Caglayan was also charged with taking bribes in cash and jewelry worth tens of millions of dollars. The charges stem from the case against Reza Zarrab, a wealthy Turkish-Iranian gold trader who was arrested in the United States over sanctions evasion last year. Erdogan has said U.S. authorities had  ulterior motives  in charging Zarrab, who has pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors have now charged Caglayan and former Halkbank general manager Suleyman Aslan and two others, according to the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Southern District of New York. They were charged with  conspiring to use the U.S. financial system to conduct hundreds of millions of dollars  worth of transactions on behalf of the government of Iran and other Iranian entities, which were barred by United States sanctions,  U.S. prosecutors said in a statement dated Wednesday. They were also accused of lying to U.S. government officials about the transactions, laundering funds and defrauding several financial institutions by concealing the true nature of the transactions, prosecutors said. Reuters was not immediately able to reach Caglayan or Aslan for comment. Halkbank said all of its transactions have always fully complied with national and international regulations, adding that news regarding the U.S. case  misleads  the public and investors. Relations between Washington and NATO ally Turkey, an important partner in tackling the Syrian conflict, were strained after a failed coup against Erdogan in July last year and the president s subsequent crackdown on opposition. Ankara is seeking, so far without success, extradition of a U.S.-based Muslim cleric it accuses of backing the coup attempt. The cleric, Fethullah Gulen, denies the allegation. Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci defended his predecessor and said U.S. prosecutors had yet to prove their accusations.  Caglayan did not do anything against Turkey s interests,  Zeybekci told reporters.  It is no concern to Turkey if Caglayan acted against interests of other countries.  Both Caglayan and Aslan are also accused of taking bribes, according to the indictment.  Caglayan, who was serving as Minister of the Economy... received tens of millions of dollars  worth of bribes in cash and jewelry from the proceeds of the scheme to provide services to the government of Iran and conceal those services from U.S. government officials,  prosecutors said. U.S. prosecutors have said that between 2010 and 2015 Zarrab and others worked to conceal his ability to supply currency and gold to Iran through the Turkish bank, avoiding U.S. sanctions. As part of that scheme, Zarrab and others used front companies and fake invoices to trick U.S. banks into processing transactions disguised to appear as though they involved food, and thus were exempt from the sanctions, prosecutors have said. The U.S. indictment echoes charges in a leaked 2014 Turkish police document, reported by Reuters, which detailed allegations that a  crime organization  had helped Iran exploit a loophole in Western sanctions that allowed it to purchase gold with oil and gas revenues. When the West prohibited the gold trade in 2013 as a sanctions violation, the police report alleged the network concocted records of shipments of food at preposterous volumes and prices to continue giving Iran access to foreign currency. Iran emerged from years of economic isolation in January 2016, when world powers lifted the crippling sanctions in return for Tehran complying with a deal to curb its nuclear ambitions. The sanctions had cut off the country of 80 million people from the global financial system, slashed its exports and imposed severe economic hardship on Iranians.  Caglayan, Aslan and others indicted in the case on Wednesday remain at large, prosecutors said.  Zarrab and a Halkbank deputy general manager, Mehmet Hakan Atilla, were arrested while in the United States. Zarrab was detained in March 2016 and Atilla a year later. Both are scheduled to appear for trial in October. Zarrab has hired former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and former U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey to defend him against the charges.  Giuliani has said that both U.S. and Turkish officials remained  receptive  to a diplomatic solution due to the nature of the charges against Zarrab and the importance of Turkey as an ally. A decree issued two weeks ago gave Erdogan authority to approve the exchange of foreigners detained or convicted in Turkey with people held in other countries  in situations required by national security or national interests . Shares of Halkbank were down 3.4 percent at 13.81 lira as of 1337 GMT, underperforming the benchmark BIST 100 index, which was flat. ",worldnews,"September 7, 2017 ",1
Moldova sends troops to NATO drills despite presidential veto,"CHISINAU (Reuters) - The Moldovan government said on Thursday it has sent 57 servicemen to Ukraine to participate in military exercises starting this week, deepening a row with the pro-Russian president who had vetoed the move.  The drills in western Ukraine from Sept. 8-23 will be conducted mainly by NATO member countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom and Turkey.  They coincide with war games known as  Zapad , or  West , by thousands of Russian troops in Belarus, the Baltic Sea, western Russia and the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. The Russian exercises have worried NATO despite Moscow s assurances troops would rehearse a purely defensive scenario.    Moldova is governed by a pro-Western government and a pro-Moscow president, meaning frequent clashes over foreign policy, especially where relations with Russia and the European Union are concerned.  The government s plans to send troops were vetoed by President Igor Dodon, who argued that Moldova is bound by its constitution to stay neutral. The defense ministry ignored the president, who is also Moldova s commander-in-chief.  Officially I confirm that, despite all the obstacles, 57 servicemen of Moldova, as was planned earlier, just an hour ago went by bus to participate in NATO military exercises, which start on Friday in Ukraine,  Defence Ministry spokeswoman Diana Gradinaru said.  Earlier this year Dodon banned the participation of military personnel in NATO exercises in Romania, prompting complaints by the U.S. and Romanian ambassadors. Moldova has been governed by pro-Western governments since 2009 and signed a trade pact with the EU in 2014. Russia retaliated by halting imports of Moldovan farm produce, depriving the country of a key market for its wine, fruit and vegetables. Relations suffered further this year due to a dispute in March over the treatment of Moldovan officials traveling to or through Russia, and the expulsion of Russian diplomats in May. In August, Moldova declared Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin persona non grata, accusing him of making defamatory remarks about Moldovan government officials.

Merkel call to stop Turkey's EU bid draws mixed response,"TALLINN/PARIS (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel s call to stop Turkey s European Union accession talks drew a mixed response from the bloc s foreign ministers on Thursday, while French President Emmanuel Macron said Ankara remained a vital partner of the EU. NATO allies Germany and Turkey have traded increasingly bitter words over the last two years, contributing to an overall souring of Ankara s relations with the EU. President Tayyip Erdogan s crackdown on dissent following a failed 2016 coup attempt has drawn broad condemnation in the bloc. Merkel announced her toughened stance on Turkey s long-stalled EU bid in a TV debate last Sunday as she faced off with her main rival in national elections due on Sept. 24. Her Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, arriving for talks with his EU colleagues in the Estonian capital Tallinn, said it was Turkey itself that was moving away from the EU. Austria s Sebastian Kurz reiterated his line that the talks should end.  But Finland and Lithuania spoke out against breaking off the talks, which opened formally in 2005 but stalled over Erdogan s track record on human rights and the unresolved issue of Cyprus - a Mediterranean island that belongs to the EU but of which part falls under an unrecognized protectorate of Turkey.  No, we should continue the process and engagement. It s not easy but we have to value contacts,  Lithuania s Linas Linkevicius told reporters.  By stopping, by cutting, we will ...encourage them even more to go away. I think the effect would be the opposite than what we d wish.  EU entry talks, no matter how protracted, had long been seen in themselves as a stimulus to Turkish democratic reform; but EU officials see a slide back in recent years with judicial independence and freedom of speech in peril. Turkey s EU ties minister, Omer Celik, is due to join the bloc s 28 officials for talks in Tallinn later on Thursday. The EU is wary of upsetting Erdogan, eager to preserve a deal that stemmed the mass migration via Turkey of people from conflict zones in the tumultuous Middle East.   We have to tread very carefully and, while discussing Turkey s status as a candidate country, we should also discuss the future relationship in all its aspects,  Estonia s Sven Mikser said in Tallinn. He said he did not expect the EU to make any formal decision this year, adding that the bloc needed to cooperate with Ankara on migration and security in particular. The French president told Greece s Kathimerini newspaper that ties with Turkey should be maintained.  Turkey has indeed strayed away from the European Union in recent months and worryingly overstepped the mark in ways that cannot be ignored,  he said.  But I want to avoid a split because it s a vital partner in many crises we all face, notably the immigration challenge and the terrorist threat.  With other countries in the EU also advocating more  strategic patience , the unanimity of 28 member states required to kill off Turkey s bid seems absent. But suspending accession talks, which the European Parliament has already called for repeatedly, would only require the backing of majority of EU states. Merkel wants to discuss that with fellow EU leaders at their summit planned in October 19-20, more than three weeks after  Germany s election. A senior Turkish official said EU states must decide whether they wanted Turkey as a member, but there was a sense  they no longer want the marriage...(but) want cohabitation . Kati Piri, a European Parliament speaker on Turkey, advised suspending the membership track but pushing ahead with customs union talks as the  most realistic leverage the EU can now have to try negotiate some standards with Turkey .  Turkey under this government does not even uphold the minimum human rights standards now. But we should not take away the EU perspective from the Turkish people, and in suspending talks we would have to name conditions for reviving them.   But this German twist is triggered by German elections, not by some change on the side of Turkey. So what does Merkel really mean? I think it s likely she will return to her usual pragmatism after the elections,  Piri told Reuters. ",worldnews,"September 7, 2017 ",1
The millionaire socialist who may be Norway's next prime minister,"OSLO (Reuters) - Norway s next prime minister could be a man born into wealth and privilege who became the unlikely leader of the Labour Party, the political home of the working class.

With the left and right neck-and-neck in the polls and many voters undecided, the race is too close to call.  If he wins, it would be a victory for a millionaire, whose background was once deemed an obstacle to his ambition to lead a party rooted in the struggle for workers  rights. Stoere got massive attention in the media in 2013 when he failed, apparently by accident, to raise the national flag outside his house on International Workers  Day on May 1 - an important tradition in the labor movement.  I have not grown up in the traditional working class and I cannot explain my background away. Like everyone else I m the sum of my experiences,  he told the tabloid VG at the time. With a net worth of 64.5 million Norwegian crowns ($8.3 million), media interest in Stoere s investments has at times threatened to overshadow his campaign, leading him last week to divest stakes in a mutual fund that did not comply with the same ethical standards as the sovereign wealth fund. He served as foreign minister and health minister in the two cabinets of his friend, prime minister Jens Stoltenberg, in 2005-2013, and became Labour Party leader when Stoltenberg was named NATO Secretary General.  In 2010, while foreign minister, Stoere helped broker a deal to delineate an Arctic offshore border between Norway and Russia that had been in dispute for four decades.   Stoere was a very popular foreign minister, but has experienced problems as party leader,  Toril Aalberg, a professor of political science at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim told Reuters.  While there is a greater degree of consensus in Norwegian foreign policy, there is a greater degree of disagreement in domestic policy matters.  The son of a shipbroker, Stoere credits his conversion to social democracy to his move to study in France where he was confronted with starker class differences.  I learnt what kind of society I wanted to live in. In France, differences between people are large, larger than in Norway   between rich and poor, between those with education and those without, between city and countryside,  he wrote in a column for Norway s ABC News website in June.  In Norway, we have shaped a society where there are fewer differences. But we are not immune to this and this is not a given.  He attended Paris  prestigious Sciences Po university, became engaged in the movement to support Soviet dissidents, and traveled to the Soviet Union to provide supplies and support.  He organized a protest in support of Andrei Sakharov, then held in internal exile, persuading French star Yves Montand, a long-time Communist sympathizer, to deliver a letter to the Soviet embassy in Paris calling for the Nobel laureate s freedom. When he returned to Norway, Stoere worked closely with Norway s first female prime minister, Gro Harlem Brundtland, known as the  mother of the nation  in Norway, first as an adviser and later a senior civil servant under several governments between 1989 and 1997.  From 1998 to 2000 he followed Brundtland to the World Health Organisation to serve as chief of staff to the new executive director. He was also Secretary General of the Norwegian Red Cross from 2003 to 2005. If Labour wins the Sept. 11 vote, it would spend less money from Norway s near-trillion dollar sovereign wealth fund and instead raise taxes, arguing that the growth in oil revenue spending must slow.  Sound public finances are critical for welfare and critical for productivity,  Stoere told Reuters in an interview in June. Stoere also said he would be careful about allowing the sovereign wealth fund into new asset classes.  Political risk is clearly one issue. Spreading the focus of the fund too much is another one,  he said. To govern, Labour will need the support of the Centre Party, whose main support is in rural areas, with whom it shared power between 2005 and 2013. But depending on the outcome of the vote, Stoere may be in need of the support of the far-left Red Party and would face demands from the small-but-growing Green Party about limiting the reach of Norway s oil industry.  Stoere says he is adamant he would not accept the Green Party s ultimatum of shutting down the industry but his position may be more difficult to defend if he needs their support.  Forming a government is going to be difficult,  said Johannes Bergh, a political scientist at the Institute of Social Research in Oslo. ",worldnews,"September 7, 2017 ",1
Spanish PM Rajoy to ask court to revoke Catalan referendum law,"MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said on Thursday he would ask Spain s constitutional court to revoke a referendum law passed on Wednesday by the Catalan parliament that sets the stage for a Oct. 1 vote on splitting from Spain. The law, passed by a majority of Catalan lawmakers, was unconstitutional, Rajoy told a news conference. Spain s state prosecutors  office said on Thursday it would present criminal charges against leading members of the Catalan parliament for allowing Wednesday s parliamentary vote to go ahead.

Tunisia's new government gets party backing for reform push,"TUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisia s two main parties on Thursday gave parliamentary backing to Prime Minister Youssef Chahed s new cabinet, handing him the initiative to push sensitive economic reforms demanded by the International Monetary Fund. Chahed s cabinet needs strong support to reform public sector wages and overhaul the pension system to improve national finances. Infighting and social protests have kept past governments from pushing through tougher austerity reforms. Chahed on Wednesday named 13 new ministers including heads of the interior, defense and finance ministries. He appointed Taoufik Rajhi, one of his advisors from the Islamist Ennahda party, to a new economic reforms ministry in a deal that ends weeks of party infighting over posts. Rached Ghannouchi, the head of Ennahda party, called his 69 lawmakers in parliament to give a vote of confidence to the coalition government which includes ruling Nidaa Tounes, Machroua Tounes, the Republican and Massar parties.  The new cabinet also includes independents and former ministers who worked with ex-President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, ousted by a popular uprising in 2011. Ennahda won four important ministries, including the new ministry of economic reforms. Nidaa Tounes led by the son of President Beji Caid Essesbi welcomed the reshuffle in which his party secured six new posts and other junior portfolios.  This reshuffle maintained political balances, boosted the political weight of our party, we will give our confidence to the new team,  Sofian Tobal an official in Nidaa Tounes said. Backing from the two main parties means Chahed s government can expect support from at least 150 lawmakers in the 217-seat parliament. Ennahda and Nidaa Tounes have more than 130 seats between them plus the support of smaller parties. Chahed s cabinet needs 109 votes to win a confidence ballot.  This government would be like a war cabinet, in a war against the corruption, against rampant unemployment and a war to save the economy,  Chahed said on Wednesday. He has said he will present parliament with a comprehensive plan to push the economy forward, including accelerating the coordination of public-private partnerships and proposing more incentives to investors.  We will confront the imbalance in public finances, adjust the trade balance and improve the situation of public institutions that are facing difficulties, as well progress on major priority reforms,  he said. Tunisia is struggling to revive its economy and create jobs for frustrated youth. But it is under pressure to reduce deficits by stopping public sector hiring, laying off thousands of state employees and selling shares in some troubled public institutions. Reforms are also expected to include cuts in subsidies for energy and some basic materials, which would be highly sensitive and rejected by Tunisia strong unions who have in the past played the role of political power brokers.

German SPD loses support after television debate: poll,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives widened their lead over the Social Democrats following a television debate in which Merkel came across as more convincing and reliable than her SPD challenger Martin Schulz, a poll showed on Thursday. The weekly survey by Infratest dimap for ARD television showed support for Merkel s CDU/CSU bloc holding steady at 37 percent while the SPD dropped two percentage points to 21 percent - their lowest reading in the poll since early January. The pollster questioned 1,503 voters from Monday to Wednesday, meaning the survey was the first fully conducted after Sunday s television debate in which hardly any policy differences emerged between Merkel and Schulz. The anti-immigration, euro-hostile AfD came in unchanged at 11 percent, making it the third-strongest political force. The radical Left followed with 10 percent, up 1 point. The business-friendly FDP scored 9 percent, also up 1 point, while the environmental Greens were unchanged at 8 percent. The polls indicated two parties FDP and the AfD should enter the Bundestag as they look set to beat the 5-percent threshold. The fractured political landscape could make it hard to form a viable alliance other than the current grand coalition between Merkel s CDU/CSU and the SPD. Another scenario could be a tricky three-way  Jamaica  coalition between Merkel s conservatives, the FDP and the Greens, though such a broad alliance has never been tested on the federal level before.

Aid convoy reaches Syria's Deir al-Zor after three-year siege,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - An aid convoy arrived at Deir al-Zor in eastern Syria on Thursday, bringing supplies to soldiers and civilians days after the Syrian army broke a three-year Islamic State siege, Syrian state media reported. The Syrian army and its allies reached Deir al-Zor on Tuesday in a sudden advance following months of steady progress east across the desert. The army on Thursday advanced against militants in a pocket they still hold further west, pro-Damascus media reported. State TV broadcast footage of scores of residents cheering with relief in Deir al-Zor as the convoy arrived. The United Nations estimated that 93,000 civilians living under Islamic State siege in Deir al-Zor had been in  extremely difficult  conditions, being supplied only by air drops. The 40 trucks that reached the area on Thursday carried basic needs such as fuel, food and medical supplies to civilians, and included two mobile clinics, state news agency SANA reported. The army also holds another besieged enclave at the city s airbase, separated from its advancing forces by hundreds of meters of IS-held ground. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Thursday that the army had not yet connected with that enclave, and was working on expanding its corridor from the west. Islamic State mortar fire on neighborhoods still surrounded near the air base killed at least seven civilians and wounded dozens more on Thursday, the British-based monitoring group said. On Thursday, the army also advanced against Islamic State militants in countryside east of the city of Hama, a media unit run by Damascus ally Hezbollah reported.  The advance, which saw forces recapture two villages there, is part of efforts to drive the militants out of an isolated pocket of territory they control east of Hama and Homs. Separately, the U.S. special envoy to the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State, Brett McGurk, said on Wednesday that a convoy of Islamic State fighters and families from the Syria-Lebanon border was still in open desert. The coalition is using air strikes to block the convoy from reaching IS-held territory in eastern Syria, to which the Syrian army and its ally Hezbollah were escorting it as part of a truce following fighting on the Syria-Lebanon border. Islamic State is fighting separate offensives by both the Syrian army and its allies in eastern and central Syria, as well as the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces in Raqqa. The group has lost nearly half of its territory across both Iraq and Syria, but still has 6,000-8,000 fighters left in Syria, the United States-led coalition has said.

Syrian opposition leader says U.N. mediation has failed,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - A prominent Syrian opposition leader said on Thursday U.N. mediation to end the country s six-year conflict has failed and the revolution would continue. Riyad Hijab, chairman of the Saudi-backed High Negotiations Committee (HNC), rejected comments by U.N. special envoy Staffan de Mistura that President Bashar al-Assad s opponents must accept they have not won the war.  De Mistura s statements reflect the defeat of U.N. mediation,  Hijab wrote on Twitter.  The Syrian revolution continues,  he said. De Mistura had repeatedly made  un-studied  remarks on the conflict, he said. Hijab, a former Syrian prime minister under Assad, called for a new a U.N.  approach on the Syrian issue , without elaborating. Assad has won a series of military victories but rebel groups still hold large parts of the northwest of the country and substantial enclaves in the southwest, in Homs province and near Damascus. De Mistura said on Wednesday the opposition must be  unified and realistic  in accepting it had not won the war. He did not say Assad was victorious.  Victory can only be if there is a sustainable political long-term solution,  de Mistura said, suggesting the conflict was almost over because many countries were involved principally to defeat Islamic State and a national ceasefire should follow. The remarks come ahead of a round of Syria talks between Damascus allies Russia and Iran and opposition backer Turkey in Astana next week. Several rounds of negotiations in Astana and a separate U.N.-sponsored track in Geneva between the government and the HNC have produced no visible progress on ending the war that broke out after a popular uprising in 2011. Russia and Iran have stood by Assad. Some Western countries have softened their initial stance that he should leave power immediately, saying he could be part of a transitional period.

"Pakistan's anti-corruption agency starts criminal investigation into ex-PM, finance minister","ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan s anti-corruption agency will open a criminal investigation into former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and current finance minister Ishaq Dar, it said on Thursday. Sharif was ousted in July after the Supreme Court deemed him unfit to hold office for not declaring a small source of income, and ordered the agency, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), to instigate a criminal investigation into him, his family and Dar. The agency said its investigation would rely on the evidence collected by a Supreme Court-appointed six-man panel that was investigating the Sharif family s wealth and included officers from powerful military intelligence agencies.  The chairman (of) NAB directed that the prosecution of the cases will be followed up vigorously in the concerned Accountability Courts,  the agency said in a statement. Sharif, his family, and Dar have denied any wrongdoing.  The three-time premier said he never received the income that investigators said he did not declare.  Sharif has said there was a conspiracy against him but did not identify anyone. Instead, he named long-time loyalist Shahid Khaqan Abbasi as his replacement as prime minister until the next election, expected in mid-2018. Pakistan has for decades been plagued by pervasive graft, as well as by rivalry between the military and civilian politicians. The NAB s conviction rates are notoriously low and Sharif has multiple investigations by the agency pending against him, including one dating back to 1999. ",worldnews,"September 7, 2017 ",1
French police find more explosives after raid near Paris,"PARIS (Reuters) - French police unearthed a second stash of explosive materials near Paris on Thursday after a similar find in a nearby suburb on Wednesday, a justice official said as three suspects were questioned by anti-terrorism investigators. Thursday s swoop was carried out at a garage rented by one of the three detained in the wake of Wednesday s raid on an apartment in Villejuif, on the southern edge of the French capital, the source said. Materials used to produce TATP, an explosive often used by suicide bombers, were found at the flat after a plumber phoned  police to report suspect activity there, Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said.  Two people in their 30s and 40s were arrested in the immediate wake of Wednesday s raid, said Collomb, who added that the suspects were being questioned on suspicion of terrorist activity despite talking of a bank heist. A third man was arrested overnight, a source said.  Those under investigation spoke of wanting to blow up a bank with the TATP but they way we see it is they have links with terrorism, and this is the channel of investigation,  Collomb told public radio station franceinfo. That line of inquiry was prompted by information found in telephone communications after the raid, he added. The minister spoke before developments later in the day in which police found explosive materials at a garage in Thiais, southeast of Paris.  More than 230 people have been killed by Islamist-inspired attackers in the past three years in France, which along with the United States and other countries are bombing Islamic State bases in Iraq and Syria. TATP, an unstable explosive, has been used by militants in several attacks in western Europe in recent years, including Manchester in May, Brussels in 2016 and Paris in 2015.

Florida residents heed Irma warnings after Harvey's destruction,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (Reuters) - Hurricane Harvey s destruction in Texas may not have altered Florida s well-tested storm plans, but it appears to have infused residents with a new sense of urgency as they prepare for approaching Hurricane Irma. Officials said Harvey s devastating flooding, coupled with the sheer power of Irma, ranked as the strongest Atlantic storm on record, had sharpened the focus of Floridians who were somewhat indifferent about preparing for past hurricanes.  A lot of times they end up having hurricane parties here instead of evacuating,  Monroe County spokeswoman Cammy Clark said by phone.  That s been the opposite this time around.  Monroe County includes the Florida Keys, which ordered evacuations for all residents and tourists. Clark said she saw a steady stream of traffic leaving the travel destination as she drove to work early on Wednesday. The U.S. National Hurricane Center forecasts that Irma may strike southern Florida on Saturday, when it could still be a major hurricane.  As it neared Puerto Rico on Wednesday with maximum sustained winds of 185 miles per hour (295 kph), Irma was a Category 5 storm, the highest level on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale of intensity.  This storm is bigger, faster and stronger than Hurricane Andrew,  Florida Governor Rick Scott told a news conference on Wednesday, referring to one of the costliest storms in U.S. history that struck southern Miami-Dade County 25 years ago. For south Florida, Hurricane Irma  is a once-in-a-generation storm. It s the Big One for us,  Ed Rappaport, acting director of the hurricane center, told WFOR-TV in Miami on Wednesday evening.  Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez on Wednesday evening announced mandatory evacuations for most of the county s coastal cities beginning at 9 a.m. (1300 GMT) on Thursday. Miami-Dade has a population of 2.7 million. The evacuation orders affect more than 100,000 residents, the Miami Herald reported. Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine had already urged residents of that city on Tuesday to evacuate.  We don t want any heroes,  he said.  We want people to bring themselves to a safer place than a barrier island.  Officials across Florida said they saw signs of people taking Irma more seriously than past storms.  Residents were stocking up on water and batteries and even complaining that county leaders were not being quick enough to announce evacuations, said Don Walker, spokesman for Brevard County Emergency Management. Houston officials were criticized for not ordering an evacuation ahead of the flooding that left hundreds of people in the country s fourth-largest city trapped in their homes.  Everyone is really in tune with this storm system. My neighbors are talking about it, and we don t usually do that,  Walker said. For years, many Florida residents, joined by an ever-growing number of newcomers, paid little heed to hurricane warnings as most opted to stay in their homes, county officials said. Not this time around.  I ll tell you for the community, heck yeah, they re taking this more seriously,  said Teri Barbera, spokeswoman for the Palm Beach County Sheriff s Office, noting that many stores were out of bottled water by Monday.  They re not playing.  ",worldnews,"September 7, 2017 ",1
China tightens control of chat groups ahead of party congress,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China issued new rules on instant messaging chat groups on Thursday, tightening control over online discussions ahead of a sensitive leadership reshuffle next month. Beijing has been ramping up measures to secure the internet and maintain strict censorship, a process that has accelerated ahead of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party, when global attention will be on the world s No.2 economy. Group chats on instant messaging apps and online commenting threads have seen a surge in popularity in China in recent years as forums for discussion, partly because they are private for members and so in theory are subject to less censorship. Internet chat service providers must now verify the identities of their users and keep a blog of group chats for no less than six months, the Cyberspace Administration of China said in a statement released on its website  The rules, which take effect on Oct 8, just before the congress is due to begin, will cover platforms provided by China s internet titans, such as Tencent s WeChat and QQ, Baidu s Tieba and Alibaba s Alipay chat.  The regulations also require companies to establish a credit system, and to provide group chat services to users in accordance to their credit rating, CAC said. Chat group participants who break the rules will see their credit scores lowered, their rights to manage group chats suspended or revoked and should be reported to the relevant government department, it added. The CAC did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment sent after office hours on Thursday.     The administration also said the owner of the chat group should bear responsibility for the management of the group.  Whoever owns the group should be responsible, and whoever manages the group should be responsible,  it said. The new rules are the latest requirement for China s internet giants, who have already been subject to investigations from the CAC into their top social media sites for failing to comply with cyber laws.  The administration has already taken down popular celebrity gossip social media accounts and extended restrictions on what news can be produced and distributed by online platforms, and has embarked on a campaign to remove virtual private network apps, which allow users to access websites blocked by the authorities.

'And then they exploded': How Rohingya insurgents built support for assault,"YANGON (Reuters) - When the former U.N. chief Kofi Annan wrapped up his year-long probe into Myanmar s troubled northwest on Aug. 24, he publicly warned that an excessive army response to violence would only make a simmering conflict between Rohingya insurgents and Myanmar security forces worse. Just three hours later, shortly after 8 p.m., Rohingya insurgent leader Ata Ullah sent a message to his supporters urging them to head to the foot of the remote Mayu mountain range with metal objects to use as weapons. A little after midnight, 600 km northwest of the country s largest city Yangon, a rag-tag army of Rohingya militants, wielding knives, sticks, small weapons and crude bombs, attacked 30 police posts and an army base.  If 200 or 300 people come out, 50 will die. God willing, the remaining 150 can kill them with knives,  said Ata Ullah in a separate voice message to his supporters. It was circulated around the time of the offensive on mobile messaging apps and a recording was subsequently reviewed by Reuters. The assault by Ata Ullah s group, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), was its biggest yet. Last October, when the group first surfaced, it attacked just three police border posts using about 400 fighters, according to Myanmar government estimates. The Myanmar army is now estimating up to 6,500 people took part in the August offensive. Its ability to mount a much more ambitious assault indicates that many young Rohingya men have been galvanized into supporting ARSA following the army crackdown after the October attacks, according to interviews with more than a dozen Rohingya and Rakhine villagers, members of the security forces and local administrators. The brutal October response led to allegations that troops burned down villages and killed and raped civilians. The crisis in ethnically-riven Rakhine state is the biggest to face Myanmar s leader Aung San Suu Kyi, and her handling of it has been a source of disillusionment among the democracy champion s former supporters in the West. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres appealed to Myanmar authorities on Tuesday to end violence against Rohingya Muslims, warning of the risk of ethnic cleansing, a possible humanitarian catastrophe, and regional destabilisation. Rohingya leaders and some policy analysts say Suu Kyi s failure to tackle the grievances of the Muslim minority, who have lived under apartheid-like conditions for generations, has bolstered support for the militants. The fledgling militia has been transformed into a network of cells in dozens of villages, capable of staging a widespread offensive. Myanmar s government has declared ARSA a terrorist organisation. It has also accused it of killing Muslim civilians to prevent them from cooperating with the authorities, and of torching Rohingya villages, allegations the group denies. The latest assault has provoked a major counteroffensive in which the military says it killed almost 400 insurgents and in which 13 members of the security forces have died. Rohingya villagers and human rights groups say the military has also attacked villages indiscriminately and torched homes. Myanmar government says it is carrying out a lawful counter-terrorism operation and that the troops have been instructed not to harm civilians.  Nearly 150,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh since Aug. 25, leading to fears of a humanitarian crisis. Some 26,750 non-Muslim villagers have also been displaced inside Myanmar. Suu Kyi has said she would adopt recommendations of Kofi Annan s panel that encouraged more integration. She has also previously appealed for understanding of her nation s ethnic complexities. In a statement on Wednesday, she blamed  terrorists  for  a huge iceberg of misinformation  on the strife in Rakhine. She made no mention of the Rohingya who have fled. Suu Kyi s spokesman, Zaw Htay, could not be immediately reached for comment.  On Monday, however, he told Reuters Myanmar was carrying out a counterterrorism operation and taking care of  the safety of civilians, including Muslims and non-Muslims.  In an interview with Reuters in March, Ata Ullah linked the creation of the group to communal violence between Buddhists and Muslims in Rakhine in 2012, when nearly 200 people were killed and 140,000, mostly Rohingya, displaced.  We can t turn the lights on at night. We can t move from one place to another during the day,  he told Reuters in previously unpublished remarks, referring to restrictions placed on the Rohingya population s behaviour and movements.  Everywhere checkpoints: every entry and every exit. That s not how humans live.  A Rohingya community leader who has stayed in northern Rakhine said that, while the rest of Myanmar enjoyed new freedoms under Suu Kyi after decades of military rule, the Muslim minority have been increasingly marginalized. Support for the insurgents grew after the military operation last year, he said.  When the security forces came to our village, all of the villagers apologised and asked them not to set the houses on fire - but they shot the people who made that request,  he said.  People suffered because their sons got killed in front of them even though they begged for mercy, their daughters, sisters were raped - how could they live without constantly thinking about it, that they want to fight against it, whether they die or not.  Reuters couldn t independently confirm the villagers  accounts. Last month, a Myanmar government probe - led by former head of military intelligence and now Vice President, Myint Swe - rejected allegations of crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing during the crackdown last year.  Villagers and police officers in the area say that ARSA had since last October established cells in dozens of villages, where local activists then recruited others.  People shared their feelings with others from the community, they talked to each other, they told their friends or acquaintances from different regions   and then they exploded,  said the Rohingya community leader. Rohi Mullarah, a village elder from the Kyee Hnoke Thee village in northern Buthidaung, said the leaders sent their followers regular and frequent messages via apps like WhatsApp and WeChat, encouraging them to fight for freedom and human rights and enabling them to mobilize many people without the risk of being caught going into the heavily militarised areas to recruit.  They mainly sent phone messages to the villagers, they didn t ... move people from place to place,  he said. He said his village was not involved in the insurgency and even posted a signboard in front of it that said any militants would be attacked by the villagers if they attempt to recruit people. Many Rohingya elders have for decades rejected violence and sought dialogue with the government. While ARSA has now gained some influence, especially among young, disaffected men, many Rohingya elders have condemned the group s violent tactics. In recent months there had been reports of killings of local administrators, government informers and village chiefs in the Rakhine region, leading to speculation the insurgents were adopting brutal tactics to stop information on their activities from leaking to the security forces.  They cut out the government communication by instigating a campaign of fear and took charge in the region,  said Sein Lwin, police chief in Rakhine. . An army source directly involved in operations in northern Rakhine also said it was now much more difficult to get information on ARSA s plans.  The strategy resulted in the  shut down of government mechanisms  in some places  because no government servants dared to stay there , the army source said. A village head from northern Buthidaung township, who asked not to be named, said the insurgents called him several times pressing him to allow some young villagers to take part in their training - an offer he refused.  I tried to stay safe and sometimes I had to sleep at the police station and local administrator s house,  he said. Despite the largely successful clamp down on information by the insurgents, it was a tip off by an informer that stopped the Aug. 25 attacks from being much worse for the Myanmar security services, the army source said.   About an hour after Ata Ullah s men headed for the jungle in the evening of Aug. 24, the army received a signal from the Rohingya informer saying the attack was coming. The 9 p.m. message mentioned imminent multiple attacks, but it did not say where they would occur. The warning was enough for the security forces to withdraw some troops to larger stations and to reinforce strategic locations, saving many lives on the government side, the military source said. The raids by the insurgents came in waves from around 1 a.m. until sunrise, and took place mostly in Maungdaw township where Ata Ullah staged his three attacks in October. This time, though, the distance between the northern- and southern-most points was as long as 100 km (60 miles). The Rohingya also struck in the north of the neighbouring Buthidaung township, including an audacious bid to storm an army base.  We were surprised they attacked across such a wide geographical area - it shook the whole region,  said the army source.

Cuban dissidents in electoral challenge as Castro era nears end,"HAVANA (Reuters) - Opponents of the Cuban government are putting forward an unprecedented number of candidates for municipal elections in late October, the first step in a process to select a new president after nearly 60 years of the Castro brothers  rule. The electoral cycle comes at a tricky time for the Caribbean nation as the Castros  revolutionary generation dies off, an economic reform program appears stalled, aid from key ally Venezuela shrinks, and the Trump administration threatens. The municipal vote, the only part of the electoral process with direct participation by ordinary Cubans, is expected to attract 35,000 candidates for the island s 168 municipal assemblies. It will be followed by provincial and national assembly elections in which candidates are selected from slates by commissions. The new national assembly will in late February select a successor to President Raul Castro, 86, who has announced he will step aside after two terms. Raul, younger brother and successor to Fidel Castro who died in November, will retain a grip on power as head of the Communist Party, the only legal party in Cuba. The elections are being cast in state-run media as a show of support for the Castros  1959 revolution rather than an opportunity to debate the pressing issues. Campaigning is prohibited and candidates for the 12,515 ward delegate positions are nominated at neighborhood meetings based on their personal merits, not policy positions. They need not belong to the Communist Party and many candidates are independents but only few government opponents have ever competed. During the last election, the three dissidents nominated lost at the polls.  This year, however, one coalition of opposition groups, Otro18 (Other18), says it is running more than 160 candidates in the municipal elections, demanding electoral reform and government transparency.  This is unheard of,  said Boris Gonzalez, 41, one of the aspiring Otro18 candidates, explaining they wanted to challenge the Communist Party from within the system. Otro18 spokesman Manuel Cuesta Morua said in an interview that its candidates had faced harassment and threats by state security forces for months and had been warned not to participate. The government has not responded to these accusations.    The Communist Party says it does not intervene in the elections, but a video circulating on social media of First Vice President Miguel Diaz-Canel, Raul Castro s probable successor, suggested otherwise.  There are six initiatives for the 2018 elections that seek to propose counter-revolutionaries as candidates,  Diaz-Canel told Communist Party cadres in the video.  We are taking steps to discredit all that.   In this battle, which we are already fighting, we are going to be involved in this whole process in the second half of the year,  he said. The government has not commented on the video. Cuba brands all dissenters as mercenaries funded by foreign governments and exiles, out to topple the government. Even if a few dissident candidates beat the odds and are elected to municipal assemblies, they have little chance of getting any further. The candidates for the provincial and national assemblies are nominated by commissions composed of representatives of Communist Party-controlled organizations such as the trade union federation and Committees in Defense of the Revolution. The slates have had the same number of names as seats in previous elections. Up to 50 percent of those names must be ward delegates. After the general election, the assemblies elect their respective executives and on Feb. 24 the new National Assembly is scheduled to name a new president and other members of the Council of State.

Does not make sense to keep Charter of Fundamental Rights post-Brexit: UK minister,"LONDON (Reuters) - It does not make sense for Britain to retain the European Union s Charter of Fundamental Rights after it leaves the bloc, Britain s Brexit minister David Davis said. Parliament began debating legislation on Thursday to sever political, financial and legal ties with the EU, but the opposition Labour Party has said it cannot support the bill without it being amended to better protect workers  rights.  We also do not believe it would make sense to retain the Charter of Fundamental Rights,  Davis told parliament.  The charter only applies to member states when acting within the scope of EU law. We will not be a member state nor will we be acting within the scope of EU law once we leave. He added:  The charter catalogues the rights found under EU law which will be brought into UK law by the bill. It is not, and never was, the source of those rights.

China tightens regulation of religion to 'block extremism',"BEIJING (Reuters) - China s cabinet on Thursday passed new rules to regulate religion to bolster national security, fight extremism and restrict faith practiced outside organizations approved by the state. The document passed by Premier Li Keqiang updates a version of rules put into place in 2005 to allow the regulation of religion to better reflect  profound  changes in China and the world, the official Xinhua news agency reported. The rules released by Xinhua use strong and specific language about the need to protect China s national security against threats from religious groups.  Religious affairs maintenance should persist in a principle of maintaining legality, curbing illegality, blocking extremism, resisting infiltration and attacking crime,  the regulations say.      Any group or individual must not create conflict or contention between different religions, with a single religion or between religious individuals and non-religious individuals,  they say.     President Xi Jinping has emphasized the need to guard against foreign infiltration through religion and the need to prevent the spread to  extremist  ideology, while also being tolerant of traditional faiths that he sees as a salve to social ills.         The officially atheist ruling Communist Party says it protects freedom of religion, but it keeps a tight rein on religious activities and allows only officially recognized religious institutions to operate. The rules, which come into effect on Feb 2, 2018, also place new oversight on online discussion of religious matters, on religious gatherings, the financing of religious groups and the construction of religious buildings, among others. They increase existing restrictions on unregistered religious groups to include explicit bans on teaching about religion or going abroad to take part in training or meetings. Much of China s religious practice, which has seen a revival in recent decades despite being effectively banned in the 1960s during the Cultural Revolution, takes place in informal settings not recognized, though often tolerated, by the authorities. Religious education is also further brought under the umbrella of the state in the regulations, with explicit provisions on the establishment and registration of religious colleges. New provisions are included on the use and raising of religious funds and on taxation. Donations from foreign groups or individuals, for example, are banned, while donations over 100,000 yuan ($15,420) need to be reported to authorities. Fines for breaking the rules have also been increased in the new version and the organizers of unapproved events can now be subject to fines from 100,000 to 300,000 yuan, rather than the previous 1 to 3 times the amount spent on the event.

"Malaysia says foils hijacking of Thai tanker, 10 pirates arrested","KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysian authorities thwarted the hijacking of a Thai oil tanker on Thursday and arrested 10 suspected Indonesian pirates on board the ship, a maritime security agency commander said. A special team from the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA) stormed the MT Tanker MGT1, off the coast of the northeastern state of Terengganu, nearly 10 hours after it was reported missing on Wednesday. While the 10 were detained on the tanker, three suspects on a smaller boat nearby managed to escape, and an MMEA vessel has been sent to find them, the agency s chief, Maritime Admiral Zulkifli Abu Bakar, said in a statement. The boat was spotted near the tanker by a surveillance aircraft.  Warning shots were fired from the aircraft when the boat tried to escape but the attempt to stop them failed as the aircraft was running low on fuel,  Zulkifli said. Zulkifli identified the 10 suspected pirates that were arrested as Indonesian nationals. None of the 14 crew members on the tanker, all Thais, was hurt. The tanker, which was transporting 2.2 million liters of diesel valued at about 7 million ringgit ($1.66 million), had been escorted to the town of Kuala Terengganu to help with the  investigations into the case. Piracy in Southeast Asian waters, including its busy international shipping lanes, has been a problem for years. ",worldnews,"September 7, 2017 ",1
Sri Lanka court jails top former senior officials for graft,"COLOMBO (Reuters) - A Sri Lankan court on Thursday jailed and fined two top officials in former president Mahinda Rajapaksa s government for misappropriation of funds, a lawyer said, the first convictions in a series of investigations into official corruption. The government of President Maithripala Sirisena unseated Rajapaksa in 2015 on promises to expose corruption and is under pressure to follow through. Sirisena s administration has been probing money laundering and misappropriation of state property in more than 50 cases, but no one had been convicted until Thursday. Colombo High Court sentenced Lalith Weeratunga, former secretary to Rajapaksa, and Anusha Palpita, ex-head of the state-run Telecommunication Regulatory Commission, to three years of  rigorous imprisonment , or jail with hard labor, and fined them 52 million rupees ($340,760) each. Election monitors had complained that the state fund was used to influence voters ahead of 2015 presidential polls. Kalinga Indratissa, the lawyer who appeared on behalf of Weeratunga and Palpita, told Reuters the two would appeal. Two of Rajapaksa s sons, Namal and Yoshitha, have been arrested and released on bail over money laundering allegations.  His brother, Basil, who headed the economic development ministry, has also been arrested at least three times - twice over suspicion of misuse of anti-poverty funds and a once over suspicion of laundering money and released on bail. Rajapaksa and his family deny any wrongdoing.  Rajapaksa was president for a decade until January 2015 and is popular among ethnic majority Sinhala Buddhists who credit him with ending the 26-year-war against minority Tamil separatist rebels in 2009.

U.S. Navy to transport damaged destroyer from Singapore to Japan,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The U.S. Navy plans to transport the USS John S. McCain to Japan for a full damage assessment after a collision last month in which ten sailors died between Malaysia and Singapore. Moving the McCain to Yosuka, where the navy has repair and maintenance facilities, would allow the crew to be close to their families, the Naval Systems Command Office said in a news release on Thursday. The guided missile destroyer is currently moored at Singapore s Changi Naval Base. The move is notionally planned for late September. The McCain suffered significant damage in the collision with a tanker east of the Straits of Malacca and Singapore on Aug. 21. Compartments, including berthing, machinery, and communications rooms, were flooded.

France's Macron urges continued EU ties with Turkey,"PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron said Turkey remained a vital partner of the European Union and ties should be maintained even if the country had strayed from the EU path, according to a newspaper interview published on Thursday. A senior Turkish official said EU states must decide whether they wanted Turkey as a member, but there was a sense  they no longer want the marriage...(but) want cohabitation . Comments from the French president followed German Chancellor Angela Merkel s remarks in a television debate on Sunday that the EU should halt membership talks with Ankara.  Turkey has indeed strayed away from the European Union in recent months and worryingly overstepped the mark in ways that cannot be ignored,  Macron told Greece s Kathimerini newspaper.  But I want to avoid a split because it s a vital partner in many crises we all face, notably the immigration challenge and the terrorist threat.  The EU is eager to preserve a deal with Turkey that has stemmed the mass migration via Turkish territory of people from conflict areas. Turkey has in the past questioned the EU s sincerity in keeping its side of the arrangement.  Relations with Ankara and the European Union have deteriorated since a failed July 2016 coup that has been followed by the arrests of tens of thousands of people across the country. Critics accuse President Tayyip Erdogan of using the coup attempt as pretext for a reckoning political opponents. Turkey, which signed an association agreement with the EU in 1963, began formal negotiations to join the union in 2005. However, several members, including France, have opposed talks on certain subjects meaning that only 16 negotiation chapters out of 35 have been opened.  Speaking to reporters in Paris, Turkey s ambassador echoed President Erdogan s comments that the EU had to make its mind up about membership and dismissed any notion of an alternative  special partnership .  Integrating Turkey into the EU is not a Turkish question, but a European question now. Of course we have the impression of being duped,  Ismail Hakki Musa told reporters in Paris.   They no longer want the marriage they want cohabitation. For a privileged partnership it s too late and Europe must now be honest and sincere.   Turkey s relationship with France is not as bad as that with Germany, but ties have been strained following the arrest of French journalists in the country. The most recent, Loup Bureau, was seized by Turkish border guards on the frontier with Iraq in early August. Musa said Macron and Erdogan had asked their respective interior and justice ministers to find a way to solve the problem.    We have to find a solution without tainting the fundamentals of the Turkish system,  he said. France s foreign minister is due in Ankara on Sept. 14.   Finland s Foreign Minister Timo Soini, arriving in Brussels for talks with counterparts, said he was against ending membership talks with Turkey.  It s always useful to have a dialogue. We know there are problems with human rights in Turkey.  While Macron has sought not to anger Erdogan since taking office, when responding in an interview last month on why being on the world stage was not so easy, Macron appeared to take a veiled swipe at the Turkish president.       I am the one who has to talk with Erdogan every 10 days,  he told Le Point without elaborating. ",worldnews,"September 7, 2017 ",1
Indian court sentences two Mumbai 1993 blasts convicts to death,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - An Indian court on Thursday sentenced to death two men convicted of involvement in India s most deadly bombings, a series of blasts in the city of Mumbai that killed 257 people in 1993, while two others were jailed for life. Investigators said the bombs were ordered by India s most wanted man, gangster Dawood Ibrahim, to avenge the demolition of the historic Babri mosque in north India by Hindu hardliners in 1992, during a period of religious conflict. Ibrahim is believed to be hiding in Pakistan. Pakistan denies that. The court sentenced Feroz Abdul Rashid Khan and Taher Merchant to death, while Abu Salem and Karimullah Khan were jailed for life, a lawyer for the federal police, Deepak Salvi, told reporters. A fifth man, Riyaz Siddiqui, was sentenced to 10 years in prison, Salvi said. Lawyers for the convicted men did not answer their telephones, and it was not immediately known if they would appeal against the sentences. Legal proceedings against those accused of being involved in the bombings have resulted in more than 100 convictions, most of which are still winding their way through the legal system because of appeals and commutations of sentences. One suspect in the case, Yakub Memon, was hanged in 2015. In June, a court had ruled the five guilty of involvement in the blasts that shook India s financial hub more than two decades ago. A six man also found guilty at that time died in prison before sentencing. ",worldnews,"September 7, 2017 ",1
Dutch prime minister: 'enormous devastation' on Saint Martin,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Hurricane Irma has caused  enormous devastation  to the Dutch side of the Caribbean island of Saint Martin and cut off electricity and gas, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said on Thursday. Most communications with the outside world are being conducted via the military, he said, adding that there was  no clarity  on victims. The Dutch navy, which has two ships stationed off the coast of the island, tweeted images gathered by helicopter showing damaged houses, hotels and boats. French authorities have counted at least eight dead on the French side of the island.  Dutch Interior Minister Ronald Plasterk said he briefly had contact with Saint Martin s prime minister but communications are sporadic. He said nine patients at a hospital in the country had been evacuated by Dutch military helicopter. Sint Maarten is an independent nation within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, with a population of around 40,000   about the same as the French side. Images of the country s Juliana Airport showed the landing strips appeared intact, though the navy said the airport is  unreachable  for now. Andre van der Kamp, commander of the Dutch ship Zeeland, tweeted that the Zeeland and Pelikaan would be trying to moor on Sint Maarten to deliver emergency aid on Thursday, but they needed to complete a safety check of the port first.

Hurricane Irma likely to drop to Category 4 upon landfall in Florida: NHC,"(Reuters) - Hurricane Irma is likely to be downgraded to a Category 4 storm by the time it makes landfall in Florida, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Thursday. Irma, at present a Category 5 storm packing maximum sustained winds of 180 miles (285 km) per hour, is moving off the northern coast of the Dominican Republic, the NHC said.   It has become a little less organized over the past few hours but the threat of direct hurricane impacts in Florida over the weekend and early next week continues to increase, it said. Hurricane watches were in effect for the northwestern Bahamas and much of Cuba. Irma, one of the most powerful Atlantic storms in a century, killed eight people on the Caribbean island of Saint Martin and left Barbuda devastated on Thursday. Meanwhile, a hurricane swirling in the Gulf of Mexico, Katia, which is about 195 miles (310 km) northeast of Veracruz with maximum sustained winds of 80 miles per hour (130 km per hour), is likely to gain near major hurricane strength by landfall, the NHC said. A third hurricane in the Atlantic, Jose, has strengthened slightly and is expected to intensify further over the next 48 hours, it added. Hurricane Jose is about 815 miles (1,310 km) east of the Lesser Antilles with maximum sustained winds of 90 miles per hour (150 km per hour), the Miami-based weather forecaster said.

Indonesian school a launchpad for child fighters in Syria's Islamic State,"SUKAJAYA, Indonesia (Reuters) - Hatf Saiful Rasul was 11 years old when he told his father, a convicted Islamic militant, that he wanted to leave school and go to Syria to fight for Islamic State. The boy was visiting his father in a maximum security prison during a break from Ibnu Mas ud, his Islamic boarding school, Syaiful Anam said in a 12,000 word essay on his son and religion that was published online.  At first, I did not respond and considered it just a child s joke,  he wrote.  But it became different when Hatf stated his willingness over and over.  Hatf told his father some of his friends and teachers from Ibnu Mas ud had gone to fight for Islamic State and  become martyrs there , Anam wrote. Anam agreed to let him go, noting in his essay that the school was managed by  comrades who share our ideology . Hatf traveled to Syria with a group of relatives in 2015, joining a group of French fighters. Reuters spoke to three Indonesian counter-terrorism officials who confirmed the boy went to Syria.  Indonesia is the world s most populous Muslim-majority country and most of its people practice a moderate form of Islam. But there has been a recent resurgence in militancy and authorities believe Islamic State has more than 1,200 followers in Indonesia while about 500 Indonesians have left to join the group in Syria. Drawing on court documents, registration filings and interviews with counter-terrorism police and former militants, Reuters has found that Hatf was one of at least 12 people from Ibnu Mas ud who went to the Middle East to fight for IS or attempted to go there between 2013 and 2016.   Eight were teachers, four were students. At least another 18 people linked to the school have been convicted, or are now under arrest, for militant plots and attacks in Indonesia, including the three deadliest attacks in the country in the past 20 months, according to counter-terrorism police and trial documents of convicted militants. For details, click here: tmsnrt.rs/2wDwgPD Jumadi, a spokesman for Ibnu Mas ud, denied the school supported IS or any other militant Islamist group, or taught any extreme or ultra-violent interpretation of Islam. Ibnu Mas ud is one of about 30,000 Islamic boarding schools, or pesantren, across Indonesia. Most educate students in Islam and other subjects, but a handful are linked to extremism and act as centers for recruitment, Indonesian police and government officials say. Ibnu Mas ud has been in existence for a decade, despite its links to militants. Irfan Idris, the head of deradicalization at Indonesia s national counter-terrorism agency, blamed weak laws and bureaucracy for the lack of action against such schools.  Basically, it s not our domain, it s the religious ministry,  he told Reuters.  We have informed the ministry that you have a problem with Ibnu Mas ud.  Asked about the school s links to militants and why it had not been shut down, Kamaruddin Amin, the director general of Islamic education at Indonesia s Ministry of Religious Affairs, said:  Ibnu Mas ud never registered as a pesantren.  Jumadi confirmed the school was not registered with the ministry. The local government, Amin added,  had requested an explanation regarding the status of their study but did not get a response.  Jumadi confirmed recent discussions with local government officials about the school s teaching.  We have no curriculum,  he said, a reference to the emphasis on teaching the Koran.   We re focused on the tahfiz, on memorizing the Koran, and the Hadith (the sayings of the Prophet Mohammad),  he said.  We teach students about the Arabic language, about faith and the history of Islam.  Jumadi said Hatf studied at Ibnu Mas ud but he did not know the circumstances of his leaving. He said he was unaware of any staff or students traveling to Syria to join IS, other than three teachers and one student detained in Singapore last year. Mustanah, a former student deported from Iraq in August, has told police several ex-students from Ibnu Mas ud had traveled to Syria, two counter-terrorism officials told Reuters. Nestled in the foothills of Mount Salak, a dormant volcano, in the village of Sukajaya, 90 km (55 miles) south of Indonesia s capital Jakarta, Ibnu Mas ud is a ramshackle complex of classrooms, dormitories and prayer rooms that hosts up to 200 students from elementary school to junior high. A Reuters team entered the school in June but was not allowed to tour the premises and was eventually asked to leave. Inside a mosque that forms part of the complex, young boys dressed in Arabic tunics and skull caps could be seen sitting in a circle holding their Korans, smiling and fidgeting as they waited for their lessons. In a courtyard, young girls were scampering about. They looked no older than five or six and  were wearing headscarves. In a video viewed by Reuters but later taken down from Youtube, principal Masyahadi outlines the institution s adherence to Salafism, an ultra-conservative brand of Sunni Islam that urges followers to emulate the lives of the earliest disciples of Mohammad and embrace sharia law.  Ibnu Mas ud ensures that Muslim children are preoccupied with efforts to understand their religion correctly so they become a generation that understands the religion and will fight for the religion,  he says. Asked if fighting for the religion included taking up arms, Jumadi, the spokesman, said  it would need further discussion to answer that question  before declining to elaborate further. According to documents presented in court, Ibnu Mas ud was founded in 2007 in Depok, a Jakarta satellite town, by Aman Abdurrahman, a jailed cleric and Indonesia s leading Islamist ideologue.  The deed of establishment of the foundation that runs Ibnu Mas ud lists three people among its executives who were jailed with Abdurrahman for setting up a militant training base in the Indonesian province of Aceh in 2009. Sofyan Tsauri, a former militant who said he has made donations to the school, told Reuters Ibnu Mas ud  was for the children of Ikhwan (Islamic fighters)  to study while also serving as the hub of safehouses for Islamist fugitives. Dulmatin, who had a $10 million bounty on his head for taking part in a 2002 bombing on the Indonesian resort island of Bali in which 202 people were killed, prayed at Ibnu Mas ud while he was on the run, according to court documents related to the Aceh trials of Abdurrahman and the three foundation executives. Dulmatin was killed by police in 2010. After the trials, Ibnu Mas ud moved from Depok in 2010 but it ran into problems at its current location as well when a teacher tried to set fire to bunting celebrating Indonesia s independence day on August 17. The incident was confirmed by police and local villagers. People in the area were already suspicious about activities at the school, village chief Wahyudin Sumardi said.  Every time there was a terrorist incident elsewhere, the authorities would come,  he told Reuters in July.  I m not comfortable with the whole situation.  After complaints by villagers, local authorities have asked Ibnu Mas ud to leave by September 17, but Jumadi said this week that the school was negotiating to stay. The school may look for a new location if forced to move, he said. Pesantren have deep roots in Indonesia, harking back centuries, when they were the main form of education for most poor and rural people. Even as Indonesia s education system modernized and state-run secular schools were introduced, the overwhelmingly private Islamic boarding schools remain important. Amin, at Indonesia s Ministry of Religious Affairs, told Reuters in July that the ministry was working on a new policy to standardize the curriculum in pesantren and assume control of their approval. No policies have yet been announced. Anam, Hatf s father, told Reuters in handwritten comments in response to questions during a court hearing in Jakarta in July that he was proud of his son. Photos viewed by Reuters, which Anam said were taken in Syria and posted on social media by Hatf, showed the boy at a meal with older men and one in which the fresh-faced youngster is holding an AK-47 rifle almost as big as himself. Hatf could disassemble the rifle in 32 seconds, Anam wrote. He was also issued  a 9mm handgun, 2 hand grenades, a commando knife and compass.  By his father s account, citing messages sent by his son, Hatf survived one air strike, flying through the air from the force of an explosion and emerging with only a bloody ear and hearing loss. On September 1, 2016, two months short of his 13th birthday, Hatf was hit by another air strike. Shortly thereafter, the death of three Indonesians near the Syrian city of Jarabulus was announced by IS. The  merry little mujahid  was dead, wrote Anam in his essay,  his tattered little body crushed by the bomb .    I do not feel sad or loss, except a limited sadness as a father who was left by his beloved child,  Anam told Reuters in the notes he provided at the court hearing.  Instead I felt happy because my child has achieved martyrdom, inshallah.  ",worldnews,"September 7, 2017 ",1

"Germans most afraid of terrorism, secure about finances: study","BERLIN (Reuters) - Fear of terrorism, political extremism and social tension due to mass migration are Germans  top concerns as they prepare to vote in a federal election, a survey showed on Thursday. Worries about jobs and the economy have meanwhile fallen to record lows, according to the annual study by insurer R+V.  Having presided over an economic upswing that has boosted wages and created jobs, Chancellor Angela Merkel is widely expected to win a fourth term in the Sept. 24 election.      Some voters from her conservative alliance have however defected to the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) over her decision in 2015 to open Germany s borders to hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing war in Syria and Iraq. The R+V study showed terrorism remained the top fear, worrying 71 percent of Germans compared to 73 percent last year,  Security officials have said the country should brace for further violence by Islamist militants after it was hit by five attacks in 2016, including one in December on a Berlin Christmas market that killed 12 people.  The fear of terror attacks is clearly in first place and is at one of the highest levels that has ever been measured,  said Brigitte Roemstedt, who heads the R+V Info Centre that surveyed around 2,400 Germans. Political extremism was the second biggest worry, troubling 62 percent of Germans compared with 68 percent last year, while 61 percent fear that immigration could provoke social tension, down from 67 percent. R+V said fear of unemployment and a poor economic situation were at record lows, while concerns about natural disasters and contaminated food had increased. ",worldnews,"September 7, 2017 ",1
North Korea pledges 'powerful counter measures' against U.S.-backed sanctions,"VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (Reuters) - North Korea on Thursday pledged to take  powerful counter measures  to respond to U.S. pressure or any new sanctions against it over its missile program, accusing Washington of wanting war.  Pyongyang s pledge, made in a statement by its delegation to an economic forum in Russia s Far East, came after the United States said it wanted the U.N. Security Council to impose an oil embargo on North Korea, ban the country s exports of textiles and the hiring of North Korean laborers abroad, and subject leader Kim Jong Un to an asset freeze and travel ban, according to a draft resolution seen by Reuters on Wednesday.  We will respond to the barbaric plotting around sanctions and pressure by the United States with powerful counter measures of our own,  the statement read. The same statement also accused South Korea and Japan of using the Russian forum to play  dirty politics,  saying the event was meant to be about discussing economic cooperation in the region and not about criticizing its missile program. Russian President Vladimir Putin told the same forum on Thursday he thought the North Korea crisis would not escalate into a large-scale conflict involving nuclear weapons, predicting that common sense would prevail.

New Zealand's Labour widens lead as governing party loses ground,"WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand s newly invigorated Labour Party has widened its lead over the governing National Party, further threatening its decade-long hold on power, a poll showed on Thursday, as the two party leaders exchanged jabs at their third debate in a week. National fell 2 points to 39 percent, while support for the opposition Labour Party was unchanged at 43 percent, the poll released on the website of the 1 News broadcaster showed. New Zealand holds a general election on Sept. 23. The poll still tipped the nationalist New Zealand First as a likely kingmaker, and showed the Green Party would only just make it into parliament. Jacinda Ardern has almost single-handedly changed the chances of her Labour Party since taking over as leader last month, with her charisma and popularity offsetting some criticism over vague tax plans and tighter immigration policy. National leader Bill English, who is pinning his bid on his government s strong economic record, said he was not particularly worried about the poll results.  On those numbers it would seem to me that a Labour/New Zealand First government would be the more likely outcome, but that all depends on a number of negotiations,  said Grant Duncan, associate professor at Massey University in Auckland.  Based on these numbers, New Zealand First would be a key player for both Labour and National.  The New Zealand dollar fell to the day s low of $0.7173, having stood at $0.7207 shortly before the poll results were released.  The poll showed support for the New Zealand First Party rose 1 point to 9 percent, while support for the Green Party remained at 5 percent.  Duncan said the Greens were  perilously close  to the 5 percent voting threshold below which you do not get a seat in parliament. Ardern reiterated that her first call would be to the Green Party, with which she has a working agreement, if she was in a position to form a coalition government after the vote. The debate saw the party leaders trade jabs on taxes and housing, much as in their two previous encounters. It also touched on allegations this week by National that there is a NZ$11.7 billion hole in Labour s fiscal plans - a claim rejected by Labour and one that has been refuted by economists, according to media.

Turkey's economy minister defends predecessor over Iran sanctions charges,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey s economy minister said on Thursday his predecessor Zafer Caglayan, charged in the United States with conspiring to evade U.S. sanctions against Iran, had done nothing to harm his country.  Caglayan did not do anything against Turkey s interests,  Nihat Zeybekci told reporters.  It is no concern to Turkey if Caglayan acted against interests of other countries.   Zeybekci also said the case against Caglayan remained unverified.  There are claims that these sanctions are violated, but the ones who claim these things are obliged to prove them.  U.S. prosecutors have charged Caglayan, a former Turkish economy minister, and the former head of a Turkish state bank with conspiring to evade U.S. sanctions against Iran, widening an investigation that has fueled tension between Washington and Ankara.

UK Brexit minister says 'good prospect' of agreeing transitional deal with EU,"LONDON (Reuters) - There is a good prospect Britain will negotiate a transitional arrangement with the European Union before it leaves the bloc in March 2019, Britain s Brexit minister David Davis said on Thursday. Davis said Britain had only raised the issue of transition briefly with the EU so far in negotiations as it is not among the first four issues due to be discussed. Asked by a lawmaker what prospects there were for bespoke transitional arrangements being agreed and implemented by March 2019, Davis told parliament:  We are finding that the (European) Commission is open to discussion of transition ... I think there is a very good prospect.  Parliament is on Thursday due to begin debating legislation to sever political, financial and legal ties with the EU, and the opposition Labour Party has said it cannot support the bill without it being amended to better protect workers  rights. Junior Brexit minister Steve Baker told lawmakers the government would not accept any amendments to the bill that compromised its purpose. ",worldnews,"September 7, 2017 ",1

Putin rues awarding U.S. top diplomat Tillerson Russian state honor,"VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (Reuters) - Vladimir Putin took a jab at Rex Tillerson on Thursday, joking that the U.S. Secretary of State had  fallen in with the wrong company  since he had awarded him a Russian state honor for his contribution to Russian-U.S. relations. Hopes of detente in Moscow s relations with Washington under   Donald Trump, who had praised President Putin before winning the White House, have faded as the countries have imposed sanctions and expelled diplomats in recent months.  Addressing a U.S. citizen at a plenary session of an economic forum in the far eastern city of Vladivostok, Putin said:  We awarded your compatriot Mr. Tillerson the Order of Friendship, but he seems to have fallen in with the wrong company and to be steering in the other direction.   I hope that the wind of cooperation, friendship and reciprocity will eventually put him on the right path,  Putin added, drawing cheers from the crowd. In 2013 Putin awarded Tillerson, then CEO of energy giant Exxon Mobil, the Order of Friendship, a Russian state honor, for his  significant contribution to strengthening cooperation in the energy sector . Russia s relations with the United States deteriorated over its annexation of the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea in 2014 and support for pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine, prompting Washington to impose economic sanctions against Moscow.  The Kremlin, which has denied U.S. allegations it meddled in the presidential vote, had heaped praise on Trump during his election campaign, saying it supported efforts to improve Russian-American relations.  But Trump, who was faced scrutiny over the alleged ties of his entourage with Russia, reluctantly signed into law fresh sanctions against Moscow, further straining relations.

"Putin thinks North Korea crisis will not go nuclear, diplomacy to prevail","VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday he thought the North Korea crisis would not escalate into a large-scale conflict involving nuclear weapons, predicting that common sense would prevail. But he said he believed North Korea s leadership feared any freeze of its nuclear program would be followed by what amounted to  an invitation to the cemetery . Putin, speaking at an economic forum in the far eastern Russian port of Vladivostok alongside his South Korean counterpart and the Japanese prime minister, had previously warned that simmering tensions around Pyongyang s missile program could tip into  global catastrophe . But on Thursday, after days of talks with regional leaders and officials, Putin struck a more optimistic note, saying Russia could see that the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump wanted to defuse tensions around North Korea.  I am sure that things will not go as far as a large-scale conflict, especially with the use of weapons of mass destruction,  Putin told delegates at the forum.  All the competing sides have enough common sense and understanding of their responsibility. We can solve this problem through diplomatic means.  Russia has a land border with North Korea less than 20 km (12 miles) long. Putin, who was sharing a platform with South Korean counterpart Moon Jae-in and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, has spent the past few days pushing for negotiations, calling on all sides to dial down rhetoric.  The United States wants the U.N. Security Council to impose an oil embargo on North Korea, ban its , and subject leader Kim Jong Un to an asset freeze and travel ban, according to a draft resolution seen by Reuters on Wednesday. Putin gave no indication on Thursday whether Moscow would back that resolution; but he and top Russian government officials have previously condemned the idea of tightening sanctions and shown little enthusiasm to stop modest fuel exports to Pyongyang or send home North Korean workers. Instead, Russia, along with China, has advocated a  freeze for freeze  plan, under which the United States and South Korea would stop major military exercises in exchange for North Korea halting its weapons programs. Neither side appears willing to budge so far however. Putin said Pyongyang would not end its nuclear and missile programs because it viewed them as its only means of  self-defense.  It s impossible to scare them,  said Putin. Pyongyang was being offered the prospect of no new sanctions if it froze its weapons programs, but Putin said North Korea believed the wider risks to its own security outweighed the potential economic benefits of such a concession.  We are telling them that we will not impose sanctions, which means you will live better, you will have more good and tasty food on the table, you will dress better,  said Putin.  But the next step, they think, is an invitation to the cemetery. And they will never agree with this.  ",worldnews,"September 7, 2017 ",1
Gruesome Uganda murders put police role in the public dock,"KAMPALA (Reuters) - A spate of unsolved murders of young women in Uganda is putting rare public pressure on a police force long accused by opposition politicians of spending more time suppressing political dissent than tackling crime. Widespread media coverage of the appearance of 20 corpses beside roadsides south of the capital since May reflects public anger with police for repeatedly saying they have arrested the perpetrators, only for another body to be discovered.  It s terrifying,  Susan Kabul, 29, told Reuters, standing near the garbage-littered bank of a drainage channel where the latest murder victim was discovered.  The police need to tell us who is slaughtering people like this.  The government has defended the police, and police say they have arrested 30 suspects and charged 13 of them, listing possible motives ranging from domestic rows through sexual abuse to ritual murder linked to human sacrifice.  Ritual killing is one of the motives that we suspect, we also think there might be cases of jilted lovers,  police spokesman Asan Kasingye said by telephone.  Other theories might come up as investigations progress.  There have been occasional individual cases of alleged ritual murder in the east African nation, but this is the first time there has been such a large number of people killed in similar circumstances in the same area. In a nod to the public outrage, lawmakers stopped work for two days this week after the 20th body was found, saying ministers had failed to appear before the legislature over the killings in three districts on the outer edge of Kampala. Government spokesman Ofwono Opondo accused them of populism.  They spoke as if the government is doing nothing,  he said.  They should leave police to work without pressure.  The legislature is dominated by supporters of longstanding President Yoweri Museveni, who has been in power since 1986. The constitution was changed in 2005 to remove a two-term limit, allowing him to extend his rule, and parliament is discussing removing an age cap. His son is a major general and powerful presidential adviser. Opposition leader Kizza Besigye, who contends that Museveni stole his victory in last year s election, has been charged with treason. Police often break up opposition rallies with teargas, beatings or detentions.  The opposition and rights activists have long accused security forces of neglecting crime to focus on political control.  Police can t secure women in a small area - all the attention is on politics, on who is criticizing Museveni,  said Sarah Birete of the Centre for Constitutional Governance. Government spokesman Opondo said police were doing a good job.  Some people start disguised as political activists and degenerate to criminals, I think they are unhappy that the police is on their back,  he said.  The police is right to focus on all forms of crime that can cause insecurity.  Uganda is ranked among the world s most corrupt countries by watchdog Transparency International. The Ugandan government s inspector general said in a 2014 report that the police force was  the most corrupt public institution in the country  and noted crimes were rarely investigated. In Wakiso, the district south of Kampala where most of the victims have been found, few residents have faith that the killings will stop.  I have stopped moving about at night. He could be a serial killer. I don t know where he will strike next,  said Deo Busulwa, who lives a stone s throw from the canalside bank location of the latest grisly discovery, of mother-of-two Maria Nabilawa. Many residents suspect the victims are killed elsewhere and the bodies dumped. Kasingye said they had arrested Nabilawa s husband in connection with her killing.

Gaston Browne, prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda, told the BBC that about half of Barbuda s population of some 1,800 were homeless while nine out of 10 buildings had suffered some level of devastation, many of them total destruction.  We flew into Barbuda only to see total carnage. It was easily one of the most emotionally painful experiences that I have had,  Browne said in an interview on BBC Radio Four.  Approximately 50 percent of them (residents of Barbuda) are literally homeless at this time. They are bunking together, we are trying to get ... relief supplies to them first thing tomorrow morning,  he said, adding that it would take months or years to restore some level of normalcy to the island.

Australia's High Court rejects challenge to vote on same-sex marriage,"Melbourne (Reuters) - Australia s High Court rejected two legal challenges on Thursday against a proposed postal ballot on whether to legalize same-sex marriage, clearing the way for a vote on an issue that has wide support but which has also threatened to divide the government. Australians will now begin voting in the non-compulsory ballot as early as next week, with a result expected some time in November. The court s decision to reject the legal challenges, both of which argued that the center-right government needed the support of parliament to hold the ballot, comes as a welcome relief for Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. Turnbull supports same-sex marriage, as do two-thirds of Australians, but his government holds a razor-thin majority and more conservative elements in his Liberal-National coalition have used the issue to threaten his leadership. Some conservative lawmakers threatened to resign if the court ruled against the proposal, while more liberal members said they would side with the Labor opposition to secure same-sex marriage before Turnbull offered the postal vote as an alternative. A rejection would have led to increased pressure on Turnbull to hold a vote in parliament, which has already twice rejected a national ballot.  Every Australian can have a say and we can, as a Commonwealth of Australia, embrace this important social change,  Turnbull told parliament in Canberra after the court s decision was announced. Turnbull has said Australia s Marriage Act would be changed by the end of the year if the public backed same-sex marriage in the postal ballot. Although the court s verdict provides a viable pathway to same-sex marriage, advocates fear an escalation in an already vitriolic campaign. Turnbull called for mutual respect last month as the issue gathered heat. Opponents of same-sex marriage launched a contentious  No  campaign advertisement last week that the government immediately rejected as inaccurate. Activists fear a surge in malicious campaigning for the ballot, which is not a formal election and is therefore not subject to the usual rules on political advertisements. Many supporters of same-sex marriage in Australia had backed the legal challenges, insisting that the campaign would hurt people who were already vulnerable, but said they would now support the ballot.  We now get out there and campaign long and hard for a  Yes  vote,  Alex Greenwich, co-chair of Australian Marriage Equality, told reporters in Melbourne.  When we win this, we can all come together, having finally achieved marriage equality.   ",worldnews,"September 7, 2017 ",1
EU should impose more sanctions on North Korea-foreign policy chief,"TALLINN (Reuters) - The European Union should add more sanctions on North Korea as part of international pressure following Pyongyang s largest nuclear test to date, the bloc s foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said on Thursday. While sanctions have so far done little to stop North Korea boosting its nuclear and missile capacity, Federica Mogherini said more such steps were required along with piling on political pressure.  I would propose to ministers today to strengthen the economic pressure on North Korea, supporting a new U.N. Security Council resolution adopting tougher economic measures, starting new autonomous EU sanctions... and working with other partners in the world to make sure that everybody implements fully and strictly the already-decided economic measures,  Mogherini told reporters before meeting the EU defense and foreign ministers in the Estonian capital. The United States and China are discussing options to rein in Pyongyang and South Korea has deployed a defense system aimed at countering North Korean missile attacks. No formal EU decision is expected from the bloc on Thursday and its leverage on Pyongyang, as well as Russia and China   North Korea s main ally   is limited.   It has to be pursued because the alternative in our view is and could be extremely dangerous, especially if in front of you have an interlocutor that might act quite irrationally.

Factbox: New Zealand 2017 election - main parties and policies,"(Reuters) - New Zealand s two main parties are neck and neck in opinion polls after the appointment of a charismatic leader boosted the opposition Labour Party, threatening the governing National Party s decade-long hold on power. The election is on Sept 23. Below are the main parties  positions on key issues: ECONOMYNew Zealand s once booming economy is facing some capacity constraints. Unemployment is at an eight-year low and a labor shortage, most noticeably in construction, threatens to curb growth. Both main parties plan to be fiscally prudent and maintain a budget surplus, but would differ on monetary policy. National plans to cut net debt to 10-15 percent of GDP by 2025, while Labour and the Green Party both plan to cut it to 20 percent of GDP within five years of taking office. Labour proposes adding full employment to the existing inflation mandate of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, which economists say could lead to easier monetary policy and fuel longer-term inflation. To form a government, National may be more dependent on New Zealand First, which favors greater currency intervention - something New Zealand has been reluctant to do in the past. National is planning to adjust tax thresholds, or effectively deliver tax cuts, from April 2018 to boost family income. Labour wants to do away with National s planned tax cuts and boost tax credits and subsidies. New Zealand s house prices have risen more than 50 percent in the past decade as the construction industry failed to keep up with demand from a growing population, fueled by record migration and an increasing number of New Zealanders staying home. Labour criticizes National for leaving the housing crisis unresolved after nine years in government. It wants to ban overseas buyers from purchasing existing homes and build 100,000 affordable homes over 10 years. It also plans to create a housing authority to speed up residential development. National questions Labour s ability to build so many houses while curbing immigration. It plans to make NZ$1 billion available to speed up the development of 60,000 houses. New Zealand First wants to ban foreign non-residents from owning a home in New Zealand, except in particular cases, and to  provide government assistance for first-home buyers. The Green Party wants to provide 10,000 new houses over 10 years for low-income groups through a rent-to-buy scheme. The National Party tightened eligibility criteria this year for immigration and believes current levels of immigration are about right to meet the economy s needs. Labour plans to reduce net immigration by up to 30,000 from record levels of over 70,000 annually and to charge every visitor a NZ$25 fee, which would be ring-fenced for a NZ$75 million infrastructure fund. The Greens want to review immigration policy to make sure migrants match the skills employers need, in line with Labour s policy. New Zealand First wants to curb immigration by ensuring New Zealand workers have the first chance at jobs and by capping the number of older migrants. National wants to expand New Zealand s international trade. Among other plans, it wants to complete the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, launch a free trade deal with the European Union and Britain post-Brexit and upgrade its free trade agreement with China. Labour wants to reconsider New Zealand s role in the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact if provisions on foreign investment are not changed to allow the New Zealand government to restrict investment into the country. New Zealand First wants to renegotiate the TPP. ",worldnews,"September 7, 2017 ",1

Philippine president's son denies links to $125-million drug shipment,"MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte s son on Thursday told a Senate inquiry he had no links to a seized shipment of $125 million worth of narcotics from China, dismissing as  baseless  the allegations of his involvement in the drugs trade. Opponents of the president, who has instigated a fierce crackdown on a trade he says is destroying the country, say they believe his son Paolo may have helped ease the entry of the drug shipment at the port in Manila, the capital.  On Tuesday Duterte said he had told Paolo to attend the senate investigation if he had nothing to hide, besides advising him not to answer questions and invoke his right to keep silent.  I cannot answer allegations based on hearsay,  Paolo Duterte, the vice mayor of the southern city of Davao, told the Senate.   My presence here is for the Filipino people and for my fellow Davaoe os whom I serve,  he added, referring to the people of Davao, where his father served as mayor for more than two decades before being elected president in 2016.  The Philippine leader has repeatedly said he would resign if critics could prove any members of his family were involved in corruption. Senator Antonio Trillanes, a staunch critic of the president, displayed to the Senate panel photographs of Paolo Duterte beside a businessman who was behind the shipment in which the alleged drugs were found. The president s son-in-law, Manases Carpio, who has also been accused of links to the May drug shipment from China, told the hearing he had no involvement.  Duterte unleashed his bloody campaign the day he took office on June 30 last year, after promising Filipinos he would use deadly force to wipe out crime and drugs. Police records show more than 3,800 people have died in police operations since July last year, and more than 2,100 other reported murders are linked to drugs. Police reject activists  allegations that they are executing suspected drug users and dealers and say officers shoot only in self-defense. Trillanes said he had intelligence information from an undisclosed foreign country that Paolo Duterte was a member of a criminal syndicate, citing as proof a  dragon-like  tattoo with secret digits on his back.  Asked about the tattoo, Duterte said he had one, but declined to describe it, invoking his right to privacy. Asked by Trillanes if he would allow a photograph to be taken of the tattoo and sent to the U.S Drug Enforcement Agency to decode secret digits, Duterte said:  No way . He refused to respond to questions about his bank accounts, calling them  irrelevant . Presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella said the attendance of Duterte and Carpio  demonstrates that both gentlemen are willing and ready to face malicious allegations intended to impugn their character and credibility.

Fire at building in India's Mumbai kills at least six,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - A blaze in a building under construction in a suburb of the Indian city of Mumbai killed at least six people, most of them laborers, and injured nearly a dozen, fire and police officials said on Thursday. The cause of the fire, which broke out late on Wednesday, was being investigated, a fire service officer said. It is likely to compound concern about safety in the financial hub after an old building collapsed last week killing 34 people. Laborers working on the building were living on the ground floor, some with families, and cooking gas canisters were believed to have exploded in the fire, fuelling its spread.  Though the fire was brought under control immediately, all injuries and deaths occurred before the arrival of the fire brigade,  said P.S. Rahangdale, chief officer at the Mumbai Fire Brigade. Eleven people were injured, eight of them critically, he said. Mumbai has endured torrential monsoon rain and serious flooding over recent weeks.

"U.S. airlines brace themselves, passengers for Hurricane Irma","(Reuters) - As Hurricane Irma bore down on the southern United States on Wednesday, airlines adjusted flight schedules, made cancellations and assured passengers they would not have to pay unusually high fares ahead of the storm s arrival. Irma, the second powerful hurricane to approach the United States in as many weeks, was expected to make landfall in Florida by the weekend. It had already pummeled islands in the Caribbean with rain, pounding winds and surging surf by Wednesday. While the storm s precise trajectory remained uncertain, airlines preemptively canceled flights in the likely affected regions and put in place travel waivers for customers to reschedule plans. American Airlines, the largest U.S. carrier by passenger traffic, said on Wednesday it would begin winding down operations in south Florida, including Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach, on Friday. Miami-bound flights arriving on Friday from Europe and South America were canceled. American, Delta Air Lines and JetBlue all announced fare caps on flights out of Florida - $99 on JetBlue and American and $399 on Delta - for residents trying to get out of the storm s path.  We want those trying to leave ahead of the hurricane to focus on their safe evacuation rather than worry about the cost of flights,  JetBlue spokesman Doug McGraw said. Airlines have been criticized in the past for raising prices in the wake of deadly episodes and, as Irma approached, some social media users accused carriers of engaging in price-gouging schemes ahead of the dangerous storm.  In response, Senators Richard Blumenthal and Edward Markey called on the U.S. Department of Transportation on Wednesday to launch an investigation into potential opportunistic fare hikes by airlines.   It would certainly be offensive if airlines   who rely on publicly supported infrastructure and have been bolstered by American taxpayers for nearly a century   used this opportunity to impose unconscionable costs on consumers,  they wrote in a letter to Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao.  Accusations of unfair pricing techniques have been investigated in the past, including after a deadly Amtrak derailment in 2015, but U.S. officials said last year they found no evidence of wrongdoing in that instance. United Airlines, which took a substantial financial hit when Hurricane Harvey slammed into Texas last week, said it had suspended operations out of San Juan, Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory that was being raked by the very powerful Category 5 hurricane on Wednesday afternoon, and had extended a travel waiver to include cities in south Florida. In some cases, carriers added flights and upsized aircraft out of Florida and the Caribbean before the storm struck to accommodate as many passengers evacuating the area as possible. Fort Lauderdale-based Spirit Airlines said it expected its largest operational hub to be affected and planned to move its operations center to Detroit on Thursday evening. Beyond U.S. airlines, Canadian carriers Air Transat and WestJet Airlines both launched evacuation operations on Wednesday to remove passengers that could be affected by Hurricane Irma in the Dominican Republic, and Air Canada allowed passengers to change flights in impacted areas free-of-charge. WestJet, Canada s second-largest carrier, operated rescue flights to Punta Cana and Puerto Plata on Wednesday and could make additional trips to Santa Clara and Cayo Coco, Cuba, on Thursday, airline spokeswoman Lauren Stewart said. Carnival Cruise Lines, which has major operations in Florida, canceled two of its Bahamas-bound cruises and said it was likely that other schedules would be affected as the storm s path and impact became more clear.

Trump says U.S. not 'putting up with' North Korea's actions,"WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) - President Donald Trump warned on Wednesday that the United States would no longer tolerate North Korea s actions but said the use of military force against Pyongyang will not be his  first choice.  His comment appeared to be in line with classified briefings to Congress in which Trump s top national security aides - Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence - stressed the search for a diplomatic solution to the crisis, lawmakers said. A senior administration official, meanwhile, said that the White House has set aside for now consideration of exiting a free trade pact with South Korea, a move being contemplated by Trump that could have complicated relations with Seoul. In a flurry of phone calls with world leaders days after North Korea s sixth and most powerful nuclear test, Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping committed to  take further action with the goal of achieving the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,  the White House said.  President Xi would like to do something. We ll see whether or not he can do it. But we will not be putting up with what s happening in North Korea,  Trump told reporters, though he offered no specifics.  I believe that President Xi agrees with me 100 percent,  he added. Asked whether he was considering a military response to North Korea, Trump said:  Certainly, that s not our first choice, but we will see what happens.  Xi, who has been under pressure from Trump to do more to help curb North Korea s nuclear and missile programs, told the U.S. president during their 45-minute call that the North Korean issue must be resolved through  dialogue and consultation.  The focus on negotiations by China, North Korea s main trading partner, contrasted with Trump s assertions over the last few days that now was not the time for talks with North Korea while pressing instead for increased international pressure on Pyongyang. The United States and South Korea have asked the United Nations to consider tough new sanctions on North Korea after its nuclear test on Sunday that Pyongyang said was an advanced hydrogen bomb. Late on Wednesday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin indicated that if the U.N. Security Council fails to approve sufficiently strong measures, Trump could authorize him to impose sanctions on any country or entity that trades with North Korea.  We believe that we need to economically cut off North Korea,  Mnuchin told reporters aboard Air Force One as it flew back from North Dakota, where Trump gave a speech on tax reform.  I have an executive order prepared. It s ready to go to the president. It will authorize me to . . . put sanctions on anybody that does trade with North Korea.  Mnuchin said that Trump would consider the order  at the appropriate time once he gives the U.N. time to act.  He provided no further details, including whether Trump would consider slapping sanctions on China, North Korea s largest trade partner. Russian President Vladimir Putin insisted on Wednesday that resolving the North Korean nuclear crisis was impossible with sanctions and pressure alone. Putin met South Korea s Moon Jae-in on the sidelines of an economic summit in the eastern Russian city of Vladivostok amid mounting international concern that their neighbor plans more weapons tests, including possibly a long-range missile launch before a weekend anniversary. Putin echoed other world leaders in denouncing North Korea s latest nuclear bomb test on Sunday, saying Russia did not recognize its nuclear status.  Pyongyang s missile and nuclear program is a crude violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions, undermines the non-proliferation regime and creates a threat to the security of northeastern Asia,  Putin said at a news conference.  At the same time, it is clear that it is impossible to resolve the problem of the Korean peninsula only by sanctions and pressure,  he said. No headway could be made without political and diplomatic tools, Putin said. Moon, who took office this year advocating a policy of pursuing engagement with North Korea, has come under increasing pressure to take a harder line. He has asked the United Nations to consider tough new sanctions after North Korea s latest nuclear test. The United States wants the Security Council to impose an oil embargo on North Korea, ban the country s exports of textiles and the hiring of North Korean laborers abroad and subject leader Kim Jong Un to an asset freeze and travel ban, according to a draft resolution seen by Reuters on Wednesday. Diplomats say the U.N. Security Council could also consider barring the country s airline.  I ask Russia to actively cooperate as this time it is inevitable that North Korea s oil supply should be cut at the least,  Moon told Putin, according to a readout from a South Korean official. Putin said North Korea would not give up its nuclear program no matter how tough the sanctions.    We too, are against North Korea developing its nuclear capabilities and condemn it, but it is worrying cutting the oil pipeline will harm the regular people, like in hospitals,  Putin said, according to the South Korean presidential official.  Russia s exports of crude oil to North Korea were tiny at about 40,000 tonnes a year, Putin said. By comparison, China provides it with about 520,000 tonnes of crude a year, according to industry sources. Last year, China shipped just over 96,000 tonnes of gasoline and almost 45,000 tonnes of diesel to North Korea, where it is used across the economy, from fishermen and farmers to truckers and the military. Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa May agreed in a telephone call on Tuesday that China must do more to persuade North Korea to cease its missile tests, a spokesman for May said. Sanctions have done little to stop North Korea boosting its nuclear and missile capacity as it faces off with Trump, who has vowed to stop it from being able to hit the U.S. mainland with a nuclear weapon. China and Russia have advocated a  freeze for freeze  plan, where the United States and South Korea stop major military exercises in exchange for North Korea halting its weapons programs, but neither side is willing to budge. North Korea says it needs to develop its weapons to defend itself against what it sees as U.S. aggression. South Korea and the United States are technically still at war with North Korea after the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce, not a peace treaty. China objects to both the military drills and the deployment in South Korea of an advanced U.S. missile defense system that has a radar that can see deep into Chinese territory. South Korea s Defence Ministry said the four remaining batteries of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system would be deployed on a golf course in the south of the country on Thursday. Two THAAD batteries have already been installed. For a graphic on nuclear North Korea, click: here ",worldnews,"September 2, 2017 ",1

"U.N. mulls U.S. push for North Korea oil embargo, textile export ban","UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United States wants the United Nations Security Council to impose an oil embargo on North Korea, ban the country s exports of textiles and the hiring of North Korean laborers abroad, and subject leader Kim Jong Un to an asset freeze and travel ban, according to a draft resolution seen by Reuters on Wednesday. The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, has said she wants the 15-member council to vote on Monday on the draft resolution to impose new sanctions over North Korea s sixth and largest nuclear test. However, Russia s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia has said a Monday vote may be  a little premature.  It was not immediately clear if the draft resolution had the support of North Korean ally China. Russian President Vladimir Putin insisted on Wednesday that resolving the North Korean nuclear crisis was impossible with sanctions and pressure alone. A U.N. resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the United States, Britain, France, Russia or China to pass. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday that if the Security Council did not act, he had an executive order prepared to send to President Donald Trump that would  authorize me to stop doing trade and put sanctions on anybody that does trade with North Korea.   The president will consider that at the appropriate time once he gives the U.N. time to act,  Mnuchin told reporters.  Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously adopted eight resolutions ratcheting up sanctions on North Korea over its ballistic missile and nuclear programs. Haley said the incremental approach had not worked and a diplomatic solution could only be reached by imposing the strongest sanctions. The new draft U.N. resolution would ban exports to North Korea of crude oil, condensate, refined petroleum products and natural gas liquids. China supplies most of North Korea s crude. According to South Korean data, Beijing supplies roughly 500,000 tonnes of crude oil annually. It also exports 200,000 tonnes of oil products, according to U.N. data. Russia s exports of crude oil to North Korea are about 40,000 tonnes a year. The Security Council last month imposed new sanctions over North Korea s two long-range missile launches in July. The Aug. 5 resolution aimed to slash by a third Pyongyang s $3 billion annual export revenue by banning coal, iron, lead and seafood. The new draft resolution would remove an exception for transshipments of Russian coal via the North Korean port of Rajin. In 2013 Russia reopened a railway link with North Korea, from the Russian eastern border town of Khasan to Rajin, to export coal and import goods from South Korea and elsewhere. The Aug. 5 resolution capped the number of North Koreans working abroad at the current level. The new draft resolution would impose a complete ban on the hiring and payment of North Korean laborers abroad. Some diplomats estimate that between 60,000 and 100,000 North Koreans work abroad. A U.N. human rights investigator said in 2015 that North Korea was forcing more than 50,000 people to work abroad, mainly in Russia and China, earning between $1.2 billion and $2.3 billion a year. The wages of workers sent abroad provide foreign currency for the Pyongyang government. The draft resolution would ban textiles, which were North Korea s second-biggest export after coal and other minerals in 2016, totaling $752 million, according to data from the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency (KOTRA). Nearly 80 percent of the textile exports went to China. The assets of military-controlled airline Air Koryo would be frozen if the draft resolution is adopted. It flies to Beijing and a few other cities in China, including Dandong, the main transit point for trade between the two countries. It also flies to Vladivostok in Russia. Along with blacklisting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, the draft resolution would impose a travel ban and asset freeze on four other senior North Korean officials. The Worker s Party of Korea and the government of North Korea would also be subjected to an asset freeze. The draft resolution would allow states to intercept and inspect on the high seas vessels that have been blacklisted by the Security Council. Currently nearly two dozen vessels are listed and the new draft text would add another nine ships. The draft resolution does not contain any new language on the political track. It again reaffirms council support and calls for a resumption of talks between North Korea, the United States, South Korea, China, Japan and Russia. China and Russia have been pushing their proposal to kick-start talks with a joint suspension of North Korea s ballistic missile and nuclear programs and the military exercises by the United States and South Korea. Haley has dismissed the suggestion as  insulting.  ",worldnews,"September 6, 2017 ",1
Myanmar plays diplomatic card to avert U.N. censure over Rohingya,"YANGON/SHAMLAPUR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Myanmar said on Wednesday it was negotiating with China and Russia to ensure they block any U.N. Security Council censure over the violence that has forced an exodus of nearly 150,000 Rohingya Muslims to Bangladesh in less than two weeks. Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi blamed  terrorists  for  a huge iceberg of misinformation  on the strife in the northwestern state of Rakhine but, in a statement, she made no mention of the Rohingya who have fled. Suu Kyi has come under increasing pressure from countries with Muslim populations, including Indonesia, where thousands led by Islamist groups rallied in Jakarta on Wednesday to demand that diplomatic ties with Buddhist-majority Myanmar be cut. In a rare letter to the U.N. Security Council, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed concern the violence could spiral into a  humanitarian catastrophe .  He warned on Tuesday that there was a risk of ethnic cleansing in Myanmar that could destabilize the region. Myanmar National Security Adviser Thaung Tun said Myanmar was counting on China and Russia, both permanent members of the Security Council, to block a U.N. resolution on the crisis.  We are negotiating with some friendly countries not to take it to the Security Council,  he told a news conference.  China is our friend and we have a similar friendly relationship with Russia, so it will not be possible for that issue to go forward.  Russia s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said he believed the 15-member Security Council had sent a signal, by meeting behind closed doors on the issue a week ago, that it would like to see the situation calm down.   We called for restraint,  he told reporters on Tuesday.  The Security Council for the time being did what it could do.  The U.S. State Department said Washington was  deeply concerned by sustained reports of significant violence and the impact on civilian populations, including the Rohingya community.  These reports include allegations of violence conducted by security forces and civilians, as well as additional attacks by ARSA,  a spokesman said, referring to Arakan Rohingya Solidarity Organization insurgents.  The spokesman said the United States had discussed the issue with Myanmar  at the highest levels  and was also in touch with its neighbors and other international partners.  We welcome indications that the government is committed to providing access to humanitarian aid via the Red Cross, and we look forward to learning further details.  he added.  Reuters reporters in Bangladesh s Cox s Bazar region have witnessed boatloads of exhausted Rohingya arriving near the border village of Shamlapur. According to the latest estimates from U.N. workers operating there, arrivals in 12 days stood at 146,000. This brought to 233,000 the total number of Rohingya who have sought refuge in Bangladesh since last October. New arrivals told authorities that three boats carrying a total of more than 100 people capsized in early on Wednesday. Coastguard Commander M.S. Kabir said six bodies, including three children, had washed ashore. The surge of refugees, many sick or wounded, has strained the resources of aid agencies and communities helping hundreds of thousands from previous violence in Myanmar. Many have no shelter, and aid agencies are racing to provide water, sanitation and food.  People have come with virtually nothing so there has to be food,  a U.N. source working there said.  So this is now a huge concern   where is this food coming from for at least the elderly, the children, the women who have come over without their husbands?  Suu Kyi spoke by telephone on Tuesday with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who has pressed world leaders to do more to help a population of roughly 1.1 million he says are facing genocide. In a statement issued by her office on Facebook, Suu Kyi said the government had  already started defending all the people in Rakhine in the best way possible  and warned against misinformation that could mar relations with other countries. She referred to images on Twitter of killings posted by Turkey s deputy prime minister that he later deleted because they were not from Myanmar.  She said that kind of fake information which was inflicted on the deputy prime minister was simply the tip of a huge iceberg of misinformation calculated to create a lot of problems between different countries and with the aim of promoting the interests of the terrorists,  her office said in the statement. Suu Kyi on Wednesday met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who said he shared Myanmar s concern about  extremist violence  in Rakhine state. Modi s government has taken a strong stance on an influx into India of some 40,000 Rohingya from Myanmar over the years, vowing last month to deport them all. The latest violence began when Rohingya insurgents attacked dozens of police posts and an army base. The ensuing clashes and a military counter-offensive killed at least 400 people and triggered the exodus of villagers to Bangladesh. Suu Kyi has been accused by Western critics of not speaking out for the minority that has long complained of persecution, and some have called for the Nobel Peace Prize she won in 1991 as a champion of democracy to be revoked. Myanmar says its security forces are fighting a legitimate campaign against  terrorists  it blames for a string of attacks on police posts and for burning homes and civilian deaths. It says 26,747 non-Muslims have been displaced. Fleeing Rohingya and rights monitors say the Myanmar army is  conducting a campaign of arson and killings to force them from their homes. Two Bangladesh government sources said Myanmar had been laying landmines across a section of its border for the past three days, possibly to prevent the return of fleeing Rohingya. Bangladesh will formally lodge a protest on Wednesday against the laying of land mines so close to the border, said the sources who had direct knowledge of the situation but asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.  A Myanmar military source said landmines were laid along the border in the 1990s to prevent trespassing and the military had since tried to remove them, but none had been planted recently.

"By land, river and sea, Rohingya make their escape from Myanmar","COX S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - When his family of six crossed the monsoon-soaked Mayu mountains last week, Mohammed Ishmail tied his four-year-old daughter to his back with a longyi, or Myanmar sarong. His wife carried their two-year-old the same way.  Some parts were so steep we had to pull ourselves up by tree roots,  said Ishmail, a Rohingya Muslim, in an interview  near the Kutapalong settlement for refugees in Bangladesh, shortly after arriving on Tuesday.  At night, we just cut a clearing in the bush and slept there. We had two umbrellas for shelter.  The trek through the dense bush of the mountains took two days, but the journey from his home in Khin Tha Ma village   which he says was on fire the last time he saw it - took 10. He says it felt like a month. The number of refugees who have arrived in Bangladesh from Myanmar s Rakhine state since militant attacks there on Aug. 25 stands at nearly 150,000.  They have come by land, river and sea. Many have died along the way. Others have found themselves detained by human traffickers, demanding payment for their rescue. Their destination is the Cox s Bazar region of impoverished Bangladesh, where hundreds of thousands of Rohingya already live in makeshift camps, reliant on overstretched aid agencies. Once through the mountains, Ishmail s family came across villages in the northern part of the Maungdaw district   the epicenter of violence in the state since October - that had been abandoned. By his count, only about one in 20 houses had survived fires that have swept the area.  Some people are still hiding in the forest on the Maungdaw side but in some villages there s no one,  he said.  There was no one to ask directions.  But then there was. As they reached a canal and were trying to find a way to cross it, he said, two young Myanmar soldiers spotted them and aimed their guns, he said.  I put my hands up and shouted,  We re going to Bangladesh ,  he said. There was a tense silence before the soldiers lowered their weapons.   After that they showed us the best way to cross the canal,  he added. In one village, to escape the rain, Mohammed Ishmail entered a house still standing to find the bodies of five boys, who appeared to be teenagers, their necks hacked and heads nearly severed. The death toll in the conflict is more than 400 and rising. Myanmar says most of those killed have been insurgents, but accounts from new arrivals in Bangladesh suggest reprisals by Myanmar security forces and Buddhists against Rohingya civilians the government says are in cahoots with  extremist Bengali terrorists . Myanmar rejects accusations that its security forces are targeting civilians saying they are fighting  terrorists . Dozens of bodies, including those of women and children, have washed up on the Bangladesh side of a border river, many with bullet or knife wounds, according to Bangladesh border guards. Fishermen report seeing bodies floating in the river. Reuters was shown one cadaver   what looked to be a teenage boy lying face up on the muddy river bank, a gaping wound on his face washed clean by the river.     In Maungdaw, thousands of people are on the move. A Rohingya aid worker, who was in touch with Reuters during his flight, recorded video of the journey on his mobile phone.  It s like something I ve never seen before, not even in any film,  the refugee said after his arrival in Cox s Bazar. The footage appears to show hundreds of people lining up to cross a river in Laung Don village. Some swim across, as two small ferries run back and forth. At one river crossing, the aid worker said, fighters from the Arakan Rohingya Solidarity Organization (ARSA) prevented ferries from crossing for half a day, telling civilians to return to their homes.  Campaign group Fortify Rights has documented how ARSA has prevented men and boys from leaving the area. The refugee, who asked not to be identified so he could freely discuss his journey, said the fighters backed down when villagers pleaded with them.     In southern Maungdaw, the military s campaign has driven tens of thousands of people to the coast. Bangladeshi boatmen, in their hundreds, are going to pick them up. Mostly by night, the wooden crescent-shaped boats that normally ply the fishing grounds of the Bay of Bengal, make the  journey across the 5.7-km (3.6 mile) mouth of the Naf river that separates Myanmar and Bangladesh. The 5-metre boats are loaded with as many as 50 people and their belongings. Soon after the conflict blew up, boats began landing at Shah Porir Dwip, a remote island off the southernmost tip of Bangladesh. But after three boats capsized in two days last week, killing 24 women and children, authorities launched a crackdown on boatmen and brokers they call human traffickers.  They bring these stranded people here. If they are not able to pay, the money, they imprison them,  Pronay Chakma, assistant commissioner for land in Teknaf sub-district. More than 50 people have been sentenced to short jail terms as a warning to others not to take advantage of the crisis.  It s mercenary interest, nothing else,  he said.  They tried to profit from stranded women and children.  ",worldnews,"September 6, 2017 ",1

Merkel tells voters: 'don't experiment' with the left,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel warned German voters on Wednesday not to risk allowing an untested left-wing alliance to take power after this month s national election, urging them to stick with her in  turbulent times . Less than three weeks before the Sept. 24 vote, politicians and media in Germany are turning their attention to the possible coalitions that could form after the election, from which no single party is expected to emerge with a clear majority. Merkel, 63, leads a  grand coalition  of her conservatives and the left-leaning Social Democrats (SPD) - a tie-up neither wants to repeat after the vote. Seeking a fourth term, Merkel is stressing her credentials as a global stateswoman.  Our country can t afford experiments - especially in these turbulent times,  she told a rally in Torgau, some 70 miles (120 km) south of Berlin in the state of Saxony. Merkel spoke above a cacophony of jeers and whistles from some protesters - a feature at many of her rallies as resentment persists at her decision in 2015 to open Germany s borders to hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing war in Syria and Iraq. That decision helped the rise of the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which punished her conservatives in regional votes last year. She has since bounced back, but the national election is likely to return a more fractured parliament due to the rise of the AfD - set to enter the Bundestag for the first time - and the expected return of the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP). This could make coalitions harder to form. Merkel wants to avoid being outflanked by a coalition of the SPD, the far-left Linke and the environmentalist Greens, who have held exploratory talks about the possibility of joining forces in a so-called  Red-Red-Green , or  R2G , coalition.  I say Red-Red-Green would be bad for our country,  she told the rally.  In the future too, we will need stability and security.  In a televised debate with SPD leader Martin Schulz on Sunday, Merkel challenged him to rule out a coalition with the Linke party, which he refused to do. A Red-Red-Green combination is untested at federal level, though the three parties have teamed up to take control of Berlin s city government. An opinion poll released on Wednesday put support for Merkel s conservatives at 38.5 percent, ahead of the SPD on 24 percent. The Greens were on 7.5 percent, the Free Democrats on 10 percent and the Linke and the AfD each on 8 percent. Resentment at Merkel s open-door policy runs particularly high in eastern Germany, but she has also been booed at rallies in the west - such as in Ludwigshafen, 45 miles (70 km) south of Frankfurt, last week.  We are Germans. She needs to be taking care of us,  Vincent Raap, an 18-year-old starting an apprenticeship as a machine operator, said at the Ludwigshafen rally.   Three times, an apprenticeship for which I had applied was given to foreigners instead,  he said, holding a sign saying  Merkel must go . ",worldnews,"September 7, 2017 ",1
China's military practices for 'surprise attack' over sea near Korea,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China s air force has carried out exercises near the Korean peninsula, practicing to defend against a  surprise attack  coming over the sea, Chinese state media said. The exercises came days after North Korea s sixth, and most powerful, nuclear test fueled global concern that the isolated nation plans more weapons tests, possibly of a long-range missile. An anti-aircraft defense battalion held the exercises early on Tuesday, near the Bohai Sea, the innermost gulf of the Yellow Sea that separates China from the Korean peninsula, an official military website said. Troops traveled to the site from central China before immediately beginning drills to fend off the  surprise attack  simulating real battle, it said.  The troops  rapid response capabilities and actual combat levels have effectively been tested. It was the first time certain weapons, which the website did not identify, had been used to shoot down low-altitude targets coming over the sea, www.81.cn said, without elaborating. The drills  do not target any particular goal or country , and were part of an annual plan intended to boost the troops  capability, China s Defence Ministry said on its website late on Wednesday, in a response to media.   After weeks of rising tension over North Korea s actions, South Korea and the United States have been discussing the deployment of aircraft carriers and strategic bombers to the Korean peninsula. China is deeply suspicious of any U.S.-backed military build-up in the region, and has repeatedly expressed anger at the deployment of a U.S. anti-missile defense system in South Korea.

Two Florida nuclear plants likely to shut if Irma stays on path,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Energy firm Florida Power & Light (FPL) said on Wednesday it could shut its four nuclear reactors in the path of Hurricane Irma before Saturday if the storm stayed on its current path.   Based on the current track, we would expect severe weather in Florida starting Saturday, meaning we would potentially shut down before that point,  spokesman Peter Robbins said in an email. The company, a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Inc, is watching the weather and would adjust any plans as necessary, Robbins said. The trajectory of Irma, a Category 5 storm with winds of 185 miles per hour (295 km per hour), is uncertain. Irma, which the U.S. National Hurricane Center said was the strongest Atlantic storm on record, was expected to pass near or just north of Puerto Rico on Wednesday before scraping the Dominican Republic on Thursday. FPL operates the St. Lucie nuclear power plant on Hutchinson Island, a barrier island on the Atlantic about 55 miles (88 km) north of West Palm Beach. Two reactors generate 2,000 megawatts of electricity, enough power to supply more than 1 million homes.   It also operates Turkey Point nuclear power station on Biscayne Bay, about 24 miles south of Miami. That has two reactors that generate about 1,600 megawatts of electricity, or enough for about 900,000 homes.  Robbins said the plants were designed to withstand extreme natural events including hurricanes and serious floods.    ",worldnews,"September 6, 2017 ",1
South Korea deploys U.S. anti-missile launchers amid clashes with protesters,"SEOUL (Reuters) - Protesters clashed with thousands of police at a South Korean village on Thursday as Seoul deployed the four remaining launchers of the U.S. anti-missile THAAD system designed to protect against mounting threats from North Korea.   The South s defense ministry confirmed on Wednesday the launchers would be installed on a former golf course near Seongju City some 217 km (135 miles) south of Seoul. Two launchers and a powerful radar are already in place at the site as part of the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) system. Early on Monday, around 8,000 South Korean police gathered in the village of Soseong-ri, along the only road that leads up to the golf course, to break up a blockade of around 300 villagers and civic groups opposed to THAAD. Some 38 protesters were wounded in tussles with police, with 21 sent to hospital, according to a Seongju Fire Station official. None of the injuries were life-threatening, said Kim Jin-hoon. The Soseong-ri residents say they do not have a political motive but are against the deployment of THAAD as their lives have been disrupted by the dozens of military helicopters, buses, trucks that travel through the small melon-farming town of 80 residents. The decision to deploy THAAD, designed to shoot down short- to medium-range missiles mid-flight, has drawn strong objections from China. It believes the system s radar could be used to look deeply into its territory and will upset the regional security balance. South Korea s defense ministry has said the deployment is necessary due to the imminent threat from North Korea, which has launched numerous missiles since South Korean President Moon Jae-in took office in early May. Pyongyang also conducted its sixth nuclear test on Sunday, prompting vehement reprimands from neighboring Japan and the United States. According to a United Nations draft resolution seen by Reuters on Wednesday, the United States wants the United Nations to impose an oil embargo on North Korea, ban the country s exports of textiles and the hiring of North Korean laborers as part of new sanctions on the North.

Ex-minister accuses former Brazil President Lula of accepting bribes,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - The former finance minister under Brazil s Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Wednesday accused the ex-president of receiving bribes from contractor Odebrecht [ODBES.UL], adding to a list of corruption accusations that threaten Lula s ability to run for president in 2018. Lawyers for the former finance minister, Antonio Palocci, said he told prosecutors that Lula accepted Odebrecht s purchase of land for an institute in his name, a country house in Sao Paulo state and 300 million reais ($97 million) to be used after he left office. A representative for Lula said in a statement that Palocci, who was arrested a year ago in a corruption investigation, was lying and making accusations without evidence to secure a favorable deal with prosecutors to reduce his sentence. Such testimony from a close confidant could be damning for Lula, who intends to run for president again next year if he can successfully appeal a conviction that would bar him from standing. Lula faces four additional trials. Separately on Wednesday, Brazil s top prosecutor, Rodrigo Janot, charged Lula, ex-President Dilma Rousseff and a former minister with obstruction of justice related to Lula s nomination as Rousseff s chief of staff in 2016. The nomination, later struck down by the Supreme Court, would have shielded Lula from prosecution by lower courts. It was the second charge from Janot in two days. On Tuesday he accused Lula, Rousseff and six other members of their Workers Party for allegedly forming a criminal organization to carry out corruption and other crimes involving state-controlled oil company Petrobras. Lula and Rousseff deny the charges. Palocci leveled his accusations in two hours of testimony on Wednesday as part of a probe into allegations that Lula accepted the land for the institute.   It was a blood pact and a package of bribes that included payment for a property, an estate ranch and 300 million reais that gradually were made available according to a spreadsheet delivered by the contractor,  said Adriano Bretas, one of Palocci s lawyers. Tracy Reinaldet, another of Palocci s lawyers, said the agreement was made during the transition from Lula into Rousseff s first term. Palocci also served as Rousseff s chief of staff initially but was forced to resign due to corruption allegations. ",worldnews,"September 6, 2017 ",1
Irma wreaks 'absolute devastation' on Caribbean isle of Barbuda,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Hurricane Irma left a trail of  absolute devastation  as it tore across the tiny Caribbean island of Barbuda on Wednesday with 185-mile-per-hour (295-kph) winds, destroying houses, snapping trees and killing at least one person     Gaston Browne, the prime minister of the two-island nation of Antigua and Barbuda, described the island as  barely habitable  after the powerful Category 5 storm struck early on Wednesday.  This rebuilding initiative will take years,  Browne told local ABS Television Radio after a visit to the island, where he confirmed that one person died in the storm. Describing the scene as  absolute devastation,  he said the storm, which also snapped a telecoms tower, had caused estimated damage of some $150 million. Lying a little over 250 miles (400 km) east of Puerto Rico, Barbuda has a population of 1,800 and is one of the Caribbean s quietest getaways for tourists coming to enjoy its turquoise seas and coral reefs. Aerial footage of the island after Irma had passed through showed a desolate, flooded landscape shorn of trees and foliage with overturned vehicles and scattered debris. An island resident who identified himself as King Goldilocks, 60, said he had been left homeless.  Last night was the worst night of my life,  Goldilocks said on ABS, wearing a raincoat and clutching a cane.  We had minimal loss of life but we had maximum damage.  Browne, who said earlier the damage had not been serious on Barbuda, about 30 miles (48 km) from Antigua, changed his mind after taking a helicopter to the island once the winds died down.

Pope arrives in Colombia to help heal wounds of 50-year war,"BOGOTA (Reuters) - Pope Francis arrived in Colombia on Wednesday with a message of unity for a nation deeply divided by a peace deal that ended a five-decade war with Marxist FARC rebels but left many victims of the bloodshed wary of the fraught healing process. Francis, making his 20th foreign trip since becoming pontiff in 2013 and his fifth to his native Latin America, started his visit in Colombian capital Bogota. He will travel later in the week to the cities of Villavicencio, Medellin and Cartagena. Greeted at the airport by President Juan Manuel Santos as attendees waved white handkerchiefs, the Argentine pope hopes his presence will help build bridges in a nation torn apart by bitter feuding over a peace accord with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). Speaking to reporters on the Bogota-bound plane, Francis said the trip was  a bit special because it is being made to help Colombia go forward on its path to peace.  Francis will encourage reconciliation as Colombians prepare to receive 7,000 former FARC fighters into society and repair divisions after a war that killed more than 220,000 people and displaced millions over five decades. References to the recent peace deal were immediate. A teenage boy, born in 2004 to vice presidential candidate Clara Rojas when she was held captive in the jungle by the FARC, handed Francis a white porcelain dove as a welcome present. On his drive to the Vatican Embassy in central Bogota, the leader of the world s Roman Catholics was mobbed in the  pope mobile  by screaming crowds tossing flowers and holding up children to be kissed.  Peace is what Colombia has been seeking for a long time and is working to achieve,  the pope said in a video message ahead of his arrival.  A stable, lasting peace, so that we see and treat each other as brothers, never as enemies.       The FARC, which began as a peasant revolt in 1964 and battled more than a dozen governments, has formed a political party and now hopes to use words instead of weapons to effect changes in Colombia s social and economic model. But many Colombians are furious that the 2016 peace deal with the government granted fighters amnesty and some will be rewarded with seats in congress. A referendum on the deal last year was narrowly rejected, before being later modified and passed by congress. Trumpet players, singing children and white-clad rappers greeted the pope - wearing a traditional woolen poncho - at the embassy where he urged young people to  keep smiling  and then led the crowd in the Hail Mary prayer.  Don t let anyone steal your hope,  he said. People lined up all day to see the pope pass by, queues stretched around the cathedral in Bogota as residents sought passes for his events, and street vendors sold t-shirts, baseball caps and posters carrying Francis s image.  Pope Francis coming to Colombia has to unite the people. We cannot continue to be polarized. We must learn to live in peace and respect our differences,  Lucia Camargo, a pensioner, said as she lined up for a glimpse of the pontiff. Although most church leaders have voiced support for the accord, some politicians and Catholic bishops have criticized the deal for being too lenient on the guerrillas. The pope is expected to urge them to set aside their differences.  The visit will leave us a sense of union, of forgiveness,   Bogota Mayor Enrique Penalosa told Reuters.  Colombia is very polarized at the moment. There are many passions, many hatreds.  Reconciliation will be the emphasis for events on Friday in the city of Villavicencio, south of Bogota, where the pope will listen to testimonials from people whose lives were affected by the violence and then deliver a homily. Victims and former rebels who demobilized prior to the accord will attend. The pope will not meet FARC leaders or the opposition. He also had a message of dialogue and forgiveness for neighboring Venezuela, wracked by months of protests against President Nicolas Maduro, who has tightened his hold on power as an economic crisis has escalated. As his plane flew over the socialist nation, the pope sent  cordial greetings  in a telegram to Maduro and Venezuelans.   Praying that all in the nation may promote paths of solidarity, justice and harmony, I willingly invoke upon all of you God s blessings of peace,  he said. ",worldnews,"September 6, 2017 ",1
No 'fire and fury' as Trump team talks North Korea with Congress,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump s top national security advisers stressed efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the North Korea crisis to Congress on Wednesday, staying far from Trump s tough talk of potential  fire and fury  military responses to Pyongyang s missile program. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Joseph Dunford held classified briefings on North Korea and Afghanistan for the entire House of Representatives and Senate. Lawmakers said the officials discussed efforts including consultations with allies, sanctions, pushing for action at the United Nations and military options. But they said the briefings  tone was sharply different from some of Trump s recent public statements. After recent missile launches and nuclear tests by North Korea, the president has vowed to stop the weapons program and said he would unleash  fire and fury  if Pyongyang threatened U.S. territory. Mattis also warned of a  massive  military response if the United States or its allies were threatened.  Each of them was very professional, very measured in what they were saying, and understand the stakes that are in play here. So there s nothing over-the-top, no over-the-top rhetoric, just a layout of where they are in trying to deal with this issue,  Senator Bob Corker, Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters. Representative Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee said after the briefing it was clear that the administration would like to negotiate an agreement with North Korea.  There was really no bluster whatsoever,  Engel said. Members of Congress from both parties called for stricter sanctions against North Korea, and said the United States should seek to work closely with allies like South Korea, push China to do more and see action at the United Nations.  The best strategy would be deploying sanctions... sustained financial pressure in which we do not let up on those financial institutions that are assisting North Korea,  said Republican Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House committee, who just returned from a trip to South Korea. Republican Representative Mac Thornberry, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said there had been more members of the House at the briefing than he could remember at similar sessions.  There was a tremendous amount of interest,  he said. ",worldnews,"September 6, 2017 ",1
"Florida stations face fuel shortages, delays ahead of Irma","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Gasoline stations around Florida struggled to keep up with demand from customers anxious to fill tanks as Hurricane Irma approached, with some locations running out of supply on Wednesday. Some convenience stores are out of fuel as delivery trucks wait three to four hours to get cargoes from Port Everglades, the main supply source for the southern part of the state, said Ned Bowman, executive director at the Florida Petroleum Marketers and Convenience Store Association, which represents 98 percent of fuel sold in Florida. Deliveries in the southern part of the state have been slowed by heavy traffic as residents evacuate.  The Category 5 storm, with winds exceeding 185 mph (295 km/h), clobbered Caribbean islands on Wednesday as Florida officials called for evacuations ahead of expected landfall this weekend. It would be the second powerful storm to hit the U.S. mainland in as many weeks, following Tropical Storm Harvey.  Filling stations in Orlando struggled to keep up with demand as early as Tuesday, with some running out of fuel or facing long lag times for resupply. Deliveries are usually made on an as-needed basis within an hour of a station signaling low fuel levels.  We re normally not even super busy at our pumps, and there are people parked behind each other right now, waiting,  said Eli Brito, shift manager of a RaceTrac station in Orlando that was out of regular fuel on Wednesday after waiting four hours for delivery on Tuesday.  Gasoline prices in Florida hit $2.71 a gallon on Wednesday, up 42 cents from a month ago, according to motorist advocacy group AAA. Florida has no refineries and its more than 20 million residents rely on refined products delivered by tanker and barge at its ports. On Wednesday, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it would allow diesel fuel normally restricted to off-road use like farm equipment to be sold for highway vehicles that use diesel through Sept. 22, due to the approaching storm. The U.S. Coast Guard limited movement of ships into and out of the ports, including Port Everglades, which houses about a dozen fuel terminals. Commercial traffic is still allowed, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Brandon Murray.  The Coast Guard plans to further restrict traffic at the port midday Thursday, and require ships to make final mooring plans by midday Friday. No timeline for port closure has been set. Port Everglades had supplies on hand through mid-September when Harvey hit Texas, spokeswoman Ellen Kennedy said. The port usually has about two weeks of fuel available, she added. The state s other fuel-receiving ports, including Jacksonville and Tampa, remained open, said Bowman.  We ve been down this horse race before,  Bowman said from Florida s emergency operations center ahead of the storm.  ",worldnews,"September 6, 2017 ",1
"After year of 'repression' in Bahrain, West remains silent, Amnesty says","DUBAI (Reuters) - Bahrain s government has crushed dissent and violently cracked down on protests in the past year, Amnesty International said on Thursday, and it accused Britain and the United States in particular of turning a blind eye to its abuses. Amnesty said in a report on Thursday that it had documented how the Bahraini government, from June 2016 to June 2017, arrested, tortured, threatened or banned from travel at least 169 activists and opponents or their relatives. Bahraini authorities could not immediately be reached for comment. Bahrain has repeatedly denied systematic rights abuses. Entitled  No one can protect you: Bahrain s year of crushing dissent , the report said that at least six people were killed, including a child, in the crackdowns. The report also accused Western governments, notably the United States and Britain of remaining silent. The two countries have a particularly high level of influence in Bahrain, where the U.S. Fifth Fleet is based and where Britain s Royal Navy has a major facility.  Amnesty said U.S. President Donald Trump s policy has shifted from that of his predecessor, Barack Obama, who had publicly criticized the authorities of the tiny Gulf state.   In March 2017, President Trump told Bahrain s King Hamad  there won t be strain with this administration : Bahrain appears to have interpreted this statement as a green light to pursue its repression,  the report said. Bahrain has stepped up a crackdown on critics, shutting down two main political groups, revoking the citizenship of the spiritual leader of the Shi ite Muslim community and jailing rights campaigners. It denounced attempts by previous U.S. and UK governments to intervene in its campaign. In July, a Bahraini court sentenced rights campaigner and prominent activist Nabeel Rajab to two years in jail for allegedly making  false or malicious  statements about Bahraini authorities. Rajab is facing another trial and risks a further 15 years in prison for tweeting.  Using an array of tools of repression, including harassment, arbitrary detention and torture, the government of Bahrain has managed to crush a formerly thriving civil society,  Philip Luther, Amnesty International s director for the Middle East and North Africa, said in a statement. Amnesty said it had received reports of nine cases of government critics being tortured in detention, eight of them in May 2017 alone. Bahrain has been a flashpoint since the Sunni-led government put down Arab Spring protests in 2011. The kingdom, most of whose population is Shi ite, says it faces a threat from neighboring Shi ite theocracy Iran. It accuses the Islamic Republic of radicalizing and arming some members of its majority Shi ite population in an effort to bring about the downfall of the ruling Al Khalifa family. Tehran denies any meddling in Bahrain. ",worldnews,"September 7, 2017 ",1

China's Xi tells Trump that North Korea nuclear issue must be solved via talks,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China is focused on solving the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue through talks and peaceful means, Chinese President Xi Jinping told U.S. President Donald Trump in a telephone call on Wednesday. The United States and South Korea have asked the United Nations to consider tough new sanctions on North Korea after its nuclear test on Sunday that Pyongyang said was an advanced hydrogen bomb. Washington and its allies have said there is a growing urgency for China, North Korea s top ally and trading partner, to apply more pressure on its already isolated neighbor to get it to back down on its nuclear weapons and missiles programs. China s focus on negotiations contrasts with Trump s assertions over the last few days that now was not the time to focus on talks with North Korea. In a telephone call with U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday,  President Trump reiterated that now is not the time to talk to North Korea, and made clear that all options remain open to defend the United States and its allies against North Korean aggression,  the White House said on Wednesday. However, the issue was not mentioned in a separate White House statement on the Trump-Xi call, which said only that the two leaders recognized the danger posed by North Korea and committed to working together with the goal of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. Earlier, a statement from China s foreign ministry said China  unswervingly  works to realize denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula and to safeguard the international nuclear non-proliferation system, Xi told Trump.  At the same time, we always persist in safeguarding peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and resolving the issue through dialogue and consultation,  Xi said.  It is necessary to stay on the path of a peaceful solution.  Xi also said that China attaches importance to Trump s visit to China later this year. The statement cited Trump as saying that the United States was deeply concerned about the Korean nuclear issue and that it valued China s  important role  in resolving the problem. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley accused North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Monday of  begging for war  and urged the Security Council to impose the  strongest possible  sanctions. Beijing has said reining in North Korea is not chiefly its responsibility, and has expressed doubts that U.N. economic sanctions, which it has backed, will resolve the situation. Sanctions so far appear to have done little to stop North Korea from boosting its nuclear and missile capacity as it faces off with Trump, who has vowed to stop Pyongyang from being able to hit the U.S. mainland with a nuclear weapon. It is unclear if China will back further sanctions. Beijing fears that completely cutting off North Korea could lead to its collapse, unleashing a wave of refugees into China s northeast. China accounted for 92 percent of North Korea s trade in 2016, according to South Korea. China s foreign ministry said on Tuesday it would take part in Security Council discussions in  a responsible and constructive manner . China and Russia have advocated a plan in which the United States and Seoul stop major military drills in exchange for North Korea halting its weapons programs, but neither side is willing to budge. Trump and Xi last spoke by telephone on Aug. 12. The White House said at the time that their relationship was  extremely close  and  will hopefully lead to a peaceful resolution of the North Korea problem.  But tensions in China-U.S. ties have increased since Trump took office, with the U.S. president having authorized an investigation into China s alleged theft of intellectual property, and suggesting trade relations would be linked to Beijing s help on North Korea.

Hurricane Irma threatens luxury Trump properties,"(Reuters) - Hurricane Irma swept over U.S. President Donald Trump s 11-bedroom Caribbean mansion on Wednesday, the first of several luxury Trump properties threatened by the storm s path. It was not immediately known whether Irma damaged Trump s beachfront Chateau des Palmiers, or Castle of the Palms, on St. Martin. The gated estate, for sale for $16.9 million, is owned through a trust and had been rented out, U.S. media has reported. But French Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said some buildings had been destroyed and social media showed flooded roads and overturned cars on the island that is roughly divided between France and the Netherlands.  The situation was being closely monitored on St. Martin and at a number of Trump properties in Florida, Trump Organization spokesperson Amanda Miller told Reuters in a statement.  Our teams at the Trump properties in Florida are taking all of the proper precautions and following local and Florida state advisories very closely to ensure that everyone is kept safe and secure,  Miller said. While Irma s exact trajectory remained uncertain, Trump s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach - which has been called the  winter White House  and valued by Forbes at $175 million - could also take a hit. Trump bought the estate in 1985 and turned it into an exclusive club, which now boasts a membership fee of $200,000 and is a haven for the tony Palm Beach set who pull up to the gate in Bentleys and Rolls-Royces. A staffer who answered the phone said it was closed and declined to comment further. Palm Beach County declared a state of emergency on Wednesday. Near Miami, Trump owns luxury high-rise condos called the Trump Towers, Sunny Isles and the oceanfront Trump International Beach Resort. Some guests were leaving ahead of the storm but precautions were being taken and resort officials were prepared to oversee evacuations if they were ordered, marketing director Jim Monastra said. At the Trump National Doral, an 800-acre golf resort in Miami that local media reported had completed a $250 million renovation last year, officials tweeted Wednesday that resort operations were going on as normal until further notice.

Peru raises cost of post-floods rebuilding to nearly $8 billion,"LIMA (Reuters) - Previously uncalculated damage caused by severe flooding in Peru this year has pushed up the cost of rebuilding infrastructure by 28 percent to 25.65 billion soles ($7.92 billion), a government official said Wednesday. Pablo de la Flor, who was appointed by President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski to lead the reconstruction effort, said 38 percent of the new total will pay for rebuilding highways, roads and bridges. The rest will be used to help build homes, schools, health clinics, sewage systems and farms affected by the floods.  Without a doubt this is the most important fiscal effort in Peru s recent history,  de la Flor told a press conference. Finance Minister Fernando Zavala said the cost increase would be included in the budget in 2019 or 2020. The rebuilding plan was approved by Kuczynski s cabinet on Wednesday and does not need a green light from Congress. Early this year an unusually brutal rainy season due to a sudden warming of Pacific waters killed 162 people, slowed economic growth sharply and caused damage equivalent to 2 percent of Peru s gross domestic product. De la Flor said the government would likely start awarding contracts at the end of the year. ",worldnews,"September 6, 2017 ",1
Catalonia parliament votes for Oct. 1 referendum on split from Spain,"MADRID (Reuters) - Catalonia s parliament voted on Wednesday to hold an independence referendum on Oct. 1, setting up a clash with the Spanish government that has vowed to stop what it says would be an illegal vote. After 12 hours of often chaotic debate in the Barcelona parliament, a majority voted for the referendum and the legal framework to set up a new state, under which the assembly would declare independence within 48 hours of a  yes  vote. Lawmakers who opposed independence abandoned the chamber before the vote, with some leaving Catalan flags in their empty seats. The winners, led by regional head Carles Puigdemont, sang the Catalan national anthem once the votes were counted.   Committed to freedom and democracy! We push on!  Catalonia s deputy governor, Oriol Junqueras, tweeted after the vote. Polls in the northeastern region show support for self-rule waning as Spain s economy improves. But the majority of Catalans do want the opportunity to vote on whether to split from Spain. The government has asked the Spanish constitutional court to declare the referendum law void as soon as it is approved by the regional parliament. The Spanish constitution states that the country is indivisible.  What is happening in the Catalan parliament is embarrassing, it s shameful,  Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria told reporters. The details of the referendum, which would pose the question  Do you want Catalonia to be an independent republic?  to all Spanish citizens living in Catalonia, were revealed amid a tense atmosphere in the 135-seat regional parliament.  You will not split up Spain, but you are breaking up Catalonia,  Alejandro Fernandez of the ruling People s Party (PP) told pro-independence lawmakers.  You re putting social harmony at risk.  The vote comes about three weeks after Barcelona and a nearby town were struck by Islamist attacks that killed 16 people and caused the Catalan and Spanish governments to present a brief united front. Divisions reappeared as both sides squabbled over whether either could have prevented the attacks, and rallies against terrorism became politicized. Crowds in Barcelona booed Spain s King Felipe when he visited for one march. There will be no minimum turnout requirement to make the result of the referendum binding, Puigdemont said in a recent briefing. Ballot boxes, voting papers and an electoral census are at the ready, he said. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy told a news conference on Monday the government would come down with all the force of the law to ensure no referendum would go ahead. Courts have already suspended from office and leveled millions of euros in fines at Catalan politicians who organized a non-binding referendum in 2014, which returned a  yes  vote on a low turnout.

Trump administration blacklists three officials for South Sudan war,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Wednesday imposed sanctions against two senior South Sudanese officials and the country s former army chief in a warning to the government of President Salva Kiir over increasing attacks on civilians in the country s four-year civil war. The U.S. Treasury Department in a statement on its website said it had blacklisted Malek Reuben Riak Rengu, deputy chief of defense for logistics in South Sudan s army; Paul Malong, former army chief sacked by Kiir in May; and Minister of Information Michael Makuei Lueth for their roles in destabilizing South Sudan. The measures freeze any assets in the United States or tied to the U.S. financial system belonging to the three men. Mawien Makol, spokesman at South Sudan s foreign affairs ministry, called Washington s announcement unfortunate.   Such sanctions can undermine the efforts rather than help the efforts,  Makol said, referring to a 2015 peace deal.  Nathaniel Oyet, a senior official in the opposition SPLA-IO group, welcomed the move although added:  It has come a bit late. We wanted it yesterday.   This now gives us the confidence that the Donald Trump administration will fix the crisis in South Sudan,  said Oyet. The U.S. crackdown comes days after Trump s new aid administrator, Mark Green, visited South Sudan to deliver a blunt message to Kiir that Washington was reviewing its policy toward his government. He called on Kiir to end the violence and implement a  real  ceasefire. The meeting signaled that the Trump administration was reconsidering its backing for Kiir, who came to power with the support of Washington when oil-rich South Sudan won independence from neighboring Sudan in 2011 following decades of conflict. But the world s youngest country dissolved into civil war in 2013 after Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, fired his deputy Riek Machar, a Nuer. Nearly one-third of the country s population - or 4  million people - have fled their homes, creating the continent s largest refugee crisis since the 1994 Rwandan genocide. In its statement, the U.S. Treasury said Malek Reuben was central to weapons procurement during the first few years of the conflict and helped plan an offensive in Unity State in April 2015, which targeted civilians and led to  numerous rights abuses.  It also accused him of issuing military contracts at inflated prices  in order to receive extensive kickbacks.   The U.S. Treasury blacklisted All Energy Investments, A+ Engineering, Electronics & Media Printing and Mak International Services which it said was owned or controlled by Malek Reuben.  Malong was sacked by Kiir in May as army chief and put under house arrest in the capital Juba, the country s defense minister told Reuters last week. The U.S. Treasury said he was being sanctioned for obstructing peace talks, international peacekeeping efforts and humanitarian missions in South Sudan. The Treasury statement said Malong was reportedly responsible for efforts to kill Machar in 2016 and  did not discourage  the killing of civilians around the town of Wau last year. It said Malong was found with  currency worth millions of U.S. dollars in his possession  belonging to the military s treasury as he tried to flee Juba in early May. Reached by phone in Nairobi, Malong s wife, Ayak Lucy, told Reuters her husband did not have financial assets in the United States. She was unaware of the sanctions announcement.  Meanwhile, the U.S. Treasury accused Makuei of attacks against the U.N. mission in South Sudan and obstructing of peacekeeping and humanitarian missions in the country.  What do they call it? Economic sanctions? What property do I have in America and all over the world?  he told Reuters in response to the sanctions. ",worldnews,"September 6, 2017 ",1
Togo opposition calls for president to quit as protests mount,"LOME (Reuters) - Togo s opposition chief called on Wednesday for the immediate resignation of President Faure Gnassingbe, the current head of a half century-old political dynasty, rejecting a government move to introduce term limits as protests gained momentum.  Tens of thousands of protesters clad in red, orange and pink - the colors of Togo s opposition parties - marched through the streets of the capital Lome as security forces looked on, a Reuters witness said. Some carried banners bearing slogans including  Free Togo  and  Faure resign . Gnassingbe has ruled the West African nation since his father died in 2005 after 38 years in power. The late President Gnassingbe Eyadema passed a law in 1992 limiting the president to two terms in power, only to scrap it a decade later. Togo s cabinet on Tuesday adopted a draft bill to bring back the term limits, the government announced in a statement. But the decision did little to satisfy an increasingly rejuvenated opposition. Speaking before a crowd of thousands of protesters in central Lome, Jean-Pierre Fabre, the head of the main ANC opposition party, said:  We will march again tomorrow. Faure should talk to us about the conditions for his departure. The (draft) law on mandates comes too late.  Residents said similar protests were underway in Sokode, 340 km (210 miles) north of the coastal capital, as well as several other towns.  A number of long-serving African rulers, notably in Rwanda, Burundi and Burkina Faso, have moved to drop term limits in recent years in order to remain in power. In some cases this has sparked strong opposition that has led to violent unrest. However, unlike marches last month during which at least two protesters were killed by security forces, there was no sign of violence by early afternoon on Wednesday. Togo, which aspires to become an African Dubai and hosts the headquarters of pan-African lender Ecobank  and other major firms, has a history of repression. Around 500 people were killed during protests against the current leader s 2005 poll victory. But the move to reintroduce a two-term limit could represent an important volte-face by the president, whose government in 2015 voted against the introduction of regional term limits across the ECOWAS 15-nation zone which he currently chairs.  (I) deplore the serious incidents in Sokode and Lome during the protests of 19 August and call upon the people to exercise calm, serenity and moderation,  Gnassingbe said in a statement released on Wednesday. He also pledged to improve living conditions in the country of nearly 8 million people. It was not immediately known when the bill approved by the cabinet will be presented to parliament. Nor was it clear how the proposed change to article 59 of the constitution would affect Gnassingbe, who is now serving a third mandate which ends in 2020. Government critics accused authorities of cutting mobile internet access on Wednesday in a move they said mirrored cuts imposed by other African incumbents, such as Gabon s Ali Bongo, to control criticism at sensitive times. However, the main internet gateway remained operational according to Dyn which monitors global internet traffic. A government official could not immediately be reached for comment.

Holocaust survivors rock Berlin's Brandenburg Gate with song of hope,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Two aging Holocaust survivors joined forces with a younger Israeli singer to perform songs of hope at Berlin s Brandenburg Gate on Wednesday at a time when Germany is seeing a rise in anti-Semitism. Saul Dreier, a drummer aged 92, and Reuwen  Ruby  Sosnowicz, an 89-year-old accordionist, backed up Gad Elbaz at a site once used by Adolf Hitler for anti-Semitic speeches.  I don t want to cry. If I can be 92 and be here after what I went through - there are no words,  Dreier told Reuters at the end of a long and emotional day      This is a miracle. I lost 30 people in my family,  he told a crowd of around 80 people before the performance. Dreier said recent news of neo-Nazi marches in the United States and Germany made him sick and brought back memories of the horrors of the Nazi regime that killed 6 million Jews.  It s very frightening. Young people have to make sure it never happens again.  The men, who both live in Florida, formed their  Holocaust Survivors Band  in 2014 and went on to play in front of packed audiences from Warsaw and Las Vegas to Washington, D.C.  Elbaz said the event in Berlin was meant to make sure younger people remained vigilant about the dangers of anti-Semitism.  This is about reviving history and showing our generation how important it is not to forget where we came from, what we ve been through, and that it should never happen again,  he said. Organizers plan to release a music video filmed during the performance of one of the songs,  Let the Light Shine On . Shani Ramer, 48, who was born in Israel but grew up and lives in Berlin, said the concert reminded her of family members who perished.  It touched my heart,  she said. She welcomed the concert s message of hope.  It s saying we are still here. No one will kill us now.  Abida Ali, a Muslim tourist visiting Germany from Pakistan, joined other bystanders dancing to the upbeat music. Ali said she had experienced no discrimination during her visit despite her head scarf.  It s only a small percentage of the people who are violent,  she said.  There is hope. Everyone really wants peace.  A study by Bielefeld University carried out last year showed that 78 percent of Jews living in Germany believe anti-Semitism has increased to some extent, or to a large extent, in the previous five years.

EU to raise pressure on Poland over democracy concerns: sources,"TALLINN (Reuters) - European Union states will this month debate increasing pressure on Poland to uphold the rule of law, sources said, as the next stage in a process that could see its government formally denounced as anti-democratic. The nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) government in Warsaw has pushed through reforms to the judiciary and media that critics within the EU say have weakened the democratic order.  PiS rejects the criticism, accuses Brussels of overstepping its mandate and says it has broad backing for its reforms within Poland, a country of 38 million and formerly communist eastern Europe s dominant economy. After more than a year of growing pressure from the European Commission, the executive on Wednesday asked the bloc s 28 EU affairs ministers to discuss its concerns on Sept. 25, the day after national elections in Germany. The Commission s deputy head Frans Timmermans will brief the ministers on his so far futile efforts to persuade Warsaw to shift its position, the sources said. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has joined the growing chorus of those calling for firmer action on Poland and discussed the matter with the Commission s chief, Jean-Claude Juncker. Should Warsaw remain adamant, it eventually risks losing generous EU handouts if it continues to upset its wealthier peers that chip in for the funds, a debate gradually heating up in the bloc. For now, the EU has limited firepower at its disposal.  But it could trigger Article 7 proceedings under which it would ask the other 27 EU states to formally state that the rule of law was under threat in Poland - an action unprecedented in EU history. Timmermans has set a clear red line by saying that Article 7 would be opened should Warsaw start to fire the country s Supreme Court judges under the judicial overhaul. The dispute highlights Warsaw s growing isolation in the EU since the eurosceptic PiS won power there in 2015, but also a growing east-west divide within the bloc. Launching Article 7 would be a major embarrassment for Poland, but its regional ally Hungary - whose leader Viktor Orban also has a track record of crossing swords with Brussels - has made clear it would block any sanctions against it under the punitive procedure. In the west, increasingly frustrated with multiplying feuds with Warsaw that also touch on migration and environmental issues, some express renewed doubts about the 2004 EU enlargement that added eight ex-communist countries to the bloc.  In Poland, opposition parties sound alarm that PiS is reneging on fundamental EU values and could eventually risk sabotaging Poland s EU membership, which gave the country billions of euros and anchored it in the western world after decades of the Moscow-imposed communism after World War Two. But PiS has largely been successful in rallying its supporters around what it presents as standing up for Poland s national interests against the EU dictate, just as Orban has portrayed his own feuds with the bloc to his voters. The more immediate effect is that Warsaw is hemorrhaging political influence in the EU and has less capacity to shape the bloc s policies despite being the sixth largest state by population, and the fifth one after Britain leaves.

U.S. forces apologize for 'highly offensive' Afghan propaganda leaflet,"KABUL (Reuters) - A senior U.S. commander in Afghanistan apologized on Wednesday for a  highly offensive  leaflet which contained a passage from the Koran used in the Taliban militants  banner superimposed on to the image of a dog. The Taliban said the leaflet showed American hatred of Islam, adding that it had launched a suicide attack near the entrance to the U.S. Bagram Air Field, north of Kabul, in revenge. The image, distributed by U.S. forces in Parwan province, north of Kabul, on Tuesday, showed a section of the Taliban s banner superimposed onto the side of a dog - an animal considered unclean by Muslims. The banner contains a passage from the Koran in Arabic.  The design of the leaflets mistakenly contained an image highly offensive to both Muslims and the religion of Islam,  Major General James Linder said in a statement.  I sincerely apologize. We have the deepest respect for Islam and our Muslim partners worldwide,  he said, adding that an investigation would be held  to determine the cause of this incident and to hold the responsible party accountable . Parwan Governor Mohammad Hasem condemned the leaflet as  unforgivable .  Those who have committed this unforgivable mistake in the publicity, propaganda or media section of the coalition forces will be tried and punished,  he said. The incident highlights one of the challenges facing international forces in Afghanistan, most of which are from non-Muslim cultures, despite the efforts Western forces have generally taken to avoid stoking anti-foreigner sentiment. The risk of a backlash against international forces has grown more pronounced with a rise in civilian casualties caused by increased U.S. and Afghan government air strikes since the beginning of the year. The Taliban, fighting to restore strict Islamic rule to Afghanistan and drive out foreign forces, issued a statement saying the leaflet made clear  that this war is a war between Islam and unbelief . The insurgent movement claimed responsibility for a suicide attack on the U.S. base at Bagram Air Field north of Kabul that local officials said wounded four Afghan civilians, although the Taliban itself said 20 Americans were killed. In 2012, U.S. commanders were forced to apologize after copies of the Koran and other religious texts were mistakenly burned at Bagram Air Base near Kabul. The incident triggered large demonstrations in Kabul and other provinces in which several people were killed. On another occasion, a film of U.S. Marines urinating on the bodies of dead Taliban fighters caused widespread offense, prompting an investigation and criminal charges. So-called information operations conducted by government and coalition forces have long been used to try to persuade local people to turn against the Taliban and other insurgent groups. Above the picture of a lion and the dog, the leaflet urged people to report insurgents to the authorities.   Take back your freedom from the terrorist dogs and cooperate with coalition forces so they can target your enemy and eliminate them,  it said. ",worldnews,"September 6, 2017 ",1
Trump seeks tougher sanctions to prod North Korea into negotiations,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - With no palatable military options, U.S. President Donald Trump may ultimately have no choice but to give diplomacy a chance to end the crisis over North Korea s nuclear and missile programs. For now, though, he is pursuing tougher economic sanctions, including an oil embargo, and opposed to making any concessions that might look like appeasement, insisting that more pressure on the regime of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is needed before it is time to talk. North Korea seems even more opposed to negotiations until it has achieved the ability to attack the continental United States with nuclear weapons.  North Korea is not interested in dialogue. ... Kim Jong Un has sent a message with this last test that he doesn t listen to anybody,  said a senior official who helps coordinate the European Union s North Korea policy. So for now, despite calls from Russia, China, and others, there is no push from the United States or North Korea for direct talks, despite an escalating crisis that threatens millions of lives after North Korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test last weekend.  The Trump administration says the United Nations needs to tighten economic sanctions to pressure North Korea to change its behavior and start talking. A draft sanctions resolution was circulated to the United Nations Security Council on Wednesday. Trump s tactics, one senior administration official said on the condition of anonymity, mirror those in many of his business deals: simultaneously playing good cop and bad cop, not appearing too interested in making a deal but keeping lines of communication open. Trump said on Wednesday after a call with Chinese leader Xi Jinping that military action against North Korea was not a first choice,  but we will see what happens.  Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said on Sunday that Kim was  begging for war,  but added:  The time has come for us to exhaust all of our diplomatic means before it s too late.  The United States wants the Security Council to impose an oil embargo on North Korea, ban its exports of textiles and the hiring of North Korean laborers abroad and subject leader Kim Jong Un to an asset freeze and travel ban, according to a draft resolution seen by Reuters on Wednesday. It was not immediately clear if the draft had the support of North Korean ally China, which along with Russia, while denouncing the latest test, has said that resolving the nuclear crisis is impossible with sanctions and pressure alone. [L4N1LN25F] A decade of sanctions has not slowed North Korea s nuclear weapons program, and now that it is closer to its goal, diplomats and analysts say it is unlikely to back down.  The U.S. policy of strategic patience on North Korea has assumed that time is on their side - that economic sanctions will eventually lead to the collapse of Kim Jong Un s regime and its economy, and it will come to the negotiating table, no longer able to withstand the economic pain,  said Moon Chung-in, a special adviser to South Korea s president on foreign affairs and national security.  However, such an assumption has now proven wrong. North Korea s economy has not only adapted quickly to tightening sanctions, but the country has also succeeded in advancing its nuclear weapons programs despite more than a decade of economic hardship.  Zhao Tong, a Beijing-based North Korea expert at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center, said Pyongyang may hope Washington ultimately will recognize it has developed a credible nuclear capability, abandon its long-standing precondition for talks - that North Korea accept that they be aimed at its nuclear disarmament - and instead seek the freezing its nuclear program.  From the North Korean perspective, their strategy is working,  he said.  Most experts say it no longer is realistic to think North Korea will trade away its nuclear arsenal in exchange for sanctions relief, economic support, or a peace treaty with the United States ending the formal state of war that has existed since the 1950-53 Korean War. Robert Einhorn, a former senior U.S. non-proliferation specialist now at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, said North Korea has learned from the U.S. invasion of Iraq and the late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi s decision to stop developing weapons of mass destruction  that you can t give up critical assets that you need for your own survival.  China has put forth a  freeze-for-freeze  proposal that would suspend large-scale U.S. military exercises with South Korea in return for a suspension of North Korean nuclear and missile tests. Washington continues to reject that idea. But the longer diplomacy is delayed, the greater the chances that North Korea can master the ability to hit the U.S. mainland with nuclear-tipped missiles, and then enter talks from a position of strength. South Korea is keeping open the option of dialogue with North Korea, and hopes Washington and Seoul can develop a diplomatic  roadmap,  Cho Hyun, South Korea s second Vice Foreign Minister, said at a seminar in Washington on Tuesday.  It may sound unrealistic today, but we cannot abandon it.  ",worldnews,"September 6, 2017 ",1

Rwanda arrests supporters of jailed opposition figure,"KIGALI (Reuters) - Rwandan police have arrested supporters of jailed opposition figure Victoire Ingabire who they said were planning to join an armed group in a neighboring country. Ingabire was jailed for 15 years in 2012 for conspiring to form an armed group to undermine the government and for seeking to minimize the 1994 genocide. Among the seven people arrested was Boniface Twagirimana, the vice president of Ingabire s party, and Leonille Gasengayire, a member of the party - FDU-Inkingi - which has never been registered as an official political movement, the police said on Wednesday.  Both have in the past accused the government of killing or being behind the disappearance of party members, which the government denies. Ingabire returned from exile in the Netherlands to contest a presidential election in January 2010 but was barred from standing after being accused of genocide denial. More than 800,000 people were killed in Rwanda when an ethnic Hutu-led government and ethnic militias went on a 100-day massacre. Afterwards, President Paul Kagame, who won a third term last month, was lauded for bringing economic improvements but he has faced increasing accusations of widespread human rights abuses, suppression of the political opposition and muzzling the media.

Angola's ruling MPLA wins election with 61 percent of vote: electoral commission,"LUANDA (Reuters) - Angola s ruling MPLA party has won a general election by taking 61.07 percent of the vote, the electoral commission said on Wednesday, making Jo o Louren o the next president of sub-Saharan Africa s third-largest economy. He will replace Jose Eduardo dos Santos, who steps down after 38 years at the helm but will continue as head of the People s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA). The main opposition National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) took 26.67 percent, with the smaller opposition party CASA-CE winning 9.44 percent.  Mission accomplished,  Louren o told supporters at his party s headquarters in Luanda.  We ll produce a better future for the country and the people of Angola,  he said in his first comments as president-elect. He is expected to take office on Sept. 21. UNITA, which has repeatedly complained that the electoral process has been non-transparent and illegal, declined to comment after the results on Wednesday. A spokesman told Reuters a statement will be made on Thursday. UNITA has previously said it will appeal the results. Speaking earlier on Wednesday, the spokeswoman for the National Electoral Commission Julia Ferreira rejected the opposition s complaints as having a  lack of clarity and objectivity , adding sufficient proof had not been presented. Electoral observers have said the vote on Aug 23 was reasonably free and fair. The head of the African Union s observation mission, Jose Maria Neves, congratulated Angola on a poll he said served as a  reference for the continent . Speaking before announcing definitive election results, President of the National Electoral Commission Andr  da Silva Neto asked the parties to accept the election results. On the streets of Luanda, cheering and the honking of horns was heard as residents celebrated another electoral win for the MPLA, which has maintained an unbroken hold on power since Africa s second-largest crude producer gained independence from Portugal in 1975. Louren o will be only the country s third president in that time. A quiet 63-year-old more used to army barracks and the closed doors of party politics than the public spotlight, he has denied he will remain in the shadow of his predecessor dos Santos. Louren o has promised to kick-start the economy and has not ruled out deals with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund to help restructure it. Angola imports everything from washing powder to long-life milk at huge cost. MPLA will have 150 lawmakers, giving them the two-thirds parliamentary majority needed to pass any form of legislation.

France overseas minister says two killed in French Caribbean islands after Irma,"PARIS (Reuters) - France s overseas territories minister said on Wednesday that at least two people were killed on two of its Caribbean territories, St. Martin and St. Barthelemy, as Hurricane Irma hammered the islands.  We re talking about two dead and two seriously injured for now. Obviously the situation can change very quickly,  Annick Girardin told reporters before boarding a plane for the region. She said the government was launching an emergency plan but it was vital to assess the damage because at this stage authorities could not get access to the worst-hit areas.

JetBlue offers $99 flights out of Florida ahead of Hurricane Irma,"(Reuters) - JetBlue Airways Corp is offering $99 direct flights from every Florida city where it operates, the airline said on Wednesday, as people hurry to leave before powerful Hurricane Irma hits the state. A price cap through Sept. 10 is also in place for all of JetBlue s Florida connecting flights, a maximum fare of $159 up to the last available seat, the company said.  We want those trying to leave ahead of the hurricane to focus on their safe evacuation rather than worry about the cost of flights,  JetBlue spokesman Doug McGraw said. Flights in the eastern Caribbean through Sept. 7 and in the western Caribbean through Sept. 8 are also under a fare ceiling. Florida remained under a state of emergency as Irma, packing winds of up to 185 miles per hour (295 km per hour), tracked across the northern Caribbean on a path expected to hit  landfall in the United States over the weekend. Airlines have been criticized for raising prices in the wake of deadly episodes such as a 2015 Amtrak derailment, but U.S. officials said last year they found no evidence of wrongdoing in that instance.  Irma s arrival marks the second time in as many weeks U.S. airline operations will be disrupted by a powerful storm.  Last week, Category 4 Hurricane Harvey landed in Texas and swallowed up much of Houston with powerful winds and deadly flooding. Airline operations were crippled for several days as airports closed, forcing thousands of flight cancellations. ",worldnews,"September 6, 2017 ",1
Syrian army fights to secure corridor into Deir al-Zor,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - The Syrian army and its allies are fighting to secure a corridor to troops in Deir al-Zor, a day after they smashed through Islamic State lines to break the jihadist siege.  The army reached Deir al-Zor city on Tuesday in a days-long thrust that followed months of steady advances east across the desert, breaking a siege that had lasted three years.  Islamic State counter-attacks lasted through the day, trying to repel the army, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Fierce battles raged around the city, as troops sought to expand the route and allow aid in, the British-based war monitor added.   Work is progressing to secure the route and widen the flanks so as not to be cut or targeted by (Islamic State),  said a commander in the military alliance backing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.   The next step is to liberate the city,  the non-Syrian commander said.     It points to a tough battle ahead as the army aims to move from breaching the siege to driving Islamic State militants from their half of the city, the sort of street-by-street warfare in which they excel.         Syrian state news agency SANA said the army had made gains expanding its control near the corridor after heavy artillery and air strikes.  Assad and his allies - Russia, Iran and Shi ite militias including Hezbollah - will follow the relief of Deir al-Zor with an offensive along the Euphrates valley, the commander said.  The Euphrates valley cuts a lush, populous swathe of green about 260 km (160 miles) long and 10 km (6 miles) wide through the Syrian desert from Raqqa to the Iraqi border at al-Bukamal.   The area has been an Islamic State stronghold in Syria but came under attack this year when a U.S.-backed alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias besieged and assaulted Raqqa.  Rapidly losing territory in Syria and Iraq, Islamic State is falling back on the Euphrates towns downstream of Deir al-Zor, including al-Mayadin and al-Bukamal, where many expect it to make a last stand.  Still, the jihadist group specializes in urban combat, using car bombs, mines, tunnels and drones, and has held out against full-scale attack for months in some towns and cities.  Islamic State has 6,000-8,000 fighters left in Syria, despite losing most of its territory across both Iraq and Syria since September 2014, the United States-led coalition said.  Parallel with their thrust toward Deir al-Zor, the Syrian military and its allies have been fighting Islamic State in its last pocket of ground in central Syria, near the town of al-Salamiya on the Homs-Aleppo highway.  On Wednesday, army advances gained control of four villages there, further tightening the pocket, a military media unit run by Lebanon s Hezbollah said.  In Raqqa, the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces alliance says it has taken about 65 percent of Islamic State s former self-declared Syrian capital.  Deir al-Zor lies along the southwest bank of the Euphrates. The government enclave includes the northern half of the city and the Brigade 137 military base to the west.  The army also holds an air base and nearby streets, separated from the rest of the enclave by hundreds of meters of IS-held ground and still cut off from the advancing army.         Government forces will push toward the besieged airbase, the pro-Assad commander said.   Instead of breaking the siege along the main road from Palmyra, stretches of which remain in Islamic State hands, the army reached the Brigade 137 along a narrow salient from the northwest.  The corridor from the west into Brigade 137 was only about 500 meters (yards) wide, the commander said.         The United Nations has estimated that 93,000 civilians were living under IS siege in Deir al-Zor in  extremely difficult  conditions, with some high-altitude air drops supplying them.  Deir al-Zor s provincial governor told state-run television that convoys loaded with food and medicine were on the way, along with ambulances and a mobile clinic. Residents in the enclave had gone years without vegetables, fuel, and other necessities, Mohammed Ibrahim Samra said.   Despite all this, the schools kept running,  he said.  Our people in Deir al-Zor have suffered a lot ... and they still held on to their land.       ",worldnews,"September 6, 2017 ",1
Syrian opposition must accept it has not won the war: U.N.,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Syria s opposition must accept that they have not won the six-and-a-half year war against President Bashar al-Assad, U.N. peace talks mediator Staffan de Mistura said on Wednesday. De Mistura suggested the war was almost over because many countries had got involved principally to defeat Islamic State in Syria, and a national ceasefire should follow soon after. The main rebel-held area, the city of Idlib would be  frozen .   For the opposition, the message is very clear: if they were planning to win the war, facts are proving that is not the case. So now it s time to win the peace,  he told reporters. Asked if he was implying that Assad had won, he said pro-government forces had advanced militarily, but nobody could actually claim to have won the war.   Victory can only be if there is a sustainable political long-term solution. Otherwise instead of war, God forbid, we may see plenty of low intensity guerrilla (conflicts) going on for the next 10 years, and you will see no reconstruction, which is a very sad outcome of winning a war.  De Mistura plans to join ceasefire talks in the Kazakh capital Astana next week, which he said should help resolve the fate of Idlib, a city of 2 million where rebels designated as terrorists by the United Nations are gaining influence.  I am confident...there will be a non-conflictual solution - let s say not a new Aleppo, that s what we want to avoid at any cost, if we have learned from the past,  he said, referring to the greatest battle and humanitarian crisis of the war.  If that takes place Idlib may become frozen in a way in order to avoid becoming a major tragic end to the conflict.  Meanwhile Islamic State was facing imminent defeat in its two main zones of influence - in the city of Raqqa and around the city of Deir al-Zor.  The fact is that Deir al-Zor is almost liberated, in fact it is as far as we are concerned liberated, it s a matter now of a few hours.   Raqqa s fall would follow within days or weeks, leading to the  moment of truth  for a round of negotiations in October. Since early 2016, de Mistura has overseen a tortuous series of peace talks in Geneva that has made almost no visible progress. He said the next round could see an accelerated and more pragmatic approach.  The issue is: is the government, after the liberation of Deir al-Zor and Raqqa, ready and prepared to genuinely negotiate and not simply announce victory, which we all know, and they know too, cannot be announced because it won t be sustainable without a political process?   Will the opposition be able to be unified and realistic enough to realize they did not win the war?  ",worldnews,"September 6, 2017 ",1
French union says will not join far-left protest against Macron reforms,"PARIS (Reuters) - France s hardline CGT union on Wednesday said it would not join the far-left party of Jean-Luc Melenchon in Sept. 23 protests against labor reform in a sign that opposition to President Emmanuel Macron s plan is divided. The union will instead march next week, its leader Philippe Martinez told Paris Match magazine. France s second-largest union the CGT and Melenchon s France Unbowed party are the main opponents of the plan, which includes a cap on payouts for dismissals adjudged unfair and greater freedom for employers to hire and fire.  The largest and third-largest union, the CFDT and FO, have said they would not take to the streets.  The CGT is independent from political parties,  Martinez said. He held a rare meeting with Melenchon on Wednesday. Opinion polls show voters do not like the reforms overall but back most of its individual measures, including direct negotiations between bosses and their staff in small firms. Many in the conservative Republicans party, the biggest opposition bloc in parliament, back the reform.  The CGT can mobilize tens of thousands of activists and its absence could impact turnout for Melenchon s rally. The union lost its position in March as France s biggest. France Unbowed has 17 lawmakers and so can do little to block reforms in the 577-strong parliament but Melenchon is popular and attracted 19.6 percent of the votes in the first round of the presidential election in April. The rally is a key test of the party s capacity to mobilize voters against Macron. Forty-five percent of voters say Melenchon s party is Macron s strongest opponent, more than twice the figure for the Republicans or the far-right National Front, an Ifop-Fiducial poll showed on Tuesday.

German anti-immigrant candidate walks out of TV debate,"BERLIN (Reuters) - One of the top candidates for the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party in this month s election walked out of a live television debate on Tuesday night after being accused of failing to distance herself from right-wingers. The right-wing AfD has gained support by slamming Chancellor Angela Merkel s 2015 decision to open the borders to refugees and is set to enter the national parliament for the first time after the Sept. 24 election. Polls put it on 7-11 percent. Alice Weidel, 38, collected her papers and rushed out of public broadcaster ZDF s studio during a debate with Germany s six other major parties after Andreas Scheuer, a member of  Merkel s conservative bloc, said she should distance herself from far-right figures in the AfD. Scheuer said Alexander Gauland, the AfD s other top candidate, was a  radical right-winger . Gauland has described Bjoern Hoecke, who in January called for a  180 degree turnaround  in the way Germany seeks to atone for Nazi crimes, as part of  the soul of the AfD . Weidel, who styles herself as an economic expert and critic of the euro, has gradually shifted to the right since being chosen as one of the party s chancellor candidates in April. She has called for Hoecke to be expelled from the party. In a statement published shortly after her exit, Weidel accused ZDF moderator Marietta Slomka of being biased and unprofessional:  Ms Slomka shouldn t act out her personal animosities in the television show,  she wrote. The AfD wants to abolish the license fees that finance Germany s public broadcasters. Weidel s statement ended with the comment that Slomka s behavior was  another reason to refuse to pay the license fee . It did not mention the dispute with Scheuer or a preceding fiery discussion on immigration. Some media speculated that Weidel s exit was set up, with Stern magazine s editor in chief Andreas Petzold writing on Twitter:  Alice Weidel s dramatically staged exit was certainly not spontaneous. This is how the AfD cultivates its role as a victim.  ",worldnews,"September 6, 2017 ",1

"U.S. to send 3,500 additional troops to Afghanistan","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States will send about 3,500 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan, U.S. officials said on Wednesday, a figure broadly in line with expectations as the United States boosts support for the Afghan military. The disclosure by the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, comes as Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Marine General Joseph Dunford hold closed door briefings with members of Congress about President Donald Trump s regional strategy. The Pentagon said it would not comment on additional troop numbers until Mattis makes an announcement. If confirmed, it would bring the total number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan to about 14,500. After a months-long review of his Afghanistan policy, Trump committed the United States last week to an open-ended conflict in the country and promised a stepped-up campaign against Taliban insurgents. Last week Mattis said he had signed orders to send additional troops to Afghanistan but did not specify the size of the force, saying he first needed to brief Congress. U.S. officials have for months told Reuters that Trump had given Mattis the authority to send about 4,000 additional troops to Afghanistan. The U.S. presence in Afghanistan peaked at more than 100,000 troops in 2011, when Washington was under domestic political pressure to draw down the costly operation. Some U.S. officials have told Reuters they questioned the benefit of sending more troops to Afghanistan because any politically palatable number would not be enough to turn the tide, much less create stability and security. To date, more than 2,300 Americans have been killed and over 17,000 wounded in Afghanistan. ",worldnews,"September 6, 2017 ",1
Airbus issues safety advice on Tiger helicopters flying in turbulence,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Airbus Helicopters has warned pilots of its Tiger military helicopters to be careful of rapid switches from auto pilot to manual mode during turbulence, after initial indications that such a switch may have played a role in a fatal crash in Mali.  The unit of European aerospace giant Airbus said in a statement that the warning was aimed at increasing operators  safety and should not be seen as an indication of the possible root cause of the crash during a U.N. mission in July, which killed both crew members. According to a source who has seen the Airbus Helicopters  bulletin that carried the warning, the bulletin said an unexpected switch from automatic to manual flight mode  may have played a role in the accident, according to information currently available . The bulletin did not say whether the unexpected switch had happened automatically or been done manually. German officials last week met to discuss the accident in the Mali desert, but decided to maintain existing flight restrictions on the aircraft after failing to reach a definite conclusion about the cause of the crash. Airbus said its safety guidance - sent to operators in Germany, Australia, France and Spain - was meant to  standardise all flight manuals and remind operators that crews must adjust their attention to environmental conditions while using the auto pilot during turbulence.  The guidance reiterated passages already in the flight manuals which instruct pilots not to intentionally enter areas with more than moderate turbulence, and to avoid flying through  areas of severe turbulence.  A German defence ministry report last month said the Tiger that crashed in Mali had been flying at 250 kilometres (155 miles) per hour at a height of 550 metres (1,800 feet) when it  suddenly sank its nose and entered a sharp dive.  The helicopter crashed 10 seconds later and burst into flames. The report, however, said it was too early to speculate about the causes of the crash. German officials continue to investigate the cause of the crash.  Officials say it could take months to complete the probe. At the time of the crash, they said there were no signs the helicopter was downed by an attack. Germany s deployment of four Tiger helicopters to Mali earlier this year was controversial since the aircraft required extra maintenance given the strong heat and other environmental conditions in the African country, although officials say the aircraft had been performing normally. Germany agreed to deploy the Tiger helicopters and four NH-90 transport helicopters after the Dutch military said it could not continue the work in Mali.  But Germany s increased support was heavily debated in parliament, and required a waiver from the German military allowing the helicopters to operate in higher temperatures. Germany currently has 26 Tiger helicopters. ",worldnews,"September 6, 2017 ",1

He is yet to say if he will seek a second term.  In 2014/2015 he said he was going to run for only one time to clean up the mess that the (previous) PDP government did in Nigeria. And I took him for his word that he is not contesting in 2019,  Minister of Women Affairs Alhassan said. Alhassan said in the interview she would resign if Buhari seeks re-election and would support former vice president Atiku Abubakar if he decides to run. Alhassan s portfolio ranks relatively low down in Nigeria s cabinet. Abubakar was vice president from 1999 to 2007 as part of the People s Democratic Party (PDP). He joined the All Progressives Congress (APC), Buhari s party, in 2014. She said Buhari made the comments in 2015 to APC members but gave no further details. The president s two spokesmen declined to comment on the minister s remarks.  Buhari, 74, returned on Aug. 19 from three months of medical leave in Britain for an unspecified ailment. It was his second stint of sick leave this year following a break between January and March.  Many people say they doubt whether Buhari is well enough to serve another term in Nigeria, which is Africa s most populous country and has the continent s biggest economy.  If today Mr. President says he is running in 2019 I will go to him respectfully and thank him for giving me an opportunity to serve and then tell him that I have to resign because my political father may be running,  said Alhassan.

Czech PM candidate Babis to face fraud charges after vote,"PRAGUE (Reuters) - Czech lawmakers voted on Wednesday to let police bring fraud charges against Andrej Babis, the leading candidate to become prime minister in next month s elections. Babis, a billionaire businessman and founder of the poll-leading ANO party, denies allegations that he hid ownership of one of his firms to receive a 50-million Czech crown ($2.29-million) EU subsidy meant for small business in 2008. The 63-year-old former finance minister has dismissed a police investigation into the case as a ploy by political and business adversaries to chase him out of politics.  You will not silence me, intimidate me, stop me. And you will not get rid of me,  Babis told parliament before MPs overwhelmingly voted to lift the immunity from prosecution granted to lawmakers. He ended up backing the motion himself, saying he wanted to clear his name, though other ANO party deputies boycotted the vote.  So, give me up. I ask you to lift my immunity so that the truth can be revealed,  he told the lower house.  Wednesday s decision, backed by 123 to four, does not stop Babis from standing in the Oct. 20-21 election. But it could dent his support. Several potential coalition partners have said they could not work with a prime minister charged with a crime. Babis s ANO party, a junior member in a Social Democrat-led government, leads opinion polls by a double-digit margin - though there have been no major surveys taken since the police requested his immunity be lifted on Aug. 10. The party has promised to revamp politics and root out what Babis calls mafia-like networks of business and political interests. Governments led by the traditional parties - the center-right Civic Democrats and the center-left Social Democrats - brought the country into NATO and the European Union but lost many voters in recent years amid a series of corruption scandals. Babis s adversaries argue he got rich in the environment that he now criticizes, often doing business with the state. His Agrofert group is the biggest Czech private employer with more than 30,000 staff. The subsidy under investigation, was paid for building a conference center near Prague called Stork Nest, before Babis entered politics. The police investigation is expected to last well beyond the October vote and Babis will win immunity again if reelected to parliament, as expected, which would force the police to ask again for permission to charge him.

DNA tests on Dali's body refute woman's paternity claim,"MADRID (Reuters) - DNA tests on the exhumed body of Salvador Dali showed that a Spanish woman who brought a paternity suit against him was not his daughter, the surrealist painter s foundation said on Wednesday. The court supervising the tests had informed its lawyers that Maria Pilar Abel was not Dali s biological daughter after comparing her DNA with samples taken from his remains, the foundation said in a statement. A spokesman for the court declined to confirm the results of the tests. Contacted by phone, Abel said she had not yet received the results from the court. The Madrid court in June ordered forensic scientists to exhume Dali s body after Abel, who was born in Dali s home town of Figueres, filed a paternity claim that alleged her mother had an affair with him.  This conclusion is not a surprise for the Foundation, since at no point has there been any evidence that she was a relative,  said the foundation, which manages Dali s estate.  The Foundation is happy that this puts an end to an absurd and artificial controversy.  Dali, who died in 1989 aged 84, was one of the 20th century s most famous and easily recognized artists. His paintings include  The Persistence of Memory , with its iconic images of melting clocks, and he also turned his hand to movies, sculpture and advertising. ",worldnews,"September 6, 2017 ",1
Danish Queen's husband Prince Henrik diagnosed with dementia,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Denmark s Prince Henrik, the husband of Queen Margrethe, has been diagnosed with dementia, a condition that has affected his behavior and judgment, the palace said on Wednesday. The announcement came weeks after the 83-year-old announced he did not want to be buried next to his wife, saying he was unhappy he had never been acknowledged as her equal.  Following a longer diagnostic process and lately a series of examinations during late summer, a specialist team ... has now concluded that his Royal Highness Prince Henrik suffers from dementia,  the Royal House said in a statement.   The extent of the cognitive failure is ... greater than expected considering the age of The Prince,  it added. Henrik, who married Margrethe in 1967, retired last year and renounced his title of Prince Consort, saying he was disappointed not to be named King Consort. Since then he has participated in very few official duties and spent much of his time at his private vineyard in France.  In Denmark, a princess traditionally becomes queen when her husband takes the throne, but a man does not become king when the roles are reversed. Born Henri Marie Jean Andr  de Laborde de Monpezat in France in 1934, Henrik has two sons with the queen, Crown Prince Frederik and Prince Joachim. ",worldnews,"September 6, 2017 ",1
Two arrested after French counter-terrorism raid near Paris,"VILLEJUIF, France (Reuters) - Two people were arrested after police found products that can be used to make explosives in a flat south of Paris on Wednesday, French Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said. Some of the products found in the flat in Villejuif could  be used to make the unstable explosive TATP, one source close to the investigation said.  TATP has been used by militants in several attacks in western Europe in recent years, including Manchester in May, Brussels in 2016 and Paris in 2015. Gas bottles were also found in the flat, other sources said.  The police raid followed a tip from a craftsman, Collomb said in a statement. One source said it was a locksmith who saw chemical products and tools when looking into the flat. The two people arrested were driving a small van that belongs to the flat s tenant, a police source said. France s counter-terrorism prosecutor is in charge of the investigation, a judicial source said. (This story has been refiled to correct typo in paragraph 2) ",worldnews,"September 6, 2017 ",1

NATO urges trading partners to step up pressure on North Korea,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - NATO urged all countries to step up efforts to enforce sanctions on North Korea and stop its weapons tests - an appeal that diplomats said was aimed at the reclusive state s trading partners, suspected of holding back on penalties. All 29 ambassadors of the U.S.-led military alliance issued the statement as world powers sought a common response to North Korea s sixth and largest nuclear bomb test, amid fears that more were on their way.  It is now imperative that all nations implement more thoroughly and transparently existing UN sanctions and make further efforts to apply decisive pressure to convince the DPRK regime to abandon its current threatening and destabilizing path,  the statement read, referring to North Korea s official name, the Democratic People s Republic of Korea.  Diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there were concerns that existing sanctions on North Korea have not been fully enforced by Pyongyang s few remaining trading partners, namely China and several African nations.  China, African, other Asian countries continue to trade with North Korea. Our governments are saying to Guinea-Bissau, to Malaysia, to China that they need to tighten their sanctions enforcement,  said a NATO diplomat involved in discussions about how to resolve the North Korea crisis.  Efforts to impose fresh sanctions on Pyongyang at the United Nations have run into opposition.  President Vladimir Putin has resisted restrictions on oil exports to the country, saying the crisis will not be resolved by sanctions. NATO is not directly involved in the nuclear crisis, but it has repeatedly called on North Korea to abandon its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said separately he planned to travel to South Korea and Japan in October ",worldnews,"September 6, 2017 ",1
Gupta emails still under investigation: top South Africa prosecutor,"CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - South Africa s top prosecutor said police were still examining a trove of leaked documents detailing relations between the wealthy Gupta family and President Jacob Zuma, but it was too early to say if a prosecution should be launched. Wednesday s comments to lawmakers by Shaun Abrahams were the first time the head of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has spoken publicly about the Gupta case.  The leaked emails need to be investigated,  Abrahams told a parliamentary committee in response to a question on whether his department had taken a position on the matter.  How can you make a determination on its admissibility if that (police) investigation is still ongoing? , he said. The elite  Hawks  police unit, which probes organized and commercial crime and major corruption, is investigating the Gupta allegations, NPA officials told a parliamentary briefing. Under the South African system, police investigate a case and then send a report to the NPA, which decides whether to take the case further. Senior ANC members and the opposition accuse the brothers of using their relationship with Zuma to wield influence and win government contracts, allegations that in part stem from a trove of 100,000 documents and emails leaked to reporters. The Gupta family of Indian-born businessmen were not immediately available for comment on Abraham s remarks. The brothers, who own a computer business and uranium mine, have previously denied any wrongdoing. Atul Gupta, one of three Gupta brothers, said last month that the emails were fake. Zuma has also denied any wrongdoing but his relationship with the Guptas has deepened a divide within his ruling African National Congress ahead of a conference in December where Zuma s successor as party leader - and therefore president - will be chosen. Zuma survived a no-confidence motion in August. He can remain president until a 2019 election but some opposition politicians have demanded he resign over material in the leaked emails.

EU agrees to extend blacklist on Russians over Ukraine turmoil,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union agreed on Wednesday to extend for another six months its blacklist of 149 Russian nationals and Ukrainian separatists, as well as 38 entities, for their role in the turmoil in Ukraine, sources in Brussels said.  During a weekly meeting in Brussels, representatives of the 28 EU states agreed on the roll over, which will formally be adopted on Sept. 14, and prolong the visa ban and asset freeze list until mid-March. The bloc first imposed sanctions on Russia after it annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Kiev in March 2014, and ratcheted them up as Moscow went on to back a separatist revolt in the east of the former Soviet republic.  Russia vows to never return Crimea though the annexation has not been internationally recognized and is denounced as illegal. The conflict in east Ukraine has killed more than 10,000 people and is still simmering, a key factor souring Russia s relations with the West, including the EU. The bloc s separate main economic sanctions against Russia, which curb EU cooperation in the energy, defense and financial fields, are in place until the end of January 2018.  Apart from separatist leaders in Crimea and east Ukraine, the EU s blacklist, which prevents people getting visas or freezes their assets, includes senior Russian officials and companies that have supported or benefited from the crisis.

EU refugee court ruling triggers new east-west feuding,"LUXEMBOURG/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The EU s highest court ruled on Wednesday that member states must take in a share of refugees who reach Europe, dismissing complaints by Slovakia and Hungary and reigniting an east-west row that has shaken the Union s cohesion. The Mediterranean migrant crisis which prompted mandatory quotas in 2015 for relocating asylum seekers from Greece and Italy has receded, easing immediate pressure to force compliance on nationalist leaders who are making electoral capital from lambasting the EU while benefiting from Brussels  subsidies. But defiant rejection from some ex-communist states that the EU accuses of slipping on democratic standards - Hungary called the judgment a political  rape  of EU law - indicated no let-up in tensions that are testing the Union s internal cooperation. In Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel is fighting for re-election against opponents who criticize her for taking in over a million migrants at the height of the drama, the interior minister threatened legal action against countries which fail to take in their allotted share of Syrian and other refugees. But Hungary, where outspoken Prime Minister Viktor Orban has built border fences and made keeping out migrants a key plank of his re-election campaign for next year, branded the European Court of Justice ruling  appalling and irresponsible .  This decision jeopardizes the security and future of all of Europe,  Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said.   Politics has raped European law and values.  Italy, now the main destination for migrants taking to the sea following measures to block the route from Turkey to Greece and from Greece northward, has been prominent in calling for the wealthier Western states to cut EU subsidies to poor neighbors which do not show  solidarity  in taking in migrants. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has echoed that threat, warning Orban  solidarity is not a one-way street . But the EU executive is also anxious to calm tensions ahead of negotiations on a new seven-year EU budget that will be all the harder because of a hole left by Britain s imminent departure. The Commission said on Wednesday it may seek fines at the ECJ within weeks for Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic if they do not start or resume taking people from the south. Poland and Hungary, which argue Muslim immigration is a threat to their national security and stability, have in two years taken in none of their respective quotas of about 6,200 and 1,300 people. However, the executive, which is separately considering trying to suspend eastern heavyweight Poland for undermining the independence of its judiciary, stressed it wanted solutions that would unite the 28-nation bloc. Slovakia s prime minister said he still rejected quotas but was willing to help in other ways. And as the Union digests a Brexit vote last year that was partly driven by concern over migration, many states that backed the quota system in 2015 and are increasingly exasperated by Polish and Hungarian hostility to Brussels are also reluctant to force through new policies that may bolster eurosceptics across Europe who say the EU is trampling on national sovereignty.  If we push it through above their heads, they will use it in their anti-EU propaganda at home,  one EU diplomat said, while noting that, with the migration crisis dropping out of the headlines, all sides might find a way to resolve the issue. The Commission is working on reforms to the so-called Dublin rules under which people arriving in the EU must stay to claim asylum in the first country they reach. A mechanism to help the likes of Greece and Italy in emergencies has proved elusive. However, governments may find it easier to negotiate now that the migration is not quite so prominent in local politics. The Luxembourg-based ECJ dismissed  in their entirety  the arguments advanced by Hungary and Slovakia with backing from Poland and endorsed the Commission s solution which eventually ordered states to take in nearly 100,000 Syrians and others.  The mechanism actually contributes to enabling Greece and Italy to deal with the impact of the 2015 migration crisis and is proportionate,  the court said in statement. Difficulties in identifying candidates for relocation - and a reluctance of refugees to settle other than in the wealthier west of Europe - saw fewer than 30,000 people relocated in two years, but the Commission noted an acceleration in the program this year and said it would continue to move people northward. Among the gravest problems the migration crisis caused was member states reimposing controls on internal EU frontiers. That had jeopardized one of the Union s most cherished achievements and for a time appeared to threaten to disrupt internal traffic. EU Migration Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos said special exemptions that have allowed the likes of Germany, Austria, Denmark and Sweden to control their borders with EU neighbors should now end when they expire in two months  time.

"Indian journalists, activists protest murder of newspaper publisher","BENGALURU, India (Reuters) - Indian journalists and rights activists protested on Wednesday against the murder of an outspoken publisher of a weekly tabloid amid growing concerns about freedom of the press at a time of rising nationalism and intolerance of dissent. Gauri Lankesh, 55, the editor and publisher of the Kannada-language  Gauri Lankesh Patrike  newspaper, was shot dead on Tuesday by unidentified assailants near her home in the southern city of Bengaluru.  She had parked her car outside her gate and was walking to the main entrance of her home when the attackers fired at least seven rounds, killing her, police said. The motive was not known. Lankesh was a fierce advocate of secularism and opposed hardline Hindu groups associated with Prime Narendra Modi s right-wing, nationalist ruling party. Her weekly, with a circulation of more than 5,000, is regarded as influential in the state, read by policy makers and politicians.  Lankesh spent decades with various media outlets before taking over the newspaper started by her father. Several journalist groups, including the Editors  Guild, Press Club of India and Press Association, held protests in cities across India, calling her murder a  brutal assault on the freedom of the press .  They said she was a critical, secular voice at a time when the country was being swept by a wave of right-wing, Hindu nationalism.   She was an idealist and would take on the right-wing forces on several controversial issues,  said Y.P. Rajesh, an executive editor at the news website The Print and a long-time friend of Lankesh. The U.S. embassy in New Delhi also condemned the killing. The murder is a new low in India s recent record of protecting journalists.  The Committee to Protect Journalists has said that there have been no convictions in any of the 27 cases of journalists murdered in India because of their work since 1992. This year, the country of 1.3 billion people slipped three places to 136th in the World Press Freedom Index, compiled by Reporters Without Borders. The group said Hindu nationalists, on the rise since the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) swept to power in 2014, were  trying to purge all manifestations of anti-national thought . Journalists seen to be critical of Hindu nationalists are often insulted on social media, and some women reporters have been threatened with assault.  People, including BJP members, have also openly insulted journalists, using terms like  presstitute  - a combination press and prostitute - to berate them. In recent weeks, Lankesh had posted videos on her Facebook page that were critical of Modi s economic policies and the rise of hardline Hindu groups since he came to power. Last year, she was sentenced to six months in jail after a defamation case was filed by a BJP member. She was released on bail. Ananth Kumar, a federal minister in the Modi government, said the state government must arrest those behind the killing. The state government in Karnataka, run by the Congress party, said it had set up a special investigations team to investigate  and police were examining CCTV footage. M.N. Anucheth, a senior police official investigating the case, said Lankesh was shot in the head, neck and chest.  This is an attempt to silence all of us   all of those who believe in democracy and decency,  Ramchandra Guha, a historian told the Indian Express newspaper.

France's Macron plans end to retire-young rail pensions,"PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron wants to scrap rules allowing some state rail workers to retire on a full pension up to 10 years before most other French workers. The reform plan risks inflaming tensions with labor unions who led the biggest strikes of recent decades in 1995 against a similar proposal that the government of the time floated before abandoning it and losing power. Macron has said his government will embark on overhauling France s myriad pension schemes in early 2018, creating a single system for all.  The shake-up of the pension scheme tailored for the SNCF state rail group would affect nearly 200,000 employees, in particular train drivers who can retire as early as age 52, a decade before the pension age of 62. Macron first outlined the idea in an internal SNCF publication in July. He said he wanted a draft legislation presented early in 2018 and a reform that would be effective by mid-2018 or early 2019. Asked about the president s plan for the SNCF s pensions on Wednesday, government spokesman Christophe Castaner said it fell within the wider pension reform package.   That s the track the president wants to take,  Castaner told a weekly news briefing.  Macron, a 39-year-old former investment banker, was elected on a promise to push through far-reaching social and economic reforms, a program that has drawn increasing public opposition since he took office four months ago.  His government last Thursday presented plans to ease labor regulations with only one of the three biggest unions threatening protests. But tougher tests may lie ahead, including overhauling employment insurance this autumn and then pension reforms. In 1995, plans to abolish a pension scheme specific to SNCF workers sparked the biggest wave of street protests and public transport strikes in recent French history. Those protests, including a three-week rail strike, ultimately led to the reform being abandoned, the resignation of then prime minister Alain Juppe and an election where voters replaced the right-wing government with a Socialist one in 1997. Macron said on the campaign trail he wanted to smooth out the big differences between the pensions of state and private sector employees, while keeping the pension age at 62.  Beyond the SNCF, that will mean reforming the generous pensions of big state-owned companies such as utility EDF, whose unions have fiercely defended their privileges.

Kenyan police not cooperating with watchdog over election-related deaths: sources,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenyan police are not cooperating with investigations by a government-funded watchdog into violent deaths that followed last month s election, two sources with direct knowledge of the probes said. The head of the Independent Police Oversight Authority (IPOA) told Reuters in mid-August it was fast-tracking investigations of all deaths and injuries for which the police were alleged by rights groups to be responsible following the Aug. 8 national ballot.  Macharia Njeru had attended autopsies of a young girl and a baby and called the probes into those deaths  priority cases . But the sources told Reuters that police had to date not transferred any documents or evidence to IPOA, which is mandated to investigate cases reported by individuals or police or referred to them by human rights organizations.  The big frustration of IPOA is that the police do not share information  critical to investigations into police misconduct, one of the sources said.  ... (But) officers feel IPOA is there to harass them.  The police are required by law to cooperate with the IPOA, which is civilian-run. A spokesman for the force, Charles Owino, did not respond to phone calls on Wednesday afternoon. Interior Minister Fred Matiang i last month denied accusations of police brutality. He said  criminal elements , not legitimate political protesters, had caused trouble after the election that provoked a police response. Protests broke out after the election board announced that incumbent President Uhuru Kenyatta had won by 1.4 million votes. Opposition leader Raila Odinga disputed the result and took his case to the Supreme Court, which on Friday scrapped the result and ordered a new poll within 60 days. [L8N1LI1QY]      The state-funded Kenya National Commission on Human Rights says at least 28 people were killed in shootings in the days after the results were announced. It said it believes the killings were linked to the police. Evidence relevant to the investigations could include documents such as police deployment plans and operational orders as well as internal reports into alleged misconduct by officers or units, one of the sources said. An IPOA spokeswoman said the monitor did not discuss ongoing investigations with the media.  The authority became operational in 2012 and has so far secured the conviction of two police officers in a 2014 murder of a teenage girl in a coastal Kenyan town.  In its annual reports for 2014 to 2016, it listed  suspicion by the police , delays in response to requests for information and lack of cooperation from some officers as factors impeding its operations.

"Britain could still reverse Brexit, former minister Heseltine says","LONDON (Reuters) - Brexit could be reversed if economic pain prompts a change in public opinion that brings a new generation of political leaders to power in Britain, former Conservative minister Michael Heseltine said. Heseltine, who helped topple Margaret Thatcher in 1990 but ultimately failed to win the top job, said that Britain could face another election in just two years and that Prime Minister Theresa May would not lead the party into that election. A supporter of EU membership, Heseltine said he saw a scenario in which Britain would not leave the European Union as scheduled in late March 2019.   There is now a possibility that Brexit will not happen, but it will need a change in public opinion,  Heseltine, 84, told Reuters in an interview.  There may be indications but there is no really substantive evidence of public opinion moving but I think that it will happen. My guess is that public opinion will move,  he said. Heseltine said the shift in Brexit policy by the opposition Labour Party - including staying in the European single market and customs union for a transitional period - indicated Labour had sensed the wind of a change in public opinion. May, who quietly opposed Brexit ahead of the referendum, has formally notified the bloc of Britain s intention to leave and divorce talks are under way. Some European leaders have suggested Britain could change its mind, while former Conservative prime minister John Major has said there is a credible case for giving Britons a second vote on the Brexit deal. His successor, Labour s Tony Blair, has said repeatedly that Brexit can and should be stopped. In the June 2016 referendum voters in the United Kingdom backed leaving the EU by a margin of 51.9 percent to 48.1 percent. The world s fifth-biggest economy initially withstood the shock of the Brexit vote, but growth began to slow sharply this year as inflation rose on the falling value of the pound and hit households. May, who has insisted that Britain will leave the European Union, said last month that she wanted to fight the next parliamentary election, not due until 2022. Heseltine, though, said that seemed unlikely given her botched gamble on a snap election in June which lost her party its majority in the lower house of parliament.  I don t think she will fight the next election, but there is no agreement on her successor. All the people indicated as possibles are singing the same song, and in my view the song is unattractive and will become less attractive,  he said.  Ousted  is a specific word, but there are many ways in which the Tory party operates - what it will quite look like I am not going to say. But I think there will be a change to a new leader before the next election.   They have two years before the next election.  Heseltine said he was waiting for a politician to emerge with the courage to challenge the Brexit consensus of British politics and explain to voters the full import of the divorce.  Within a relatively short period of time, the Brexit negotiations will sour even more than they already have, and the Tories will be left holding the baby. Everybody else will have moved away from Brexit,  Heseltine said. Brexit, he said, was a  monumental mistake  that would make Britain a spectator of 21st century history, bleed its wealth and relegate it from the league of leading global powers.  The idea that we are not European is just to spit in the wind: Anyone who has read Shakespeare knows just how European we are,  said Heseltine, who the Sunday Times says has a fortune of 300 million pounds ($390 million). He said Brexit was far more significant than the 1956 Suez crisis, when British forces were forced by the United States to withdraw troops from Egypt in a blunt illustration of Britain s lost imperial power. Heseltine said the EU was unlikely to give Britain the beneficial divorce deal it wanted because to do so would risk unraveling the EU itself.  It is difficult to see how the Brexit negotiations can be anything other than discordant. The issues are huge and they come down to a very simple question: Can the Europeans agree to someone leaving the club on  the cake and eat it  basis?    I don t think they can. And they have made it clear they don t intend to. If they were to change their mind so that we have our cake and eat it, well of course I will be wrong. But I don t think they are going to do that.

Munich memorial marks 1972 Olympic Games attack on Israeli team,"MUNICH, Germany (Reuters) - Victims of the attack on the Israeli team at the 1972 Olympic Games were remembered by Germany and Israel on Wednesday with a memorial, following a long campaign by their relatives. German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his Israeli counterpart Reuven Rivlin attended the inauguration of the  Munich 1972 massacre memorial  at Munich s Olympic Park, 45 years after the attack by Palestinian gunmen.  Relatives of the victims and the state of Israel waited almost half a century for this moment,  Rivlin said.  45 years have passed for an official Israeli delegation to return to this place. The Munich Olympics became the blood Olympics.  Members of the Israeli Olympic team were taken hostage on Sept. 5, 1972, at the poorly secured athletes village by Palestinians from the Black September group. Eleven Israelis, a German policeman as well as five of the Palestinian gunmen died after a stand-off at the village and then a nearby airfield, as police rescue efforts failed. The memorial offers some comfort for relatives who have also long demanded a minute s silence at the Opening Ceremonies of Olympics Games, only to be consistently turned down by the IOC. Steinmeier said it had taken too long for the memorial to be built.  It is high time and we owe it firstly to you, the relatives,  Steinmeier said.  The Olympic village became a place of Palestinian terrorists, a stage for their boundless hatred for Israel. It should never have happened.  Ankie Spitzer, whose fencing coach husband, Andre, was one of the victims, and Ilana Romano, wife of weightlifter Joseph Romano, have waged a decades-long campaign to get a commemoration at the Games  opening ceremony.

Tunisia's Chahed names new cabinet after tensions,"TUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisia s prime minister named a new cabinet on Wednesday, appointing one of his advisors from the Islamist Ennahda party to a new economic reforms ministry in a deal that ends weeks of infighting over posts. The compromise cabinet should give Prime Minister Youssef Chahed the impetus to push ahead with tough reforms of public sector wages the pension system designed to improve Tunisia finances in line with IMF demands. Chahed, in power for just over a year, restored Ridha Chalgoum, a former finance minister close to the ruling Nidaa Tounes party, to that ministry. He also named Lotfi Braham, another Nidaa Tounes ally, as interior minister, according to a statement on the appointments released by Chahed s office. He also appointed Ennahda member Taoufik Rajhi, one of his economic advisors, to the new post of economic reforms minister,  Six years since the 2011 uprising that ousted autocrat Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, Tunisia has been held up as a model by avoiding the violence that affected other nations after their  Arab Spring  revolts. However, successive governments have struggled to enact fiscal reforms that have been delayed by political infighting and government wariness of social tensions over jobs and economic conditions that helped spark the 2011 uprising. Nidaa Tounes allies were appointed to six of the 13 cabinet changes. Ennahda kept three posts and the new economics reforms portfolio. Nidaa Tounes hardliners had been pushing Chahed hard for more representation in the cabinet to better reward their 2014 election victory, while rivals in the power-sharing government pushed back. Ennahda said the party saw no reason for a major overhaul other than filling vacant minister posts. Political squabbling and Tunisia s compromise-style politics to maintain stability have in the past delayed economic reforms as parties jockey for position. This week the powerful UGTT labor union warned it could intervene as mediator, something it has done in past when tensions between secular Nidaa Tounes and Islamist Ennahda threatened to scuttle Tunisia s young democracy.  Chahed s deal with Nidaa Tounes and Ennahda is likely to ease tensions and to boost government stability,  said Riccardo Fabiani at Eurasia Group.   After scheduled local elections in December, this relationship is likely to gradually deteriorate again as tensions rise ahead of the 2019 presidential and legislative ballots,  he said.

Young generation revulsed by Breivik may sway Norway's election,"HAMAR, Norway (Reuters) - Young Norwegians, politicized by the massacre of 77 people by far-right militant Anders Behring Breivik, will play a key role in an election next week that could hinge on issues close to their hearts such as climate change. In 2011 Breivik killed eight people in a bombing in central Oslo and gunned down another 69 at a Labour Party youth camp on Utoeya Island, in the worst attacks in Norway since World War Two.  They motivated a generation of young people, often children or teenagers at the time, to become more involved in mainstream politics - both on the left and the right - in a backlash against his xenophobic and anti-Muslim world view. And data shows young voters are now more likely than in the past to actually cast their ballots. (For a graphic on Norway's parliamentary elections click tmsnrt.rs/2ugJCjo)   I felt so powerless that day. It was a way to fight back,  said Anja Ariel Toernes Brekke, 21, who joined the youth wing of the Labour Party a few weeks after Breivik s attacks. She is now the general secretary of the far-left Red party s youth wing.   I wanted to prove that the left was not weakened, that there would be people with those beliefs to replace those who had died,  she told Reuters. Brekke is touring schools in Norway to get the youth vote out. On a recent morning, she was at the Cathedral School in Hamar, 120 km (75 miles) north of Oslo, to take part in a debate with other young politicians in front of 1,250 high-school students packed in a gym hall.   Our society is more unequal. What we lack is justice. We need a new politics,  she told the crowd, to applause.  Her party, the Reds, could be one of several kingmakers in Monday s parliamentary election, in which the right-wing bloc of Conservative Prime Minister Erna Solberg is neck-and-neck in opinion polls with an opposition grouping led by Jonas Gahr Stoere s Labour. Younger voters tend to care more than the average Norwegian about issues such as schools, climate change and the environment, especially linked to Norway s oil and gas production, researchers say. The trend has been called  Generation Utoeya  by the political scientist who identified it, Johannes Bergh at the Institute of Social Research in Oslo. According to Bergh s research, published in the 2015 book  The Vote and Voters  he co-edited with Bernt Aardal, some 13.8 percent of first-time voters said they belonged to a party in 2013, the last time a parliamentary election took place, up from 6.0 percent in 2009. This more-than-doubling was higher than the increase reported for all voters, to 9.3 percent from 7.2 percent, and it was spread across the political spectrum - not just for Labour, the target of Breivik s attack.  It did come as a surprise. We had sort of expected that young people would (go) for Labour,  Bergh told Reuters.   We saw a spike in the membership of the youth wing of the Labour party immediately after the attacks. But the same thing happened with the Conservatives too. The attacks were an attack on Norwegian democracy, not on a political party.   Young people are also voting more since  July 22  - the common shorthand for the killings by Breivik, who is serving a 21-year jail term that can be extended indefinitely. At the last election in 2013, 66.5 percent of 18- to 21-year-olds cast ballots, up more than 10 percentage points from 2009. Parties are paying more attention to this young constituency.  Politicians have to listen to young people and have to make an effort to appeal to young people,  said Bergh. In the longer term, he believes the Utoeya generation effect will help ensure the renewal of democracy in Norway.  It is going to be positive. Once young people start voting, they tend to continue later in life.  The future of Norway s oil industry has emerged as a key issue for voters this time around. The small but growing Green Party, which pledges to stop oil exploration and phase out production within 15 years, is emerging as a potential key in deciding who will get to govern the Scandinavian country.  It was certainly on the mind of some first-time voters in Hamar.  We need to phase out oil production and respect the Paris climate agreement,  said 17-year-old student Signe Dahl.  We need to turn Norway into an environmental nation from an oil nation,  she told Reuters. Dahl, who can vote as she is turning 18 later this year, said she had whittled down her choice of party to between the Green Party and the Reds. Her friend Silje Fugleberg, 18, agreed:  We must think about other resources to use than oil. We must think about Norway s future and the environment.  Before the debate, she was considering voting either for the Socialist Left Party or the Red Party. After the debate and listening to Brekke,  I think I have decided and will vote for the Reds,  she said. ",worldnews,"September 6, 2017 ",1
Syrian government forces used chemical weapons more than two dozen times: U.N.,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Government forces have used chemical weapons more than two dozen times during Syria s civil war, including in April s deadly attack on Khan Sheikhoun, U.N. war crimes investigators said on Wednesday. A government warplane dropped sarin on the town in Idlib province, killing more than 80 civilians, the U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Syria said, in the most conclusive findings to date from investigations into that chemical weapon attack. The panel also said U.S. air strikes on a mosque in Al-Jina in rural Aleppo in March that killed 38 people, including children, failed to take precautions in violation of international law, but did not constitute a war crime. The weapons used on Khan Sheikhoun were previously identified as containing sarin, an odorless nerve agent. But that conclusion, reached by a fact-finding mission of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), did not say who was responsible.   Government forces continued the pattern of using chemical weapons against civilians in opposition-held areas. In the gravest incident, the Syrian air force used sarin in Khan Sheikhoun, Idlib, killing dozens, the majority of whom were women and children,  the U.N. report said, declaring the attack a war crime. Commission chairman Paulo Pinheiro told a news conference:   Not having access did not prevent us from establishing facts or reasonable grounds to believe what happened during the attack and establishing who is responsible.  In their 14th report since 2011, U.N. investigators said they had in all documented 33 chemical weapons attacks to date. Twenty-seven were by the government of President Bashar al-Assad, including seven between March 1 to July 7. Perpetrators had not been identified yet in six attacks, they said. The Assad government has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons. It said its strikes in Khan Sheikhoun hit a weapons depot belonging to rebel forces, a claim  excluded  by Pinheiro.  That attack led U.S. President Donald Trump to launch the first U.S. air strikes on a Syrian air base. A separate joint inquiry by the United Nations and OPCW aims to report by October on who was to blame for Khan Sheikhoun. The U.N. investigators interviewed 43 witnesses, victims, and first responders linked to the attack. Satellite imagery, photos of bomb remnants and early warning reports were used. The independent investigators said they were gravely concerned about the impact of international coalition strikes on civilians.  We continue to investigate coalition air strikes carried out to expel ISIS from Raqqa resulting in an increasing number of civilian casualties,  Pinheiro said. The report said:  In al-Jina, Aleppo, forces of the United States of America failed to take all feasible precautions to protect civilians and civilian objects when attacking a mosque, in violation of international humanitarian law.  A U.S. military investigator said in June the air strike was a valid and legal attack on a meeting of al Qaeda fighters.  However, the commission however has not found any evidence that such an al Qaeda meeting was taking place,  Pinheiro said. The American F-15s hit the building adjacent to the prayer hall with 10 bombs, followed by a Reaper drone that fired two Hellfire missiles at people fleeing, the U.N. report said.    Most of the residents of al-Jina, relatives of victims and first responders interviewed by the Commission stated on that on the evening in question, a religious gathering was being hosted in the mosque s service building. This was a regular occurrence.  ",worldnews,"September 6, 2017 ",1
Factbox: Humanitarian crisis worsens in Bangladesh as many Rohingya flee Myanmar,"(Reuters) - About 146,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh since violence erupted in Myanmar in late August, U.N. workers said on Wednesday. This has brought to 233,000 the number of Rohingya who have sought refuge in Bangladesh since October 2016. The exodus has put pressure on aid agencies and communities already helping hundreds of thousands of refugees from previous violence in Myanmar.  Following are some details on the crisis gathered from U.N. sources working in the Cox s Bazar district of Bangladesh, on the Myanmar border. *Landmine injuries occurred on Sept. 5 with two children brought in for treatment at the Gundum border area.  *The influx of refugees via marine routes has increased, with a sharp increase noted in Shamlapur from 1,090 individuals on Sept. 4 to 12,500 on Sept. 5. *Around 33,000 refugees have gathered at three new spontaneous settlements that have sprung up at Unchiprang, Moinar Ghona and Thangkhali. There are acute humanitarian needs in these rapidly expanding settlements, especially for emergency health, safe water, food and shelter support. *Four mobile medical teams are being deployed to different locations, and two more are planned. *No deliveries were performed by the midwives in the last two days for new arrivals, indicating that many may have delivered outside of available health facilities. *Strengthened family tracing mechanisms are needed for unaccompanied children and other separated families. Most children have arrived with their mothers as their fathers are missing or arrested.  *A total of 177 incidents of gender-based violence have been reported in the refugee camps since Aug. 27. Eighteen survivors of this violence have been referred for life-saving medical care. About 240 women and 60 men, including survivors of gender-based violence, attended stress management sessions.   *The community clinic in Kutupalong is overwhelmed with patients, resulting in long lines for waiting and inefficient service provision for survivors of gender-based violence seeking emergency health services. The cost of transport prohibits beneficiaries from travelling to health facilities where emergency sexual and reproductive health services are available, including clinical management of rape.

Hashtag politics: Merkel tries to get in with Germany's kids,"BERLIN (Reuters) - After 12 years in power, Chancellor Angela Merkel is presenting  herself as more than just Germany s  Mutti , campaigning in cyberspace to get in with younger voters and win their support for long after elections this month. Merkel, whose nickname means  Mummy , appears to be cruising toward a fourth term with strong backing from older Germans. But the 63-year-old, who unlike some Western leaders has no personal Twitter account, wants to mobilize the almost 3 million first-time voters behind her conservative CDU party on Sept. 24. To this end, Merkel has fielded questions from four YouTube video bloggers, attended Europe s biggest computer games convention and set up a walk-in campaign center in Berlin s hip start-up district. Diana Kinnert, a 26-year-old who helped draft proposals to modernize the CDU, said parties should use new communication tools to make young people put off by  sterile  politics more politically engaged in the long term.  It would be a shame if it turned out to be just election noise,  Kinnert, who wears both tattoos and a baseball cap, told Reuters at the walk-in center. The CDU, which is unlikely to win an overall parliamentary majority, needs the youth vote to strengthen Merkel s hand in coalition negotiations that will follow polling day. To some bemusement, the party has created a Twitter hashtag #fedidwgugl. Rather than the result of a malfunctioning computer keyboard, it is an acronym for the CDU campaign slogan:  Fuer ein Deutschland In Dem Wir Gut und Gern Leben  ( For a Germany in which we can live well and gladly ). So the Berlin walk-in center, where themed rooms bring the CDU manifesto to life, is called  #fedidwgugl House .  In Britain, young people turned out in droves in June to vote for the opposition Labour party, stripping the ruling Conservatives of their majority and showing how youth can twist the fate of governments even if they are less numerous. With German society rapidly aging, older people still dominate the country s agenda. There are more than twice as many eligible voters aged over 60 as there are under 30. The CDU secured the highest share of the youth vote in 2013 but its support remains skewed toward pensioners. At the last election two-fifths of its backers were aged over 60 while just 5.4 percent were under 25. Kinnert, who has posted on Instagram wearing a T-shirt reading  Keep Calm and Vote for Angie , says Merkel never stops learning and is future-orientated despite her lengthy tenure. One of Merkel s top priorities is the digitization of German industry. She has Facebook and Instagram accounts and has made efforts to show she is up on social media even if it sometimes comes across as clunky. Asked about her favorite emoji during the YouTube interview, Merkel said it was a smiley:  If things are good, even one with a little heart,  she joked. Merkel s main challenger, Social Democrat leader Martin Schulz, has not shied away from cyberspace either. This week he was grilled on YouTube on topics such as legalizing cannabis, animal welfare and rolling out broadband internet. While the CDU was mocked for causing confusion with the #fedidwgugl hashtag, the media attention drew eyeballs to the CDU s agenda. Efforts to campaign over new media also play well with older voters who want the best for their children and grandchildren, said Stefan Marschall of Duesseldorf s Heinrich Heine University. Merkel is the only chancellor most first-time voters can recall. This helps CDU to portray her as an anchor of stability in the turbulent era of Donald Trump and Brexit. An opinion poll by Forsa in June found 57 percent of 18 to 21-year-olds backed Merkel compared with 53 percent of the wider population. Just 21 percent of the young supported Schulz. Forsa s managing director Manfred Guellner said younger Germans have become more conservative than their peers in other countries:  Young people here are pragmatic; they worry about their pensions.

U.S. military says airstrike in Somalia kills three al Shabaab fighters,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - The U.S. military killed three members of Islamist militant group al Shabaab in an airstrike in Somalia conducted with government forces, the U.S. Africa Command said on Wednesday. Tuesday s strike took place in Bay region, some 75 km west of the capital, Mogadishu, and also involved help from peacekeepers from the African Union Mission in Somalia.  The Department of Defense conducted a precision airstrike in central Somalia against al Shabaab militants on ... Sept. 5 at approximately 9:50 a.m. local Somalia time, killing three terrorists,  it said.  Al Shabaab, which is linked to al Qaeda, has lost control of most of Somalia s cities and towns since it was pushed out of Mogadishu in 2011. It retains a strong presence in parts of the south and center and carries out gun and bomb attacks. The group aims to topple the government, drive out African Union peacekeeping troops and impose its own harsh interpretation of Islamic law. In March, U.S. President Donald Trump granted new authority for increased airstrikes in Somalia. ",worldnews,"September 6, 2017 ",1
Lebanon identifies soldiers killed in Islamic State captivity,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon has identified the bodies of 10 of its soldiers found along the Syrian border in a zone taken back from Islamic State last week, state news agency NNA said on Wednesday. An offensive against the enclave ended with the evacuation of Islamic State militants and their families to eastern Syria under a Hezbollah-brokered deal.  Syria s government and Lebanon s Hezbollah allowed a convoy of about 300 lightly armed fighters and 300 relatives to evacuate, surrendering their border enclave. As part of the agreement, IS militants identified where they had buried the soldiers, Lebanon s army chief said. DNA tests confirmed that all 10 bodies found in the mountainous border region were Lebanese soldiers, security sources and local media said on Wednesday. Islamic State had held territory along the border for years, and took Lebanese troops captive in 2014 when they briefly overran the town of Arsal with other militants, one of the worst spillovers of the Syrian conflict into Lebanon. Lebanese Justice Minister Salim Jrayssati said a military court would look into whether any civil or military authorities played a role in their capture. President Michel Aoun called for an investigation last week.  At a conference on Wednesday, the families of the soldiers demanded an inquiry to punish anyone who led to the deaths during the fighting and negotiations since 2014.  For three years, they had protested in the streets and met with many government officials to find out the fate of their relatives.  There is immense and deep sadness in our hearts. But in our minds, there is pride and dignity,  Hussein Youssef, the father of a soldier, said at the government headquarters in Beirut. Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri declared Friday a national day of mourning after meeting with the families.  They were martyred defending this country,  said Nizam Mougheit, whose brother died in Islamic State captivity.  Anyone who had a hand in their martyrdom should be held accountable, whoever it is.

Germany says Putin move on U.N. peacekeepers in Ukraine a 'step',"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany welcomed on Wednesday a suggestion by Russian President Vladimir Putin that armed U.N. peacekeepers could be deployed to eastern Ukraine to help protect ceasefire monitors, but said any prospect of lifting sanctions was still a way off. Putin said on Tuesday that Russia intended to draft a U.N. Security Council resolution to this end, saying it would help resolve the problem in eastern Ukraine, though he also said preconditions would have to be met before any deployment. German government spokeswoman Ulrike Demmer said any deployment would have to be across the whole area of conflict, not just on the contact line between the Ukrainian army and pro-Russian separatists. The war between the two sides has killed more than 10,000 people in three years.  The president s suggestion is a step,  said Demmer, adding many further steps were needed before sanctions could be lifted.  For a complete lifting of sanctions to be discussed, there would need to be the full implementation of the Minsk ceasefire agreement,  she added. Ukraine believes external peacekeepers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) should be deployed throughout separatist-held territory and on the sections of the Ukraine-Russia border that are not under Kiev s control. Kiev accuses Moscow of sending troops and heavy weapons to the region, which Russia denies. Putin also said on Tuesday that any decision by the United States to supply defensive weapons to Ukraine would fuel the conflict. ",worldnews,"September 6, 2017 ",1
Florida prepares for powerful Hurricane Irma,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (Reuters) - Emergency management officials across South Florida hastened disaster preparations on Tuesday in anticipation of Hurricane Irma s expected weekend arrival on the U.S. mainland with possibly greater force than Hurricane Harvey unleashed on Texas. Irma, a Category 5 storm - the highest hurricane ranking used by U.S. forecasters - neared the Caribbean s northern Leeward Islands, east of Puerto Rico, late on Tuesday with maximum sustained winds of 185 miles per hour (300 km/h). The U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) in Miami forecast the storm would make landfall in Florida on Saturday, although Irma s precise trajectory remained to be seen. Forecasters described the storm as  potentially catastrophic.  Irma ranks as one of the five most powerful Atlantic hurricanes during the past 80 years and is the strongest Atlantic storm ever recorded outside the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, the NHC said. Mindful of the devastation wrought by Harvey days ago along the Gulf Coast of Texas and Louisiana, Florida officials were taking no chances.   Normally, people here don t like to prepare,  said Gary Palmer, a 60-year-old deputy sheriff who visited a home supply store in Fort Lauderdale.  But what happened in Texas opened up everybody s eyes.  Authorities in the Florida Keys, the popular resort archipelago stretching from the southern tip of the state s mainland peninsula, called for a mandatory evacuation of the islands  visitors, starting at sunrise on Wednesday. Roman Gastesi, administrator of Monroe County, which includes the Keys, said a mandatory evacuation of residents there was likely at some point. Residents of low-lying areas in densely populated Miami-Dade County to the north were urged to move to higher ground by Wednesday as a precaution against coastal storm surges. Public schools throughout South Florida were to be closed ahead of the storm, starting with Monroe and neighboring Lee County on Wednesday and Miami-Dade and several others districts beginning on Thursday.  My wife is leaving the Keys today,  Monroe County Emergency Management Director Martin Senterfitt said in a statement.  She would rather go to the dentist than sit in traffic. The sooner people leave the better. If ever there was a storm to take serious in the Keys, this is it.  U.S. President Donald Trump, acting at the request of Governor Rick Scott, approved an emergency declaration on Tuesday mobilizing federal disaster relief efforts in Florida ahead of Irma s arrival, the White House said. Scott has also directed all 7,000 of the state s National Guard troops to report for duty Friday morning, saying additional Guard members would be activated as needed beforehand. Fort Lauderdale native Alexandra Nimmons, 25, said she was taking Irma s possible impact on South Florida more seriously after seeing the extreme damage Harvey left behind in Texas.  I spent a while today collecting water,  Nimmons said.  I hoard Mason and salsa jars so that finally paid off.  She also planned to stock up on candles, matches and canned food. Annisa Ali, 45, who just moved to Oakland Park, Florida, from New York City said she was having a hard time finding water at local stores.  Last night, I went to Wal-Mart. No water. I went to Target. No water. Now I m here. No water,  Ali said at a grocery store in Wilton Manors, Florida. James Foote, a 56-year-old handyman in Fort Lauderdale, said he was unable to find any plywood to nail over windows at a local home supply store on Tuesday. He said more wood was expected to be delivered on Wednesday.  I will be back tomorrow before this place opens at 7 o clock,  Foote said.  I ve waited in lines for concert tickets before. This is way more important than that.  ",worldnews,"September 5, 2017 ",1
"Time for EU to decide on Turkey's membership bid, Erdogan says","ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey s president said on Wednesday it was time for the EU to make up its mind whether it wants his country to join the bloc, a day after Germany s Angela Merkel vowed to push her EU partners to consider suspending or ending its accession talks. Merkel had sharpened her rhetoric in the build-up to this month s German national vote and said on Sunday Turkey should not become a member. Ankara has accused her of indulging in populism.  The EU needs to take a step now. Either they will keep their promises and open the road for full membership... or come out and say they do not want to continue with Turkey,  President Tayyip Erdogan told a meeting of his ruling AK Party in Ankara. Erdogan said Turkey had not abandoned its strategic goal of EU membership. But he has long signaled that his country has run out of patience with the EU over its languishing accession bid, launched in 2005, and the impasse has been brought into focus by a sharp deterioration in Turkey s ties with Germany.  I am telling them: Come out and say this bravely and do what is necessary. Bravely,  Erdogan said.  Instead of this courage, there is a two-faced approach to halt the Turkey-EU full membership talks. This is politically unethical.   Germany s frustrations are focused on the detention of 11 German citizens, four of them with dual citizenship, in Turkey on political charges. Turkey accuses Germany of harboring plotters behind the 2016 coup attempt. Erdogan on Wednesday reiterated a call on Germany s voters of Turkish descent not to back  enemies  of Turkey, among whom he has previously named Merkel s Christian Democrats, the SDP and Greens. He also repeated an accusation, which has infuriated Berlin, that German politics were reverting to the country s Nazi past.  They get offended by my Nazi comparisons, but you are doing that. I am not calling you Nazis, I am depicting the situation. This situation is Nazism, fascism and you are doing it,  he said. Ahead of the April referendum on boosting his powers, Erdogan repeatedly lashed out at Germany and other European countries, accusing them of  Nazi-like  tactics for banning his ministers from speaking to rallies of Turkish voters abroad.

British civil servants' union calls nationwide strike ballot,"LONDON (Reuters) - British civil servants will vote next month on nationwide strike action to put pressure on the government to abandon its 1 percent cap on public sector pay rises, their main trade union said on Wednesday. Prime Minister Theresa May s government is considering lifting the cap for at least some public-sector workers later this year, according to media reports earlier this week, as disquiet grows over pay restraint that has lasted since 2010. But on Wednesday May would not commit to lift the cap for nurses - who are widely thought likely to get an increase - after opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn challenged her in parliament over wages in the public and private sector. The Public and Commercial Services union (PCS), the main union for civil servants, said it would ballot nearly 200,000 members between Oct. 9 and Nov. 6 to assess appetite for what would be their first nationwide strike since October 2014. If there are no concessions on pay after the first ballot, the union will hold a second ballot to confirm support for specific strike action.  Pay misery for public servants must end and the government must restore public-sector pay to levels that allow working people to live with the dignity and security they deserve,  Mark Serwotka, the PCS s general secretary, said in a statement. The PCS said it wanted pay rises of at least 5 percent for all public-sector workers. Average weekly earnings in the public sector rose by 1.3 percent over the past year, compared with a 2.2 percent rise in private-sector wages. Consumer price inflation was 2.6 percent over the same period. Some 5.4 million Britons work in the public sector, of whom just over 400,000 work in the civil service. Most public-sector staff work as teachers or in the National Health Service. ",worldnews,"September 6, 2017 ",1

Spain and Morocco arrest six suspected of practicing beheadings,"MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish and Moroccan police have arrested five Moroccans and one Spaniard suspected of belonging to an Islamist militant cell that simulated decapitations, the Spanish interior ministry said on Wednesday. The arrests mark the first big raids since a double Islamist attack in Catalonia in August that killed 16 people, most of whom were mown down by a van in Barcelona. The cell was at an advanced stage of activity, the ministry said. It did not say whether those arrested were men or women. The group held secret night meetings at which they planned large-scale attacks, and carried out physical training sessions in which they simulated cutting off victims  heads, the ministry said. Five of the arrested were Moroccan, one with Spanish residence rights. One was Spanish of Moroccan heritage. One was arrested in the Spanish north African enclave of Melilla, and the rest in Morocco. Spanish police have arrested 199 people in the country accused of connections to militant groups since raising the security alert to one notch below the highest level in 2015.

Papuan separatists to petition U.N. against Indonesian rule,"GENEVA (Reuters) - The people of West Papua are facing a  slow motion genocide  and demand independence from Indonesia, separatist leaders told Reuters after a march in Geneva, adding they would press their case with a petition to the United Nations in New York. Benny Wenda, international spokesman for the United Liberation Movement for West Papua (ULMWP), said the human rights situation had worsened under Indonesian President Joko Widodo, with estimates of up to 8,000 people arrested last year.  They look at West Papua differently, as subhuman, and as a colony. We are not equal. That s why if we live with Indonesia, in 30 years time my people will disappear,  he told Reuters. Indonesian presidential spokesman Johan Budi declined to comment on the separatists  comments. West Papua and Papua provinces - often collectively referred to as West Papua - make up the western half of an island north of Australia, with independent Papua New Guinea to the east. The provinces have been gripped by a long-running and often violent separatist conflict since they were incorporated into Indonesia after a widely criticized U.N.-backed referendum in 1969. Dutch colonial rule ended in 1963. Widodo has made easing the tension in the two provinces on the island a key goal, through stepping up investment, freeing political prisoners, and addressing human rights concerns.         However, Oridek Ap, coordinator for Free West Papua Campaign in the Netherlands, said his father was killed in 1984 for singing freedom songs, and it was still dangerous to speak out.  Sometimes they find a body and we have confirmation of death. But as long as somebody is disappeared we don t have confirmation,  he said.  When we talk about slow motion genocide, how can you prove it. On the other side of the border we are talking about 7-8 million Papuans. Why not on our side? This killing is still going on.  The separatists say there are 2.5 million West Papuans, roughly the same as 50 years ago.  What happened in 1969 was a fraud,  Wenda said.  This is why West Papuans believe that our right to self-determination under international law still exists.   Geneva is the house of human rights and freedom. That s why we start here, and then we go to New York,  he said. Wenda, who has political asylum in Britain, added:  We need to solve this problem in the United Nations.

Yemen's Saleh keeps friend and foe guessing after skirmish with Houthi allies,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Yemen s ex-president Ali Abdullah Saleh appears to have patched up a violent rift with his allies in the armed Houthi movement, but the drama has left friends and foe alike wondering anew at the wily political survivor s next move. Forming a surprise alliance with the Houthis when they seized the capital Sanaa in 2014, Saleh s army loyalists and Houthi fighters have together weathered thousands of air strikes by a Saudi-led military coalition in 2 1/2 years of war. Fearing the Houthis are a proxy for their arch-foe Iran, the mostly Gulf Arab alliance seeks to help the internationally recognized government push up from a base in Yemen s south toward Sanaa. Saleh s guile has been key to resisting the push. For 34 years Saleh ruled over one of the world s most heavily armed and tribal societies with expertly balanced doses of largesse and force. He battled the Houthis for a decade in office before he befriended them when out of power. Cornered by pro-democracy  Arab Spring  protests, Saleh wore a cryptic smile when signing his resignation in a televised ceremony in 2012. Then as now, few could discern his intentions. But his desire to preserve by any means necessary his influence and that of his family - many of whom occupy top military positions - seems beyond doubt. His influence has outlived that of other Arab leaders left dead or deposed by uprisings and civil wars since 2011. As the conflict has wrought a humanitarian crisis, weeks of mutual sniping about responsibility for economic woes in northern Yemeni lands that they together rule peaked with a deadly gun battle between Houthi and Saleh supporters last week. Leaders from Saleh s former ruling party and the Houthis met and pronounced the split healed. Though they pledged to focus on the war effort against Yemen s internationally recognized government that is backed by the Saudi-led coalition, the tensions suggest Saleh is seeking to stake out his own political strategy as exhaustion sets in on all sides.   Saleh wants to capitalize on popular opposition to both the Houthis and the government, positioning himself as an alternative,  said Adam Baron, a Yemen expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR). The war has killed at least 10,000 people, displaced 2 million from their homes, led to widespread hunger and a cholera epidemic which has left 2,000 people dead. Militias and Yemen s powerful Al Qaeda branch have gained ground in the chaos. Any total breakdown within the alliance between Saleh and the Houthis would be bloody and pit scores of local leaders, tribesmen and army units cultivated by Saleh for decades against others loyal to the fighters. Saleh appeared eager to avoid that showdown in an interview which aired on Monday on Yemen Today, a TV channel he owns.  There is no crisis or disagreement at all except in the imaginations of trouble-makers and sowers of discord at home and abroad,  he said. But the ex-leader, at times referring to himself in the third person, said that  imbalances  remained in the alliance, suggesting not all wounds had been salved. Analysts say he remains annoyed at the continued existence of a Houthi  revolutionary committee  which ruled alone before its alliance was formalized with Saleh s General People s Congress party in a  governing council  where they shared power.  Anxiety also flares over appointments of local officials and control over financial policy - both former GPC prerogatives. Beyond local squabbles, the good relations Saleh enjoyed with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates during his presidency raise Houthi fears of a grand double cross. Saleh s son, Ahmed Ali, lives under house arrest in the UAE where he once served as ambassador before it joined its ally Saudi Arabia to make war on the Houthi-Saleh alliance. A powerful former military chief whom his father appeared to be grooming to succeed him, Ahmed Ali and the passing of Saleh power to the next generation may figure into his calculus.  He certainly wants to secure a place for his family in any post-war order ... the Houthis are very paranoid that Saleh may cut a deal with Saudi Arabia and the UAE that will leave them out to dry,  Baron of ECFR added. Saleh has denied seeking to advance his son s political career or any backroom dealing with their enemies. To salvage their alliance, the Houthis will need to convince Saleh that despite their violent history, they make for stronger allies than some GPC members - like Saleh s successor, President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi - who turned on him in the past.  I say to President Saleh, out of sincerity and love, beware of these snakes,  Houthi official Hamid Rizq wrote on his Facebook page on Tuesday.  They are the ones who pushed you to fight wars against the honorable and loyal people in your society then abandoned you and called you are a thief and a criminal.  ",worldnews,"September 6, 2017 ",1
Dennis Rodman talks of skiing friendship with Kim Jong Un,"EDINBURGH (Reuters) - U.S. basketball legend Dennis Rodman said on Wednesday he had skied and sung karaoke with his friend North Korea s leader Kim Jong Un and would like to  straighten things out  amid a nuclear standoff with the United States. Rodman has paid several visits to Kim in the isolated state but the two rarely discuss politics, the retired National Basketball Association star told British TV show  Good Morning Britain.  North Korea has carried out a series of nuclear and missile tests and U.S. President Donald Trump has responded with warnings of a  massive  military response.  For me to go over there and see (Kim) as much as I have, I basically hang out with him all the time. We laugh, we sing karaoke, we do a lot of cool things together. We ride horses, we hang out, we go skiing, we hardly ever talk politics and that s the good thing,  Rodman said, according to a transcript. The basketball ace expressed admiration for Trump but said the U.S. president could be  a little bit crazy sometimes .  Rodman last visited North Korea in June and earlier trips stoked talk that he could facilitate a breakthrough between Pyongyang and Washington, although his comments on Kim have also drawn ridicule. North Korea has long ignored warnings from the West and from its lone major ally, China, to halt its nuclear and missile tests which it conducts in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions. Rodman said he was not trying to defend the actions of Kim and was  just an ambassador for sports.  He said the relationship between the U.S. and Russia had changed  but for some reason we have a big issue with North Korea.    I don t love (Kim). I just want to try to straighten things out for everyone to get along together.  Rodman, nicknamed  The Worm  during his playing career and known for his flamboyant character, is considered one of the best defensive players and rebounders in NBA history.

"EU threatens Hungary, Poland with fines if refuse refugees","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The EU executive said on Wednesday it was ready to institute court proceedings within weeks that could lead to fines for Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic if they refuse to take in asylum-seekers from Italy and Greece. Speaking to reporters after the EU s top court, the European Court of Justice (ECJ), upheld the legality of quotas for states to take migrants relocated from the Mediterranean, Migration Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos said:   If the member states that have not relocated at all or not for a long time do not change their approach in the coming weeks, we should then consider to take the last step in the infringement procedure, taking Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to the European Court of Justice.  The ECJ has the power to levy financial penalties on governments which fail to comply with EU law. ",worldnews,"September 6, 2017 ",1
EU court migrant ruling comes gift-wrapped for Orban re-election bid,"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - A rap on the knuckles from the EU s top court will not end Hungary s opposition to accommodating asylum seekers, and may even help Prime Minister Viktor Orban in his campaign for re-election next year. Rightwinger Orban has been one of the bloc s most vocal opponents of attempts by Brussels to force member states to take in quotas of mainly Syrian refugees, and the fence that Hungary built on its southern border to keep them out has been criticized by other governments and rights groups. But that unapologetic stance has gone down well with voters at home and, with Orban s Fidesz party already firmly ahead in opinion polls, initial responses from Budapest to Wednesday s ruling suggested the legal setback would help keep the issue of migration high on the domestic political agenda. Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said the European Court of Justice s dismissal of appeals by Hungary and Slovakia against the migrant quota system the European Union launched in 2015 was  entirely unacceptable .  The real battle only starts today,  he told a news conference.  I want to assure all citizens ... that the Hungarian government will do everything it can to protect Hungary and the Hungarian people.  Hungary argues that the obligatory relocation of asylum seekers arriving in Greece and Italy from the Middle East would undermine its sovereignty and social fabric, and Orban s government held a referendum in 2016 on whether to accept any future EU-wide migrant relocation quotas. More than 3 million Hungarians, an overwhelming majority of participants, rejected the EU initiative then - and Orban would win a third term in office next April with their support alone.  Orban could use a rejection of Hungary s claim (by the court) to fuel his electoral campaign with anti-EU-arguments,  said Professor Hendrik Hansen, an expert on international and European politics at Budapest s Andrassy University.  The migration issue is a winning point for the Orban government independently of what the European court decides,   added Tibor Attila Nagy, of the Centre for Fair Political Analysis said ahead of the court ruling.  The square in front of Budapest s Eastern Railway station was a focus of the world s media when thousands of migrants camped there in September 2015, hoping to scramble on to trains bound for Austria and Germany. On a bright late summer morning two years later its flagstones are eerily quiet, but locals hurrying to work have not forgotten the days when Hungary was the main transit route for hundreds of thousands of refugees from war and poverty en route to richer western states.  Many remain opposed to the country taking in migrants.  The fence is very good (to have) as it protects us from the explosions and violence and everything,  catering worker Ilona Nagy, 55, told Reuters.  I would vote for Fidesz, only Fidesz.    It was only Hungary which did what it had to do and protected the Schengen borders, and this is still the case,  said pensioner Peter Lazar, 73, another Fidesz supporter. But some preferred to focus on other matters.  I believe the whole migration crisis is government propaganda nothing more,  said Karoly Szenasi, 50.  Monika Fenyvesi, 33, out walking with her child in a stroller, said the scenes at the station had been  scary  and it was good that Hungary had imposed controls. But issues such as support for families, healthcare, taxation, and wages would determine which party got her vote.  It will be hard to decide but it will not be the current government.

Suspected al Shabaab militants behead four in Kenya's Lamu County: official,"MOMBASA, Kenya (Reuters) - Suspected militants from the Somali group al Shabaab beheaded four men in two different attacks in Lamu County on Kenya s north coast on Wednesday, authorities said, a month after 12 people were killed in similar incidents in the region.  Lamu County Commissioner Gilbert Kitiyo said the attacks took place in Silini-Mashambani early on Wednesday where three were killed, while in a separate incident in Bobo village one person was killed.  Kitiyo said about 30 heavily-armed assailants went from house-to-house calling out victims by name before pulling some out and slitting their throats.  They were dressed in military gear and had AK-47 rifles. They beheaded four men before fleeing into the forest. All the victims are men. Police have already arrived at the scene and taken the bodies to the mortuary,  Kitiyo told Reuters by telephone. He said the attackers surrounded all the victims  houses  making it difficult for them to escape. Abdiasis Abu Musab, al Shabaab s spokesman for military operations, said the group was behind the attack, and put the number of those killed at five, saying it had targeted non-Muslims. In August, al Shabaab attackers killed four men in a similar manner while earlier in July, nine men were slaughtered the same way in nearby villages. After the latest attacks, protesters burned tyres on the roads on Wednesday morning in complaint over insecurity. Riot police to fire teargas and rubber bullets to disperse them.  A government-imposed dusk-to-dawn curfew is in force in the area following past attacks. The al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab aims to topple Somalia s United Nations-backed government and impose its own strict interpretation of Islam. They have intensified attacks in Kenya since it sent troops into Somalia in 2011. They have also claimed responsibility for a series of cross-border attacks in recent months, including a spate of roadside bombings targeting security forces. ",worldnews,"September 6, 2017 ",1
"Erdogan says Turkey will send 10,000 tonnes aid to Myanmar's Rohingya","ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey will provide 10,000 tonnes of aid to help Rohingya Muslims who have fled violence in Myanmar, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday.

Moldovan president vetoes participation in NATO country exercises,"CHISINAU (Reuters) - Moldova s pro-Russian President Igor Dodon has blocked government plans to send troops to Ukraine to participate in military exercises starting this week and which coincide with Russian drills across the border in Belarus.  Dodon s move on Wednesday underscores divisions within the ex-Soviet nation, where the president is frequently at odds on foreign policy with the government, which favors closer ties with the European Union and the United States.  The government had planned to send 57 servicemen to take part in exercises by mostly NATO countries, including the United States and Turkey, in western Ukraine from Sept. 8-23. Russia will meanwhile hold drills from Sept. 14-20 in western Russia, Belarus and Russia s exclave of Kaliningrad. Moscow has dismissed fears in neighboring nations that the drills may be used as a precursor for an invasion. Dodon exercised his presidential veto to block the decision, arguing Moldova was bound by its constitution to stay neutral.   The participation of Moldovan servicemen in military exercises outside the country is not acceptable,  Dodon wrote on his Facebook page. A Ukrainian defense ministry spokesman said Kiev had not been formally notified that Moldova was withdrawing its personnel.  Earlier this year Dodon banned the participation of military personnel in NATO exercises in Romania, prompting complaints by the U.S. and Romanian ambassadors in Chisinau. Speaking at a televised cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Pavel Filip said he was baffled by Dodon s decision:  No one wants an unprepared and weak army.  Moldova has been governed by pro-Western leaders since 2009 and signed a trade pact with the EU in 2014. Russia retaliated by halting imports of Moldovan farm produce, depriving the country of a key market for its wine, fruit and vegetables. Relations suffered further this year due to a dispute in March over the treatment of Moldovan officials traveling to or through Russia, and the expulsion of Russian diplomats in May. In August, Moldova declared Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin persona non grata, accusing him of making defamatory remarks about Moldovan government officials.

Exclusive: Bangladesh protests over Myanmar's suspected landmine use near border,"DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh lodged a protest after it said Myanmar had laid landmines near the border between the two countries, government officials said on Wednesday, amid growing tensions over the huge influx of Rohingya Muslims fleeing violence in Myanmar. An army crackdown triggered by an attack on Aug. 25 by Rohingya insurgents on Myanmar security forces has led to the killing of at least 400 people and the exodus of nearly 125,000 Rohingya to Bangladesh, leading to a major humanitarian crisis. When asked whether Bangladesh had lodged the complaint, Foreign Secretary Shahidul Haque said  yes  without elaborating. Three other government sources confirmed that a protest note was faxed to Myanmar in the morning saying the Buddhist-majority country was violating international norms.  Bangladesh has expressed great concern to Myanmar about the explosions very close to the border,  a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. The source asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter. A Myanmar military source said landmines were laid along the border in the 1990s to prevent trespassing and the military had since tried to remove them. But none had been planted recently. Two Bangladeshi sources told Reuters they believed Myanmar security forces were putting the landmines in their territory along the barbed-wire fence between a series of border pillars. Both sources said Bangladesh learned about the landmines mainly through photographic evidence and informers.  Our forces have also seen three to four groups working near the barbed wire fence, putting something into the ground,  one of the sources said.  We then confirmed with our informers that they were laying land mines.  The sources did not clarify if the groups were in uniform, but added that they were sure they were not Rohingya insurgents. Manzurul Hassan Khan, a Bangladesh border guard officer, told Reuters earlier that two blasts were heard on Tuesday on the Myanmar side, after two on Monday fueled speculation that Myanmar forces had laid land mines. One boy had his left leg blown off on Tuesday near a border crossing before being brought to Bangladesh for treatment, while another boy suffered minor injuries, Khan said, adding that the blast could have been a mine explosion. A Rohingya refugee who went to the site of the blast on Monday - on a footpath near where civilians fleeing violence are huddled in a no man s land on the border - filmed what appeared to be a mine: a metal disc about 10 centimeters (4 inches) in diameter partially buried in the mud. He said he believed there were two more such devices buried in the ground. Two refugees also told Reuters they saw members of the Myanmar army around the site in the immediate period preceding the Monday blasts, which occurred around 2:25 p.m. Reuters was unable to independently verify that the planted devices were land mines and that there was any link to the Myanmar army. The Myanmar army has not commented on the blasts near the border. Zaw Htay, the spokesman for Myanmar s national leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, was not immediately available for comment.  On Monday, he told Reuters clarification was needed to determine  where did it explode, who can go there and who laid those land mines. Who can surely say those mines were not laid by the terrorists?  The Bangladesh interior ministry secretary, Mostafa Kamal Uddin, did not respond to calls seeking comment. The border pillars mentioned by the Dhaka-based sources mark the boundaries of the two countries, along which Myanmar has a portion of barbed wire fencing. Most of the two countries  217-km-long border is porous.  They are not doing anything on Bangladeshi soil,  said one of the sources.  But we have not seen such laying of land mines in the border before.  Myanmar, which was under military rule until recently and is one of the most heavily mined countries in the world, is one of the few countries that have not signed the 1997 U.N. Mine Ban Treaty.

Zimbabwe opposition rejects post-Mugabe coalition deal-making,"HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe s opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) said on Wednesday it had no plans to join factions of the ruling ZANU-PF party to form a national unity coalition after the  eventual death of 93-year-old President Robert Mugabe. A Reuters investigation this week revealed that Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa, favorite to succeed Mugabe, has been looking to build a broad coalition that would kickstart the economy by reintegrating thousands of white farmers booted off their land in the early 2000s. The report was based on leaks from inside Zimbabwe s Central Intelligence Organisation and interviews with top political players, including MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai. The 63-year-old, who has been Mugabe s main political rival for the last two decades, told Reuters at the time he had not met Mnangagwa for several years but that he had received overtures about a meeting that were turned down. In a statement, the MDC said it would never consider joining an administration that was not the product of an election. Zimbabwe s next vote is next year and Mugabe is running as ZANU-PF s presidential candidate.  While stability is important, President Tsvangirai and the MDC have always placed a far higher premium on legitimacy and democracy,  the statement said. The Reuters story also revealed that senior members of Zimbabwe s military were starting to swallow their disdain for Tsvangirai, who has never enjoyed their respect because of his background as a union leader rather than a liberation fighter. The intelligence reports suggested top generals had given Mnangagwa their backing. Tsvangirai did not deny any contact with military leaders or British ambassador Catriona Laing, who the intelligence reports said favored a Mnangagwa-led succession, but said post-Mugabe deal-making was not on the agenda.  President Tsvangirai has not had any meeting with either the British or the military involving this purported deal,  the MDC statement said.  Any purported deal outside elections and involving diplomats, the military and other such characters will not be legitimate and will not rescue Zimbabweans from their current predicament.  Mugabe has been Zimbabwe s only leader since independence from Britain in 1980. Its once promising economy collapsed in the early 2000s after the violent seizure of thousands of white-owned commercial farms by pro-Mugabe gangs. ",worldnews,"September 6, 2017 ",1
Thousands of Indonesians join anti-Myanmar rally in Jakarta,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Thousands of Indonesians, led by Islamist groups, held a rally near the Myanmar embassy in Jakarta on Wednesday to protest against the treatment of Rohingya Muslims and demand the snapping of ties between the two countries.    Indonesia has the world s largest population of Muslims and there have been several anti-Myanmar protests in Jakarta and the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur over the treatment of Buddhist-majority Myanmar s roughly 1.1 million Rohingyas.  Roads were blocked and barbed wire barriers put up around the embassy, in a leafy district of the capital, which was patrolled by police in riot gear who set up water cannons. Some protesters chanted  Allahu Akbar  (God is Greatest), while others shouted slogans such as  Slaughter Myanmar  and  Burn the embassy . Buddhists should respect Muslims in Myanmar in the same way that Muslims respected Buddhists in Indonesia, one speaker told the crowd, using a loud-hailer.    Almost 125,000 Rohingyas have been forced to flee clashes between Rohingya insurgents and the army in Myanmar s northwestern state of Rakhine. Tens of thousands have crossed the border into neighboring Bangladesh. Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi met Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi and top security officials this week to urge a halt to the bloodshed. Marsudi also visited Dhaka, capital of Bangladesh on Tuesday, to offer help in tackling the crisis. Some protesters at the Jakarta rally called for the expulsion of the Myanmar ambassador over the issue, as well as for diplomatic ties between the two countries to be severed. Myanmar embassy staff would be safe, however, said a foreign ministry spokesman, Armanatha Nasir.   It is the responsibility of the host countries to ensure the safety of all diplomatic missions and their personnel,  the spokesman said.  Indonesia takes this responsibility seriously.   At the weekend, a petrol bomb was thrown at the embassy causing a small fire. Indonesian police have also pledged to bar Islamist groups from staging a rally on Friday at the Borobudur Buddhist temple in central Java to protest against the treatment of Myanmar s Rohingya Muslims.

"Allowing nuclear weapons in Japan could defuse North Korean threat, say some policy makers","TOKYO (Reuters) - As Japan looks for a quick, resolute response to North Korea s growing missile threat, some defense policy makers in Tokyo say it may be time to reconsider non-nuclear pledges and invite U.S. nuclear weapons on to its soil. Japan, the only country to suffer nuclear attack, upholds three non-nuclear principles that commit it not to possess, manufacture or allow nuclear weapons on to its territory that were adopted five decades ago.  Perhaps it s time for our three principles to become two,  a senior defense policy maker told Reuters, suggesting nuclear weapons be allowed into Japan. He asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue. North Korea, pursuing its weapons programs in defiance of international condemnation, fired an intermediate ballistic missile over Japan last week, prompting authorities to sound sirens and advise residents to take cover. On Sunday, North Korea tested a nuclear device that had a  yield estimated at ten times that of the atom bomb dropped by the United States on Hiroshima in 1945. Inviting U.S. nuclear weapons would be an attempt by Japan jolt China, North Korea s sole major ally, to do more to rein in its neighbor by showing there are consequences to North Korean provocations that threaten its neighbors and destabilize the region, the policy maker said.  A simple way to do this could be for a nuclear-armed U.S. submarine to operate from one of the U.S. Navy bases in Japan, he said, a move bound to infuriate China. Former Japanese defense minister Shigeru Ishiba stoked controversy on Wednesday by questioning whether Japan can expect protection under the U.S. nuclear umbrella while maintaining its non-nuclear principles.  Is it right that we don t discuss this?  Ishiba asked in a television interview. In his election campaign last year, Donald Trump chided Japan and South Korea for not contributing enough to their defenses. On Tuesday, the president said he was ready to sell Seoul billions of dollars in weapons and scrap a limit on the size of warheads the Washington would supply.  We don t have any plan to begin discussing the three non-nuclear principles,  Japan Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters when asked to respond to Ishiba s comment.     Yet, the growing North Korean threat could stifle some of the opposition, experts say.  Just by raising this issue of nuclear principles, Japan will push the United States and China to act, and it is something that Beijing is not going to like,  said Takashi Kawakami, a security expert at Japan s Takushoku University.  It s the medicine that China needs to make it act against North Korea.  Allowing the U.S. military to deploy nuclear weapons on Japanese territory would pose a grave political risk for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, particularly amid an influence-peddling scandal that has hit his popularity ratings. Any move toward relaxing the non-nuclear principles, however, is unlikely to lead to a home-made atomic bomb, despite Japan s technical abilities, say experts.  Tokyo has the civilian nuclear program, fissile materials and the weaponization technology necessary. It could probably develop a small arsenal of nuclear devices within a year if there was motivation to do so,  said Emily Chorley, a nuclear weapons expert at IHS Janes. But doing so would force Japan to renege on its non-proliferation commitments and could severely damage Washington s alliances and position of strength in Asia.  This would signal that the Japanese no longer have confidence in U.S. extended deterrence,  said a former senior U.S. military commander who asked not to be identified because he is not authorized to talk to the media.  That would essentially mean that they no longer have confidence in the alliance.    ",worldnews,"September 6, 2017 ",1
"Armyworm hits northern Cameroon, worsening food crisis","YAOUNDE (Reuters) - Crop-eating fall armyworms have attacked nearly 37,000 hectares of maize in northern Cameroon, officials said on Wednesday, accentuating an already dire humanitarian crisis provoked by the Islamist militant group Boko Haram s cross-border insurgency. More than two dozen African nations have reported outbreaks of the invasive Central American variety of the pest, which is harder to detect and eradicate than its African counterpart. They have now spread to all of Cameroon s 10 administrative regions, though maize crops in the Extreme North region have only been heavily affected since July, Deputy Agriculture Minister Clementine Ananga Messina told Reuters.  The armyworm attack endangers the entire maize sector and is creating serious risks of food insecurity, because it s the most commonly grown cereal in Cameroon,  she said.  The Extreme North region bordering Chad and Nigeria has been hit hard by Boko Haram, whose campaign of violence and cross-border attacks has sent more than 93,000 Nigerians fleeing into Cameroon where some 235,000 people have also been displaced. Across the Lake Chad region around 1.5 million people are confronting a food crisis, according to the United Nations. Cameroonian authorities have launched an action plan to fight against the infestation, but so far pesticides have failed to contain it.   There are no effective means to fight armyworm currently existing in Cameroon,  said Agriculture Ministry expert Andre Marie Elombat Assoua.  The chemical products now being used by farmers are ineffective and too expensive.   Around 12 million Cameroonians, more than half of the national population, regularly consume maize. It is also an important ingredient for the central African nation s breweries and in the production of feed for livestock. Though the fall armyworm prefers maize, it also attacked sorghum and millet, two of Cameroon s other staple crops, earlier this year. ",worldnews,"September 6, 2017 ",1
Cambodia charges opposition leader with treason,"PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodian opposition leader Kem Sokha has been charged with treason and could face a jail term of 15 to 30 years if convicted, a court said on Tuesday. Kem Sokha was arrested on Sunday in an escalating crackdown on critics of Prime Minister Hun Sen s government, which accused the opposition leader of plotting with the United States to undermine the Southeast Asian country. Trials of senior political figures in recent years have resulted in convictions and international rights groups questioned whether proceedings against Kem Sokha would be fair. He had been charged with  colluding with foreigners  under Article 443 of Cambodia s penal code, the Phnom Penh Municipal Court said in a statement.  The act of secret collusion with foreigners is an act of treason,  it added. The evidence the government has presented is a video of Kem Sokha from 2013 in which he tells supporters of his Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) that he has had American support and advice for his political strategy to win power. One of the opposition leader s lawyers, Pheng Heng, said what appeared in the video clip was no crime.  The legal procedure is wrong and the charge isn t correct,  he said.  What he talked about was elections in a multi-party democratic way.  The arrest of Kem Sokha and growing pressure on independent media and rights groups have drawn condemnation from the United States and other Western countries, which have raised doubts over whether a general election next year can be fair. But Hun Sen, one of Asia s longest serving rulers, has won support from China, which has made him one of its closest regional allies and provided billions of dollars in infrastructure loans. Next year s election could represent the greatest challenge to Hun Sen and his ruling Cambodian People s Party (CPP) in the more than three decades he has ruled, but his critics accuse him of trying to shut down all opposition in advance. Pro-government website Fresh News said there could be further arrests of officials from the opposition party in the case.  The government and the ruling CPP have manufactured these treason charges against Kem Sokha for political purposes, aiming to try and knock the political opposition out of the ring before the 2018 electoral contest even begins,  said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director of New York-based Human Rights Watch. Kingsley Abott, senior international legal adviser for Southeast Asia at the Geneva-based International Committee of Jurists, said the allegations against Kem Sokha had the hallmarks of being politically motivated.  The absence of an independent and impartial prosecution and judiciary makes the delivery of a fair trial impossible in most political cases,  he said. Kem Sokha, was sentenced to five months in jail last September after failing to appear in court in connection with a case against two of his party colleagues, but he was later pardoned at Hun Sen s request. He had avoided prison on that occasion by taking refuge at his party headquarters. Kem Sokha s predecessor as party leader, Sam Rainsy, was found guilty of defamation in absentia. He lives in France to avoid the conviction, which he says was politically motivated. ",worldnews,"September 5, 2017 ",1
Hurricane Irma moves away from Barbuda: NHC,"(Reuters) - The eye of the potentially catastrophic Category 5 hurricane Irma has moved away from Barbuda and is heading towards St. Martin, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said in an advisory.

"Myanmar's Rohingya suffered for years, need lasting solution: Turkey","BAKU (Reuters) - Turkey s foreign minister called on Wednesday for a lasting solution to the plight of Myanmar s Rohingya Muslims who he said had been living for years in  open prisons , ahead of his visit to neighboring Bangladesh to discuss the crisis. President Tayyip Erdogan, who leads Turkey s Islamist-rooted AK Party, has been fiercely critical of Myanmar s treatment of the Rohingyas, saying they have been subjected to genocide. The latest violence began on Aug. 25, when Rohingya insurgents attacked dozens of police posts and an army base. The ensuing clashes and a military counter-offensive have killed at least 400 people.    After Erdogan spoke to Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Tuesday, Turkey said it would deliver 1,000 tonnes of food, medicine and clothing to the afflicted northwestern region of Rakhine. Around 150,000 Rohingyas have fled to Bangladesh, where Turkey s Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu is due to arrive later for talks on Thursday about tackling the crisis. Cavusoglu said he would visit the border region to assess the humanitarian needs there, adding that Turkey would also provide ambulances and other equipment.  We will not leave these people alone here. However, we need to find a lasting solution to the problem in Rakhine,  he said.  There have been events and cruelties before as well, many people died or had to leave their homes.   I went to Rakhine two years ago as well, and they literally live in open prisons covered in mud. It is unacceptable for people to live under these conditions in this day and age.  Suu Kyi has faced increasing pressure from countries with Muslim populations to halt the violence against Rohingya Muslims which has prompted their flight to Bangladesh. Erdogan, whose wife and a son will accompany Cavusoglu to  Bangladesh, said this week he had spoken to 20 world leaders about the issue, and would press for it to be discussed at the United Nations later this month. Turkey has said its state aid agency TIKA would start the first foreign aid deliveries to Rakhine on Wednesday. ",worldnews,"September 6, 2017 ",1
Turkish police kill Islamic State militant set to attack police station,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish police shot dead an Islamic State militant who was set to carry out a suicide bomb attack on a police station in the Mediterranean city of Mersin on Wednesday, the interior ministry said. The assailant, wearing a vest packed with explosives, was killed outside the police station in the Yenisehir district, which security sources said is located next to the regional headquarters of Turkey s MIT national intelligence agency.   One member of the Daesh terrorist organization, wearing a suicide bomb vest, was captured dead in front of the Mersin Yenisehir district s ... central police station,  the interior ministry said in a statement. Police officers spotted the suspect behaving suspiciously some 50 meters (55 yards) from the police station at around 8:15 a.m. (0515 GMT), the Mersin governor s office said. The man ignored an order to stop and continued to move toward the police station. He was shot when his hand reached for a cable hanging down from his shoulder, the governor s office said. Islamic State militants have previously carried out gun and bomb attacks in Turkey. Many foreign fighters have also passed through Turkey in recent years on their way to join the jihadist group in its self-proclaimed caliphate in Syria and Iraq. Ankara has detained more than 5,000 Islamic State suspects and deported some 3,290 foreign militants from 95 different countries in recent years, according to Turkish officials. The Dogan news agency identified the would-be attacker as a 20-year-old Syrian national who lived in an apartment block near the police station. It said bomb disposal experts defused the explosive device. Police subsequently searched the home of the Syrian man and detained his father, Dogan said, adding that his family had moved to Mersin a year ago. ",worldnews,"September 6, 2017 ",1
Britain rejects Irish call for role in Northern Ireland rule,"BELFAST (Reuters) - Britain on Tuesday rejected an Irish demand for a role in running Northern Ireland if parties there fail to revive a devolved power-sharing government, as unionists said concessions would lead to  grave consequences  for Theresa May s government.  The 1998 peace deal that ended 30 years of violence in Northern Ireland between Irish nationalists and pro-British unionists provides for a consultative role for the Irish government in the running of the British region.  Since January Irish nationalists Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) have failed to reach agreement on re-establishing the devolved administration. The British government has warned it may soon have to step in to rule the province directly for the first time in a decade.  Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney on Tuesday told journalists in Belfast that if talks to form a power-sharing government failed  there can be no British-only direct rule,  adding that this was Irish government policy.  He did not say what kind of role he expected for the Irish government and said he was still hopeful devolved power-sharing could be rescued.  In an apparent rebuff to Coveney, a British government spokesman said in a statement that London would  never countenance any arrangement, such as Joint Authority, inconsistent with the principle of consent in the (Good Friday) Agreement.   In the absence of devolved government, it is ultimately for the United Kingdom Government to provide the certainty over delivery of public services and good governance in Northern Ireland, as part of the United Kingdom,  the statement said.  DUP lawmaker Jeffrey Donaldson, whose party Prime Minister Theresa May s minority government depends on to survive, warned that his party would not accept any concessions to Dublin.    Even if we have a temporary period of direct rule, the Irish Government must be clear that it must not interfere with the internal affairs of Northern Ireland and to do so would be a fundamental breach of faith,  Donaldson told the Belfast Telegraph newspaper in comments published on Wednesday.   If that were to happen it would have grave consequences for the stability of the government at Westminster and for the prospect of restoring devolution in Northern Ireland,  he was quoted as saying.

Germany climbs in development ranking by taking in refugees,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Germany has jumped 10 slots from last year to fifth place on a list ranking how well rich countries  policies help improve lives in the developing world, mainly thanks to its willingness to take in refugees - a hot topic in its Sept. 24 election. Denmark took over the top spot from Finland, which falls to third place, while Sweden moves up one notch to second on the list that includes the impact from foreign aid and policies on trade, finance, migration, the environment and technology.  Germany moves up to fifth on the 2017 Index, mainly thanks to policies on migration, including accepting a large number of refugees,  author Ian Mitchell from the Washington-based Center for Global Development said in the report. Labor mobility is potentially the most powerful tool for poverty reduction and income redistribution, he said.  By migrating to richer countries, workers gain valuable skills and broaden their opportunities to earn higher incomes. They also send billions of dollars back home each year in remittances, a flow that surpasses foreign aid several fold.  Chancellor Angela Merkel s 2015 decision to open Germany s borders to hundreds of thousands of refugees, many fleeing war in the Middle East, cost her support but she has since bounced back.  Her challenger in this month s election, Social Democrat Martin Schulz, attacked her on Sunday for failing to coordinate a better European response to the refugee crisis. The report said Germany s surge in the rankings was thanks not only to taking in the large influx, but also to its aid and trade policies. Despite Germany s improvement, France still ranks highest among the G7 countries at fourth place. The United States fell to 23rd from 20th among the 27 countries ranked. Its best performance was on trade and security, while it scored poorly on finance, environment, and aid, the report said.  The U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord will be reflected in future years, potentially taking the U.S. score lower,  the think tank said. Britain, which is in the process of negotiating its departure from the European Union, jumped to seventh place from ninth last year. The report said there was a risk that Brexit could hit Britain s score on trade unless it could quickly replicate favorable EU trade policies toward developing countries. However,  on agriculture, it could certainly reduce subsidies compared with the EU and level the playing field for developing world producers.  The 2017 rankings show almost all countries improved their performance in the environmental component, with reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and new climate commitments in the 2016 Paris agreement.

Philippine lawmakers reject last left-wing cabinet minister,"MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine lawmakers on Wednesday rejected the nomination of the last leftist President Rodrigo Duterte included in his cabinet, removing the agrarian reform minister a year after he joined the government in a bid by Duterte to promote peace. Duterte, after becoming president in June last year, offered places in his cabinet to members of the outlawed Communist Party of the Philippines to demonstrate his commitment to talks to end their long-running insurgency. The minister, Rafael Mariano, was one of two people the party nominated to serve in the cabinet. Senator Vicente Sotto, chairman of a committee scrutinizing cabinet appointments, said it had conducted an  exhaustive deliberation  then held a vote.  The weight of the scales ultimately tipped the balance against the confirmation of the appointee,  Sotto told Senate. He did not elaborate on the reason for the rejection but it came a few months after the government canceled formal peace talks with the communist rebels.  Duterte wants to strike a peace deal with the communists but has been angered by continued violence. He says their demands are excessive and he has already made concessions.     Mariano, speaking to reporters after the hearing, denounced  big landlords, oligarchs, businessmen and big corporations , saying they may have prevailed with his rejection but the farmers would win in the end.  I may have failed to get the confirmation today but I will not stop serving our farmers,  he said. Presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella expressed regret over Mariano s removal, saying he had promoted farmers  rights and welfare and ensured their security of land tenure.

Modi says India shares Myanmar's concern about 'extremist violence',"NAYPYITAW (Reuters) - Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Wednesday that India shared Myanmar s concern about  extremist violence  in its Rakhine state, where a security force operation against Muslim rebels has sent about 125,000 people fleeing to Bangladesh. Modi spoke after talks with Myanmar s de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi during a visit aimed at expanding commercial ties as part of an  Act East  policy, and pushing back against Chinese influence.  Myanmar has come under international pressure after some 125,000 Rohingya Muslims fled from a surge of violence in Rakhine state, beginning with an Aug. 25 attack by Rohingya insurgents on dozens of police posts and an army base. The rebel attacks triggered a sweep by the Myanmar security forces, in which refugees and right groups say many innocent Rohingya have been targeted. Buddhist-majority Myanmar rejects accusations by refugees and rights groups that its armed forces have violated the rights of the mostly stateless Rohingya, saying the army and police are fighting  terrorists . Mostly Hindu India has faced years of attacks by Islamist militants.  Suu Kyi told a joint news conference at the presidential palace in the capital, Naypyitaw, that Myanmar was grateful for India s stance on the attack on her country and they could work together to face the challenge.  We would like to thank India particularly for its strong that it has taken with regard to terrorist threat that came to our country a couple of weeks ago,  she said in brief remarks.  We believe that together we can work to make sure that terrorism is not allowed to take root on our soil.  Modi said India and Myanmar had similar security interests in the region.    We share your concerns about extremist violence in Rakhine state and specially the violence against security forces and how innocent lives have been affected,  he said.    We hope that all the stakeholders together can find a way out in which the unity and territorial integrity of Myanmar is respected and at the same time we can have peace, justice dignity and democratic values for all.  Modi s government has taken a strong stance on an influx into India of some 40,000 Rohingya from Myanmar over the years, vowing last month to deport them all. That decision has drawn criticism from rights groups and prompted a petition in the Supreme Court to stop the government from doing so.         International concern, in particular from Muslim countries, is growing about the latest exodus of Rohingya. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has pressed world leaders to do more to help the population of roughly 1.1 million, saying they are facing genocide. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned on Tuesday of the risk of ethnic cleansing and regional destabilization. India is trying to boost economic ties with resource-rich Myanmar, with which it shares a 1,600-km (1,000-mile) border, to counter Chinese influence and step up links with a country it considers its gateway to Southeast Asia. Two-way trade has grown to about $2.2 billion as India courts Myanmar following the gradual end of military rule, but Indian-funded projects have moved slowly. India recently started exporting diesel to Myanmar via a land route, in a boost to Modi s pledge to enhance hydrocarbon trade with neighbors.. ",worldnews,"September 6, 2017 ",1
China brushes off Vietnam protests over South China Sea drills,"HANOI (Reuters) - China on Wednesday dismissed Vietnamese condemnation of its military live-fire exercises in the disputed South China Sea, saying it was acting within its sovereign rights. China conducted the drills around the Paracel Islands, which Vietnam claims, prompting Vietnam to say it would  resolutely protect  its  legitimate rights  through peaceful means. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a regular briefing that China had done nothing wrong.  We hope the relevant side can regard the drills calmly and reasonably,  he said, without elaborating. China claims nearly all the South China Sea, through which an estimated $3 trillion in international trade passes each year. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan also have claims. Tension between China and neighboring Vietnam is at its highest in three years over the disputed waters. Vietnam suspended oil drilling in offshore waters that are also claimed by China in July under pressure from Beijing. China has appeared uneasy at Vietnam s efforts to rally Southeast Asian countries over the South China Sea as well as at its growing defense relationships with the United States, Japan and India.

"EU court dismisses Hungary, Slovak case against taking refugees","LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - The European Union s top court dismissed complaints on Wednesday by Slovakia and Hungary about EU migration policy, upholding Brussels  right to force member states to take in asylum seekers. In the latest twist to a divisive dispute that broke out two years ago when over a million migrants poured across the Mediterranean, the European Court of Justice found that the EU was entitled to order national governments to take in quotas of mainly Syrian refugees relocated from Italy and Greece.  The court dismisses the actions brought by Slovakia and Hungary against the provisional mechanism for the mandatory relocation of asylum seekers,  the Luxembourg-based court said in a statement.  The mechanism actually contributes to enabling Greece and Italy to deal with the impact of the 2015 migration crisis and is proportionate.  The programme set up by the executive European Commission was approved by majority vote of member states in the face of opposition from formerly communist countries in the east who said their societies could not absorb mainly Muslim immigrants. It provided for the relocation of up to 160,000 people, but only some 25,000 have so far been moved.  ",worldnews,"September 6, 2017 ",1

"Protesters storm Philippines mining event, demand halt to extraction","MANILA (Reuters) - Around 300 protesters clashed with security on Wednesday at a Manila hotel where an annual mining conference was being held, demanding that mineral extraction be halted due to the environmental destruction caused.  The rally comes a day after President Rodrigo Duterte declared he s supporting a ban on open-pit mining in the Southeast Asian nation, a move that could constrict supply from the world s top nickel ore exporter.  Words are not enough, he must act on it,  lawyer Aaron Pedrosa of Sanlakas (One Force), an activist political group that was among the protesters, told reporters.   We are here to express our opposition to mining in our country and the failure of mining companies to rehabilitate mining areas,  Pedrosa said.  Anti-mining protests are a fixture at mining industry events in the Philippines. Some of the protesters, clad in business suits, managed to get past hotel security and into the lobby where they held up placards denouncing mining. Outside the hotel, other protesters, including those from tribal communities, chanted and held streamers saying  Stop Mining Plunder  and  No to Large-Scale Mining . The hotel was locked down for at least an hour.  Mining is a contentious issue in largely underexplored Philippines following past examples of environmental mismanagement. In 1996, for instance, a tailings leak at Canadian-owned Marcopper Mining Corp s copper mine in Marinduque contaminated rivers. The sector contributes less than 1 percent to the economy, with only 3 percent of the 9 million hectares identified by the state as having high mineral reserves being mined, according to government data.  Last month, lawmakers allied with Duterte filed a bill seeking to ban mining in watershed areas and exports of unprocessed ores. The bill would also require miners to get legislative approval before operating. The move comes after a 10-month mining crackdown led by former Environment Secretary Regina Lopez, who ordered the closure or suspension of 26 of the country s 41 mines and banned open-pit mining.  Lopez failed to be confirmed in her post by lawmakers and was replaced in May by Roy Cimatu, a former soldier who has so far not reversed any of her previous measures.  Gerard Brimo, president of top Philippine nickel ore producer Nickel Asia Corp, said the industry would like to show Duterte old mines that have been rehabilitated, including open pits. Open-pit extraction is allowed under a Philippine mining law and is widely used in the country where most ore is near the surface and low grade.  If you want minerals and metals ... that s the reality. That s the case in the Philippines as it is all over the world. But the other reality is that it can be rehabilitated.

Exclusive: Cambodia says opposition party could be barred from election,"PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodia s government has raised the possibility that the main opposition party could be ruled out of elections if it does not replace its leader, Kem Sokha, who has been charged with treason. The opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) has said it will not replace its leader and the comments reinforced its fears that Prime Minister Hun Sen plans to cripple it before next year s elections. The arrest of Kem Sokha on Sunday drew Western condemnation and marked an escalation in a crackdown on critics of Hun Sen, who has ruled for 30 years and could face possibly his toughest electoral challenge from the CNRP next year.  They have to appoint an acting president,  government spokesman Phay Siphan told Reuters on Tuesday.  If they don t comply with the law, they will not exist and have no right to political activity... It s their choice, not my choice.  Kem Sokha s daughter, Kem Monovithya, who is also a party official, said the party would not appoint a new leader. Kem Sokha was only named in February after his predecessor resigned in fear the party would be banned if he stayed on.  The ruling party can drop their divide-and-conquer plan now,  she said. Opposition officials accuse Hun Sen of trying to weaken or destroy the party ahead of the election, after it did well in June local elections, in which it nonetheless came well behind Hun Sen s Cambodia People s Party. Hun Sen, one of Asia s longest serving rulers, said on Wednesday there could be more arrests after  the act of treason  and it had reinforced the need for him to stay in office.  I ve decided to continue my work - not less than 10 years more,  he told garment factory workers, jabbing his finger in the air for emphasis. Kem Sokha became leader after opposition veteran Sam Rainsy resigned because of a new law that forbids any party having a leader who is found guilty of a crime. Sam Rainsy fled into exile to avoid a defamation conviction he says was political. Cambodian law says a political party has 90 days to replace a president if he or she dies, resigns or is convicted of an offence. Western countries have condemned the arrest of Kem Sokha and a crackdown on critics of Hun Sen, including independent media.  We don t care about people outside,  Phay Siphan said.  We care about our national security. We don t belong to anyone.  China, Hun Sen s close ally, has voiced support for Cambodia on steps to ensure its security. Kem Sokha was formally charged with treason on Tuesday. His lawyers have dismissed the evidence presented against him so far - a video publicly available since 2013 - in which he tells supporters he is getting support and advice from Americans for the campaign to win elections.      The government and the ruling CPP have manufactured these treason charges against Kem Sokha for political purposes, aiming to try and knock the political opposition out of the ring before the 2018 electoral contest even begins,  said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director of New York-based Human Rights Watch.

Britain says to pursue balanced post-Brexit immigration policy,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will pursue a balanced policy on immigration once it has left the European Union by seeking to attract high-skilled workers while driving the overall numbers down, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said on Wednesday.

Hong Kong's vanishing archives and the battle to preserve history,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - For anyone digging into Hong Kong s history, the official archives might not be the place to look. The office of the chief executive, Hong Kong s leader, failed to hand over any official records at all for eight of the 20 years since it came under Chinese rule in 1997, according to the government department that manages the archives. The Security Bureau only did it for 10. Researchers say the problem is that Hong Kong, under roughly 150 years of British colonial rule and the first 20 years of Chinese rule, has never had a law regulating how government records should be kept or destroyed. As a result, the document retention that researchers see as necessary for keeping a record of the past has been somewhat spotty within Hong Kong. Under British rule, the archiving of documents in Hong Kong was also lax. In 1994 and 1995, for example, the Government House gave nothing to the archives.  But thanks to a constant flow of correspondence between the colonial government and London, Britain would have stored a copy of most official records, according to researchers. After the handover of Hong Kong to China in 1997, that back-up mechanism disappeared, leading to concerns that fragments of Hong Kong s history might slip away for good.  Unlike Hong Kong, China has a set of archive laws, under which officials failing to file records can face administrative sanctions, or face charges if the case constitutes a crime.  But researchers say that for any Hong Kong-related documents kept by China, access would be difficult. Simon Chu, the former head of the Government Records Service who has been advocating for an archives law, said that prior to 1997 researchers could count on finding records in Britain, even if they were lost in Hong Kong.  After 1997, you don t have this kind of luxury,  he said.    Connie Lo, a documentary director digging into the 1967 Communist-led riots in Hong Kong, found almost nothing on the subject in the government archives. She was, however, able to find material in Britain s National Archives for her film  Vanished Archives,  which premiered in Hong Kong this year. Fears over record retention were highlighted last year when the government of former Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying said it had kept no records of informal meetings with local groups over a controversial land development project.  Hong Kong s current leader, Carrie Lam, has said she places  great importance  on the integrity of government records, and that she supports passing an archives law. She said she would pursue a law after receiving a report from the Law Reform Commission, which is studying the issue. The commission, however, has been considering the issue for four years and only expects to start consultations on the subject next year.  Activists like Chu are anxious that records of sensitive information, such as government decisions during the 2014 pro-democracy street protests could be destroyed with impunity.   I m very pessimistic about that,  Chu said. One former senior government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, also admitted to throwing out some documents in order to protect a former top official. He declined to say what the documents contained. But he suggested the practice might be widespread in the civil service.  For some of the most sensitive issues, there would not even be a record,  he said. The Government Records Service said it received 25 reports of unauthorized destruction of records in the past six years, and disciplinary actions were taken against four officers in four cases.

FBI says witnesses in U.S. probe into Malaysia's 1MDB fear for safety,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Potential witnesses to the multi-billion dollar scandal at 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) are afraid to speak with U.S. investigators as they fear for their safety, the Federal Bureau of Investigation says. A total of $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB by high-level officials of the fund and their associates, according to dozens of civil lawsuits filed by the U.S Justice Department in the past two years. 1MDB is at the center of money-laundering probes in at least six countries, including the United States, Switzerland and Singapore. Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak set up 1MDB in 2009 and served as chairman of its advisory board until last year. He has denied any wrongdoing. The Prime Minister s office and 1MDB did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the FBI claims. In a federal court filing in Los Angeles, the FBI requested that the names of its informants in the case be kept secret, after many expressed concerns of retaliation if they were found to have been in contact with the U.S. government. Individuals otherwise willing to provide information on the case have also told investigators that they were afraid that they would  place the safety and security of both themselves and their families at serious risk , according to a declaration in the filing by FBI agent special agent Robert Heuchling. The agent said identifying witnesses could result in intimidation or threaten their safety, citing Malaysian news reports of local officials and politicians who have been arrested for purportedly disclosing information linked to 1MDB. The agent cited Malaysian press reports from Aug 30 that said the driver of former Malaysian Attorney-General Abdul Gani Patail was shot in public as a possible warning against assisting the U.S government in the case. Abdul Gani had led investigations on 1MDB until he was replaced in 2015. Last month, the U.S. Justice Department asked for a stay on its civil lawsuits seeking to seize more than $1 billion in assets allegedly bought with stolen 1MDB funds because it was conducting a related criminal probe. The lawsuits filed by the department allege that the funds were stolen in four phases. The lawsuits say those involved included Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho, also known as Jho Low, Najib s stepson Riza Aziz, and Khadem al Qubaisi, the former managing director of Abu Dhabi s International Petroleum Investment Co. The trusts holding the assets on behalf of Low, Aziz, al Qubaisi and their families have opposed the request to put the civil proceedings on hold. The Low trusts have asked the United States to provide the identities of witnesses, sources of evidence, and thousands of documents that are relevant to the criminal investigation, the FBI said. The Justice Department has sought to seize a total of about $1.7 billion in assets that it said were bought with misappropriated 1MDB funds. The lawsuits also claim that $681 million in 1MDB funds found its way into the personal accounts of so-called Malaysian Official 1, who Malaysian and U.S. officials have identified as Najib. He was cleared of any wrongdoing in a Malaysian investigation. Low did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the FBI filing and he has previously denied any wrongdoing in the 1MDB case, saying that the Justice Department s actions were  a further example of global overreach in pursuit of a deeply flawed case.

"Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala urge protections for U.S. 'Dreamers'","MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico and Central American countries they will lobby U.S. lawmakers to protect young illegal immigrants who saw their lives thrown into limbo on Tuesday after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would end a program that shields them from deportation.  Trump announced plans to halt the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program that has protected from deportation nearly 800,000 young men and women who entered the United States illegally as children. Mexico s deputy foreign minister, Carlos Sada, said Trump s decision created  anxiety, anguish and fear  for the roughly 625,000 Mexican nationals protected under the program.  They are exceptional. ... This is as emotional for the United States as for Mexico,  Sada said at a news conference immediately following the announcement to end the program.  He said his government would press U.S. lawmakers for a quick solution to the uncertainty that  Dreamers,  as they are commonly called, now face in their adopted home. Immigrants who opt to return to Mexico will be welcomed with  open arms,  Sada said, offering them assistance with work, finances and education. The announcement to end DACA, created by former President Barack Obama in a 2012 executive order, came during the final day of talks in the Mexican capital to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement, adding pressure to already tense conversations between Mexico and the United States. El Salvador s foreign relations minister, Hugo Martinez, said he would meet with U.S. Congress members to find a solution within the next six months, before DACA s provisions are set to end, aiming to protect the 30,000 to 60,000 Salvadorans who could be affected.  It s a worrisome situation. ... We will be lobbying to have legislation as soon as possible that opens a way out,  Martinez said. Guatemala s foreign relations ministry said in a statement that it is counting on the  humanitarian sensibilities  of U.S. lawmakers to ensure thousands of Guatemalans are not forced to leave the country where many grew up. Honduras said in a statement that it would push U.S. Congress to reconsider Trump s move, and offer consular support for more than 18,500 Hondurans protected by DACA. The director of a Honduras migrant aid center, the Center for Attention for Honduran Migrants, called the U.S. decision  very sad,  and said young Hondurans forced to return home could face violence from gangs and drug traffickers.  Their lives will be much more difficult and put at enormous risk,  said Valdette Willeman, the center s director.

Mexican families of 'Dreamers' tell them to keep fighting,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Yolanda Varona is encouraging her children and thousands of other young Mexicans who may lose their right to live in the United States to stay and fight to achieve their American Dream. Varona is the mother of two of the 800,000 people, most of them Mexicans, who could face deportation after U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday eliminated the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA). DACA gave work permits to people known as  Dreamers  who were brought to the United States illegally as children by immigrants like Varona. Trump scrapped the Obama-era program, but delayed implementation until March to give Congress a chance to draft an alternative. After Varona was deported in 2010 and separated from her two children in the United States, she set up a chapter of Dreamers  Moms in the border city of Tijuana.  The group, founded in the United States by parents of Dreamers and other activists, has organized legal education workshops for immigrants across the United States. The Tijuana chapter has 80 mothers whose children in the United States could lose the legal protection that originally convinced them to risk registering with the U.S. government to join DACA.   We want them to keep fighting, they can achieve better things there,  Varona said by telephone.  In the unfortunate case that the police arrive to deport them, we will be there to help them.  Varona said Trump s decision would drive young people to  live in the shadows  again. She stressed how difficult it was for these youths to return to Mexico, where they have lost family ties and sometimes do not speak the language. Some 625,000 young Mexicans are enrolled under DACA. The Mexican government has offered them legal support and help finding work should they be deported from the United States.  But many Dreamers fear returning to an unfamiliar, violence-plagued country offering salaries that are a fraction of what they can earn in the United States.   Iliana Flores, a 28-year-old Dreamer in San Diego, across the border from Tijuana, said she was afraid of taking her two young, American-born children back to Mexico, where she said they would not receive a good education and would be surrounded by poverty and violence.   I fear for the future of my children there,  she said. Like millions of Mexicans living in the United States, Flores sends part of the U.S. dollars she earns back to her family, who live in Durango, to help them make ends meet.   The situation in Mexico is unfortunately very difficult,  she said. The U.S.-Mexico border is home to the largest per capita wage differential of any land border on the planet, with average U.S. wages about five times higher than those in Mexico. Carlos Martinez, a young man who came with his parents to California at the age of 11, said he feared he would expose his two children to rising violence and extortion if he was to return to Mexico. The murder rate in Mexico hit a record high this year, reaching levels not seen in homicide data going back two decades.   To be honest, I m afraid to live in what was once my country,  Martinez said. ",worldnews,"September 6, 2017 ",1

Billionaire Branson to ride out Hurricane Irma on Necker Island,"(Reuters) - British billionaire and adventurer Sir Richard Branson will stay on his private Caribbean island, Necker, for the potentially devastating arrival of Hurricane Irma, the founder of the Virgin group of companies said on Tuesday. Packing 185 mph (295 kph) winds, Hurricane Irma is due to reach the British Virgin Islands on Wednesday before grinding west across Haiti and Cuba then heading for the southern United States. The storm is classified as a Category 5 hurricane, the highest level on the scale used by the National Hurricane Center to measure strength.       We had some lovely guests staying on Necker Island who have cut their trip short for safety reasons, and another group of guests have also postponed,  Branson said in a statement on the Virgin Group website.  I will be on Necker alongside our team, as I have been on the three times we have had hurricanes over the past 30 years.  Necker, which has a large main house and several small Balinese-style houses that can accommodate about 34 people in total, is rented to private groups for $80,000 a night, according to its website. The island has more than 100 staff and two infinity pools. Branson said Necker boasts  really strong  buildings with hurricane blinds  that should be able to handle extreme weather pretty well.  He said their main concern was for British Virgin Islanders, who should make themselves as prepared as possible.  Whatever happens, keep inside, away from the ocean and away from flying debris,  Branson wrote. Recalling seeing two powerful hurricanes, Earl and Otto, strike the British Virgin Islands in 2010, Branson said he had beheld nature  at its most ferocious.  And he noted the damage done in Texas and Louisiana by Hurricane Harvey, which came ashore as the second-strongest Category 4 storm and destroyed thousands of homes and businesses, killed an estimated 60 people and displaced more than 1 million more. Harvey was a  tragic and costly reminder  that society is not doing enough to tackle climate change, Branson wrote.  If Irma is any indication, we must brace ourselves for more of these catastrophic weather events.  ",worldnews,"September 5, 2017 ",1

Mexican presidential hopeful Lopez Obrador says he would revise oil contracts,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - If elected, Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador will review oil contracts signed after historic reforms in the sector, the leftist politician said on Tuesday. The 63-year-old leads various polls ahead of next year s presidential election, and opponents looking to keep him out of office denounce him as a populist who would seek to emulate Venezuela s socialist government. Mexico opened up its energy sector with sweeping reforms in 2013 and 2014 to give investors the chance to participate in oil exploration and extraction. It has held auctions for sites on land as well as in shallow and deep water, in its efforts to boost energy production.  We will intervene because we don t want to end up not producing petroleum,  Lopez Obrador said in a speech at the Wilson Center in Washington, D.C.  The fall in production must be stopped   if not, we will end up buying crude oil, and we can t have that. We are going to intervene quickly and we are going to review the contracts.  The leader and founder of the political party Morena did not specify the form of the intervention. But he said he would not trust those who had signed the contracts for Mexico and would ensure the pacts were favorable for the country.  We are not going to act in an arbitrary way, we are going to be respectful of the law, but we will review the contracts,  Lopez Obrador said.  Everything related to Pemex must be public business - their profits are for the Mexican people and we must look after them. It is not an ideological matter, it is not a political matter.  Mexican crude production hovers around 2 million barrels per day, off a height of 3.4 million in 2004. Authorities have said after the reform production would increase gradually over several years. The reform had not lived up to its promise, said Lopez Obrador, adding that his industry plan included a refining stimulus, through the modernization of six of state-run oil company Pemex s refineries in Mexico. He also called for two more refineries to be built so that Mexico would not have to continue importing more than half the gasoline it consumes.    We sell crude oil and we buy gasoline, and it s necessary to pay a surcharge of 30 percent just for the freight, money that could be saved if the gasoline was made in Mexico,  Lopez Obrador said.

Brazil former presidents Lula and Rousseff charged in corruption case,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil s top prosecutor on Tuesday charged former Presidents Luis Inacio Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff along with fellow  Workers Party members with forming a criminal organization, the latest accusations in Brazil s sprawling corruption scandal. The prosecutor, Rodrigo Janot, alleged that eight members of the Workers Party, including Lula and Rousseff, committed a series of crimes involving state-owned oil firm Petrobras such as cartel formation, corruption and money laundering. They were the first criminal charges to be leveled against Rousseff, who was impeached in 2016 for breaking budgetary laws. The 230-page document filed with the Supreme Court accused Lula of heading the organization. Lula s lawyer said the law was being misused to persecute the former president. The Workers Party said in a statement that the charges were baseless and being used to divert attention from other investigations, including one into a former federal prosecutor, referring to a case Janot announced on Monday. A representative for Rousseff said the prosecutor s office had offered no evidence of the crimes and called on the Supreme Court to guarantee the right to defend against them.  Lula, who is still Brazil s most popular politician, is appealing a corruption conviction that would bar him from running for president in 2018. He faces four other corruption trials. The charges stem from the Operation Car Wash investigation that uncovered a cartel of companies paying bribes to officials to secure Petrobras contracts, revelations that have spawned a host of investigations that has shaken Brazil s political system and economy.

Germans content with national direction ahead of vote: survey,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germans are far more satisfied with the direction of their country and less politically polarized than other European nations, a survey showed on Wednesday, underscoring why Angela Merkel is expected to win a new term as chancellor this month. The survey by the Bertelsmann Foundation showed that 59 percent of Germans believe their country is headed in the right direction. Some 77 percent say their personal economic situation has improved or stayed the same over the past two years, while 80 percent describe themselves as political centerists. The results contrast with other European countries where dissatisfaction with the economy and political establishment has led to a surge in support for populist parties on the right and left in recent years. By contrast, German voters seem keen for continuity. Merkel is widely expected to win a record-tying fourth term on Sept. 24, with polls showing her center-right bloc 13-15 percentage points ahead of its closest rival, the Social Democrats (SPD).  These findings point to a highly content and status quo oriented German society and contrast starkly with the situation elsewhere in Europe,  the authors Catherine de Vries and Isabell Hoffmann said. In Italy, for example, just 13 percent of respondents said they were satisfied with the direction of their country. In France and Britain, satisfaction levels stood at 36 and 31 percent, respectively. The average satisfaction level across the 28 countries in the EU was 36 percent. Both Germany and France showed sharp increases in satisfaction levels over the past months. In a survey conducted in March, before young centrist Emmanuel Macron was elected president, just 12 percent of French said their country was headed in the right direction. German satisfaction levels stood at 32 percent in March. Among the big European countries, France was the most politically polarized, with just 51 percent of respondents describing themselves as centrist. Some 24 percent identified as left or extreme left, while 25 percent described themselves as right or extreme right. In Germany, just 13 percent of respondents described themselves as left or extreme left, and only 7 percent as right or extreme right. The Bertelsmann survey was conducted in July and based on interviews with 10,755 Europeans in all EU member states. ",worldnews,"September 6, 2017 ",1
U.N. enacts sanctions against anyone hindering Mali peace,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations Security Council established a Mali sanctions regime on Tuesday that allows the body to blacklist anyone who violates or obstructs a 2015 peace deal, hinders the delivery of aid, commits human rights abuses or recruits child soldiers. Anyone added to the blacklist would be subjected to a global travel ban or asset freeze, according to the French-drafted resolution, which was unanimously adopted by the 15-member Security Council.  We do see the sanctions as an additional tool in order to promote the peace agreement,  French U.N. Ambassador Francois Delattre told the Security Council.  Time is not on our side and the peace agreement in Mali is one of the keys to stabilization of the regional situation in the Sahel.    The vast, arid Sahel region has in recent years become a breeding ground for jihadist groups   some linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State   that European countries, particularly France, fear could threaten Europe if left unchecked. A 2015 peace deal signed by Mali s government and separatist groups has failed to stop violence in northern Mali by Islamist militants, who have also staged assaults on high-profile targets in the capital Bamako, Burkina Faso and Ivory Coast. French forces intervened in 2013 to drive back Islamist fighters who had hijacked the Tuareg uprising to seize Mali s desert north in 2012. The U.N. Security Council then deployed peacekeepers to the country.  Attacks on U.N. troops have made it the world body s deadliest peacekeeping mission. Anyone who attacks peacekeepers could be blacklisted by the Security Council.  The United Nations said two peacekeepers were killed and two seriously injured on Tuesday in an attack on their convoy in the Kidal region.  ",worldnews,"September 5, 2017 ",1
Brazil Congress advances bill to curb party proliferation,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil s lower house of Congress on Tuesday gave initial approval to a bill to reduce the huge array of political parties that have made it hard to govern the country and contributed to corruption. The chamber voted 384-16 for the establishment of a minimum national vote threshold that parties must reach to get public funding and free radio and television time for their election campaigns. The requirement would be 1.5 percent of votes in 2018, rising to 3 percent in 2030.  The constitutional amendment must be approved twice in each chamber of Congress by Oct. 7 to apply in next year s general elections. The proliferation of parties has forced Brazilian governments to forge unwieldy coalitions to stay in power by distributing jobs, influence and pork barrel spending, which critics say has provided fertile ground for graft. Small parties facing extinction opposed the vote threshold, which they said would favor larger established parties and hinder renewal of Brazil s scandal-plagued political class. The amendment also seeks to do away with the loose, ad hoc coalitions that parties often form on an election-by-election basis, regardless of ideology or platform.  Brazil currently has 35 political parties, 28 of which are represented in Congress. One of them, the Brazilian Women s Party, has only one federal lawmaker, who is a man. Brazil s public funding model has encouraged the founding of new parties, several of them with no clear platforms. There are currently 67 requests to register new parties, according to Brazil s top electoral court. A sweeping three-year-old probe of endemic corruption in Brazil has uncovered a web of political bribes and kickbacks implicating dozens of politicians, including President Michel Temer and a quarter of his cabinet. Next week lawmakers will vote on a separate amendment creating a new fund of taxpayer money to finance campaigns. That amendment would also replace a system of party lists to elect congressmen with races in which individual candidates with the most votes would win office. ",worldnews,"September 6, 2017 ",1
Putin: Russia reserves right to cut further U.S. diplomatic mission,"XIAMEN, China (Reuters) - Russia reserves the right to cut further the number of U.S. diplomatic staff in Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday, in response to what he called Washington s  boorish  treatment of Russia s diplomatic mission on U.S. soil. Speaking after U.S. officials ordered Russia to vacate diplomatic premises in several American cities, Putin said he would order the Russian foreign ministry to take legal action over alleged violations of Russia s property rights.  That the Americans reduced the number of our diplomatic facilities - this is their right,  Putin told a news conference in the Chinese city of Xiamen, where he was attending a summit of major emerging economies.  The only thing is that it was done in such a clearly boorish manner. That does not reflect well on our American partners. But it s difficult to conduct a dialogue with people who confuse Austria and Australia. Nothing can be done about it. Probably such is the level of political culture of a certain part of the U.S. establishment.   As for our buildings and facilities, this is an unprecedented thing,  Putin said.  This is a clear violation of Russia s property rights. Therefore, for a start, I will order the Foreign Ministry to go to court - and let s see just how efficient the much-praised U.S. judiciary is.  A U.S. State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Washington hoped to avoid further retaliatory actions with Moscow, but was   confident in the legality  of the consular closure and restrictions ordered last week. U.S. President Donald Trump took office in January, saying he wanted to improve ties with Russia. Putin also spoke favorably of Trump. But relations have been damaged by accusations from U.S. intelligence officials that Russia sought to meddle in the presidential election. Russia has denied interfering in the vote. Asked by a reporter if he was disappointed with Trump, Putin said:  Whether I am disappointed or not, your question sounds very naive - he is not my bride and, likewise, I am neither his bride nor bridegroom.   We are both statesmen. Every nation has interests of its own. In his activities, Trump is guided by the national interests of his country, and I by the interests of mine.   I greatly hope that we will be able, just as the current U.S. president said, to find some compromises while resolving bilateral and international problems ... taking into account our joint responsibility for international security.  The U.S. order for Russia to vacate some of its diplomatic  properties was the latest in a series of tit-for-tat actions that began when former U.S. president Barack Obama, late last year, expelled 35 Russian diplomats. The Obama administration said it was retaliating for Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential election. In July, Moscow responded, ordering the United States to cut the number of its diplomatic and technical staff working in Russia by around 60 percent, to 455. Moscow said the move aimed to bring the number of U.S. and Russian diplomats working on each other s soil to parity. But Putin said the latest expulsions ordered by Washington brought the number of Russian diplomats on U.S. soil to below parity.  He said the United States was erroneously counting 155 Russian diplomats working at the United Nations headquarters in New York as being Russian diplomats on U.S. soil. If they are removed from the equation, Putin said, Russia has fewer than 455 diplomats in the United States.  We reserve the right to take a decision on the number of U.S. diplomats in Moscow. But we won t do that for now. Let s wait and see how the situation develops further,  he said. The United States has ordered the closure of the Russian consulate in San Francisco and two buildings housing trade missions in Washington and New York.  U.S.-Russian relations have also been badly strained by Moscow s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the subsequent separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine, developments which led Washington to impose economic sanctions on Russia. Trump, himself battling allegations that his associates colluded with Russia, grudgingly signed into law the new sanctions against Moscow that had been drawn up by Congress.

Key U.S. senator says time not right for new North Korea legislation,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Any U.S. response to North Korea s latest nuclear weapons test is unlikely to include new sanctions legislation from the U.S. Congress, at least in the short term, an influential lawmaker said on Tuesday. Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the tensions with Pyongyang were  so heightened  that he thought it would be more appropriate for lawmakers to wait.  I don t think rushing out right now legislatively is probably the place we need to be,  Corker told reporters at the U.S. Capitol. As part of an agreement on a broad sanctions bill that passed in July, members of Congress had agreed to consider additional, more stringent, sanctions on North Korea after returning to Washington after their August recess. For example, some lawmakers have been pushing for legislation to impose  secondary  sanctions targeting banks that do business with North Korea. A top North Korean diplomat warned on Tuesday that his country was ready to send  more gift packages  to the United States as world powers struggled for a response to Sunday s weapons test, the latest in a series. Senior officials from President Donald Trump s administrations, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, are due to hold classified briefings on Wednesday for the House of Representatives and Senate to discuss North Korea and Afghanistan.

Florida insurers shares tumble as Hurricane Irma looms,"(Reuters) - Shares of Florida home insurers, including Heritage Insurance Holdings, tumbled on Tuesday and many extended losses later in the day as Hurricane Irma appeared set to hit Florida on Saturday, causing investors to brace for losses.  HCI Group shares posted their biggest-ever one-day percentage drop, falling 20.0 percent at $30.94 and hitting the lowest level since November. Trading volume was 11.6 times the stock s 10-day moving average. Heritage shares hit record lows and closed down 17.0 percent at $9.35 with trading volume 7.0 times the stock s 10-day moving average. Universal Insurance Holdings Inc shares tumbled 14.6 percent in the biggest one-day percentage drop since November 2015. Irma strengthened to a highly dangerous Category 5 storm, with winds of 185 mph, as it barreled toward the Caribbean and the southern United States, threatening deadly winds, storm surges and flooding.   If Irma continues its current path it will create significant insured damage,  said Sandler O Neill analyst Paul Newsome.  It s quite easy for them to wipe out all their earnings for the year.      Shares of United Insurance Holdings fell 7.2 percent, hitting their lowest point since February. Trading volume was 8.1 times the 10-day moving average. Larger insurance companies with a broader geographic exposure were also lower after tumbling last week on expectations of massive losses from Hurricane Harvey, which devastated parts of Texas and Louisiana. Travelers Co was down 3.7 percent after a 5 percent drop last week, and Progressive Corp was down 3.4 percent after falling 5.7 percent last week. Chubb Ltd fell 2.6 percent. Another big hurricane in the same year  adds another level of financial losses even for the big companies with enormous capital bases,  Newsome said. A second hurricane  strains the system  as insurers will have a harder time getting enough people to do loss adjustments in order to settle claims as quickly as possible, he said.

"Myanmar's Suu Kyi under pressure as almost 125,000 Rohingya flee violence","SHAMLAPUR, Bangladesh/DHAKA (Reuters) - Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi came under more pressure on Tuesday to halt violence against Rohingya Muslims that has sent nearly 125,000 of them fleeing over the border to Bangladesh in just over 10 days. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned of the risk of ethnic cleansing and regional destabilization. He   urged the U.N. Security Council to press for restraint and calm in a rare letter to express concern that the violence could spiral into a  humanitarian catastrophe.  Reuters reporters saw hundreds more exhausted Rohingya arriving on boats near the Bangladeshi border village of Shamlapur on Tuesday, suggesting the exodus was far from over. The International Organization for Migration said humanitarian assistance needed to increase urgently and that     it and partner agencies had an immediate funding gap of $18 million over the next three months to boost lifesaving services for the new arrivals. Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said after meeting Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in Dhaka that Jakarta was ready to help Bangladesh in dealing with the crisis.  This humanitarian crisis shall be ended. I want to repeat, this humanitarian crisis shall be ended , she told reporters in Dhaka, a day after she held talks in the Myanmar capital. The latest violence in Myanmar s northwestern Rakhine state began on Aug. 25, when Rohingya insurgents attacked dozens of police posts and an army base. The ensuing clashes and a military counter-offensive have killed at least 400 people and triggered the exodus of villagers to Bangladesh. Myanmar officials blamed Rohingya militants for the burning of homes and civilian deaths, but rights monitors and Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh say the Myanmar army is trying to force them out with a campaign of arson and killings. When asked if the violence could be described as ethnic cleansing, Guterres told reporters on Tuesday:  We are facing a risk, I hope we don t get there.   I appeal to all, all authorities in Myanmar, civilian authorities and military authorities, to indeed put an end to this violence that, in my opinion, is creating a situation that can destabilize the region,  he said. The treatment of Buddhist-majority Myanmar s roughly 1.1 million Muslim Rohingya is the biggest challenge facing Suu Kyi, who has been accused by Western critics of not speaking out for the minority that has long complained of persecution. Myanmar says its security forces are fighting a legitimate campaign against  terrorists.   H.T. Imam, a political adviser to Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, said other countries from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations could join Indonesia in putting pressure on fellow member Myanmar. Malaysia, another ASEAN member, summoned Myanmar s ambassador to express displeasure over the violence and scolded Myanmar for making  little, if any  progress on the problem.  Malaysia believes that the matter of sustained violence and discrimination against the Rohingyas should be elevated to a higher international forum,  Malaysian Foreign Minister Anifah Aman said in a statement. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who has said the violence against Rohingyas constituted genocide, told Suu Kyi the violence was of deep concern to the Muslim world, and that he was sending his foreign minister to Bangladesh. Pakistan, home to a large Rohingya community, has expressed  deep anguish  over the situation. About 210,000 Rohingya have sought refuge in Bangladesh since October, when Rohingya insurgents staged smaller attacks on security posts, triggering a major Myanmar army counter-offensive. Refugees arriving in Shamlapur, and residents of the village, said hundreds of boats arrived on Monday and Tuesday with several thousand people. Reuters reporters saw men, women and children with a few possessions, including chickens, disembark from one boat.  The army set fire to houses,  said Salim Ullah, 28, a farmer from Myanmar s village of Kyauk Pan Du, gripping a sack of belongings.  We got on the boat at daybreak. I came with my mother, wife and two children. There were 40 people on the boat.  The new arrivals - many sick or wounded - have strained the resources of aid agencies and communities already helping hundreds of thousands of refugees from previous spasms of violence in Myanmar.     Vivian Tan, a spokeswoman for the U.N. refugee agency, UNHCR, said one camp in Bangladesh, Kutupalong, had reached  full capacity  and resources at others were stretched.  We are doing what we can, but will need to seek more resources,  Tan said. Bangladesh is concerned about Myanmar army activity on the border and would lodge a complaint if Bangladeshi territory was violated, an Interior Ministry official said. A Bangladesh border guard officer said two blasts were heard on Tuesday on the Myanmar side, after two on Monday fueled speculation Myanmar forces had laid land mines. One boy had his left leg blown off near a border crossing before being brought to Bangladesh for treatment, while another boy suffered minor injuries, the officer, Manzurul Hassan Khan, said, adding the blast could have been a mine explosion. The Myanmar army has not commented on the blasts but said in a statement on Tuesday that Rohingya insurgents were planning bomb attacks in Myanmar cities including the capital, Naypyitaw, Yangon and Mandalay to  attract more attention from the world .

U.N. chief warns Myanmar violence could destabilize region,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres appealed to Myanmar authorities on Tuesday to end violence against Rohingya Muslims in the country s Rakhine state, warning of the risk of ethnic cleansing and regional destabilization.  He also urged the Security Council to press for restraint and calm, sending the 15-member body a rare letter to express concern that the violence could spiral into a  humanitarian catastrophe with implications for peace and security that could continue to expand beyond Myanmar s borders.  Nearly 125,00 Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh from Myanmar s northwestern Rakhine state since the violence began on Aug. 25, when Rohingya insurgents attacked dozens of police posts and an army base. The ensuing clashes and a military counter-offensive have killed at least 400 people.  When asked if the violence could be described as ethnic cleansing, Guterres told reporters on Tuesday:  We are facing a risk, I hope we don t get there.   I appeal to all, all authorities in Myanmar, civilian authorities and military authorities, to indeed put an end to this violence that, in my opinion, is creating a situation that can destabilize the region,  he said. Myanmar says its security forces are fighting a legitimate campaign against  terrorists  responsible for a string of attacks on police posts and the army since last October. Myanmar officials blamed Rohingya militants for the burning of homes and civilian deaths but rights monitors and Rohingya fleeing to neighboring Bangladesh say the Myanmar army is trying to force them out with a campaign of arson and killings. The U.N. Security Council met behind closed doors last week to be briefed on the situation at the request of Britain.   If it continues to deteriorate then one of the things that we can do is to hold further meetings to shine a spotlight on the situation there,  Britain s U.N. Ambassador Matthew Rycroft said on Monday. The treatment of Buddhist-majority Myanmar s roughly 1.1 million Muslim Rohingya is the biggest challenge facing leader Aung San Suu Kyi, accused by Western critics of not speaking out for the minority that has long complained of persecution. Under the rarely used Article 99 of the U.N. Charter, Guterres can  bring to the attention of the Security Council any matter which in his opinion may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security.  While Guterres  letter does not specifically involve Article 99, he writes that  the international community has a responsibility to undertake concerted efforts to prevent further escalation of the crisis.

Spanish auditors demand Catalan leaders pay for previous independence vote: El Pais,"MADRID (Reuters) - A Spanish audit office has demanded the former leader of Catalonia and other politicians from the region pay 5 million euros ($5.96 million) for holding a consultative independence ballot in 2014, El Pais newspaper said on Tuesday. The report, which cited judicial sources, came a day before Catalonia is expected to approve plans to hold an Oct. 1 referendum on a split from Spain. The 2014 vote was non-binding, a symbolic ballot by pro-independence campaigners that was declared illegal by Spain s Constitutional Court. Catalonia, along with Britain s Scotland and Belgium s Flanders, has one of the most active independence movements in the European Union.  El Pais said the former head of the Catalan government, Artur Mas and other regional leaders, were being told by the audit body in charge of overseeing the financing of political parties and the public sector to pay out of their own pocket for organizing the consultation vote. The money was due by Sept 25, it said. The audit office was not immediately available for comment. The current head of the Catalan government, Carles Puigdemont, said the move was the Spanish state  spreading fear . Catalan lawmakers are due to vote on Wednesday on laws approving the referendum and the legal framework to set up an independent state. The laws are expected to be approved because pro-independence parties have a majority in the regional parliament. The populous, north-eastern region, with its capital Barcelona, has a strong national identity with its own language and traditions, although polls show support for self-rule waning as Spain s economy improves.

Indian journalist shot dead at her residence,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - A senior Indian journalist was shot dead on Tuesday in the southern city of Bengaluru by unidentified assailants, police said. The body of Gauri Lankesh, the editor of an Indian weekly newspaper, was found lying in a pool of blood outside her home.  People in front of her house heard gunshots,  the city s Police commissioner, T. Suneel Kumar, told reporters.  We found four empty cartridges from the scene.  Lankesh was known as a fearless and outspoken journalist. She was a staunch critic of right-wing political ideology. Last year, she was convicted of criminal defamation for one of her articles. While the motivation for the killing was not immediately clear, political leaders, journalists and activists took to Twitter to express their outrage and denounce intolerance and any threat to free speech.

"Venezuela arrests top oil executive, eight other PDVSA employees: sources","CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela has arrested the state oil company s boss for the western region and eight other executives at PDVSA, according to an internal company memo and a half-dozen sources in the OPEC member s oil industry.  It was not immediately clear why Gustavo Malave and the other employees were apprehended, though a series of corruption probes are under way at PDVSA and have entangled other employees.  The sources said Malave was arrested on Monday in Zulia state, Venezuela s traditional oil-producing region near Colombia, in what would be one of the highest-profile detentions of a PDVSA executive.  PDVSA, the prosecutor s office, and Malave did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Separately, Venezuela s new chief prosecutor Tarek Saab on Thursday announced he was investigating  spectacular  overpricing in a dozen contracts in the nation s Orinoco oil belt, on the other side of the country.  The reputation of PDVSA - short for Petroleos de Venezuela SA - has been tarnished in recent years by graft investigations involving high-profile staff.  The company has blamed the problems on a small group of employees and executives, and promised a war on corruption. Last year, the opposition-led congress said $11 billion was lost at PDVSA between 2004 and 2014, when Rafael Ramirez was in charge of the company. He denied the allegations. The Caracas-based company is the financial motor of leftist President Nicolas Maduro s government, but is reeling from low oil prices, mismanagement, and lack of investments.

Nigeria's cabinet meeting canceled for second time since Buhari's return,"ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria has canceled its weekly cabinet meeting for the second time since President Muhammadu Buhari returned from three months of medical leave in Britain. Information Minister Lai Mohammed said in a statement Wednesday s meeting would not take place  due to inadequate time to prepare the documents . Buhari canceled the first cabinet meeting following his return on Aug. 19, raising concerns that the president, criticized for inertia by his opponents, was returning to his former ways, when he worked from home and missed ministerial meetings. But the 74-year-old president, who has been working from home since his return, last week presided over his first cabinet meeting since taking leave for an unspecified ailment.  The refusal to disclose details of his illness has caused speculation about whether he is well enough to run Africa s most populous country and biggest economy. Mohammed s statement said a two-day public holiday on Friday and Monday to mark the Islamic Eid-el-Kabir celebrations had left little time to prepare for the weekly meeting.

"Commander of Lesotho defense force shot dead, South Africa calls for calm","MASERU (Reuters) - Lesotho s top military leader, Khoantle Mots omots o, and two  senior officers were shot dead on Tuesday at an army barracks, the government said. While it was not immediately clear what the motivation for the shooting was, the kingdom has been subject to several coups and periodic political violence since gaining independence from Britain in 1966, and South Africa called for calm. Colonel Tanki Mothae, the principal secretary for the defense force, told Reuters the two senior officers were under investigation for the murder of another former Lesotho defense commander in 2015. Prime Minister Thomas Thabane, who fled the country in 2014 after a coup attempt and whose wife was shot dead in June, offered no details about the killings during a news conference other than saying the incident was being investigated. Neither Mothae nor the prime minister confirmed South African media reports that the two officers had killed the defense commander and then died in a gunfight with soldiers. South African President Jacob Zuma condemned  in the strongest terms possible the senseless and regrettable killing  and called for  calm and restraint  in the mountainous country that is entirely surrounded by its large neighbor. Lesotho is a major supplier of water to South Africa s industrial heartland. Zuma also said the Southern African Development Community (SADC) would send a ministerial fact-finding mission to Lesotho on Thursday to assess the situation.      South African Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa has made frequent trips to Lesotho to try to secure peace among political rivals as a facilitator for SADC.  Lesotho has been through bouts of political turbulence since the attempted coup in 2014 and its last three elections - most recently in June - have failed to produce winners with clear majorities.

French see far-left's Melenchon as Macron's strongest opponent: poll,"PARIS (Reuters) - French voters view far leftist Jean-Luc Melenchon as the strongest opponent of President Emmanuel Macron, according to a new poll on Tuesday that highlights the weakness of mainstream opposition. The Ifop-Fiducial poll showed Macron s popularity has dropped sharply since he took power in May but its key finding could help him as he embarks on reforms because polls show voters see Melenchon as too extreme to be a serious candidate for power.  Melenchon is very much on the protest front but not seen as an actual alternative (to Macron),  said Frederic Dab of Ifop pollsters.   That can be an opportunity for Emmanuel Macron, allowing him to create a vacuum around him and replace the left-right divide by a reform vs protest debate.  The poll for Paris Match and Sud Radio showed 45 percent of voters say Melenchon s  France Unbowed  party provides the strongest opposition to Macron. That is more than twice the figure for the conservative Republicans (LR) or the far-right National Front (FN). Only 8 percent mentioned the Socialists. France Unbowed has been much more vocal than the conservatives or Socialists. The Republicans have been subdued in the wake of their defeat in the presidential election and divided over what stance to take toward Macron, whose economic policies resemble what many in their party have asked for for years. All three parties are struggling to get their voices heard above Macron and Melenchon s criticism of each other.  Macron is trying to eliminate anything there is between him and extreme parties. I won t let him do that ... I won t resign myself to Melenchon being the only opposition to Macron,  Laurent Wauquiez, the frontrunner to win LR s leadership in December, said on Sunday.  A government source said Melenchon s relative strength was welcome and he was Macron s only proper opponent.   I was praying to have Jean-Luc Melenchon and Marine Le Pen in parliament ... The Emmanuel Macron/Edouard Philippe alliance was meant to get the Socialist Party and the right to explode and we are not disappointed,  the source said. He was referring to the fact that Macron s prime minister Philippe comes from LR.     Melenchon strongly opposes Macron s plans to overhaul labor laws but his party can do little to block the measures because it has just 17 lawmakers in the 577-strong parliament. Melenchon, an anti-NATO euroskeptic known for his fiery debating style, has called on his supporters to march on Sept. 23 to protest the labor reforms, which will give companies more flexibility on firings, pay and working hours. The poll confirmed Macron s drop in popularity with 46 percent saying they approved of his policies, down 10 points from July. ",worldnews,"September 5, 2017 ",1

"If Trump says Iran violating nuclear deal, does not mean U.S. withdrawal: Haley","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - If U.S. President Donald Trump tells Congress in October that Iran is not complying with a 2015 nuclear deal it brokered with world powers, that does not mean a U.S. withdrawal from the agreement, U.S. envoy to the U.N. Nikki Haley said on Tuesday. Under U.S. law, the State Department must notify Congress every 90 days of Iran s compliance with the nuclear deal. The next deadline is October, and Trump has said he thinks by then the United States will declare Iran to be non-compliant.  If the President chooses not to certify Iranian compliance, that does not mean the United States is withdrawing from the JCPOA (the nuclear deal),  Haley told the American Enterprise Institute think tank in Washington.  Should he decide to decertify he has grounds to stand on,  said Haley, adding that she did not know what Trump would decide.  We will stay in a deal as long as it protects the security of the United States.  Most U.N. and Western sanctions were lifted 18 months ago under the nuclear deal. Iran is still subject to a U.N. arms embargo and other restrictions, which are not technically part of the deal. In April, Trump ordered a review of whether a suspension of sanctions on Iran related to the nuclear deal, negotiated under President Barack Obama, was in the U.S. national security interest. He has called it  the worst deal ever negotiated.  Iranian President Hassan Rouhani warned last month that Iran could abandon the nuclear agreement  within hours  if the United States imposes any more new unilateral sanctions.  (The nuclear deal) is a very flawed and very limited agreement ... Iran has been caught in multiple violations over the past year and a half,  Haley said.  The Iranian nuclear deal was designed to be too big to fail.  The U.S. review of its policy toward Iran is also looking at Tehran s behavior in the Middle East, which Washington has said undermines U.S. interests in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Lebanon.  Iran s leaders want to use the nuclear deal to hold the world hostage to its bad behavior,  she said. Haley traveled to Vienna last month to meet International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) officials for what she described as a fact-finding mission as part of Trump s review. The IAEA polices restrictions the deal placed on Iran s nuclear activities and reports quarterly. While Haley asked if the IAEA planned to inspect Iranian military sites to verify Tehran s compliance, something Tehran has said they would not allow, she said on Tuesday:  We never ask the IAEA to do anything.

'Suicidal' Danish submarine owner says journalist killed by hatch cover,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Swedish journalist Kim Wall died when she was accidentally hit by a heavy hatch cover on board a home-made submarine, the Danish owner of the vessel testified in court on Tuesday. Peter Madsen, who denies killing Wall, said he was holding the hatch for her but it slipped and hit her head as they sailed in the strait between Denmark and Sweden last month on the UC3 Nautilus submarine he had built.  Madsen, 46, was speaking in court after being charged with killing the Swedish journalist on the submarine and mutilating her body   a case bearing many of the attributes of the region s popular Nordic Noir books and films. It could mean a sentence of five years to life in prison for Madsen, if found guilty. The court on Tuesday ordered a psychiatric evaluation and that Madsen be kept in custody for four weeks. In its preliminary investigation, the court had ordered Madsen detained until Tuesday on the lesser charge of involuntary manslaughter. Madsen said Wall s death was an accident. With the vessel at the surface, he said he had crawled out through the hatch and was standing on top, while holding it open  to let Wall follow him. At that moment, the submarine was rocked by a wave from another boat.  I lose my foothold and the hatch shuts,  he told the Copenhagen court, saying Wall was knocked to the floor.  There was a pool of blood where she had landed.  A prosecutor also read earlier testimony from behind closed doors in which Madsen said the impact had fractured the journalist s skull and killed her. Madsen said he tried to bury her at sea but denied mutilating her body, and added that he had contemplated killing himself while still on board. Wall, a 30-year-old freelance journalist who was researching a story on Madsen, went missing after he took her out to sea in his 17-metre (56-foot) submarine on Aug. 10. On Aug. 23, police identified a headless female torso that washed ashore in Copenhagen as Wall s. The cause of her death has not been determined. In court, Madsen denied having amputated her limbs and said he dropped her  whole  body into the water, several hours after her death, after having a sleep because he was  tired and exhausted . He admitted that he wanted to  bury her at sea  by attaching metal to the body in order for it to sink.   I had no contact with the body and didn t want a dead body in my submarine,  Madsen told the court.  I put a rope around her feet to drag her out of the hatch,  he said, adding that he was crying during this operation.  I am suicidal at this stage (and) thought a fitting end for Peter Madsen would be on board the Nautilus,  he said.  I was in a condition where I decided I couldn t continue the life I had been living.  He changed his mind, he said, because he wanted to see his wife and three cats. The submarine is one of three Madsen had built and one of the largest privately built ones in the world. It could carry eight people and weighed 40 tonnes fully equipped. A day after taking Wall out to sea, Madsen was rescued in a navy operation after deliberately sinking the vessel. ",worldnews,"September 5, 2017 ",1
Colombia urges ELN rebels to turn over body of Russian hostage,"BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia s government on Tuesday urged the ELN rebels to turn over as soon as possible the body of a Russian-Armenian hostage killed in April, while a commander with the guerrillas said they were in touch with the Russian embassy about the matter. Arsen Voskanyan, 42, was seized by the rebels in northwestern Choco province in November. The group claimed he was collecting endangered frogs and accused him of wanting to smuggle wildlife overseas.  The National Liberation Army (ELN) is currently in peace talks with the government in a bid to end more than 53 years of war. The two sides, who are meeting in Ecuador, said on Monday they had agreed on a bilateral ceasefire starting in October and extending into next year, which includes a ban on kidnappings. The ELN unit that had been holding Voskanyan told Reuters he was shot when he grabbed a hand grenade in an effort to escape. ELN leaders in Quito later confirmed his death.  We are urging the (ELN) negotiators in Quito to facilitate the return of the Russian s body to his family, the negotiators have been in touch with the embassy,  head government negotiator Juan Camilo Restrepo told journalists.  They said they have given instructions and have the utmost willingness to return the body of the Russian citizen as soon as possible, I hope they fulfill it, quickly,  Restrepo added. The ELN s head negotiator, Pablo Beltran, said in Quito that Voskanyan had been buried and confirmed the group was in touch with the Russian embassy in Ecuador.

Brexit bill row to last the length of Brexit talks: UK minister,"LONDON (Reuters) - A row over how much money Britain should pay the European Union when it leaves the bloc will probably go on for the full duration of the EU exit talks, Brexit minister David Davis said on Tuesday. The Brexit bill is a contentious issue both in Britain, where eurosceptics are keen to see as little money paid as possible, and in the EU, which is demanding Britain meets its existing commitments to the bloc.   My expectation is that the money argument will go on for the full duration of the negotiation,  he told parliament.  Britain, which began a two-year negotiating period in March, has said it is prepared to meet its international obligations and, last week, Davis said London was willing to offer more than the bare legal minimum.  The bill is one of three issues the EU is demanding progress on before it is willing to begin discussing Britain s future relationship with the bloc - something London is keen to move on to as soon as possible. But, Davis stressed that Britain would not be pressured into cutting a deal just to move talks to the next stage.  Davis said the two sides disagreed over the basis of the so-called Brexit bill, and that he did not expect them to fully resolve their differences.  It is clear that the two sides have very different legal stances,  Davis told parliament during an update on the talks.  (EU chief negotiator) Michel Barnier and I agreed that we do not anticipate making incremental progress on the final shape of the financial deal in every round ... it is also clear there are significant differences to be bridged in this sector.   Davis also said that there was widespread agreement across the European Union about having an implementation period when Britain leaves the bloc, and that it would probably look to continue its relationship with the European Investment Bank.

Saudi says Iranian talk of rapprochement is laughable,"LONDON (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia said on Tuesday that Iran s talk of a possible rapprochement with the kingdom was laughable. Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told reporters in London that Iran would have to change its policies for any rapprochement. Iran s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, last month said the Islamic Republic would soon exchange diplomatic visits after the regional rivals severed diplomatic ties last year.  The comments of the foreign minister are laughable,  al-Jubeir said.  If Iran wants to have good relations with Saudi Arabia, it has to change its policies. It has to respect international law.   At this time, we do not see... that they re serious about wanting to be a good neighbor,  al-Jubeir said Iran s Zarif was quoted by the Iranian Students  News Agency (ISNA) that diplomatic visits could take place after the haj pilgrimage ends in the first week of September. But al-Jubeir said that diplomatic exchanges with Iran over arrangements for the haj did not represent a normalization of relations and that such contacts had nothing to do with politics.  We had the haj season, and when we have the haj, we try not to politicize it... But this is not normalization,  he said.  The meetings around the haj, have nothing to do with the politics. It s a religious issue.  Relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia are at their worst in years, with each accusing the other of subverting regional security and supporting opposite sides in conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Yemen. Al-Jubeir also said that if the rift with Qatar continued for two years then  so be it.   Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) severed ties with Qatar in June over Doha s alleged support for militants.  ",worldnews,"September 5, 2017 ",1
France turns to armed drones in fight against Sahel militants,"TOULON, France (Reuters) - France has decided to arm its surveillance drones in West Africa as part of counter-terrorism operations against Islamist militants, Defense Minister Florence Parly said on Tuesday. French President Emmanuel Macron has made fighting Islamist militants his primary foreign policy objective and the move to armed drones fits into a more aggressive policy at a time when it looks increasingly unlikely Paris will be able to withdraw from the region in the medium to long-term.  France currently has five unarmed Reaper reconnaissance drones positioned in Niger s capital Niamey to support its 4,000-strong Barkhane counter-terrorism operation in Africa, and one in France.   Beyond our borders, the enemy is more furtive, more mobile, disappears into the vast Sahel desert and dissimulates himself amidst the civilian population,  Parly said in a speech to the military.   Facing this, we cannot remain static. Our methods and equipment must adapt. It is with this in mind that I have decided to launch the process to arm our intelligence and surveillance drones.      A further six of 12 Reaper drones, built by U.S. firm General Atomics and ordered after France s 2013 intervention in Mali to eventually replace its EADS-made Harfang drones, are due to be delivered by 2019. The defense ministry said on Tuesday the new drones would be delivered with Hellfire missiles while the existing six would be armed by 2020, possibly with European munitions.   Previous French administrations have shied away from purchasing armed drones, fearing a possible increase in civilian casualties. Al Qaeda s north African wing AQIM and related Islamist groups were largely confined to the Sahara desert until they hijacked a rebellion by ethnic Tuareg separatists in Mali in 2012, and then swept south. French forces intervened the following year to prevent them taking Mali s capital, Bamako, but they have since gradually expanded their reach across the region, launching high-profile attacks in Mali, Burkina Faso and Ivory Coast, as well as much more frequent, smaller attacks on military targets. At the end of July, at the military base in Niger, officers and pilots had told Reuters it was imperative to arm the drones to be more efficient and quick in tackling jihadist groups.  In the future, armed drones will enable us to accompany surveillance ... with the capacity to strike at the opportune moment.  We will be able to gain in efficiency and limit the risk of collateral damage,  Parly said.  France is also working with Germany, Italy and Spain to  develop a European drone, which is expected to be ready by 2025. ",worldnews,"September 5, 2017 ",1
Exclusive: Crowded Bangladesh revives plan to settle Rohingya on isolated island,"DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh, one of the world s poorest and most crowded nations, plans to go ahead with work to develop an isolated, flood-prone island in the Bay of Bengal to temporarily house tens of thousands of Rohingya Muslims fleeing violence in neighboring Myanmar, officials say. Dhaka says the Rohingya are not welcome, and has told border guards to push back those trying to enter the country illegally. But close to 125,000 Rohingya have crossed into Bangladesh in just 10 days, joining more than 400,000 others already living there in cramped makeshift camps. (For a graphic on Bangladesh's refugee relocation plan click tmsnrt.rs/2k7ZAZy)  We are stopping them wherever we can, but there are areas where we can t stop them because of the nature of the border; forests, hills,  said H.T. Imam, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina s political adviser.  We have requested international agencies for help for shifting the Rohingya temporarily into a place where they can live - an island called Thengar Char. Developing Thengar Char should be given serious consideration,  he said. Leonard Doyle, chief spokesman for the International Organisation for Migration, said the idea of moving refugees to the island has been talked about for years, but he hadn t heard anything new in the past few days. The island, which only emerged from the silt off Bangladesh s delta coast 11 years ago, is two hours by boat from the nearest settlement. It regularly floods during June-September monsoons and, when seas are calm, pirates roam the nearby waters to kidnap fishermen for ransom. Flat and featureless, Thengar Char has no roads or buildings. When Reuters visited in February, a few buffalo grazing along its shores were the only sign of life. (For a graphic on Thengar Char click tmsnrt.rs/2wE9Tcu) The plan to develop the island and use it to house refugees was criticized by humanitarian workers when it was proposed in 2015 and revived last year. Bangladesh, though, insists it alone has the right to decide where to shelter the growing numbers of refugees.  The honorable prime minister wants to resettle them in Thengar Char, though some people say that island will not be a suitable place for them,  said another Hasina aide, who declined to be named.  But there are many such areas in Bangladesh, where Bangladeshis live. It s our country, and we decide.  Officials say no one could have foreseen just how many refugees would arrive so swiftly after violence in northern Myanmar last year sent more than 75,000 Rohingya fleeing across the border. The latest unrest in Myanmar s northwestern Rakhine state began on Aug. 25, when Rohingya insurgents attacked dozens of police posts and an army base, prompting an army counter-offensive that has killed at least 400 people and forced entire villages to flee. Myanmar says its security forces are fighting a legitimate campaign against  terrorists . The country s leader and Nobel laureate, Aung San Suu Kyi, has come under international pressure for not speaking out against the persecution of roughly 1.1 million Muslim Rohingya in the Buddhist-majority country. Makeshift camps in Cox s Bazar, in southeast Bangladesh, have grown so rapidly they have run out of space - even for the tiny tarpaulin and bamboo shacks the Rohingya refugees typically throw together.  With hundreds of new refugees streaming in every day, Kutupalong and Nayapara camps are at breaking point,  Duniya Aslam Khan, a spokeswoman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), said in a statement.  Imam, the adviser to Hasina, said a lack of space was the biggest concern right now, adding Bangladesh could not continue to house refugees in its schools and madrassas indefinitely.  We are waiting for Thengar Char to be developed. Once that s done we will shift them,  he told Reuters, reflecting a growing sense of hostility towards the Rohingya even in a Muslim-majority country.  The islands gradually come up because of silting. That s continuing, and that s how Bangladesh has been created. If there are people there, why can t the Rohingya live there?  he said. Some officials in Bangladesh s interior ministry are concerned that settling the refugees on the island would give them a sense of permanent residency, making it harder to send them back to Myanmar. Residents of Sandwip, the nearest island to Thengar Char, say the Rohingya are not welcome. Mizanur Rahman, the administrator of Might Bangha village, the closest settlement to Thengar Char, said local residents who have lost their land to erosion should be relocated first, ahead of the Rohingya. The UNHCR s local office did not respond to an email seeking comment about the relocation plan. Rohingya camped out in Cox s Bazar said they don t want to move to the island, fearing they could die there during the monsoon season and there won t be any work. The violence and refugee exodus have ratcheted up tensions between the two neighbors, and Bangladeshi officials said fighter jets were scrambled last week in response to several Myanmar defense helicopters violating its air space.

Kenya's election body appoints key personnel for presidential vote re-run,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya s election commission said on Tuesday that different staff will be in charge of the Oct. 17 re-run of the presidential election, after the country s top court last week nullified the result of the August vote. The Supreme Court ordered on Friday that the vote be re-run within 60 days, saying incumbent President Uhuru Kenyatta s victory by 1.4 million votes was undermined by irregularities in the process. Kenyatta was not accused of any wrongdoing. Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission Chairman Wafula Chebukati said in a statement on Tuesday that it had appointed for three months a project coordinator and officials to run the information technology, logistics, operations and training as well as the national tallying center during the re-run.  The appointment takes immediate effect,  Chebukati said. The appointments were announced hours after opposition leader Raila Odinga said his coalition would not participate in the re-run unless some officials were removed and its voting technology audited. Chebukati s statement did not mention those who previously held the positions. Kenyatta responded to Odinga s demands by saying there was nowhere in law that required the electoral body to consult Odinga. Odinga s conditions for participating in the repeat presidential election included the removal of six officials at the election board. He wants criminal investigations to be opened against them.   You cannot do a mistake twice and expect to get different results,  Odinga told reporters.  A number of the officials of the commission should be sent home, some of them should be investigated for the heinous crimes they committed.  The opposition also said it was planning to file dozens of challenges to results from races lower down the ticket, including legislative and local seats contested in the Aug. 8 vote.  The Supreme Court ruling, the first time in Africa that a court had overturned the re-election of a sitting president, was hailed by Odinga s supporters as  historic . Analysts have said it is likely to lead to some short-term volatility in East Africa s biggest economy, but could build confidence in institutions longer-term. On Monday, the election board said it would hold new elections on Oct. 17. But Odinga said he wanted elections held on Oct. 24 or 31 instead.  Odinga s National Super Alliance said in a letter to the chairman of the election commission that before the new vote is held, it needs to audit the technology used to conduct August s election and give an assurance it will be transparent in its conduct.   There will be no elections on the 17th of October until the conditions that we have spelt out in the statement are met,  Odinga said.  Kenyatta rebuffed Odinga s demands.  There is no legal requirement that Raila be consulted. I was neither consulted. Kenya doesn t belong to one man,  he said in a statement sent by his office. Odinga has lost the last three presidential elections. Each time, he has said the vote was rigged against him. A row over a 2007 poll, which Odinga challenged after being declared loser, was followed by weeks of ethnic bloodshed that killed more than 1,200 people. The opposition also plans to lodge 62 court cases contesting governorship, lawmaker, and local seats, spokeswoman Kathleen Openda told Reuters.  At least 33 court cases were filed contesting election results before the presidential election was annulled, said Andrew Limo, spokesman for the election board.  The judiciary said in a statement that by Tuesday a total 66 cases had been filed before various courts challenging the outcomes of such seats countrywide. The board received challenges to 189 results in 2013. ",worldnews,"September 5, 2017 ",1
"Colombia's Golfo crime gang willing to surrender, president says","BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia s notorious Golfo Clan crime gang, one of the country s most violent, has told the government it is willing to surrender, President Juan Manuel Santos said on Tuesday. The group, also known the Usuga Clan, is accused of operating profitable drug trafficking routes in partnership with Mexican cartels and taking part in illegal gold mining.   We received an expression of willingness by the head of the Golfo Clan to turn themselves in, to submit to justice,  President Juan Manuel Santos said at an event in Bogota.  I have asked the justice minister and the attorney general to evaluate it.  The government is not going to negotiate with the gang, Santos said, because members are criminals, and not politically motivated rebels like the FARC and ELN guerrilla groups.  The group formerly known as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, who have kept their FARC acronym for their new political party, signed a peace deal with the government last year, while the National Liberation Army (ELN) is in peace talks.  If they surrender to justice, the law could give them some benefits, depending on the surrender conditions,  Santos said.  What are they handing over, what is its value to society, for Colombians.  The United States has offered a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to the capture of Golfo gang leader Dario Antonio Usuga, known by his alias Otoniel.    Second-in-command Roberto Vargas, alias Gavilan, was killed by the army in a shoot-out last week. The group is infamous for a series of police officer assassinations in the Andean country.

Egypt says suspended U.S. military exercises to resume,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt s armed forces said on Tuesday that joint U.S.-Egyptian military exercises will resume this month for the first time since 2009, after U.S. officials canceled them in 2013 following an Egyptian army crackdown on protests. The joint training is usually held every two years but was also canceled in 2011 after the  Arab Spring  uprising that year that overthrew Egypt s longtime ruler Hosni Mubarak. The announcement on the  Bright Star  exercises came weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump s administration denied Egypt $95.7 million in aid and delayed $195 million because of its failure to progress on respecting rights and democratic norms.     The exercises will take place from Sept. 10-20 at the new Mohamed Najuib military base in west Alexandria, according to a statement on the Egyptian military s official Facebook page.  The Bright Star training is considered one of the most important joint Egyptian-American armed forces exercises, which reflects the depth of relations and cooperation between the armed forces of both countries,  the Egyptian statement said. A U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to media confirmed the timing and location of the exercise and said U.S. Central Command is due to make an official announcement soon. Egypt is one of Washington s closest Middle East allies, and U.S. military aid has long cemented its historic 1979 peace deal with Israel. Home to the Suez Canal, the stability of the Arab world s most populous state is a U.S. priority. But the strategic relationship hit a low under former U.S. President Barack Obama, who briefly froze aid to Egypt after President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi overthrew his Islamist freely elected predecessor in 2013 after mass protests against him. Washington provides $1.3 billion in military aid and about $250 million in economic aid to Egypt every year. Trump has moved to reset U.S. relations with Sisi, giving him firm backing and vowing to work together to fight Islamic militants. U.S. sources have said last month s decision to freeze aid reflected a desire to continue security cooperation but also express frustration with Cairo s stance on civil liberties. A new law regulating non-governmental organizations is widely seen as part of a growing crackdown on dissent. ",worldnews,"September 5, 2017 ",1

Speaking to reporters, Oliveira said he backs a  deep investigation  into the emergence of new evidence suggesting that witnesses who involved President Michel Temer in a corruption scandal might have not been forthcoming about all of their crimes. Prosecutor General Rodrigo Janot said on Monday that billionaire meat tycoon Joesley Batista and a fellow witness seemed to have inadvertently recorded a four-hour conversation discussing crimes not covered in their plea deal bargain.

French magazine found guilty over topless photos of British Duchess,"PARIS (Reuters) - A French court ruled on Tuesday that celebrity magazine Closer  invaded the privacy of Britain s Prince William s wife Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, when it published topless photos of her in 2012. The court handed the maximum fine of 45,000 euros ($53,500) to both Laurence Pieau, an editor of Closer s French edition, and Ernesto Mauri, chief executive of Italian publisher Mondadori (MOED.MI), the magazine s owner.  William and Kate, who announced on Monday that they were expecting a third child, said they were pleased with the court ruling and the matter was now closed.  Closer magazine, a weekly round-up of gossip about the rich and famous, published a series of topless photos of Kate, the wife of the second-in-line to the British throne, while on holiday in southern France. Two photographers from a Paris agency, who denied taking the photographs, were ordered to pay smaller fines after also being convicted under French privacy laws. The damages ordered by the court were well short of the 1.5 million euros sought by the royal couple, a subject of fascination for many in Britain and other parts of the world, who filed the suit for what they called at the time a  grotesque  breach of privacy.  This incident was a serious breach of privacy, and their Royal Highnesses felt it essential to pursue all legal remedies,  a spokeswoman for the couple said.  They wished to make the point strongly that this kind of unjustified intrusion should not happen.  The photos were taken as the royal couple relaxed on a balcony of a chateau in the picturesque Luberon region of southeastern France. The pictures rekindled memories for some in Britain of the media pursuit of William s mother, Princess Diana, who died in a car crash in Paris in 1997 while being chased by paparazzi. Closer magazine s lawyers had sought to justify publication of the photos on public interest grounds, saying they disproved rumors circulating at the time that Kate might be anorexic. Jean Veil, a prominent French lawyer hired by the Duchess of Cambridge, said during the trial the article that accompanied the photos was only a pretext for publishing the pictures.

Austria's far-right party accuses conservatives of stealing campaign ideas,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria s far-right Freedom Party (FPO) on Tuesday accused Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz of stealing its platform on immigration and the economy ahead of a parliamentary election, which he is favorite to win. FPO leader Heinz-Christian Strache s comments come a day after Kurz presented plans for his conservative People s Party (OVP) for a slimmer state, changes in corporate tax law and cuts to benefits for foreigners.  The program Kurz presented is almost identical to the FPO economic program. We are still waiting for the presentation of the OVP s own economic plan,  Strache told Reuters. Kurz has led opinion polls ahead of the Oct. 15 election with just over 30 percent. The Freedom Party and the center-left Social Democrats (SPO) trail with around 25 percent each.   The conservatives and the far right have enough common ground on migration, taxes and education to launch coalition talks if the vote does not yield a clear winner, said political analyst Peter Filzmaier. Austria s system of proportional representation will likely lead to another coalition government. A coalition of the SPO and OVP has held power since 2006 but is unpopular because it failed to agree major reforms on job creation, investment and taxes.  Given Sebastian Kurz s popularity, a coalition between the OVP and the FPO seems to be the most likely outcome,  said Vienna-based analyst Peter Hajek. Kurz told reporters on Tuesday he did not rule out working with any party and was  equidistant  from the FPO and the SPO. A cartoon in daily newspaper Kurier showed a naked Strache in a police station telling an officer Kurz had stolen  everything  from him. The FPO and OVP focus on the free market, a small state and low taxes. The SPO wants new taxes, including on wealth and inheritance and subsidies to promote job creation. The Social Democrats under Chancellor Christian Kern have begun to consider cooperation with the Freedom Party but Kern this week said his party was  light years  from it.   The Freedom Party s popularity rose to a high during Europe s migration crisis in 2015 when it denounced the government s decision to open Austria s borders to hundreds of thousands of refugees and migrants.  It led polls for more than a year with support above 30 percent and its candidate came close to winning last year s presidential election. Tens of thousands of people from the Middle East, Afghanistan and Africa have arrived in Austria in the past two years, raising public spending on social benefits and fuelling support for policy makers who advocate cutting migration.

Russian court told that oil boss gave minister $2 million in a brown bag,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Russian court was told on Tuesday that a close ally of President Vladimir Putin personally handed the country s then economy minister $2 million in cash inside a lockable brown bag as part of an elaborate bribery sting. Former Economy Minister Alexei Ulyukayev is on trial on charges of extorting the $2 million bribe from Igor Sechin, the head of state-owned oil company Rosneft, in exchange for Ulyukayev approving a business deal. In the courtroom, a state prosecutor read out the transcript of a secret recording of a late-night meeting between Sechin and Ulyukayev on Nov. 14 last year at the Rosneft offices in Moscow, when prosecutors say the money was handed over.  Sechin, who was cooperating with law enforcement officials, was wearing a wire to gather evidence. Ulyukayev says he was framed after having been lured to what he said was an innocent meeting to discuss Rosneft. The case has thrust into the open simmering tensions between rival Kremlin clans   a spectacle rarely seen in public in the 17 years since Putin first became president. Sechin, one of Putin s closest lieutenants, is part of a powerful faction in the Kremlin that favors greater state control over the economy. They have clashed with economic liberals in the government, a group that included Ulyukayev, whose arrest is seen as weakening the latter group s hand.  In the transcript read out in court on Tuesday, Sechin is quoted asking someone to bring some tea and  a little basket with sausage , a reference to a gift he gave Ulyukayev. In another fragment read out by the prosecutor, Sechin is cited as telling Ulyukayev:  Sorry it took a while. I was on a business trip and going here and there while putting together the amount. Consider the mission accomplished. There you go   take it. And this key just in case. And take the basket too.  The funds were handed over inside a lockable brown bag along with a key and the basket, the state prosecutor said. When agents from Russia s Federal Security Service swooped on Ulyukayev as he emerged from the meeting, the minister told agents that the bag he was carrying in the boot of his car contained some  good wine  given to him by Sechin, a state prosecutor told the court.  When agents opened the bag with a key which Ulyukayev said Sechin had given him, they found 200 bundles of $100 bills, the prosecutor said. The basket was also found in the boot.  Ulyukayev s hands were also found to be contaminated with a tracing agent that the bag had been marked with, the prosecutor said. ",worldnews,"September 5, 2017 ",1

Xi urges BRICS grouping to push for more 'just' international order,"XIAMEN, China (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday urged BRICS nations to deepen coordination on global matters, and push for a more  just  world order, by boosting representation for emerging and developing countries in international bodies.  Reiterating that emerging and developing markets have been the primary engine of global growth, Xi called for a bigger role for BRICS in speeding economic governance reforms and promoting trade, especially as rising risks veil a global recovery.  BRICS countries should push for a more just and reasonable international order,  Xi told a summit of the grouping, which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.  We should work together to address global challenges.  In his closing remarks, Xi urged the grouping to battle for more  representation power  for emerging and developing countries, which some analysts say are often under-represented in global institutions such as the World Bank, by comparison with the dominance of the United States and Western Europe.  The summit in the southeastern city of Xiamen has given host China its latest chance to position itself as a bulwark of globalization in the face of U.S. President Donald Trump s  America First  agenda. Xi appeared to rebuke the United States s resistance to international pacts - including the Paris climate accord - in a separate speech earlier on Tuesday to leaders of BRICS and other developing countries.    Multilateral trade negotiations make progress only with great difficulty and the implementation of the Paris Agreement has met with resistance,  Xi said.   Some countries have become more inward-looking, and their desire to participate in global development cooperation has decreased.   In talks on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Trump has sought improved terms for the United States, under threat of leaving the pact, and has said he will withdraw his country from the Paris climate accord. Xi gave $500 million for a South-South cooperation fund to help other developing countries tackle famine, refugees, climate change and public health challenges, besides an earlier $80-million summit pledge to support BRICS cooperation. Egypt, Guinea, Tajikistan, Thailand and Mexico joined the three-day summit as observer nations, and Xi called for a  BRICS Plus  plan to potentially expand the bloc, although no new member has been formally announced. Xi lauded smooth progress in the grouping s cooperation in areas such as anti-terrorism and internet security.  Leaders from the BRICS countries are determined to work toward another  golden decade ,  he added.   ",worldnews,"September 5, 2017 ",1
Venezuelan opposition pins hopes on elections as protests falter,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela s opposition is shifting its focus to forthcoming state elections as protests aimed at ousting President Nicolas Maduro have subsided following the installation of an all-powerful, pro-government legislative body. Four months of violent demonstrations in which at least 125 people were killed have all but stopped due to fatigue among protesters and disillusionment at seeing the ruling Socialist Party cement vast powers despite the concerted opposition push.  Most opposition leaders say October s elections for governors in all the country s 23 states now represent the best means to keep pressuring Maduro, providing a chance to win some of the governorships at stake and an opportunity for a protest vote to demonstrate the president s unpopularity. The opposition, which boycotted the elections for the Constituent Assembly, accused electoral authorities of inflating turn-out figures for the July 30 vote. There are few options available for adversaries of Maduro, who maintains control over the OPEC nation despite widespread public anger about triple-digit inflation and chronic shortages of basic goods.  Venezuelans are fighting against a continued rupture of the constitutional order,  said opposition leader Henrique Capriles, who is governor of Miranda state but who is not running in next month s election and who is barred from holding public office once his term expires. Nevertheless he urged Venezuelans to vote in the elections.  If you abstain, then it s more difficult to bring about the political change that all Venezuelans want,  Capriles told reporters. Capriles has called his own barring from office - because of alleged irregularities in managing public funds - a Socialist Party move to sideline him. Governorships provide little in the way of a platform to directly challenge Maduro. But they are coveted by politicians because they offer launching pads for political careers and the possibility to channel state resources toward political allies.  The opposition s participation in next month s poll ensures it will have witnesses at voting stations and at the election council headquarters. Opposition coalition leaders say that should allow them to quickly identify any attempt to alter results. However, some who spent months on the streets with the encouragement of opposition leaders, especially young members of a self-styled  Resistance  movement, feel betrayed. They say turning attention so quickly to the election legitimizes what they view as Maduro s authoritarianism and insults the memory of slain protesters. They also see a contradiction with the opposition s decision to boycott July s  vote for the Constituent Assembly. Maduro pushed for the creation of the assembly, which is meant to rewrite the constitution but which has no formal check on its powers, saying it would restore stability to a country in turmoil over the widespread anti-government protests.  It has broadly supplanted the Congress, which the opposition won control of in a 2015 landslide vote. Small opposition party Vente Venezuela and its founder Maria Corina Machado, who has a high profile in the media but limited influence, broke with the opposition s Democratic Unity coalition over its decision to join next month s vote.  The main opposition parties have nominated candidates and opinion polls show that in a free and fair vote they would likely take a majority, compared to just three governorships they won in 2012. But the Socialist Party-controlled Constituent Assembly may bar some of them from running or from holding office if they win.  Last week, the assembly said it would seek the prosecution of opposition leaders for treason for attempting to block international financing for Maduro s government and for allegedly seeking a military intervention against him. Government leaders say the end of the protests is evidence the Constituent Assembly has brought peace to the country. They add that the opposition s decision to register candidates is a sign they believe in the electoral system despite their complaints of fraud.  The Constituent Assembly has calmed the country,  said assembly president Delcy Rodriguez.  As soon as it was inaugurated, Venezuela returned to tranquility.   Maduro says the country is a victim of an  economic war  by the opposition, and insists the assembly is a symbol of Venezuela s vibrant democracy. The opposition took to the streets in late March to protest a Supreme Court ruling that briefly allowed it to assume the powers of Congress, and maintained near daily rallies until the end of July. By then, street mobilizations were in decline and what had initially been massive marches steadily gave way to violent clashes between security forces and small groups of hooded demonstrators throwing rocks and at times vandalizing property. Recent opposition rallies have attracted only a few hundred people. U.S. President Donald Trump has imposed sanctions on top ruling Socialist Party officials, in some cases for their participation in the Constituent Assembly, while the European Union and most Latin American nations condemned the body. Maduro has acquired the reputation as a dictator around the world, said opposition leader Freddy Guevara in an interview in August broadcast on the Internet, adding that street protests were crucial in shifting public opinion.  I m convinced that we have to confront the dictatorship in any situation that we can,  said Guevara.  ",worldnews,"September 5, 2017 ",1
Spain pushes EU to adopt restrictive measures against Venezuela,"MADRID (Reuters) - Spain is pushing for the European Union to adopt restrictive measures against members of the Venezuelan government as a way of encouraging a return to constitutional order in the crisis-hit country, the Spanish foreign ministry said on Tuesday. The head of Venezuela s opposition-led congress, Julio Borges, visited Spain on Tuesday to meet Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy as part of a European tour seeking support against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Maduro s government has been criticized by the United Nations, Washington and other governments for failing to allow the entry of foreign aid to ease an economic crisis, while it overrides congress and jails hundreds of opponents.  Against the progressive worsening of the situation in Venezuela, the Spanish government is pushing ... for the adoption of restrictive, individual and selective measures, which don t hurt the Venezuelan population,  the ministry said in a statement. The Spanish government was working with its partners in the EU on these measures and was in constant contact with other Latin American countries, the ministry said. A foreign ministry spokesman did not say what the measures would be. After the meeting with Borges, the ministry underlined Spain s support for a peaceful, democratic solution and called for the release of all political prisoners. Spain s foreign minister, Alfonso Dastis, also met representatives of human rights activist Lilian Tintori, the wife of Venezuela s best-known detained political leader, who was barred from flying out of the country to join Borges on the tour. Venezuela s foreign minister, Jorge Arreaza, criticized the opposition leaders  meeting with Rajoy, saying they were unpatriotic in backing sanctions that he said would hurt the Venezuelan economy.  @marianorajoy assaults Venezuelan dignity, representing the worst colonial past, defeated and expelled by our Liberators,  Arreaza tweeted on Tuesday. The Venezuelan opposition won control of congress in 2015. But Maduro s loyalist Supreme Court has tossed out every major law it has passed as the oil-rich country slips deeper into a recession exacerbated by triple-digit inflation and acute shortages of food and medicines. Maduro has said he faces an  armed insurrection  designed to end socialism in Latin America and let a U.S.-backed business elite get its hands on the OPEC nation s crude reserves.

EU executive to raise pressure on Poland on Wednesday: sources,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission will ask EU member states on Wednesday to take a stand on whether the Polish government is abusing democratic standards, three sources told Reuters, as the bloc  steps up pressure on Warsaw. Poland has been in a deepening dispute with Brussels and other European Union states over upholding the rule of law since the nationalist-minded, eurosceptic Law and Justice (PiS) party won power in late 2015.  PiS denies that it is undermining democratic standards in the largest ex-communist EU country but Brussels - along with many other member states, the Polish opposition and rights activists - has been sounding the alarm for months.  After German Chancellor Angela Merkel offered rare public criticism of Warsaw last week, the bloc is seen more likely to head toward an unprecedented punishment of Warsaw. Three sources said the executive Commission will ask all EU states on Wednesday to discuss the situation in Poland again at a ministerial meeting in Brussels on Sept. 25. The meeting is not expected to trigger the so-called Article 7 punitive procedure yet but the discussion will measure the willingness of the other 27 EU countries to move ahead. At the heart of the dispute is a PiS reform of the judiciary in Poland which puts the courts and judges under tighter government control.  ",worldnews,"September 5, 2017 ",1
Germany warns against Turkey travel after spate of arrests,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany s foreign ministry has warned its citizens traveling to Turkey that they risk arbitrary detention even in tourist areas, revising its travel advice after a spate of arrests of German citizens that it considers politically motivated. The change in travel advice, issued on Tuesday, marks a new low in relations between the NATO allies and is a blow for the tourist sector, which has already been hit by militant attacks and the fall-out from last year s failed coup attempt in Turkey. The trigger for the sharpening of the travel advice was the detention at the coastal Antalya airport last week of two Germans, one of whom has since been released. Berlin believes they, like 11 others, were detained for political reasons.  There is a risk of similar detentions in all parts of Turkey, including in tourist regions,  the new advice reads. It falls short of a formal travel warning, issued for war-afflicted countries like Afghanistan, Iraq or Yemen, which would make obtaining travel insurance harder.  We can t take from tourists the decision whether to travel or not,  Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said.  But we have described in detail what you should be aware of before you go.  Large numbers of European citizens have been caught up in the crackdown following last year s failed coup against President Tayyip Erdogan, in the wake of which tens of thousands of Turks have been imprisoned on  terrorism  charges.  Critics say the crackdown amounts to an undiscriminating purge of Erdogan s opponents. ",worldnews,"September 5, 2017 ",1
"Syrian army, allies break Islamic State siege in eastern city","BEIRUT (Reuters) - Syrian government forces on Tuesday reached troops besieged for years by Islamic State in the eastern city of Deir al-Zor, the militants  last major stronghold in Syria, the army said. Tanks and troops pressed quickly toward a government-held enclave in the city, where Islamic State has trapped thousands of civilians and Syrian soldiers since 2014. The advance has opened a land route linking that territory to the outside. The advance into strategic prize Deir al-Zor, a city on the Euphrates river and once the center of Syria s oil industry, is a significant victory for President Bashar al-Assad against Islamic State and another stinging blow to the group. The group is being fought in Syria by government forces, backed by allies Iran and Russia, and separately by a U.S.-led alliance of Arab and Kurdish fighters. In Iraq, the jihadists were driven out of their Mosul stronghold earlier this year. Islamic State still holds half of Deir al-Zor city and much of the province, however, as well as parts of its former stronghold Raqqa to the northwest, where the U.S.-backed offensive is being fought.  Our armed forces and allies, with support from Syrian and Russian warplanes, achieved the second phase of their operations in the Syrian desert,  Syria s military said.  They have managed to break the siege.  State media and a war monitoring group said advancing forces had linked up with the besieged troops at a garrison on the western edge of the city. Footage on Syrian state TV showed soldiers cheering near the garrison. State media said residents in government-held parts of the city were celebrating the advance. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said a nearby military air base and three districts remained under siege by IS. Battles still raged around the city, the British-based war monitor said. Deir al-Zor governor Mohammed Ibrahim Samra told Reuters that government troops were also pushing toward the air base.  The forces have begun to lift the siege,  he said.  Our residents have been waiting for this moment ... forces are (trying to) break the siege on the military airport as well.       The coming days will see the clearing of Deir al-Zor city (of militants)  and advances on nearby countryside under Islamic State control, Samra added. Assad congratulated the troops in a statement from his office. The army and its allies made rapid advances in recent days pushing through Islamic State lines with the help of heavy artillery and Russian air strikes. A Russian warship in the Mediterranean sea fired cruise missiles at Islamic State positions near Deir al-Zor to boost the offensive, Russia s defense ministry said. The city has been cut off from government-held Syria since 2013, after rebel groups rose up against Assad during the first flush of Syria s six-year war. Islamic State then overran rebel positions and encircled the army enclave and nearby air base in 2014. The United Nations said in August it estimated 93,000 civilians were living there in  extremely difficult  conditions. During the siege, high-altitude air drops have supplied them. Deir al-Zor lies southeast of Islamic State s former base in Raqqa. Hemmed in on all sides, Islamic State fighters have fallen back on footholds downstream of Deir al-Zor in towns near the Iraq border. The Deir al-Zor gains  form an important launching pad for expanding military operations in the area,  the army said. For Damascus, the latest advance caps months of steady progress as the army and its allies turned from victories over rebels in western Syria to push east against Islamic State.  The eastwards march has on occasion brought them into conflict with U.S.-backed forces. Still, the rival campaigns have mostly stayed out of each other s way, and the U.S.-led coalition has stressed it is not seeking war with Assad. In a statement on Sunday an alliance of Iran-backed Shi ite militias allied to Damascus, including Lebanon s Hezbollah, accused Washington of trying to hinder the advance to Deir al-Zor. An official in the pro-Assad alliance said senior Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps commander Qassem Soleimani was closely monitoring fighting, a sign of Iran s close military involvement.

Polish president says 'multi-speed' EU will lead to break-up of bloc,"KRYNICA-ZDROJ, Poland (Reuters) - The European Union will become less attractive to some member states if it implements a  multi-speed  vision and the bloc will ultimately break up, Polish President Andrzej Duda said on Tuesday. Deeper eurozone integration is sometimes called a  multi-speed  Europe because it would create different speeds of convergence within the 28-member bloc. Poland and other eastern EU states say they fear it could reduce their influence, financial support and competitiveness.  A division of the Union into a multi-speed union will not be beneficial ... politically, will not be beneficial economically,  Duda told an economic forum in Poland s southern city of Krynica-Zdroj.   In my opinion it will ultimately lead to a break-up of the European Union,  he said, adding that all member states would be hurt in such a scenario. Europe-wide polls show Poles are one of the most pro-EU societies, even though they overwhelmingly oppose adopting the euro currency.Duda also said EU support could falter in member states that do not participate in deeper eurozone integration. The remark appeared to suggest he believes EU support could fall in Poland. Duda is an ally of the ruling eurosceptic Law and Justice (PiS) party.  If EU membership becomes less attractive for countries that are thrown out of the first decision-making circle, then this moment in my opinion will be the actual beginning of the end of the union,  Duda said.  Sooner or later the societies of states that today view the EU positively ... will feel rejected and support for the EU will decline, which will result in further Brexits,  Duda said. Since PiS won an election in 2015, the government has clashed with the European Commission over issues ranging from its refusal to accept EU migrant relocation quotas to the ruling conservatives  tightening grip on the judiciary and media. French President Emmanuel Macron, one of the most vocal supporters of deeper integration within the euro zone, said in August that Warsaw was moving in the opposite direction to Europe on numerous issues and would not be able to dictate Europe s future. Poland rejected the accusations, saying Macron was inexperienced and arrogant. Macron also wants the EU to tighten its rules on the employment abroad of labor from low-pay nations, which could threaten hundreds of thousands of jobs performed by Polish employees in richer western EU states.

Romanian defense minister quits over communications mixup,"BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Romania s Defence Minister Adrian Tutuianu said he had resigned on Tuesday after his ministry said it was unable to pay military and defense staff wages in full, only to be contradicted within hours by the finance ministry. The defense ministry said in a statement that it had run out of funds to cover salaries for its staff and would pay them in stages pending a consolidated budget revision planned for September. The finance ministry later contradicted the statement, saying no ministry was facing wage funds shortages.  I have handed in my resignation for the lack of communication,  Tutuianu told private television station Antena3. Prime Minister Mihai Tudose will send the resignation to the president later on Tuesday. The defense minister position carries a lot of responsibility as NATO member Romania has committed to spend 2 percent of its gross domestic product on defense every year for the next nine years, a military procurement plan for 2017-2026 showed. Romania, a country of 20 million people, hosts a U.S. ballistic missile defense station and has sent troops to Iraq and Afghanistan. ",worldnews,"September 5, 2017 ",1
North Korea warns of 'more gift packages' for United States,"GENEVA (Reuters) - North Korea is ready to send  more gift packages  to the United States, one of its top diplomats said on Tuesday, dismissing the international uproar over his country s latest and biggest nuclear weapons test. Han Tae Song, ambassador of the Democratic People s Republic of Korea (DPRK) to the United Nations in Geneva, was addressing the U.N.-sponsored Conference on Disarmament two days after his country detonated its sixth nuclear test explosion.   I am proud of saying that just two days ago on the third of September, DPRK successfully carried out a hydrogen bomb test for intercontinental ballistic rocket under its plan for building a strategic nuclear force,  Han told the Geneva forum.  The recent self-defense measures by my country, DPRK, are a  gift package  addressed to none other than the U.S.,  Han said.  The U.S. will receive more  gift packages  from my country as long as its relies on reckless provocations and futile attempts to put pressure on the DPRK,  he added without elaborating. U.S. disarmament ambassador Robert Wood sought to turn the tables on Han by using his language against him.  With regard to the so-called gift packages that the North is presenting, my recommendation to the North would be, instead of spending inordinate amounts of money on nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, that it give its people the gift package of peace with their neighbors, economic development and an opportunity to rejoin the family of nations.  Han said military measures being taken by North Korea were  an exercise of restraint and justified self-defense right  to counter  the ever-growing and decade-long U.S. nuclear threat and hostile policy aimed at isolating my country.  Pressure or sanctions will never work on my country,  Han declared, adding:  The DPRK will never under any circumstances put its nuclear deterrence on the negotiating table.  Wood said that North Korea had defied the international community once again with its test.   We look forward to working with our partners in the (U.N. Security) Council with regard to a new resolution that will put some of the strongest sanctions possible on the DPRK,  he told the conference.  Advances in the regime s nuclear and missile program are a threat to us all ... now is the time to say tests, threats and destabilizing actions will no longer be tolerated,  Wood said.  It can no longer be business as usual with this regime.   The White House said on Monday President Donald Trump had agreed  in principle  to scrap a warhead weight limit on South Korea s missiles following the North s latest test.     The United States accused North Korea s trading partners of aiding its nuclear ambitions and said Pyongyang was  begging for war . ",worldnews,"September 5, 2017 ",1

Turkey to start first foreign aid distribution in Myanmar,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey said it will start the first foreign deliveries of aid on Wednesday to northwestern Myanmar, where hundreds of people have been killed and nearly 125,000 have fled over the border to Bangladesh in the last 10 days. A spokesman for President Tayyip Erdogan, who has described the violence against Rohingya Muslims there as genocide, said the deliveries were approved after Erdogan spoke by phone with Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Tuesday. Spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said 1,000 tonnes of food, clothes and medicine would be distributed by military helicopters.  He said Myanmar had given approval for officials from Turkey s state aid agency TIKA to enter the country and deliver the assistance, in coordination with local authorities in Rakhine state. Suu Kyi has faced increasing pressure from countries with Muslim populations to halt the violence against Rohingya Muslims which has prompted their flight to Bangladesh. Reuters reporters saw hundreds more exhausted Rohingya arriving on boats near the Bangladeshi border village of Shamlapur on Tuesday, suggesting the exodus was far from over. Erdogan told Suu Kyi that the violence against the Rohingya was violation of human rights and that the Muslim world was deeply concerned, Turkish presidential sources said. Indonesian foreign minister Retno Marsudi, in Dhaka to discuss aid for the fleeing Rohingya, met her Bangladeshi counterpart, Abul Hassan Mahmood Ali, a day after urging Suu Kyi and Myanmar army chief Min Aung Hlaing to halt the bloodshed. The latest violence in Myanmar s northwestern Rakhine state began on Aug. 25, when Rohingya insurgents attacked dozens of police posts and an army base. The ensuing clashes and a military counter-offensive have killed hundreds. Erdogan, with his roots in political Islam, has long strived to take a position of leadership among the world s Muslim community. On Friday, he said it was Turkey s moral responsibility to take a stand over the events in Myanmar. Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu will travel to Bangladesh  on Wednesday evening and hold meetings on Thursday, Turkish sources said.  ",worldnews,"September 5, 2017 ",1

Afghan officials investigate helicopter wedding deaths,"CHARIKAR, Afghanistan (Reuters) - Afghan authorities are investigating an incident in which two people were killed and two others wounded when a helicopter appeared to come under fire from guests at a wedding party near Kabul and fired back, local officials said. Kabul police spokesman Basir Mujahid said the circumstances of the incident in Qarbagh district outside the capital Kabul late on Monday were still being investigated and it was unclear if the victims were members of the wedding party or not. Wedding parties and similar gatherings in Afghanistan, where many people outside major city centers carry guns, sometimes feature guests firing into the air in celebration. If confirmed, the deaths would be the latest in a series that has seen at least 24 civilians killed in Afghan and U.S. air strikes over the past week. Afghan officials said the helicopter came from the NATO-led Resolute Support coalition but there was no immediate confirmation from Resolute Support headquarters in Kabul that U.S. or coalition aircraft were involved in the incident.   We are aware of reports, but have no further information at this time,  a spokesman said in an emailed statement. Last week, local officials said at least 13 civilians were killed in an Afghan air force strike in the western province of Heart, while another 11 were killed in a U.S. strike in the eastern Loghar province. [nL4N1LF3TJ] [nL4N1LG4VP] Fears have grown that civilian casualties will rise as a result of an increase in air strikes in Afghanistan following the U.S. decision to step up military action against the Taliban and other insurgents. Already in the first half of the year, United Nations figures showed a 43 percent spike in civilian casualties, with 95 killed and 137 wounded as the pace of air operations increased even before U.S. President Donald Trump announced his new strategy in Afghanistan.

India's Modi heads to Myanmar as Rohingya refugee crisis worsens,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will discuss rising violence in Myanmar s western Rakhine state during a visit that begins on Tuesday, and push for greater progress on long-running Indian infrastructure projects, officials said.  India seeks to boost economic ties with resource-rich Myanmar, with which it shares a 1,600-km (1,000-mile) border, to counter Chinese influence and step up connectivity with a country it considers its gateway to Southeast Asia. Two-way trade has grown to around $2.2 billion as India courted Myanmar following the gradual end of military rule, but Indian-funded projects have moved slowly. Modi s promises to  Act East  and cement ties with India s eastern neighbor have slipped even as China has strengthened its influence. His first bilateral visit comes amid a spike in violence in Rakhine, after a military counter-offensive against insurgents killed at least 400 people and triggered the exodus of nearly 90,000 villagers to Bangladesh since Aug. 25. The violence could hit development of a transport corridor that begins in Rakhine, with the Indian-built port of Sittwe and includes road links to India s remote northeast, analysts said.  It s going to be a very vexed and complex issue,  said Tridivesh Singh Maini, a New Delhi-based expert on ties with Myanmar.  You need to play it very smartly. You need to make it clear that Rakhine violence has regional implications... but India will not get into saying,  This is how you should resolve it.  Last month, India said it wanted to deport 40,000 Rohingya refugees who left Myanmar in previous years. Modi arrives from China late on Tuesday in the capital Naypyidaw to meet President Htin Kyaw on a three-day visit. New Delhi believes the best way to reduce tension in Rakhine is through development efforts, such as the Kaladan transport project there, said Indian foreign ministry official Sripriya Ranganathan.      We are very confident that once that complete corridor is functional, there will be a positive impact on the situation in the state,  she told reporters. Modi will meet Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi and visit the heritage city of Bagan and a Hindu temple. The countries share close cultural ties, and several in Myanmar trace their roots to India.  Modi will also talk up a trilateral highway project connecting India s northeast with Myanmar and Thailand.  There is a fear that China is already going full steam ahead,  said Udai Bhanu Singh of Delhi think-tank, the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses.  From the Indian side, there has been some laxity.   Singh said India could offer Myanmar help in building its navy and coastguard, while Myanmar would seek assurances that India was a reliable economic partner and an alternative power to Beijing.

Vietnam protests over Chinese live-fire drills in South China Sea,"HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam on Tuesday issued a strong condemnation of Chinese military live-fire exercises in the disputed South China Sea, amid rising tension between the two countries. The Maritime Safety Administration of China s southern province of Hainan, which oversees the South China Sea, said last month there would be live fire drills around the Paracel Islands, which Vietnam claims, until September 2.  Vietnam strongly objects this action by China and seriously requests China to respect Vietnam s sovereignty over the Hoang Sa (Paracel) archipelagos,  Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang said in a statement.  Vietnam once again asserts that (we) will resolutely protect our sovereignty and our legitimate rights and interests in the East Sea (South China Sea) through peaceful measures that are suitable with international laws,  the statement said. China claims nearly all the South China Sea, through which an estimated $3 trillion in international trade passes each year. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan also have claims. Tension between China and neighboring Vietnam is at its highest in three years over the disputed waters. Vietnam suspended oil drilling in offshore waters that are also claimed by China in July under pressure from Beijing. China has appeared uneasy at Vietnam s efforts to rally Southeast Asian countries over the South China Sea as well as at its growing defense relationships with the United States, Japan and India.

"Don't leave Saudi-backed commission to probe Yemen abuses, U.N. says","GENEVA (Reuters) - The United Nations must take over responsibility for investigating rights violations in Yemen s civil war as the country s government is not up to the job, the global body s human rights office said.  In a report published on Tuesday, the office challenged the U.N. Human Rights Council, which meets this month, to agree to look into atrocities committed during what it called an  entirely man-made catastrophe . The 47-country council has shied away from that task for two years, leaving the job to Yemen s National Commission, which reports to President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. He is backed by a Saudi-led coalition that is one of the combatants.  I ...join you in asking why the members of the Human Rights Council are not taking their responsibility and their membership to this body seriously,  the office s head of Middle East and North Africa, Mohammad Ali Alnsour, told a news conference. Yemen is mired in a war that has killed at least 10,000 people over the past two-and-a-half years, according to U.N. figures. Widespread hunger and internal displacement and an unprecedented cholera epidemic have led aid agencies to describe it as one of the world s worst humanitarian disasters. Alnsour said this was the third time the Council was being asked to set up an investigation.   That would really put pressure on the conflicting parties to adhere to the rules and the obligations under humanitarian law,  he said. The U.N. report said Yemen s National Commission was detrimentally affected by  political constraints .  The perceived partiality of the National Commission and its limited access have prevented it from executing its mandate comprehensively,  it said.  In addition... (it) appears to be lacking any instrument, or mandate, that would enable it to channel its findings into a credible accountability mechanism.  The head of the U.N. World Food Programme told Reuters on Monday that Saudi Arabia should fund the entire humanitarian aid budget for Yemen, or stop the war, or both   unusually direct criticism of a major U.N. donor. The U.N. report said at least 5,144 civilians were documented as being killed between March 2015 and Aug. 30, 2017, with the Saudi-led coalition responsible for more than half. Its air strikes were the leading cause of civilian and child casualties, the report said.  It also blamed the coalition for stoking a food crisis that has left 7.3 million on the brink of famine.

"In Athens, Macron to urge renewal of EU democracy","PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron will go to the Athens hill considered the birthplace of democracy to urge fellow Europeans to tackle the democratic crisis he believes the continent faces, his aides said on Tuesday. Macron, who swept to power on a pro-EU platform last May, has made reforming the euro zone and EU institutions battered by a series of crises - from the economy, to immigration and Brexit - a priority of his mandate.  It s a symbol of a new chapter (for Europe),  a French presidency official said of the speech Macron plans to give on Thursday evening on the hill of Pnyx, where ancient Greeks gathered to host popular assemblies.  We have gone through a financial crisis and a sort of confidence crisis, Greece knows that, it suffered from them. The president wants to show that Europe must be rebuilt democratically,  the official said. Macron will promote his campaign proposal to launch  democratic conventions  - or public debates - in European countries to discuss the future of the EU. The president, whose popularity ratings have slumped at home following a series of unpopular measures including proposals to cut public spending and welfare benefits, also wants to make institutions governing Europe s single currency more democratic. He wants a euro zone finance minister to manage a common budget that would be accountable to a euro zone parliament, but that proposal has met with robust resistance abroad, notably in Berlin. During a two-day trip ending on Friday, Macron will be accompanied by around 40 French business leaders, including from blue-chip firms Total, L Oreal, Sanofi, Engie and Vinci. After a German-French consortium won a majority stake in Thessaloniki Port last June, France is keen to push its companies to invest in Greek infrastructure, energy and the agri-food business. French officials also want to avoid more strategic sectors of the Greek economy from falling into non-European hands after China s COSCO Shipping bought a 51 percent stake in Piraeus Port, Greece s biggest, for 280.5 million euros.  It poses a sovereignty problem, it s kind of a European failure,  the French official said.  In June, Macron urged the European Commission to come up with a system for screening investments in strategic sectors from third countries, something some other western European nations have supported. But smaller eastern and southern European economies that have benefited from Chinese investments have rejected any steps against Beijing.      ",worldnews,"September 5, 2017 ",1

Malaysia summons Myanmar ambassador over violence in Rakhine State,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia on Tuesday summoned Myanmar s ambassador to express displeasure over violence in Myanmar s Rakhine State, which has displaced nearly 125,000 Rohingya Muslims. Foreign Minister Anifah Aman said the latest incidents of violence showed that the Myanmar government had made  little, if any  progress in finding a peaceful solution to problems facing the Rohingya minority, most of whom live in the northwest Myanmar state near the Bangladeshi border.  Given these developments, Malaysia believes that the matter of sustained violence and discrimination against the Rohingyas should be elevated to a higher international forum,  Anifah said in a statement. Muslim-majority Malaysia has been particularly outspoken in its concern about the plight of the Rohingya. Myanmar says its security forces are fighting a legitimate campaign against  terrorists  responsible for a string of attacks on police posts and the army since last October. The latest violence began on Aug. 25, when Rohingya insurgents attacked dozens of police posts and an army base. In a separate statement, Malaysia s foreign affairs ministry issued a travel advisory asking Malaysians to defer all non-essential travel to Rakhine State, and for Malaysians in Myanmar to  take all necessary precautions  and be aware of the security situation.

Merkel wants EU to consider halting Turkish accession talks after vote,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Tuesday that Turkey was fast abandoning the rule of law and vowed to push her EU partners to consider suspending or ending its accession talks at a meeting in October. Less than three weeks before a German national election, she spelled out her intentions clearly to the Bundestag lower house of parliament after sharpening her rhetoric on Sunday and saying Turkey should not become an EU member. Those comments, made in a televised debate with her Social Democrat (SPD) election rival, drew charges of populism from Ankara. It was the latest of a series of spats between Merkel and President Tayyip Erdogan over the last two years which has led to a serious deterioration in relations.  Turkey is moving away from the path of the rule of law at a very fast speed,  Merkel said, adding her government would do everything it could to secure the release of Germans detained in Turkey, who Berlin says are innocent. The Foreign Ministry said last week 12 German citizens, four of them with dual citizenship, had been detained in Turkey on political charges. One has since been released. The ministry updated its travel advice on Tuesday and said that  incomprehensible  arrests were taking place all over Turkey, including regions frequented by tourists.  Venting her growing frustration, Merkel said a rethink of Germany s and the EU s relations with Turkey was needed.  We will also - and I will suggest this takes place at the EU meeting in October - discuss future relations with Turkey, including the question of suspending or ending talks on accession,  she said.  I will push for a decisive stand ... But we need to coordinate and work with our partners,  she said, adding that it would damage the EU if Erdogan saw member states embroiled in an argument.  That would dramatically weaken Europe s position.  Although Turkey s foreign minister has said EU membership remains a strategic goal, the EU has turned very skeptical - especially since Erdogan s crackdown on opponents after a failed coup in July 2016.  A European Commission spokesman said on Monday Turkey was taking  giant strides  away from Europe. Although her conservative party has long opposed Turkish membership of the bloc, Merkel has staked a good deal on maintaining relations with its NATO ally.  She has repeatedly defended an EU-Turkey migrant deal she championed last year because it helped to stem the flow of refugees fleeing war in the Middle East to western Europe.  Merkel said despite her own reservations, she had gone along with EU accession talks agreed by her SPD predecessor, Gerhard Schroeder, mainly to ensure continuity in foreign policy. Erdogan accuses Germany of harboring plotters behind the 2016 coup attempt. Turkey has arrested about 50,000 people in its purges of state institutions and the armed forces. Ankara says the crackdown is necessary to ensure national security but many Western countries and human rights groups say it is an attempt by Erdogan to stifle all dissent. Erdogan also won sweeping new powers in a referendum in April. In the runup to the German election little divides the main parties, who currently share power in a grand coalition, on Turkey. SPD Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel in July said Germans should be careful if they traveled to Turkey and threatened steps that could hurt investment there.     ",worldnews,"September 5, 2017 ",1
China seeks to silence critics at U.N. forums: rights body report,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Beijing is waging a campaign of harassment against Chinese activists who seek to testify at the United Nations about repression, while the world body sometimes turns a blind eye or is even complicit, Human Rights Watch said. In a report released on Tuesday, the group said China restricts travel of activists, or photographs or films them if they do come to the U.N. in Geneva to cooperate with human rights watchdogs scrutinizing its record.  What we found is that China is systematically trying to undermine the U.N. s ability to defend human rights, certainly in China but also globally,  Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, told Reuters.  This comes at a point where domestically China s repression is the worst it has been since the Tiananmen Square democracy movement (in 1989). So there is much to hide and China clearly attaches enormous importance to muting criticism of its increasingly abysmal human rights record.  Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang dismissed the report s accusations as  groundless , saying Beijing was playing an active role in the United Nations  human rights work.  We urge the relevant organization to remove their tinted lenses and objectively and justly view China s human rights development,  he told a regular briefing. Rolando Gomez, U.N. Human Rights Council spokesman, said the office did its best to protect all participants and had been  extremely vigilant in addressing and investigating all acts and perceived acts of intimidation, threats, and attacks brought to its attention , regardless of which state committed them. The U.N. system offers one of the few remaining channels for Chinese activists to express their views, the New York-based rights group said. Its report,  The Costs of International Advocacy: China s Interference in United Nations Human Rights Mechanisms,  is based on 55 interviews.  NIP-IT-IN-THE-BUD STRATEGY   (Chinese President) Xi Jinping seems to have adopted a  nip it in the bud  strategy with respect to activism at home, but increasingly abroad. That s one of our messages, China s repression isn t stopping at its borders these days,  Roth said. In China, activists have  decreasing space safe  from intimidation, arbitrary detention, and a legal system controlled by the Communist Party, the report said, decrying a crackdown on activists and lawyers since 2015.Some activists who have attended U.N. reviews of China s record have been punished on their return, it said. Others have their passports confiscated or are arrested before departure. When Xi addressed the U.N. in Geneva in January, the U.N. barred non-governmental organizations (NGOs) from attending, Human Rights Watch said.  Dolkun Isa, an ethnic Uighur rights activist originally from China, was attending a U.N. event in New York in April when U.N. security guards ejected him without explanation, despite his accreditation, it added. Jiang Tianyong, a prominent human rights lawyer, disappeared last November, months after meeting in Beijing with U.N. special rapporteur on poverty Philip Alston who has called for his release. Jiang, after being held incommunicado for six months, was  charged with subversion. At his trial last month he confessed, saying that he had been inspired to overthrow China s political system by workshops he had attended overseas.  So the signal is clear - don t you dare present an independent perspective to a U.N. investigator,  Roth said. ",worldnews,"September 5, 2017 ",1
Ex-Georgian leader risks extradition on return to Ukraine,"KIEV (Reuters) - Ukraine says it will review a request from Georgia to arrest and extradite former Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili, one of the most colorful and divisive figures in the politics of both countries, if he re-enters Ukraine in the next few days. Brought in to help drive reforms after the 2014 Ukrainian uprising that ousted a pro-Russian leader, Saakashvili has been at loggerheads with the Kiev authorities since quitting as governor of the Odessa region last year and accusing President Petro Poroshenko of abetting corruption. Stripped of Ukrainian citizenship while on a trip abroad, he  will try to re-enter Ukraine via the Polish border on Sunday, his staff and lawyers say, and expects to be greeted by supporters and lawmakers sympathetic to his cause. It is unclear how Ukrainian border guards will respond.  The justice ministry is sending the request from Georgia ... to Ukraine s general prosecutor for an extradition review,  Deputy Justice Minister Serhiy Petukhov told a news conference. Saakashvili s representative Olena Galabala said:  If there are any questions regarding the extradition of Saakashvili, then firstly they need to let him into Ukraine and then resolve this issue. Otherwise it looks like intimidation.  Saakashvili took power in Georgia after a peaceful pro-Western uprising, known as the Rose Revolution, in 2003. He was president at the time of a short and disastrous five-day war with Russia in 2008, a conflict that his critics argued was the result of his own miscalculations. The 49-year-old is now wanted on four separate criminal charges in Georgia, including abuse of office, which he says were trumped up for political reasons. Loathed by the Kremlin, Saakashvili was once a natural ally for Poroshenko after Moscow annexed Ukraine s Crimea region in 2014. But he has become one of the president s most vocal critics casting doubt on the Western-backed authorities  commitment to tackle entrenched corruption. Saakashvili has accused the Ukrainian authorities of using pressure tactics to deter him from returning to Kiev, where he has launched a campaign to unseat his former ally Poroshenko. Saakashvili s spokeswoman and his brother, David, were both questioned by authorities at the weekend.    In this way they re trying to influence me to change my mind about coming back,  Saakashvili said in a post on Facebook.  You know me very badly - this just further strengthens my resolve to defend Ukraine and Ukrainians from the dirty dealers and their lawlessness.  Interior ministry spokesman Artem Shevchenko said David Saakashvili s permission to reside in Ukraine had been annulled because his work permit had been withdrawn.  We didn t detain him. The Kiev police ensured the delivery of the Georgian citizen to the migration services,  he told news agency Interfax Ukraine. Poroshenko s office says Saakashvili failed to deliver change while governor of Odessa. They have also said his citizenship was withdrawn because he allegedly put false information on his registration form. Saakashvili says the decision was politically motivated. Saakashvili last year founded a party called the  Movement of New Forces, whose support is in the low single digits and  which has been seeking to unite reformist opposition forces.

Putin warns U.S. not to supply Ukraine with defensive weapons,"XIAMEN, China (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday that any decision by the United States to supply defensive weapons to Ukraine would fuel the conflict in eastern Ukraine and possibly prompt pro-Russian separatists to expand their campaign there. On a visit to Kiev last month, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said he was actively reviewing sending lethal weapons to Ukraine to help it defend itself, an option that previous U.S. president Barack Obama vetoed. Ukraine and Russia are at loggerheads over a war in eastern Ukraine between pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian government forces that has killed more than 10,000 people in three years. Kiev accuses Moscow of sending troops and heavy weapons to the region, which Russia denies.  Putin, answering a question after a BRICS summit in China about the possibility of the United States supplying Ukraine with heavy weapons, said it was for Washington to decide whom it sold or gave weapons to, but he warned against the move, something Kiev wants.   The delivery of weapons to a conflict zone doesn t help peacekeeping efforts, but only worsens the situation,  Putin told a news briefing.  Such a decision would not change the situation but the number of casualties could increase.  In comments likely to be interpreted as a veiled threat, Putin suggested that pro-Russian separatists were likely to respond by expanding their own campaign.  The self-declared (pro-Russian) republics (in eastern Ukraine) have enough weapons, including ones captured from the other side  said Putin.  It s hard to imagine how the self-declared republics would respond. Perhaps they would deploy weapons to other conflict zones.  Putin also said Russia intended to draft a resolution for consideration in the United Nations Security Council, suggesting armed U.N. peacekeepers be deployed to eastern Ukraine to help protect ceasefire monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) there.  It would help resolve the problem in eastern Ukraine,  said Putin, saying that a slew of preconditions would need to be met before any such deployment happened. ",worldnews,"September 5, 2017 ",1
Kidnapped Red Cross staff released in Afghanistan after seven months,"KABUL (Reuters) - Two Red Cross staff members kidnapped early this year in Afghanistan have been released, the International Committee of the Red Cross said on Tuesday. The two were abducted on Feb. 8 while delivering assistance in Jawzjan province, in the north of the country, on the border with Turkmenistan.  Six of their colleagues were killed in the attack, which prompted the ICRC to suspend operations in Afghanistan for a time.  We are relieved and grateful that our colleagues are now back with us unharmed, the ICRC head of delegation in Afghanistan, Monica Zanarelli, said in a statement. At the time of the attack, officials in the area blamed Islamic State gunmen but the ICRC said it would not comment on the identity of the abductors, their motives or details of the release. Kidnapping has been a major problem in Afghanistan for many years. Most victims are Afghans abducted for ransom but foreigners or Afghans working for foreign organizations have also been targeted.

"France appoints envoy to mediate between Qatar, Arab states","PARIS (Reuters) - France s foreign ministry said on Tuesday that it picked its former ambassador to Saudi Arabia as a special envoy to see how Paris could support mediation efforts in the rift between Qatar and several of its neighbors. Kuwait s Emir Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber has led mediation efforts to resolve the row, which began in early June when Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt cut political and trade ties with Qatar.  France, which has close ties with Egypt and the United Arab Emirates while also being a major arms supplier to Qatar and a key ally of Saudi Arabia, has been relatively discreet on the crisis, largely sticking to calls for calm.   I confirm that Bertrand Besancenot, diplomatic advisor to the government, will soon go to the region to evaluate the situation and the best ways to support the mediation and appease tensions between Qatar and its neighbors,  Foreign ministry spokeswoman Agnes Romatet-Espagne told reporters in a daily briefing.  Qatar s neighbors accuse it of supporting regional foe Iran and Islamists across the region, a charge Doha denies.   ",worldnews,"September 5, 2017 ",1
Malaysian police say they foiled attack on SEA Games closing ceremony,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysian police thwarted a plan by a member of the Islamic-State linked Abu Sayyaf militant group to attack the closing ceremony of the Southeast Asian Games in Kuala Lumpur last week, the top police official said on Tuesday. The suspected attacker, a 25-year-old Philippine national, had been involved in fighting, kidnapping and beheading of foreign hostages in the Philippines, Inspector-General of Police Mohamad Fuzi Harun said in a statement. The arrest will raise concern about increasing cooperation among militants within Southeast Asia and what governments fear is the spreading influence of Islamic State as it loses ground in the Middle East.. Mohamad Fuzi did not identify the suspect but said he had planned to attack the closing ceremony of the games at the Bukit Jalil National Stadium, as well as an Independence Day parade the next day. He gave no detail of the plans. The man was arrested in a raid on Aug. 30, the day of the ceremony, along with seven other suspected members of the hardline Abu Sayyaf, including another Philippine national. Authorities said earlier they had detained Philippine Abu Sayyaf leader Hajar Abdul Mubin, 25, also known as Abu Asrie, in the Aug. 30 raid.  Abu Asrie was arrested with six Malaysians and another Philippine national, aged between 20 and 52, police said earlier. Eleven other suspected militants, including nine foreigners, were picked up in a two-month security operation before the games. The arrests were the latest in a crackdown on militancy by Muslim-majority Malaysia. Since 2013, Malaysia has arrested more than 250 people on suspicion of links to Islamic State.     Among those picked up were two Iraqi brothers, aged 41 and 63, who were suspected to have served as commanders for Islamic State, Mohamad Fuzi said. They were working as technicians and were arrested in a Kuala Lumpur suburb on Aug. 11.  The Iraqis had arrived in Malaysia separately and were detained on information from foreign intelligence agencies, a Malaysian police source told Reuters.    One arrived last year, while the other came in early August. We re still investigating what their activities were in Malaysia,  said the source, who declined to be identified because he is not authorized to speak to media.  Others picked up in the sweep included suspects from Bangladesh, the Maldives, Indonesia and the Palestinian territories. Police counter-terrorism chief Ayob Khan Mydin Pitchay told Reuters the number of foreigners showed the growing Islamic State threat in the region.    ",worldnews,"September 5, 2017 ",1
"UK police arrest four, including soldiers, over suspected far-right terrorism","LONDON (Reuters) - British police arrested four men on Tuesday, including some serving soldiers, on suspicion of belonging to a banned far-right group and planning terrorist acts.  The men, aged 22 to 32, were detained on suspicion of being involved in the commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism and of being members of the National Action group. The neo-Nazi organization became the first far-right group to be outlawed in Britain last year after the murder of member of parliament Jo Cox, whose killing the group had praised. The four arrests were made by counter-terrorism officers in the cities of Birmingham, Ipswich and Northampton and in Powys, Wales.   The arrests were pre-planned and intelligence-led; there was no threat to the public s safety,  West Midlands Police said. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said a number of serving members of the army had been arrested.  These arrests are the consequence of a Home Office Police Force-led operation supported by the army,  an MoD spokeswoman said.  This is now the subject of a civilian police investigation and it would be inappropriate to comment further.   Britain is on its second-highest threat level,  severe , meaning an attack is highly likely. Suspected Islamists have killed 35 people this year in London and Manchester, and a man died in June after a van was driven into worshippers near a London mosque. Last month, a senior police chief said the number of referrals to the authorities about suspected right-wing extremists had doubled since the murder of Cox, who was killed in June last year by a loner obsessed with Nazis and white supremacist ideology.

Ukraine drops tax probe of finance minister: finance ministry,"KIEV (Reuters) - Ukrainian prosecutors have ended an inquiry into Finance Minister Oleksandr Danylyuk over alleged tax evasion after failing to find any evidence of wrongdoing, his press service said on Tuesday. The investigation was launched in July at the request of lawmaker Tetiana Chornovol, a member of former Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk s  People s Front  party.  Danylyuk, who became finance minister after Yatseniuk s ouster in April 2016, denied the charges and hinted they were linked to his efforts to crack down on corruption. In a statement his press service said  the case has been closed due to a lack of circumstances constituting a breach of law.  The General Prosecutor s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Since becoming finance minister, Danylyuk, a former investment manager who has also served as a deputy head of President Petro Poroshenko s administration, has backed reforms required under a $17.5 billion bailout program from the International Monetary Fund.

Sinn Fein's Adams to outline succession plan in November,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams said on Tuesday he would outline his succession plans in November as the former political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) prepares to complete a generational shift in its leadership. Adams, Sinn Fein leader for over 30 years, will seek re-election to the one-year post at the party s annual conference and set out his future plans at that time.  I will be allowing my name to go forward for the position of Uachtaran Shinn Fein (President of Sinn Fein),  Adams said in a speech at a meeting of the party s lawmakers.  And if elected I will be setting out our priorities and in particular our planned process of generational change, including my own future intentions.  Reviled by many as the face of the IRA during its campaign against British rule in Northern Ireland, Adams, 69 next month, reinvented himself as a peacemaker in the troubled region and then as a populist opposition lawmaker in the Irish Republic. Around 3,600 people were killed during Northern Ireland s  Troubles , three decades of sectarian bloodshed between pro-British Protestant unionists and Catholic nationalists seeking a united Ireland that was ended by a 1998 peace agreement. Whenever he decides to step down, he will almost certainly hand over to a successor with no direct involvement in the decades of conflict in Northern Ireland, say political analysts, making Sinn Fein a more palatable coalition partner in the Irish Republic where it has never been in power. Deputy leader Mary Lou McDonald, who has been at the forefront of a new breed of Sinn Fein politicians transforming the left-wing party s image, is the clear favorite to take over. Michelle O Neill, another Sinn Fein lawmaker in her 40s, succeeded Martin McGuinness as leader in Northern Ireland shortly before the former IRA commander s death in March.  With McGuinness, Adams turned Sinn Fein into the dominant nationalist party in Northern Ireland and the third largest party south of the border. Adams said last month that he intended to lead the party into the next parliamentary election in the Irish republic where suspicion of Sinn Fein s role in the Northern Ireland troubles still runs deep among the main political parties. The far larger ruling Fine Gael and main opposition Fianna Fail, a more natural ally, have ruled out governing with Sinn Fein but analysts say a change of leader could soften that stance. The next election is expected in the next 12 months. ",worldnews,"September 5, 2017 ",1
"Defying warnings, residents refuse to leave Mumbai's crumbling buildings","MUMBAI (Reuters) - On a sunny morning last week in Mumbai after two days of incessant monsoon rain, Mohammad Altaf had come out of his home for a cigarette when he heard a terrifying crash, followed by a huge swirl of dust. The six-storey Husainee building where he had lived for the last month had collapsed, trapping nearly 50 people. Thirty-four of them were killed, including a newborn baby.  It was shocking. I had come down for a smoke, and within two minutes the building was no more,  said Altaf, who says he was unaware the apartment block was declared unsafe by housing authorities in India s financial hub six years ago. Across the teeming city of 20 million people, thousands of families live in crumbling buildings that have been officially declared uninhabitable - and most of them know it. Housing officials say they cannot be forced out because of lax laws. This year, the city s municipal corporation classified 791 buildings as beyond repair and too dangerous to live in, but close to 500 of these continue to be occupied, a municipal authority official said. Although regulations vary from country to country and also from state to state, authorities in most places have more powers to order evacuations. Altaf, in his mid-thirties, is a bachelor and was living with two co-workers in the apartment in the Bhendi Bazar locality, one of the oldest in the metropolis. His two flatmates survived, with minor knee and shoulder injuries, after jumping out of their apartment on the third floor. Police say they have yet to determine the cause of the collapse, which came after days of intense rain.  The 117-year-old apartment block in Bhendi Bazar, a packed neighborhood of narrow streets, shops and tenements, was declared unsafe in 2011 by the regulator, the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA). Yet it continued to house Altaf and his flatmates, along with five other families, a sweet shop warehouse and even a nursery on the first floor.  The owner of the building, Hakimmudin Bootwala, said seven families moved out by 2014, but other tenants refused despite his urging. One of them had sub-let the apartment to Altaf and his colleagues.  The people were my friends and neighbors first, and tenants later,  said the 73-year-old.  I sincerely advised them to move out. The building had lots of problems, leakages. The roof was fine, but the walls had become really weak and porous.  An official at MHADA said there was a law to force residents to evacuate dangerous buildings but enforcing it was impossible because of loopholes and legal challenges. For instance, evicting children and senior citizens could cause trouble, said the housing official, who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the press.  We cut water and electricity supply of buildings that are identified as dangerous for living, but people manage to get water and electricity from nearby buildings,  said the  official. MHADA, which does a routine check of buildings that are older than 30 years, has identified more than 14,000 buildings in the city that need repair, according to its latest list.  Nine thousand of these, home to nearly 250,000 families, need to be redeveloped, the housing official said, adding that the other 5,000 were relatively safe due to regular maintenance work done by landowners in consultation with the housing body. Once regulators decide a building needs to redeveloped, they have to appoint a developer to renovate or rebuild the structure in the case of public housing, or order private owners to hire one. The developer, in turn, must offer residents alternative accommodation until the work is completed, according to state law in Mumbai.  But residents often complain the housing they are offered is too small, shabby or too far away.  Seventy percent of tenants of both privately- and publicly-owned buildings must agree to redevelop their building according to state rules, or no redevelopment work can commence. Building owners say residents are often unrealistic, refusing to leave even if the alternative housing is adequate. Some worry they could lose their tenancy if they move. The MHADA official said the agency does everything it can to get residents and developers to clinch an agreement, but that the process often gets mired in legal challenges.  The problems of the Husainee building were typical. A neighborhood body, the Saifee Burhani Upliftment Trust, had been selected by its owner in 2009 to redevelop the building along with other buildings in the neighborhood, even before the Husainee had been declared unsafe by MHADA. A trust official told Reuters it offered alternative housing to the residents in a place around 2.5 km (1.5 miles) from the building. The official said the trust repeated the offer in 2011 after MHADA declared the building unsafe.  A Reuters team visited the complex where the Husainee families who had agreed to move had been relocated, a gated high-rise complex with guards and a playground for kids. Residents said they were happy with their new apartments, although they complained about the distance to work.  But other Husainee families refused to move. MHADA officials said the trust was in charge of ensuring relocation and redevelopment and MHADA could not force the Husainee families to leave.  The trust has said it has repeatedly tried to evict families from Husainee but some residents refused to move.      This incident should be a wake-up call for the city, and a policy needs to be actioned to evict non-cooperating tenants who continue to live in dilapidated buildings,  the trust said in a  written reply to Reuters queries. Building owner Bootwala says the residents who refused to leave argued they did not want to upend their lives by moving to a new neighborhood. Also, they did not know how long it would take to renovate the building. Reuters was unable to talk to other residents from Husainee, but neighbors in Bhendi Bazar told similar stories. Despite knowing their buildings were unsafe, many of them did not want to leave.  A man in his 50s in the neighborhood, who refused to give his name, said he was living in a more than 100-year old building that had been deemed unsafe. The developer offered him temporary housing 13 km (8 miles) away, but he said that was too far.  I spent my entire life here. I know every lane in this area,  the man said.  My children s college, my workplace, everything is closer from here.  ",worldnews,"September 5, 2017 ",1

China's Xi wants to put relations with India on 'right track',"XIAMEN, China (Reuters) - China wants to put its relationship with India on the  right track , President Xi Jinping told Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday, as the two countries sought to mend ties damaged by a recent tense Himalayan border standoff. The meeting was the first between the two leaders since Chinese and Indian troops ended a standoff in the Doklam border region about a week ago that was the neighbors  most serious military confrontation in decades. Talks between Xi and Modi had been in question before the  de-escalation, which came just in time for China to host the BRICS summit of emerging economies, which also includes Brazil, Russia and South Africa, in the southeastern city of Xiamen. Healthy, stable ties were in the  interests of both countries, Xi told Modi in a meeting on the sidelines of the summit, according to a statement from China s foreign ministry.  China is willing to work with India ... to increase political trust, advance mutually beneficial cooperation and promote the further development of China-India relations along the correct path,  Xi said.  China and India must maintain the fundamental determination that each other constitute mutual development opportunities and do not constitute a mutual threat,  Xi said, adding that peaceful, cooperative relations were the  only correct choice . Xi and Modi spoke for more than an hour and the discussions were  constructive , Indian Foreign Secretary Subrahmanyam Jaishankar told reporters in Xiamen after the meeting.  There was a sense that if the relationship is to go forward, then peace and tranquility on the border area should be maintained,  Jaishankar said, adding that both sides agreed that strong contacts between their defense personnel were needed to prevent another border incident.  On both sides there was a sense that more efforts need to be made to ensure that these kinds of situations don t reoccur.  Pressed on how the Doklam dispute was discussed, Jaishankar said,  Both of us know what happened. This was not a backwards looking conversation. This was a forward-looking conversation.   Hundreds of troops were deployed on the Doklam plateau, near the borders of India, its ally Bhutan, and China after New Delhi objected to China building a road through the mountainous area. The quiet diplomacy that ultimately ended in de-escalation was based on a principle of stopping  differences becoming disputes  that Modi and Xi had agreed at a June meeting in Astana, an Indian official has said. Still, China and India remain divided on many fronts, including India s deep suspicions of China s growing military activities in and around the Indian Ocean. For its part, Modi s government has upset China with its public embrace of Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama, whom the Chinese regard as a dangerous separatist, and growing military ties with the United States and Japan. China has said its forces will continue to patrol in Doklam, which is claimed by Bhutan, and that it hoped India had learned a lesson from the incident.    ",worldnews,"September 5, 2017 ",1
