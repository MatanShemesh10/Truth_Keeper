Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican U.S. Representative Todd Rokita keeps a clock hanging on the wall of his Capitol Hill office that tracks the U.S. governments rising debt in real time and reminds him of his top priority: reining in federal spending. I was sent here on a fiscal note, said the Indiana lawmaker and vice chairman of the House of Representatives Budget Committee, who rode a Republican wave during his first election to Congress in 2010. When President Donald Trump unveils his budget for the 2018 fiscal year on Thursday, Rokita will be among many conservative Republicans cheering proposed cuts to domestic programs that would pay for a military buildup. More moderate Republicans are less enthusiastic and worry Trumps budget could force lawmakers to choose between opposing the president or backing reductions in popular programs such as aid for disabled children and hot meals for the elderly. What you would hope is that the administration is aware of the difficulty of some of these things, said Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma. The release of Trumps budget, which comes as the Republican president is facing an intraparty revolt over proposed legislation to replace the Obamacare healthcare law, could open another fight among Republicans who control both houses of Congress. To keep the government running, lawmakers will need to approve a spending plan later this year. The White House has released few details about Trumps budget, other than making clear the president wants to boost military spending by $54 billion and is seeking equivalent cuts in non-defense discretionary programs. But several agencies, including the State Department and the Environmental Protection Agency, have been asked to prepare scenarios for steep reductions, according to officials familiar with the discussions. While supporting deficit-reduction efforts, Cole said a major research university in his district could get hit by National Institutes of Health cuts, as could sewage treatment facilities funded by the EPA. Republican Senator Rob Portman, whose home state of Ohio sits on the southern shores of Lake Erie, expressed concern about media reports saying the Trump budget had penciled in sharp cuts in a cleanup program for the Great Lakes. While Rokita, who was among a group of Republican lawmakers who met with Trump last week, appeared comfortable with what he had learned so far about Trumps budget, some Republican members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus said they wanted to see even further budget cuts. Representative Mo Brooks of Alabama said the outcry from lawmakers over the expected cuts underscored to him that the blueprint would be a a very large step in the right direction of reining in the debt. Brooks added: My fear is that the Trump budget will not be austere enough to minimize Americas risk of suffering the kind of debilitating insolvency and bankruptcy that is destroying the lives of Venezuelans right now. OPEC member Venezuela is immersed in a deep economic crisis, with inflation in triple digits, shortages of basic goods, and many people going hungry. Brooks and other members of the Freedom Caucus are among the most vocal critics of the legislation backed by the White House to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, former Democratic President Barack Obamas signature healthcare plan, known as Obamacare. To try to woo the conservative lawmakers on Trumps legislative agenda, budget director Mick Mulvaney, himself a former member of the House Freedom Caucus, has invited them to a bowling and pizza night at the White House on Tuesday night. Another Freedom Caucus member, Representative David Schweikert of Arizona, said Mulvaney was encouraging lawmakers to submit maverick fiscal ideas to the White House. Schweikert said he hoped to revive a proposal from a few years ago, in the midst of a fight over raising the U.S. debt limit, that would have allowed the government to take a series of alternative, albeit controversial steps, such as paying some creditors ahead of others. One senior Republican aide, who referred to Trumps budget as a slash and burn proposal, said one fear of some House lawmakers was that they would be pressured to back big spending cuts only to have them rejected by the Senate, where Republicans hold a slimmer majority. The risk for House members is that their votes could prompt a backlash in the 2018 congressional elections. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said a budget that cuts State Department funds by one-third is unlikely to pass in his chamber. Other high-ranking Republicans are setting off alarms. Senator Lindsey Graham, following a White House lunch on Tuesday with Trump, said: What I told him is that when we get in a deadlock between the House and the Senate, different factions of the party ... youre the guy who needs to come down and close the deal. Cole said Congress would ultimately have the final say on the budget. At the end of the day, well have a budget. Well pass the budget, he said. Our budget is not necessarily the presidents budget.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two days before U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara was fired, President Donald Trump tried to call the high-profile New York prosecutor in what a White House official said was an effort to thank him for his service and to wish him good luck. But a U.S. law enforcement official said Bharara declined to take the call, placed on Thursday, saying he did not want to talk to the president without the approval of his superiors. Bharara said on Saturday he had been fired after he defied a request to resign. The move was a surprise because Bharara had told reporters in November that Trump had asked him to remain in the job. As the chief federal prosecutor for the Southern District of New York, which includes Manhattan, Bharara oversaw several  notable corruption and white-collar criminal cases, as well as prosecutions of terrorism suspects. He was one of 46 Obama administration holdovers who were asked to resign by the Justice Department on Friday. Although U.S. attorneys are political appointees, and the request from Trumps Justice Department is part of a routine process, the move came as a surprise. Not every new administration replaces all U.S. attorneys at once. The White House declined to comment further on the resignations. The office in the southern district of New York handles some of the most critical business and criminal cases that pass through the federal judicial system. Bharara had been overseeing a probe into New York City Mayor Bill de Blasios fundraising. Bharara said his deputy, Joon Kim, would serve as his temporary replacement. The law enforcement source declined comment on whether the office had any active investigations related to Trump. On Wednesday, three watchdog groups asked Bharara to take steps to prevent the Trump Organization from receiving benefits from foreign governments that might enrich Trump, who has not given up ownership of the business. Norm Eisen, a former White House ethics lawyer who leads one of the groups, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, questioned the timing of the firings. I do believe that something odd happened, he said. You dont decide to keep 46 folks on, then suddenly demand their immediate exit, without some precipitating cause or causes. Democrat Elijah Cummings, ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, said on Sunday it was the presidents prerogative to fire U.S. attorneys. But he questioned why Trump had suddenly changed his mind on keeping Bharara. Im just curious as to why that is, Cummings said on ABCs This Week program.Certainly, theres a lot of questions coming up as to whether ... President Trump is concerned about the jurisdiction of this U.S. attorney and whether that might affect his future. Republican Senator John McCain said he did not know what promises Trump might have made to Bharara in terms of keeping him on, but he said the president was within his rights to seek the resignation of political appointees from a prior administration. I do know that other administrations have done the same thing, perhaps not in as abrupt a fashion, McCain said on CNNs State of the Union. Elections have consequences, so for people to complain about it they are ignoring the history of new presidencies and I think the president had every right to ask for their resignations, McCain said.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administrations firing of Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara sent shockwaves through New York, but veterans of the high-profile office expect a longstanding mission of cracking down on political corruption and Wall Street wrongdoing to remain intact. Staffed with more than one hundred career prosecutors, the Manhattan U.S. Attorneys Office has a long history of being apolitical and pursuing a wide range of investigations into terrorism, public corruption, securities fraud and cyber crime, former prosecutors said.  Lorin Reisner, former head of the offices criminal division from 2012 to 2014, who is now in private practice at law firm Paul Weiss, said the priorities of the office are unlikely to change, regardless of who replaces Bharara. Generations of SDNY prosecutors have been told that their job is to do the right thing, for the right reasons, every day, in every case, he said, using the acronym for the office, the Southern District of New York. Hanging in the balance are ongoing investigations of potential fraud at Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc and its ties to a mail-order pharmacy and of two massive data breaches at Yahoo Inc, including one affecting more than one billion user accounts. The office is also investigating a major cyber heist from the Bank of Bangladesh involving funds which moved through the New York Federal Reserve bank. Bharara, appointed by President Barack Obama in 2009, lived up to the offices reputation, investigating Republicans and Democrats alike. He has been overseeing a probe into Democratic New York City Mayor Bill de Blasios fundraising. It would be tremendously difficult for any U.S. attorney to come in and politicize that office, said Carrie Cohen, a former prosecutor who worked under Bharara and is now in private practice at Morrison & Foerster. President Donald Trump has yet to announce a replacement for Bharara or the other remaining 45 U.S. attorneys from the Obama era who were asked to step down on Friday.  U.S. attorneys are political appointees requiring confirmation by the U.S. Senate. They usually leave office when a new president is elected, although some remain for months to help with the transition.  But Bhararas removal from office came as a surprise because  Trump had met with him after the election and indicated he would be retained. Bharara refused to resign, prompting his firing on Saturday. Whoever Trump appoints to replace Bharara will likely reflect U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions priorities, including a desire to crack down on violent crime and less of a focus on civil rights cases. There is growing speculation among former prosecutors and others in the legal community that Bhararas replacement will be Marc Mukasey, a defense lawyer whose father served as attorney general under Republican President George W. Bush. Mukasey declined to comment on Sunday.  In the short-term, the office will be headed by acting U.S. Attorney Joon Kim. He is a veteran of the office, returning under Bharara in 2013 as a key deputy following an earlier stint from 2000 to 2006. In between, he was a partner at the Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton law firm. A spokesman for the office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Outside of public corruption, Bharara was perhaps best known for overseeing a wave of cases focused on insider trading. Many of the investigations were already underway when Bharara took office in August 2009. But he became the face of the crackdown, landing on the cover of Time magazine in 2012 with the headline This man is busting Wall St. The new U.S. attorney will have some latitude on what to focus on in the future. Each U.S. attorney has his own order of priorities and how they see the resources of the office best used and each U.S. attorney also has the right to discontinue an investigation if they feel its a waste of time, said Ben Brafman, a leading defense lawyer. Sessions has, however, already signaled a shift away from some Obama administration priorities. Unlike Bharara and his former bosses in the Obama administration, Sessions advocates trying foreign militants before military commissions instead of in civilian courts. Bharara had pushed for trials in civilian courts while Sessions has criticized that approach and vouched for the ongoing value of trying foreign defendants before military tribunals.  On civil rights, Norman Siegel, former executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said there was growing anxiety about the future of such cases since Bhararas firing.

A bondholder group led by OppenheimerFunds and Franklin Advisers, which hold debt across a wide swath of Puerto Rican credits, made the request to the board in a letter made publicon Monday morning, ahead of the boards scheduled public meeting in New York. An extension would ... allow Puerto Rico and the oversight board to work with Puerto Ricos key stakeholders to develop a fiscal plan that makes sense to all the parties, the group said.  The turnaround plan, a requirement of the Puerto Rico rescue law known as PROMESA, must be submitted by Governor Ricardo Rossello and approved by the seven-member board in charge of managing the islands finances. The plan is meant to serve as the basis for looming restructuring talks with holders of Puerto Ricos $70 billion in debt. So far, Rossello and the board have disagreed about what the blueprint should look like, with the board saying an initial draft by Rossello relied on overly optimistic revenue and growth projections. The draft increased 10-year cash flows by $33.8 billion, through spending cuts and new revenues, and contemplated $1.2 billion a year in debt service - only 30 percent of what it owes next fiscal year. The board on Monday is expected to take up a revised version of the plan from Rossello, and has said it wants to approve a final version by Wednesday. But the lingering disagreements between the board and Rossello call for an extension, the Oppenheimer group said in Mondays letter, adding that more time might give the islands creditors a seat at the table. Oppenheimer said Rossellos draft plan was unfeasible, saying it ignored payment priorities, offered too weak an analysis on debt sustainability, and did not go far enough on tax reform measures. Puerto Rico is trying to stem rampant out-migration, reduce a 45 percent poverty rate, and fix near-insolvent public healthcare and pension systems. Oppenheimer said it supported extendingthrough Dec. 31a stay on litigation arising from debt defaults, so sides can negotiate a debt restructuring without worrying about lawsuits.

Biden, whose son Beau died from brain cancer in 2015, delivered an emotional speech at the South by Southwest technology summit in Austin, Texas, about continuing the work he led under former Democratic President Barack Obama in the so-called Cancer Moonshot, an initiative aimed at speeding up research into new cancer therapies. He spoke of the need for prevention, research collaboration and big data to battle cancer. Biden did not mention U.S. Republican President Donald Trump by name but said in the speech before several thousand people he was willing to work with the current administration on the fight against cancer, which kills an estimated 600,000 Americans a year. The only bipartisan thing left in America is the fight against cancer, he said. Biden said that just before he made his formal announcement in 2015 not to run, Obama asked him if he had any regrets.

He is a wealthy real estate magnate from New York who shoots from the hip and enjoys the spotlight. It is hard to imagine two leaders more different, in style or substance, than Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and Donald Trump, the new president of the United States. For months, they have been engaged in an uneasy long-distance skirmish over policy and values. On Tuesday, they meet for the first time - a high-stakes encounter that will be watched by governments around the world for clues about the future of the transatlantic alliance, a partnership that has helped shape the global order since World War Two but which Trump is threatening to upend. Do I think they are going to become good friends? Probably not. They are very different personalities, said Charles Kupchan, who advised Trumps predecessor Barack Obama on European policy as a member of the National Security Council. But I do think they have a strong interest, both politically and strategically, in learning how to work together. It is arguably the most important meeting with a foreign leader of Trumps presidency. German officials say the detail-oriented Merkel, 62, has been preparing assiduously for her trip to Washington. She has watched Trumps speeches and poured over his interviews, including a lengthy Q&A with Playboy magazine from 1990 in which he floats many of the controversial ideas he is now trying to implement as president, they say. Members of her entourage have also analyzed Trumps encounters with other leaders - including Britains Theresa May, Japans Shinzo Abe and Canadas Justin Trudeau - and have had exchanges with some of their counterparts on how to handle the unpredictable former reality-TV star, the officials added.  We have to be prepared for the fact that he does not like to listen for long, that he prefers clear positions and does not want to delve into details, said one senior German official.  On both economic and foreign policy, the divide between the two leaders appears vast. Trump, 70, has called Merkels decision to allow hundreds of thousands of refugees into Germany a catastrophic mistake. He has threatened to impose tariffs on German carmakers that import into the U.S. market. And he has criticized Berlin for not spending more on defense, a longstanding U.S. complaint that Merkel has promised to address. Another source of tension is Germanys 50 billion euro trade surplus with the United States. Trump adviser Peter Navarro has accused Germany of gaining unfair trade advantages through a weak euro. Merkel and her ministers have pointed out that the European Central Bank - and not Berlin - controls the fate of Europes single currency. Russia will also be on the agenda. White House officials have said Trump will seek advice from Merkel on how to deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin.  For her part, Merkel has been critical of Trumps travel ban targeting the citizens of several mainly Muslim countries. In a phone call in January, she explained to Trump that the Geneva Convention obliges signatories, including the United States, to take in war refugees on humanitarian grounds. Merkel is also concerned that Trump, who has repeatedly praised Britains decision to leave the European Union, might continue to undermine the bloc with his rhetoric at a time of deep crisis triggered by the rise of anti-EU populist parties. Europe is in a very fragile, precarious state and Germany is trying to ensure that the European integration project holds together. I suspect the chancellor will want to make this clear to the president, said Anthony Gardner, who served as U.S. ambassador to the European Union until January. This is an opportunity to sketch out areas of common interest, to define a positive agenda, he added. But one meeting wont change the atmosphere on its own.  Trump is the third U.S. president that Merkel, Europes longest-serving leader, has worked with. She established a good rapport with George W. Bush, who was keen to repair ties with Germany after his clash with Merkels predecessor Gerhard Schroeder over the Iraq war. And although relations with Obama got off to an awkward start when Merkel rebuffed his request to speak at the Brandenburg Gate during the 2008 presidential campaign, the two grew close over time, cooperating on sanctions against Russia and launching negotiations on a transatlantic free-trade deal. The parting is hard for me, Merkel acknowledged when Obama visited Berlin in November, a week after Trumps victory. The German leader will be walking a fine line in Washington. With an election looming at home in September, she must avoid offering her political opponents ammunition by cozying up to Trump. Neither can she afford an open confrontation that might damage German interests. One of the biggest concerns in the chancellors camp before the visit is the potential for surprises. Japans Abe had an awkward 19-second handshake with Trump, while May was criticized in some sections of the British media for holding hands with Trump during a stroll at the White House, apparently after he reached out to steady himself. When Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met Trump last month, he and his team spent the day before running through endless scenarios, lines of questioning and role-plays to ensure they were prepared for any scenario. But in the end, they were still taken aback when Trump spoke off the cuff at their news conference on the sensitive issues of settlements and a future Palestinian state. Merkel has admitted to being so uncomfortable with surprises as a child that she drew up her Christmas wish-list months in advance to avoid being caught off-guard by an unexpected gift. With Trump, she might have to expect the unexpected. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

New York U.S. Attorney Preet Bhararas defiant exit, first announced on Twitter, raised questions about President Donald Trumps ability to fill top jobs throughout his government. Trump has yet to put forward any candidates to serve as the nations 93 district attorneys even as his Justice Department asked the 46 who have not yet quit to hand in their resignations on Friday. Key positions at agencies like the State Department and the Defense Department also remain unfilled.  As the federal prosecutor for Manhattan and surrounding areas since 2009, Bharara secured insider-trading settlements from Wall Street firms and won criminal convictions in high-profile corruption and terrorism cases.  He told reporters in November that Trump had asked him to stay in his post, and he refused to resign when asked to do so by the Justice Department on Friday. He said he was fired on Saturday afternoon. Serving my country as U.S. Attorney here for the past seven years will forever be the greatest honor of my professional life, no matter what else I do or how long I live, Bharara said in a press statement.  The Justice Department confirmed that Bharara was no longer serving in the position and declined further comment. Like all U.S. attorneys, Bharara is a political appointee who can be replaced when a new president takes office. Previous presidents have often asked outgoing U.S. attorneys to stay on the job until their replacements win confirmation in the U.S. Senate.  The Washington Post, citing two people close to Trump, said the presidents adviser Stephen Bannon and Attorney General Jeff Sessions wanted a clean slate of federal prosecutors to assert the administrations power.  But the decision to replace so many sitting attorneys at once has raised questions about whether the Trump administrations ability to enforce the nations laws would be hindered.  President Trumps abrupt and unexplained decision to summarily remove over 40 U.S. attorneys has once again caused chaos in the federal government, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, a Democrat, said.     Senator Patrick Leahy, a Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the firings showed the independence of the Justice Department is at risk under this administration and that lawmakers had to carefully evaluate Trumps replacements.       Career attorneys will carry on that work until new U.S. attorneys are put in place, the Justice Department said. Bharara said his deputy, Joon Kim, will serve as his temporary replacement. Marc Mukasey, a defense lawyer whose father served as attorney general under Republican President George W. Bush, has been mentioned as a possible replacement. He did not respond to a request for comment. HIGH-PROFILE OFFICE Bhararas office handles some of the most critical business and criminal cases passing through the federal judicial system. He has been overseeing a probe into New York City Mayor Bill de Blasios fundraising. Bharara has successfully prosecuted state and local politicians for corruption, including former New York Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver. He won a lifetime sentence against the Times Square bomber, Faisal Shahzad, and a 25-year sentence for international arms dealer Viktor Bout.  He won a $1.8 billion insider-trading settlement against SAC Capital Advisors, the largest in history, which forced the hedge fund to shut down, and he forced JPMorgan Chase to pay $1.7 billion to settle charges related to its role in the Bernie Madoff Ponzi scheme. His firing so early in President Trumps tenure is somewhat unexpected, but if you had asked me a few months ago whether I expected Preet to still be in that job in March I would have said no, said Matthew Schwartz, a former prosecutor under Bharara.   Trump has asked two U.S. prosecutors to remain on the job, according to the Justice Department.  U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein of Maryland has been asked to stay on as the Senate considers his nomination to serve as the No. 2 Justice Department official, and U.S. Attorney Dana Boente of Virginia, who is temporarily serving in that position, has also been asked to remain.

The campaign, known as PeoplePower, kicks off on Saturday with a town hall-style event in Miami featuring resistance training that will be streamed live at more than 2,300 local gatherings nationwide.  It will focus on free speech, reproductive rights and immigration and include presentations from legal experts, ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero and Top Chef television star Padma Lakshmi. Membership in the civil rights organization, which was founded in 1920, has tripled to more than 1 million since Trumps election, the group says.  As activists have marched in streets, demonstrated at airports and confronted U.S. lawmakers regularly since election day, progressive groups like MoveOn and the newly formed Indivisible have sought ways to translate that frustration into local action. That is the idea behind PeoplePower, which represents a major strategic shift for an organization that has traditionally focused on courtroom litigation, Romero said in a phone interview on Friday. Approximately 135,000 people have signed up for the campaign. Before, our membership was largely older and much smaller, he said. Our members would provide us with money so we could file the cases and do the advocacy. Whats clear with the Trump election is that our new members are engaged and want to be deployed. For example, the Miami event will encourage individuals to engage local officials in conversations about immigrant policies in their town or city. The ACLU has prepared model ordinances ensuring the protection of immigrant rights that supporters can press legislators to adopt, part of a campaign to create freedom cities, according to ACLU political director Faiz Shakir. Suggested tactics, like the use of text messages as a mass mobilization tool, will mirror some of those employed by the insurgent presidential campaign of U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, who mounted a surprisingly robust challenge to Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination.

The board must approve a turnaround blueprint for the island under the federal Puerto Rico rescue law known as PROMESA. It has said it plans to do by March 15.  Francisco Cimadevilla, a spokesman for the board, said the seven-member panel is still evaluating the new proposal and will not have any comment before a public hearing in New York on Monday.  Rossellos office issued a statement on Saturday announcing the revamped plan, but gave little detail. It said the plan would continue to try to protect Puerto Ricos most vulnerable citizens. Our administrations plan remains the same: to avoid affecting the most vulnerable and to operate a fiscally responsible government, Rossello said in the statement.  Puerto Rico, plagued by a 45 percent poverty rate and shrinking population, is trying to restructure $70 billion in debt. The fiscal plan will serve as the baseline for restructuring talks with wide-ranging bondholder groups.  Rossellos earlier draft set aside $1.2 billion a year to service debt, just 30 percent of what it owes next fiscal year. It proposed cuts to healthcare spending and pension benefits, and projected creating $33.8 billion over 10 years through myriad spending cuts and $12.9 billion in new revenue.

Attorney General Brian Frosh said his office would formally join the suit on Monday. The administration persists in an effort to implement a policy that is inhumane and unconstitutional, but also makes us less safe, not more safe, Frosh said in a statement. The new travel order, which is set to take effect on Wednesday, replaced a more sweeping ban issued on Jan. 27 that caused chaos and protests at airports.  The first order, which temporarily halted the entry of refugees and travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries, was hit by more than two dozen lawsuits.  Detractors claimed it discriminated against Muslims and violated the U.S. Constitution.  The government has said the president has wide authority to implement immigration policy and that the travel rules are necessary to protect against terrorist attacks. Trumps second executive order is still a Muslim ban, Frosh said in the statement.  The state of Washington brought one of the suits against the original ban, and last month a federal judge in Seattle ordered an emergency halt to the policy. That ruling was upheld by an appeals court in San Francisco. Washington is now asking the court to apply the emergency halt to the new ban, arguing it is a veiled version of the old one. The new order keeps a 90-day ban on travel to the United States by citizens of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, but excludes Iraq. Refugees are still halted from entering the country for 120 days, but the new order removed an indefinite ban on all refugees from Syria. Oregon and Minnesota also are joining Washingtons challenge. Hawaii has a separate case pending against the new ban.  Frosh said the ban would make Maryland less competitive by deterring visits by academics, scientists and engineers from other countries and would hurt Marylands universities and economy.

A Justice Department spokeswoman confirmed the resignation requests included Bharara, whose office handles some of the most critical business and criminal cases passing through the federal judicial system. Bharara met with Trump in Trump Tower on Nov. 30. After, Bharara told reporters the two had a good meeting and he had agreed to stay on. On Friday, Bharara was unsure where he stood because he did not know if the person who contacted him about resigning was aware that Trump had asked him to remain in office, according to a source familiar with the matter.  It was not immediately clear if all resignations would ultimately be accepted. A Justice Department spokesman said on Friday Trump had called Dana Boente, acting U.S. deputy attorney general, to decline his resignation.  Trump also called Maryland U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein, his pick to take over as deputy attorney general, to keep him in his post, the spokesman said.     Bharara, appointed by Democratic President Barack Obama in 2009, has pursued an aggressive push against corruption in state and city politics and is known for his prosecution of white-collar criminal cases. He also has been overseeing a federal probe into New York City Mayor Bill de Blasios fundraising. In November, he announced charges against two defendants in connection with what he called a multimillion-dollar fraud and kickback scheme at Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO). He has also brought dozens of successful cases against insider traders, including a $1.8 billion settlement and plea deal in 2013 with hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors LP. His office has secured settlements with companies including General Motors Co (GM.N) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N); won several convictions and guilty pleas of former employees of Ponzi scheme operator Bernard Madoff; and prosecuted Suleiman Abu Ghaith, a son-in-law of the late al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. Bhararas priorities have often matched those set by Obamas Justice Department, which potentially puts him at odds with the Trump administration. Amid an increase in civil rights investigations nationally, for example, Bhararas office joined a lawsuit that led to a settlement in 2015 aimed at reducing violence in New York Citys Rikers Island jail complex. U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, said in a statement that he was troubled to learn of the requests for resignations, particularly that of Preet Bharara. As Schumers chief counsel, Bharara helped lead the investigation of the dismissals of U.S. attorneys in 2006 during the George W. Bush administration. Robert Capers, U.S. Attorney in Brooklyn, issued a statement saying he had been asked to resign. He said Bridget Rohde, the chief assistant U.S. attorney in that office, would take over his role in an acting capacity. The Justice Department said on Friday: Until the new U.S. attorneys are confirmed, the dedicated career prosecutors in our U.S. attorneys offices will continue the great work of the department in investigating, prosecuting, and deterring the most violent offenders.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - A federal judge in Wisconsin dealt the first legal blow to President Donald Trumps revised travel ban on Friday, barring enforcement of the policy to deny U.S. entry to the wife and child of a Syrian refugee already granted asylum in the United States. The temporary restraining order, granted by U.S. District Judge William Conley in Madison, applies only to the family of the Syrian refugee, who brought the case anonymously to protect the identities of his wife and daughter, still living in the war-torn Syrian city of Aleppo. But it represents the first of several challenges brought against Trumps newly amended executive order, issued on March 6 and due to go into effect on March 16, to draw a court ruling in opposition to its enforcement. Conley, chief judge of the federal court in Wisconsins western district and an appointee of former President Barack Obama, concluded the plaintiff has presented some likelihood of success on the merits of his case and that his family faces significant risk of irreparable harm if forced to remain in Syria. The plaintiff, a Sunni Muslim, fled Syria to the United States in 2014 to escape near-certain death at the hands of sectarian military forces fighting the Syrian government in Aleppo, according to his lawsuit.  He subsequently obtained asylum for his wife and their only surviving child, a daughter, and their application had cleared the security vetting process and was headed for final processing when it was halted by Trumps original travel ban on Jan. 27. That executive order sought to ban admission to the United States of citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries - Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Yemen and Iraq - for 120 days and to suspend entry of all refugees indefinitely.  The original travel ban, which caused widespread chaos and protests at airports when first implemented, was rescinded after the state of Washington won a nationwide federal court order blocking further enforcement of the policy. The modified executive order reduced the number of excluded counties - removing Iraq from the list - and lifted the indefinite refugee travel ban for Syrians. But opponents from several states have gone to court seeking to halt its implementation as well. The court appreciates that there may be important differences between the original executive order, and the revised executive order, Conley wrote in his decision. As the order applies to the plaintiff here, however, the court finds his claims have at least some chance of prevailing for the reasons articulated by other courts. In a related development on Friday, the federal judge in Seattle who imposed a nationwide injunction on enforcement of the original travel ban refused a request to apply that order to the revised policy, saying that lawyers from states opposed to the measure needed to file more extensive court papers.

Merkel will visit the White House on Tuesday for talks with Trump and a joint news conference in what will be their first face-to-face meeting since the new U.S. president took power on Jan. 20. They are expected to discuss Germanys level of defense spending for the NATO alliance, the Ukraine conflict, Syrian refugees, the European Union and a host of other issues, said three senior Trump administration officials who briefed reporters.   During the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, Trump regularly criticized Merkel for her open-door refugee policy, contrasting it with what he promised would be tighter controls in the United States if he won office. Merkel has been a leading critic of Trumps effort to ban travelers temporarily from seven Muslim-majority nations, a list that has since been pared back to six. My expectation is that theyll have a very positive, cordial meeting, said one of the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Trump has long expressed desire for warmer U.S. relations with Russia but some of his top Cabinet officials are skeptical. The president will be very interested in hearing the chancellors views on her experience interacting with Putin, said another official. Hes going to be very interested in hearing her insights on what its like to deal with the Russians. Trump will also ask for Merkels advice on what role the United States can most helpfully play in ongoing diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine, which has pitted Ukrainian forces against Russian-backed separatists. The officials described Trump as impressed by Merkels leadership, particularly in Germanys role alongside France in seeking peace in Ukraine, and on Afghanistan. Trump has been critical of NATO allies who he says do not pay their fair share, and the officials said he would raise with Merkel the need for Germany to increase its defense spending as he tries to rally European allies to contribute more to NATO. Germany should be leading by example on increasing contributions to NATO, one official said. We are heartened by the German governments determination to reach NATOs benchmark of committing 2 percent of GDP to defense by 2024, the official said.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has chosen Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a conservative health policy expert with deep ties to the pharmaceutical industry, to lead the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the White House said on Friday. If confirmed by the Senate, Gottlieb would be in charge of implementing Trumps plan to dramatically cut regulations governing food, drugs, cosmetics, dietary supplements and tobacco. Gottlieb is well known on Capitol Hill, where he has testified multiple times on hot-button health issues, including complex drug pricing matters, and is viewed favorably by drug companies and pharmaceutical investors. He sits on the boards of several small drug and biotech companies and is an adviser to GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK.L). Thank God its Gottlieb, Brian Skorney, an investment analyst at Robert W. Baird, wrote in a research note. We view this as a favorable development for the sector. Gottlieb was chosen over Jim ONeill, a libertarian investor close to Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel, a PayPal co-founder who now advises Trump on technology and science matters. ONeills stated view that drugs should be approved before being proven effective generated widespread alarm. Gottlieb, 44, is a resident fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute think tank and a partner at a large venture capital fund. He is a former FDA deputy commissioner who has advocated a loosening of requirements needed for approval of new medical products. Scott knows how the agency works and he will move it forwards, though maybe not always in ways the agency is comfortable with, said John Taylor, a lawyer and president of compliance and regulatory affairs with the consulting firm Greenleaf Health and a former acting FDA deputy commissioner. In addition to his public health and health policy roles, Gottlieb has for the past decade been a partner at New Enterprise Associates, a large venture fund with investments in the life sciences, medical technology and healthcare services. Critics of the nomination say Gottliebs financial background present an array of potential conflicts of interest. Dr. Michael Carome, director of Public Citizens Health Research Group, said Gottlieb has spent most of his career dedicated to promoting the financial interests of the pharmaceutical industry. If confirmed, he added, he will have to be recused from key decisions time and time again. Stephen Ubl, a spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said it looks forward to working with Dr. Gottlieb in his new role and engaging with him and the Agency as they seek to modernize the drug discovery and review process. Gottlieb, who declined to comment on the nomination, is unlikely to up-end the FDA in the way ONeill might have, but he is nonetheless expected to bring significant change, including moving the agency to increase flexibility in the clinical trial development process. In this he will be supported by the recently passed 21st Century Cures Act which instructs the FDA among other things to consider the use of real world evidence to support new drug applications. This could include anecdotal data, observational studies and patient reports  People dont want to take chances with safety, but theres increasingly some clamor to be more flexible on the efficacy side, said Kathleen Sanzo, who leads the FDA practice at the law firm Morgan, Lewis & Bockius. You need to have some signal of efficacy. The question is, how much? The FDA has attempted to push back against moves to sideline randomized clinical trials, long considered the gold standard. In January it issued a report documenting 22 cases in which drugs that appeared to show promise in early trials turned out to be either ineffective or unsafe or both in larger trials. One of Gottliebs priorities will likely be to streamline the process for approving generic versions of complex, difficult-to-copy therapeutics. He has stated publicly that he does not believe the FDA has good tools or policies to move such products and has advocated the creation of different approval standards. Hes a thoughtful and nuanced kind of guy, and not solely an industry shill, said Jim Shehan, head of Lowenstein Sandlers FDA regulatory practice.  A survey conducted by Mizuho Securities USA Inc of 53 pharmaceutical executives found that 72 percent favored Gottlieb over other potential candidates. Many described him as knowledgeable, experienced and balanced. Gottlieb is someone who the industry and investors view as an incremental positive, said RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee. The industry and investors need rational scientific logic and an understanding of risks and benefits. Patient advocates welcomed the news. Gottlieb has firsthand experience at the FDA and as a physician that has treated patients understands the breadth of work that needs to be achieved on their behalf, said Ellen Sigal, founder of Friends of Cancer Research.

Several hundred asylum seekers, mainly from Africa but also the Middle East, have entered Canada. The refugees and migrant agencies blame the exodus on moves by U.S. President Donald Trump to clamp down on immigration.  We have provided information about the specific documents that were presented at the border because those are American documents, Canadian Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale told reporters. Goodale spoke after meeting U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly in Ottawa for talks on the influx, which is putting domestic pressure on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Emergency responders and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police are struggling to respond to people defying wintry conditions to cross the undefended border near Emerson, Manitoba. Manitoba premier Brian Pallister is demanding Trudeaus Liberal government provide money and resources. Ottawa says there is a chance the flow of people will increase as the weather improves. We obviously have safety concerns on both sides of the border, Goodale said, adding that he had seen no evidence yet of any profiteering or human trafficking. Kelly told CTV that he and his Canadian counterparts were perplexed as to why people who generally, as a group, have come to the United States legally would make their way north. Canadian officials caution against the idea that Trumps policies are solely to blame. Goodale said some of the asylum seekers had been planning their move in early 2016, months before the November election that brought Trump to power. Goodale said there was little Canada could do, since the vast majority of those crossing the border had been in the United States legally and enjoyed freedom of movement. No one is suggesting the construction of a wall along the Canadian border, no one is saying the RCMP should line up along the border and join arms and shoo people away, he said. Goodale said he and Kelly had agreed officials needed to gather more information to work out what was happening.

The rule, Statistical Policy Directive Number 3, is meant to preserve the distinction between the policy-neutral release of data by statistical agencies and their interpretation by policy officials, the White House budget office explained when it published the most recent version in September 1985.  Jason Furman, who led President Barack Obamas Council of Economic Advisers, noted on Twitter that the rule had been in place for decades: Everyone has followed it. Until now.  Asked about the tweets at a White House news briefing, Spicer said the posts simply repeated public information and did not provide any analysis that could have disrupted markets.  Were excited to see so many Americans back to work, he said. So, I apologize if we were a little excited.  Erica Groshen, who led the Labor Departments statistical arm for four years under Obama, in her own comment on Twitter called the directive a best practice separating non-partisan number crunchers from officials with a more-political bent.  In its monthly report on U.S. employment, released at 8:30 a.m. (1330 GMT), the Labor Department said non-farm employers added 235,000 workers to their payrolls, with the unemployment rate dropping a tenth of a percentage point to 4.7 percent.  The monthly jobs data sets the tone for financial markets worldwide, and the robust pace of employment growth in February was seen as giving the Federal Reserve a green light to raise interest rates next week.  Twenty-four minutes after the data was released, Spicer tweeted, \""Great news for American workers: economy added 235,000 new jobs, unemployment rate drops to 4.7% in first report for @POTUS Trump.\""  Minutes later, he offered a fresh post: \""Not a bad way to start day 50 of this Administration.\""  Spicer was not alone.

Flynn acted as a foreign agent representing the interests of Turkeys government in exchange for more than $500,000 during last years presidential campaign even as he was advising  Trump, the New York Times said on Friday.  White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters Flynns lobbying was a personal and business matter, and it was up to him to decide when to register. Asked if Trump had not been aware that former general Flynn was working as a foreign agent, Spicer said: Correct... You wouldnt know that until he filed. He didnt file until two days ago.  Some U.S. lawmakers have questioned Flynns relationship with the government of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Before Trumps inauguration, Flynns ties to Turkey were widely reported and he wrote an article urging the United States to cultivate better relations with Erdogan. Trump fired Flynn last month for discussing U.S. sanctions on Russia with the Russian ambassador to the United States before Trump took office on Jan. 20 and misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations. Before Trump took office, Flynns lawyer contacted the presidential transition team about his work for Turkey to ask what he should do, Spicer said.

The Boots on the Border Act was backed by Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, Senator John McCain, a member of that panel, and Senator Jeff Flake, who serves on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which oversees immigration policy. Flake, in a statement, noted that long screening procedures have resulted in 1,768 Border Patrol positions and 1,046 Customs and Border Protection jobs remaining unfilled. At the same time, the Department of Homeland Security has plans to add more than 5,000 border enforcement agents to the current force. The legislation, which would have to go through several steps in the Senate and House of Representatives before it could become law, comes as the Trump administration is stepping up deportations of illegal immigrants. It also is moving to restrict travel in the United States for people from six predominately Muslim countries, a move that faces legal challenges. Under the Senate bill, CBP could waive current polygraph requirements for applicants who have been working in federal, state and local law enforcement for the past three years, have clean employment records and have successfully completed polygraph and other background investigations. The bill also would cover U.S. armed forces personnel and veterans.

In the face of opposition by Democrats, healthcare providers and many conservatives, two House of Representatives committees approved the legislation that would undo much of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, moving it closer to a vote before the full House. The Energy and Commerce Committee voted 31-23 along party lines, with Democrats unified against it, to back the plan after marathon proceedings lasting 27 straight hours. Hours earlier, the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee similarly voted 23-16 before dawn to approve it after working 17 straight hours. House Speaker Paul Ryan sought to bolster support among  conservatives in his own party, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said fellow Republicans must get in a governing mode while Trump denied the bill was in trouble. Despite what you hear in the press, healthcare is coming along great. We are talking to many groups and it will end in a beautiful picture! the Republican president said on Twitter. The bill would replace Obamacares income-based subsidies with a system of fixed tax credits to help people buy private insurance on the open market, while ditching the Obamacare expansion of the Medicaid insurance program for the poor. It would also end penalties for not having insurance, though  insurers would be given permission to impose a 30 percent surcharge on customers who let their coverage lapse for more than two months and then seek to renew. Hospital stocks, which has fallen after the plan was unveiled on Monday, ended broadly higher on Thursday, with Tenet Healthcare up 3.4 percent. Shares of health insurers were mixed, with most large insurers modestly higher and Medicaid-focused insurers ending negative, including Molina Healthcares 3.3 percent drop.  While Republicans have been itching for seven years to dismantle Democratic former President Barack Obamas signature domestic policy achievement, the party has failed to coalesce behind the plan put forth by House Republican leaders. Republicans control the White House and both houses of Congress for the first time in a decade, but passage of the legislation was not a foregone conclusion. Conservative lawmakers and lobbying groups have lambasted it as too similar to Obamacare. They have sharply criticized its proposed tax credits as an unacceptable new government entitlement program and have called for a quicker end to the Obamacare Medicaid expansion. The measure is the first major legislative test for Trump and his fellow Republicans amid questions about whether they can govern effectively after years spent as an opposition party under Obama. Ryan, with his shirt sleeves rolled up and using a video screen with facts and figures, held what he called a townhall-style presentation for reporters on the proposal. But his intended audience appeared to be fellow Republicans, and he said his party must actually make good on our word. The time is now, said Ryan, who long has been the target of criticism of some conservatives. This is the closest we will ever get to repealing and replacing Obamacare, Ryan added. McConnell had a similar message, saying, We need to get into a governing mode and start thinking about actually achieving something rather than just kind of sparring. Democrats denounced the bill as a gift to the rich that would force millions of people off of insurance rolls. Republicans said it was needed to roll back the governments nanny state role in the more-than-$3 trillion U.S. healthcare system. Trumpcare is a loser for just about all of America, unless youre in the top 1 percent, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said. The House Budget Committee next Wednesday is due to merge the provisions approved by the two committees into one bill to be voted on by the full House before it goes to the Senate. Republican leaders are eyeing April for congressional passage of the bill. In a series of tweets early on Thursday, conservative Republican Senator Tom Cotton urged his House colleagues to pull back, saying their measure could not pass the Senate without major changes. What matters in long run is better, more affordable health care for Americans, NOT House leaders arbitrary legislative calendar, Cotton wrote. But White House spokesman Sean Spicer expressed confidence in the legislations prospects. Were not jamming this down peoples throat, Spicer said. This bill will land on the presidents desk. He will sign it. We will repeal Obamacare. The Brookings Institution think tank forecast that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, expected early next week to release its closely watched assessment of the bills cost and coverage implications, would conclude that at least 15 million people would lose health insurance. Credit rating agency Standard & Poors earlier estimated 6-10 million people could lose health insurance coverage. Before the Energy and Commerce Committee vote, conservatives at the request of the panels chairman withdrew an amendment sponsored by Republican Joe Barton that would move up by two years, to next Jan. 1, the end of the Medicaid expansion. Barton said he planned to try to offer the amendment on the House floor. Committee Chairman Greg Walden hailed the unanimity of Republicans on the committee in approving the bill. Obamacare enabled 20 million previously uninsured people to obtain coverage. About half came from the Medicaid expansion. The bills proposed changes in Medicaid funding could hurt smaller, less diverse health insurers, Fitch Ratings said, and the unintended, unforeseen consequences of a bill this size are likely to create uncertainty for all health insurers.  With doctors, hospitals, seniors, health plans, Democrats, some governors and conservative Republicans against the bill, it may not make it out of the House, Mario Molina, chief executive of managed care company Molina Healthcare, said in an interview. If it does, I think the Senate is going to slow things down and really take a good look, Molina said. We are going to have to hope that the Senate is more moderate.

Just ask its namesake, U.S. President Donald Trump, who until recently was quoted on its website saying the club provides more than a membership  its a true luxury lifestyle. The business is worth more than $50 million and yielded more than $10 million from 2015 to early 2016, according to the financial disclosure form Trump filed last May. But seven months earlier, an attorney for Trump filed a lawsuit against the town of Ossining, New York, seeking lower taxes, claiming the course was worth only $1.4 million. The lawsuit, which remains pending, has left at least one local official worried that taking a tough negotiating stance against a business owned by the worlds most powerful political figure puts her town of 25,000 residents at risk of retribution. Are we, the puny town of Ossining, going to choose to go up against the presidents company? said Dana Levenberg, the town supervisor. I wouldnt want to do anything that has negative repercussions for the town of Ossining. Ethics experts said disagreements between Trump businesses and local governments create unavoidable conflicts of interest, since the federal government is a key source of funding and other benefits for municipalities and counties. Over decades as a hard-charging businessman, Trump has been embroiled in numerous legal battles with local governments, from lawsuits to property tax appeals to zoning fights. At least half a dozen disputes, including the Westchester lawsuit, remained unresolved as the Trump presidency began in late January. Donald Trump has shown to date that he can play hardball in these kinds of disputes, said Noah Bookbinder, executive director of the nonprofit Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics. I would imagine any local official would at least have a moment of pause before going as hard as they otherwise would against the Trump companies. But some local officials said they would handle Trump-related disputes in the same manner as any other, without fear or favor. In Floridas Palm Beach County, where a Trump golf course was challenging its tax bill, the county mayor, Paulette Burdick, allowed that Trumps position as president would pop into my mind but insisted that officials treat every resident equally. A White House spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment. The Trump Organization also did not respond to requests for comment. Although federal conflicts of interest law does not apply to the president, Trump has nevertheless faced criticism since his election about the potential conflicts posed by his business empire. Past officeholders have generally placed their assets in a blind trust to avoid any appearance of impropriety.  Trump, however, has refused to do so, instead turning over day-to-day management of his companies to his two adult sons without divesting his stake. Ethics experts have said that solution does nothing to address the problem, since Trump still stands to profit from businesses that remain under the control of his immediate family. According to public records and interviews with officials, Trumps pending tax disputes at the time of his inauguration included cases in Florida, where his lawyers challenged the tax bills for two Trump-owned golf courses; Washington, D.C., where Trumps new hotel sued the district over its assessment; and Chicago, where Trumps company filed multiple lawsuits seeking property tax relief for a hotel. New York City records show Trump companies were seeking tax breaks for commercial space at both Trump Tower and Trump International Hotel and Tower. The president also filed appeals in Los Angeles County over the value of his Beverly Hills mansion. Over the years, Trump has repeatedly brought lawsuits against Palm Beach, Florida, for various issues related to Mar-A-Lago, his winter White House, though no case is active. His golf courses also frequently require permits from local governments for construction and development. Federal decisions on everything from antiterrorism funding to infrastructure projects can have an outsized impact on states and cities. The mere appearance of a possible quid pro quo undermines public confidence, said Larry Noble, the general counsel for the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan group dedicated to democratic reform. It just distorts the decision-making field, he said. There are numerous ways a president can help a local government  or not. Not all local officials share Levenbergs concerns. In Palm Beach County, Steven Abrams is both a county commissioner and the chairman of the value adjustment board, which handles tax appeals, placing him squarely in the middle of the issue. But he said Trumps status would have no impact on the process. There are pretty standard formulas for determining property values, he said. Theres not a lot of room for discretion based on who you are. For her part, Levenberg said the prospect of going up against the presidents business is really scary. But she said she has become more emboldened in recent months after receiving supportive emails from residents urging her to hold the line.  You should be paying your share of taxes, she said. You need to shoulder your part of the community burden. And if youre not doing it, that means everybody is picking up the slack for you. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do and theres tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact, he told CNBC.  So no, I would not agree that its a primary contributor to the global warming that we see, Pruitt said. But we dont know that yet, we need to continue to debate, continue the review and analysis. Trump campaigned on a promise to roll back environmental regulations ushered in by former President Barack Obama, including those aimed at combating climate change. He framed his stand as aimed at boosting U.S. businesses, including the oil and gas drilling and coal mining industries. We can be pro-growth, pro-jobs and pro-environment, Pruitt said Wednesday afternoon in a Houston speech at CERAWeek, the worlds largest gathering of energy executives. Scientists immediately criticized Pruitts statement, saying it ignores a large body of evidence collected over decades that shows fossil fuel burning as the main factor in climate change. We cant afford to reject this clear and compelling scientific evidence when we make public policy. Embracing ignorance is not an option, Ben Santer, climate researcher at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, said in a statement.  The Supreme Court unleashed a fury of regulation and litigation when it ruled in 2007 that greenhouse gases are an air pollutant that can be regulated under the Clean Air Act. Two years later, the EPA declared carbon dioxide and five other heat-trapping gases to be pollutants. Pruitt said the Supreme Courts decision should not have been viewed as permission for the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide emissions. Decisions were made at the executive branch level that didnt respect the rule of law, Pruitt said in his Houston speech.  Pruitt has previously said the EPA should not regulate CO2 without a law passed by Congress authorizing it to do so. The Republican-controlled Congress could potentially issue a strong signal to the EPA that carbon dioxide should not be regulated by the agency, a move that would undermine many Obama-era rules aimed at curbing emissions. Administrator Pruitt is correct, the Congress has never explicitly given the EPA the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as a pollutant and the committee has no plans to do so, said Mike Danylak, spokesman for the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, the panel that oversees the EPA.  When asked at his confirmation hearing in January whether he would uphold the EPA endangerment finding, Pruitt said it was the law of the land and he was obliged to uphold it for now. Pruitt declined to respond to a question from a reporter after his Houston speech on whether he would now seek to overturn the endangerment finding.  As Oklahomas attorney general, Pruitt and another dozen attorney generals unsuccessfully challenged the endangerment finding in a federal appeals court. The mask is off. After obscuring his true views during his Senate confirmation hearings, Scott Pruitt has outed himself as a pure climate denier, said David Doniger, director of the climate program at the Natural Resources Defense Council. The new EPA chief said he was committed to ensuring thorough processes for environmental rules and regulations to reduce regulatory uncertainty. Pruitt added that he shared Trumps view that the global climate accord agreed by nearly 200 countries in Paris in 2015 was a bad deal. Trump promised during his campaign for the White House to pull the United States out of the accord, but has since been mostly quiet on the issue.

He has not worked on that matter at the Department of State, and will play no role in the deliberations or ultimate resolution of TransCanadas application, said the letter from Katherine McManus, the State Departments deputy legal adviser. McManus letter came after Greenpeace wrote to officials at the State Department and the Office of Government Ethics on Wednesday, urging Tillerson recuse himself from any decisions on the multibillion-dollar pipeline, given his former role as chief executive officer of Exxon Mobil Corp.. Greenpeace argued in its letter that Exxon Mobil would directly and predictably benefit from the approval of Keystone XL because the firm has investments in Canadian oil sands. Tillerson recused himself from the matter in early February, McManus wrote. TransCanada tried for more than five years to build the 1,179-mile (1,897-km) pipeline, until President Barack Obama rejected it in 2015. TransCanada resubmitted its application for the Keystone project in January, after Obamas White House successor, Donald Trump, signed an order smoothing its path. The line is designed to link existing pipeline networks in Canada and the United States to bring crude from Alberta and North Dakota to refineries in Illinois en route to the Gulf of Mexico. Exxon has a majority stake in Imperial Oil, a Calgary, -Alberta-based company that operates the Kearl oil sands project in northern Alberta. Exxon Mobil could benefit from the approval of the pipeline if it has specific contracts or agreements with TransCanada either to transport their Canadian tar sands production, or to receive such shipments at their U.S. refineries, Greenpeace wrote in its letter on Wednesday. Tillerson wrote in a January letter to McManus that for one year after his resignation from Exxon Mobil, he will not participate personally and substantially in any particular matter involving specific parties in which I know that Exxon Mobil is a party or represents a party, unless I am first authorized to participate. He also wrote that on a case-by-case basis, he would recuse himself from participation in any particular matter involving specific parties in which I determine that a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts would question my impartiality in the matter, unless I am first authorized to participate.

The Department of Justice is deploying 50 judges to immigration detention facilities across the United States, according to two sources and a letter seen by Reuters and sent to judges. Trump meets with community bankers and promises them he will to strip away some Dodd-Frank financial regulations and ensure they can continue giving small businesses access to capital.

In doing so, the often blustery Trump faces a test of credibility for the voters that catapulted him into office: How does a celebrity outsider, the CEO president, cut deals in Washington? Does the New York businessman live up to the image of dealmaker in chief? Interviews with more than a dozen White House and congressional aides, members of Congress and conservative activists offer a glimpse into his attempts at conducting the most formidable, high-stakes negotiation of his presidency. They show a more circumspect Trump than many see publicly. While they acknowledge he can make his points with a blunt and combustible style, he appears to be doing more listening than talking, they said, trying to appease both supporters and critics by signaling flexibility over legislation that faces criticism on multiple fronts.  Democrats and some influential Republicans say it would rip health insurance away from millions of Americans and increase costs for many others, including voters who helped elect Trump - a problem that could haunt his fellow Republicans in 2018 congressional elections. Conservatives say it does not go far enough in gutting the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obamas signature healthcare reform passed by Democrats in 2010. Republicans have long sought to dismantle the law, which they see as government overreach. Trump has called Obamacare a disaster and made its repeal and replacement a key campaign pledge. The political stakes are immense for an eight-week-old  presidency marked by instability, infighting, battles with the media, questions over temperament and a stubborn investigation into ties between his campaign and Russian intelligence. A lot of times you have politicians who gather in a room to pontificate. Thats not why he has gathered people in the room, a senior White House official said of Trumps negotiation style this week. Hes gathered people in to hear their opinions. I think thats lost a little bit because he does speak so forcefully. He definitely does let them say their piece, and he listens. The president has reached out to influential conservatives such as U.S. Senator Ted Cruz and groups such as the Heritage Foundation and Americans for Prosperity, which have expressed skepticism about the bill. He was gregarious, reasonable. He listened. It was a not a lecture, said Tim Phillips, president of AFP, a group backed by billionaires Charles and David Koch and part of a small group of conservative leaders who met with Trump in the Oval Office on Wednesday night. He said: This is a negotiation. Lets figure out ways to make this proposal better, Phillips said of Trump.  Trump has indicated he will only go so far to make conservatives happy, insisting the core elements of the bill must remain intact if it has any chance to pass the House of Representatives and then the Senate, both controlled by Republicans. One sticking point involves the use of tax credits to help consumers purchase health insurance, which Trump favors. Hes made it clear this is the vehicle to finally undo the damage of Obamacare and repeal and replace it, said another senior White House official. And if it can be improved in this process, he has encouraged that. Trump is operating with a razor-thin margin for success. A defection by 20 or so Republicans in the House could sink the bills prospects. There is already discontent among some in the Senate, where Republicans hold an even slimmer edge. Democrats and groups such as AARP, which advocates for older Americans, and the American Medical Association have come out strongly against the bill.  Conservatives in the House and advocacy groups opposed to the bill would like to slow the process and rework its fundamentals. They argue the legislation retains basic facets of Obamacare, including federal assistance to purchase health insurance and penalties if coverage lapses.  House Speaker Paul Ryan is hoping to pass the legislation within two weeks so the House can move on to other priorities. That leaves little time for wholesale alterations. Representative Kevin Brady, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said he expected the bill would largely remain in its current form. I know lots of people have good ideas. Thats terrific. And those will fit in future bills. The White House has tried to persuade conservatives that the House bill is just the first step in a three-step process, and will soon be joined by a companion bill that would embrace some of their policy priorities. Regulations put in place by Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price will also address their concerns, aides said.  The challenge for Trump is whether he can convince enough wary conservatives to back the first step of the plan without being able to guarantee the other phases will come to pass. It could leave them on the record voting for a bill they do not feel adequately dismantles Obamacare. Some conservatives may also not see the point of sticking their necks out backing a bill that may die in the Senate. This is a futile effort, said Rachel Bovard, a policy analyst for the Heritage Foundation, which opposes the bill. The White House is aggressively making the case that the House bill is the best chance to do away with Obamacare. Moving too far rightward to placate conservatives could stir up opposition from moderate Republicans and lead to a bill that stokes a powerful backlash among millions of Americans who would lose health insurance - including many Republicans. Many Democrats are already planning to run campaigns on the issue. The White House was busy this week trying to reassure moderate Republicans as well. Vice President Mike Pence is holding meetings in Congress, including with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican aide said. Trumps budget director, Mick Mulvaney, a former House member, has invited conservative lawmakers to dinner at the White House next Tuesday.  Trump plans to leverage the power of his office in another way, making trips to Kentucky and Tennessee in coming days to sell the House bill to the American public.  Earlier this week, Trump welcomed about 30 Republican House members, many of whom said they had never been in the White House before - a contrast in style from Obama, who was often criticized for not attempting to engage more fully with Congress. In the East Room, Trump told them to come back every week.  Grover Norquist, a longtime conservative tax advocate, praised Trumps strategy, saying: He is making people feel loved and appreciated and part of the team.

The new travel order, which is set to take effect on March 16, changed and replaced a more sweeping ban issued on Jan. 27 that caused chaos and protests at airports. The first order was hit by more than two dozen lawsuits, including a challenge brought by Washington state and joined by Minnesota. In response to Washingtons suit, U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle ordered an emergency halt to the policy last month. That ruling was upheld by an appeals court in San Francisco. Washington state Attorney General Robert Ferguson said on Thursday he planned to ask Robart to confirm that his ruling would also apply to Trumps revised order, which would halt it from being implemented. Ferguson told a news conference the new order harmed a smaller group of individuals but that would not affect the states ability to challenge it in court.  He said the burden was on the Trump administration to show that the court ruling from last month did not apply to its new policy.  A U.S. Department of Justice spokeswoman declined to comment on pending litigation. The government has said the president has wide authority to implement immigration policy and that the travel rules are necessary to protect against terrorist attacks. New Yorks attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, said on Thursday he would be joining Washingtons lawsuit against the new ban and the state of Oregon said it would join too.  The opposition comes on top of a separate legal challenge to the new ban brought by Hawaii on Wednesday. Hawaii had also sued over the previous order and is seeking to amend its complaint to include the new ban. A hearing in that case is set for next Wednesday, a day before the clock starts on the new order.     The states and immigration advocates argue the new ban, like the original one, discriminates against Muslims. Trumps new executive order was designed with the intention of avoiding the legal hurdles.  While the new order keeps a 90-day ban on travel to the United States by citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, it excludes Iraq.  Refugees are still halted from entering the country for 120 days, but the new order removed an indefinite ban on all refugees from Syria. The revisions include explicit exemptions for legal permanent residents or existing visa holders and waivers are allowed on a case-by-case basis for some business, diplomatic and other travelers.      The first hurdle for the lawsuits will be proving standing, which means finding someone who has been harmed by the policy.

The officials declined to discuss the subject of Comeys meeting with the group of leaders known as the Gang of Eight. U.S. President Donald Trump has alleged that the Obama administration wiretapped his election campaign. The Gang of Eight, who have routine access to highly classified materials, include House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes and its top Democrat, Adam Schiff. Senate members include Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, and the top Republican and Democrat on the intelligence committee, Senators Richard Burr and Mark Warner. The House intelligence committee on Wednesday asked the Justice Department in a letter for copies of documents which if they exist could shed light on Trumps allegation. A law enforcement source said the Federal Bureau of Investigation was in discussions with the National Security Division of the Justice Department as to how to respond to public and congressional inquiries about the existence or non-existence of such eavesdropping. If Trumps campaign or advisers were indeed being wiretapped, the most likely legal path for the Obama administration to do so would be to have the Justice Department ask the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for permission to eavesdrop. Trump accused predecessor Barack Obama on Saturday of wiretapping him during the late stages of the campaign, but offered no evidence for an allegation which an Obama spokesman said was simply false. The intelligence committees letter, addressed to Dana Boente, the acting Deputy U.S. Attorney General, also asks for copies of any such orders actually issued by the court and any electronic surveillance warrants related to Trump or his associates issued last year by a federal judge or magistrate under a wide-ranging anti-crime law. Reuters saw a copy of the letter, signed by Nunes and Schiff, on Thursday. The letter has not been publicly released. Nunes said on Tuesday he had seen no evidence to support Trumps wiretapping allegation. Law enforcement sources have said that the FBI is pursuing a wide-ranging counter-intelligence investigation of alleged contacts between Trump associates and Russians, as well as two separate investigations into pre-election email hacking linked to Russia which mainly targeted Democratic political operatives.

In separate meetings, the Senate Banking Committee led by Idaho Republican Chairman Mike Crapo and the House Financial Services Committee led by Texas Republican Jeb Hensarling approved a series of identical bills, paving the way votes by the full Senate and House of Representatives. It is not yet known when both chambers may take up the bills. The move is part of an effort by Congress to streamline the U.S. financial sector, and it comes at the same time that U.S. President Donald Trump is pushing to repeal or replace regulations which he contends could impede economic growth. The bills won broad bipartisan support in both committees, with minimal dissent. Sherrod Brown, the Senate panels ranking Democrat, praised the bipartisan work and said he was optimistic there are additional common sense measures that can tackled next. The bills propose changes to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissions regulations, such as raising the dollar amount of stock options that private companies can award employees in a given year to $10 million from $5 million and easing restrictions to allow brokers to publish research on the global $3.7 trillion exchange-traded fund market. Other changes in the bills would raise the number of people who can invest in venture capital funds without triggering a requirement to register with the SEC; subject mutual funds in Puerto Rico to the same rules funds already face on the U.S. mainland, and credit stock exchanges for any fees and assessments they may have overpaid to the SEC in the last decade. The House Financial Services Committee also on Thursday approved a sixth bill that would require the SEC to formally consider and respond to regulatory proposals that are made annually by the agencys Government-Business Forum on Small Business Capital Formation. The Senate panel did not consider that bill on Thursday, but Banking Committee spokeswoman Amanda Critchfield said she expects it will be considered in the future. Pennsylvania Republican Senator Pat Toomey, who co-sponsored the bill involving private company stock options, said on Thursday he is hopeful the measure will be considered by the full Senate soon. The dual committee meetings were the first time since the November election that the Republican-led Congress has convened to consider financial legislation. The House Financial Services Committee, meanwhile, is also separately preparing to unveil a more comprehensive rewrite of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation, which will also include measures to boost capital formation. Trumps choice to lead the SEC, Wall Street deal-making attorney Jay Clayton, has previously discussed ideas with Trump privately on how to help spur capital formation.

We are still working out the logistics for this trip, so (we) cannot yet speak definitively as to whether well be able to accommodate any press on the Secretarys plane, State Department spokesman Mark Toner wrote in an email.Going forward, the State Department will do everything it can to accommodate a contingent of traveling media on board the Secretarys plane.  The State Department told reporters earlier this week that Tillerson would not take any of them on a March 15-19 trip to Japan, South Korea and China, countries of strategic, military and economic interest to the United States. Major news organizations complained, among them the BBC, CNN, New York Times, Washington Post and Reuters. North Korea, which fired four ballistic missiles into the sea off Japans northwest coast on Monday, angering both South Korea and Japan, is likely to be a key topic of Tillersons trip. Asked earlier this week why Tillerson was not taking media with him, a State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told reporters the plane is too small to accommodate ... he carries a much smaller footprint in terms of personnel, and thats not just press.  Toner did not respond when asked whether Tillerson had tried to get a larger Air Force plane or how the department would respond to critics who described the plan as self-defeating.   Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and other past State Department officials questioned Tillersons plan, saying that by including reporters, the chief U.S. diplomat could make the administrations case and prevent other countries from dominating coverage of U.S. policy. Albright, secretary of state under Democrat Bill Clinton, told MSNBCs Andrea Mitchell Reports on Wednesday taking the news media demonstrates a U.S. commitment to a free press. President Donald Trump, a Republican, has accused news outlets of fake news and called journalists the enemy of the people. Richard Boucher, a retired U.S. diplomat who served as State Department spokesman from 2000 to 2005 under Albright as well as  Republicans Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, could not recall a time during his tenure when reporters did not fly on the plane. Since becoming secretary of state on Feb. 1, Tillerson, a former Exxon Mobil Corp chief executive, has traveled to Germany and Mexico, in both cases inviting fewer media than his predecessors for at least the last 50 years.

Trump, joined by National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, said community banks play a vital role in the U.S. economy. Nearly half of all private-sector workers are employed by small businesses. We must ensure access to capital to small businesses and for small businesses to grow. Community banks are the backbone of small business in America, Trump said at the beginning of the meeting. Representing the industry were chief executives of nine community banks with assets of around $1 billion or less and the heads of the American Bankers Association and the Independent Community Bankers of America (ICBA). Bankers who attended the 45-minute meeting said they discussed the role community banks play in rural areas and provided real-world examples about the difficulties smaller banking institutions face. The bankers emphasized the need for tailoring regulations to fit the size and complexity of banks, said Chesapeake Financial Shares Inc Chairman and CEO Jeffrey Szyperski, one of the bankers in the meeting. Chesapeake is a regional bank headquartered in Kilmarnock, Virginia, that has 14 branches and a separate wealth management division. We were very focused our message on how do we create a tiered and proportionate regulatory environment for community banks, said Rebeca Romero Rainey, head of Centinel Bank of Taos, a community bank in New Mexico. The idea seemed to resonate with Trump, who asked questions and showed a pre-existing understanding of the community banking landscape, according to those in attendance. ICBA, one of the industry groups at the meeting, has advocated a tiered system of regulations that tailor regulations to a banks size, business model, complexity and risk.  The type of regulation that you need for a $700 million bank and the risks they present are very different than those for a $200 billion bank or a $1 trillion bank, a White House official said before the meeting.  Larger banks are able to spread their higher compliance costs over much bigger asset and employee bases, while smaller banks struggle with high costs and workloads. One of the institutions participating, Standard Financial Corp of Monroeville, Pennsylvania, has just nine branches with $488 million in assets and earnings of $559,000 in the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2016. It plans to merge with a rival in southwestern Pennsylvania in a deal that will roughly double its size. Trump officials cited a dearth of applications to form new community banks and around a 30 percent drop in the number of small U.S. banks since 2008 as the impetus for the meeting. A smaller bank has gone out of business every day for the past seven years, Szyperski said, citing the Dodd-Frank financial reform law enacted after the 2007-2008 financial crisis as a reason new banks had not formed in their stead.  Trump promised the bankers that his February executive order on reducing regulation was very powerful and would apply to the community banking sector. Mnuchin, the former CEO of OneWest bank, a regional lender in Southern California, said at his confirmation hearing in January that onerous regulations are killing community banks. He pledged to ease those burdens while maintaining proper regulation, so that we dont end up with a world where we only have four big banks in this country. Also discussed at the meeting were the compliance costs associated with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), a new regulator created under Dodd-Frank.  The CFPB is a perennial target for Republicans, who want to shift its funding from the Federal Reserve to annual appropriations by Congress and shift its management, now concentrated in a powerful chairman, to a multi-person commission structure. Separately on Thursday, when asked during a briefing with reporters whether Trump still backs his campaign pledge to restore the Glass-Steagall Act, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said that he did. The law, which separated commercial and investment banking activities, was repealed in 1999 and, if reinstated, would mainly apply to larger banks. The Trump administration has not made any moves thus far to break up big banks. Investors have bid up bank stocks since Trumps election on expectations they would get regulatory relief but not be forced to divest. There is little indication such legislation is an imminent priority that will be taken up by the administration or the U.S. Congress. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Coats must still be confirmed by the full Senate to be the top U.S. intelligence official. The popular former lawmaker, who also served as ambassador to Germany, is expected to be confirmed easily. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence was created after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to oversee all 16 U.S. intelligence agencies and improve communications among them. Coats, 73, replaces James Clapper, who retired as President Barack Obama left office. Coats was a member of the Senate intelligence panel until he retired from the Senate at the end of last year. He pledged during his confirmation hearing on Feb. 28 to support a thorough investigation of any Russian effort to influence the 2016 presidential election. Wyden, one of the Senates leading privacy advocates, said he voted against his former colleague because he felt that the office of the Director of National Intelligence had not provided the committee with enough information about how many Americans communication records have been subjected to government surveillance. Given that there has not been a firm commitment to deliver this critical information, I cannot support any DNI nominee without that material, Wyden said in a statement. Harris said that after consideration of Coats record on a range of issues, she concluded she could not support his nomination. Senators Richard Burr, the committees Republican chairman, and Mark Warner, its top Democrat, both said they were pleased the committee had backed Coats.

Transgender rights are a politically charged issue in the United States. Supporters say bills like the one blocked on Thursday protect people who do not conform to their birth gender, while opponents say they could give cover to voyeurs and sexual predators. The 187-179 vote by the Republican-controlled New Hampshire House of Representatives to table the bill without debate came one day after Governor Chris Sununu, also a Republican, said he had no position on the matter.  Many Democrats had supported the bill. With Sununus support, the bill, which was tabled by a slim margin, would be on its way to the corner office, said Ray Buckley, chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party. His silence and apathy are a tacit endorsement of discrimination, and he will have to live with the fact that he denied many transgender people the freedom that is granted through equality under the law. A spokesman for Sununu whose father, John Sununu, was a New Hampshire governor and later White House chief of staff in the first Bush administration, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. This was the latest in a string of defeats for transgender rights this week. The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday threw out a lower court ruling in favor of a Virginia transgender student after President Donald Trump rescinded a policy put in place last year protecting such youths. A Texas Senate committee on Wednesday approved a bill that would require people to use public restrooms that match the gender on their birth certificates. That measure is similar to one passed last year in North Carolina, which sparked boycotts that are estimated to have cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars. Due to economic concerns, analysts do not expect the Texas measure to pass the state House. Despite their dominance in New Hampshires government, Republicans in the state legislature do not unanimously support the partys national agenda. Last month state legislators blocked a bill that would have allowed employees in union-represented jobs not to pay dues. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The vote was largely along party lines, a contrast with  strong bipartisan support for past ambassadors to Israel. Democratic Senator Robert Menendez joined all 11 committee Republicans in backing Friedman, despite concerns about his temperament. Friedman, who has no diplomatic experience, is a long-time friend of Trump who has worked for the New York businessman as a bankruptcy lawyer.  In addition to investing in settlements on land claimed by the Palestinians, Friedman favors moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem. The relocation is strongly opposed by many U.S. allies because both Israel and the Palestinians claim the city as their capital. Trumps selection of Friedman reflects his shift in policy toward Israel after years of friction between former President Barack Obama and Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu. Unlike Obama, Trump has wavered on the U.S. commitment to a two-state solution, long a bedrock of Washingtons Middle East policy, and backed the embassys relocation. Friedman is also known for using inflammatory language against those with whom he has political disagreements. Democrats said his approach could risk security. The region is incredibly volatile. The last thing we need in this position is someone who has a penchant for over-the-top, hyperbolic, and even false statements, Democratic Senator Tim Kaine said. Friedman has called Obama an anti-Semite, and dismissed the liberal-leaning pro-Israel group J Street as far worse than kapos, a reference to Jews who worked for the Nazis in World War Two concentration camps. J Street and the Reform Jewish Movement are among groups opposing Friedmans nomination. Friedman was heckled during his contentious February confirmation hearing. He said then that he regretted the use of such language. Senator Ben Cardin, the committees ranking Democrat, said Friedman also was problematic because he does not explicitly back a two-state solution for Middle East peace. Friedman will next be considered by the full Senate, where Trumps fellow Republicans control a slim majority. He is expected to be confirmed despite continued Democratic opposition. Republican Senator Bob Corker, the Foreign Relations Committee chairman, praised Friedman as an impassioned advocate for strong U.S.-Israeli ties. He understands the complexity of issues at stake for the United States and the necessity to support a democratic ally in an important and unstable part of the world, Corker said.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives have unveiled a plan to replace Obamacare, known formally as the Affordable Care Act, stripping away much of President Barack Obamas signature domestic policy achievement that insured 20 million Americans.  President Donald Trump and his Republicans had vowed for years to dismantle the law. It was a central campaign issue in 2016. The House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee approved the bill along party lines early Thursday after nearly 18 hours of debate.  The House Energy and Commerce Committee was still debating the bill Thursday, after an all-night session where Democrats fought the measure and used numerous tactics to delay a vote. The bill could still change substantially as it makes its way through committees. Here are its main provisions:  The Republicans want to eliminate next year Obamacares income-based tax credits that help low-income people purchase individual insurance. These would be replaced with tax credits ranging from $2,000 to $4,000 per year that would be capped at upper income levels. While Obamacares credits provided more assistance to those with lower incomes, those in the Republican plan would be largely based on age.  The Republican bill would abolish most Obamacare taxes, including taxes on medical devices, health insurance premiums,  tanning salons and prescription medications. It would also delay a tax on high-cost employer-provided insurance known as Cadillac plans until 2025. Those taxes paid for Obamacare. Republicans have not said how they would pay for the parts of the law they want to keep.  The bill also repeals the Obamacare financial penalty for the 2016 tax year for not purchasing insurance, as well as a surtax on investment income earned by upper-income Americans.  And it repeals the mandate that larger employers must offer insurance to their employees. Under Obamacare, more than 30 states, including several Republican states, made the Medicaid government health insurance more accessible to the poor. About half of Obamacare enrollees obtained insurance through the expansion. The bill would allow the Medicaid expansion to continue until January 1, 2020, providing states that chose not to expand under Obamacare a window to enroll more people. After that date, the expansion would end and Medicaid funding would be capped on a per-person basis. States that did not expand Medicaid would receive additional funds through a number of changes, including the reinstatement of disproportionate share hospital payments, money that is provided to hospitals that serve a large number of Medicaid and uninsured people. State Medicaid plans would no longer have to cover the same essential health benefits that health insurers on Obamacares exchanges must provide. That fulfills a Republican promise to return more control to the states, as they can decide what their Medicaid plans must cover. The Republican plan would maintain some of Obamacares most popular provisions. It would allow young people to stay on their parents health plan until age 26, ban insurers from discriminating against those with pre-existing conditions and bans insurers from setting a lifetime dollar limit on coverage. But the bill would allow insurers to mark up premiums by 30 percent for those who have a lapse in insurance coverage of about two months or more.  Insurers won another provision they had long sought: The ability to charge older Americans up to five times more than young people. Under Obamacare, they could only charge up to three times more. It would also allow states to set their own ratio.  The measure also provides states with $100 billion to create programs for patient populations, including high-risk pools to provide insurance to the sickest patients. The bill would also revoke federal funding for Planned Parenthood for one year. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Contractors likely breached security and handed over documents describing the Central Intelligence Agencys use of hacking tools to anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks, U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials told Reuters on Wednesday. Two officials speaking on condition of anonymity said intelligence agencies have been aware since the end of last year of the breach, which led to WikiLeaks releasing thousands of pages of information on its website on Tuesday. According to the documents, CIA hackers could get into Apple Inc (AAPL.O) iPhones, devices running Googles Android software and other gadgets in order to capture text and voice messages before they were encrypted with sophisticated software. The White House said on Wednesday that President Donald Trump was extremely concerned about the CIA security breach that led to the WikiLeaks release. Anybody who leaks classified information will be held to the highest degree of law, spokesman Sean Spicer said. The two officials told Reuters they believed the published documents about CIA hacking techniques used between 2013 and 2016 were authentic. One of the officials with knowledge of the investigation said companies that are contractors for the CIA have been checking to see which of their employees had access to the material that WikiLeaks published, and then going over their computer logs, emails and other communications for any evidence of who might be responsible. On Tuesday in a press release, WikiLeaks itself said the CIA had lost control of an archive of hacking methods and it  appeared to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive. The CIA, which is the United States civilian foreign intelligence service, declined to comment on the authenticity of purported intelligence documents.  The agency said in a statement that its mission was to collect foreign intelligence abroad to protect America from terrorists, hostile nation states and other adversaries and to be innovative, cutting-edge, and the first line of defense in protecting this country from enemies abroad. The CIA is legally prohibited from surveillance inside the United States and does not do so, the statement added. A U.S. government source familiar with the matter said it would be normal for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the CIA both to open investigations into such leaks. U.S. officials previously have confirmed that prosecutors in Alexandria, Virginia for years have been conducting a federal grand jury investigation of WikiLeaks and its personnel.  A spokesman for the prosecutors declined to comment on the possibility of that probe being expanded. It is not clear if the investigation of the latest CIA leaks is part of the probe. Contractors have been revealed as the source of sensitive government information leaks in recent years, most notably Edward Snowden and Harold Thomas Martin, both employed by consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH.N) while working for the National Security Agency.  U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California and a Democrat on the intelligence committee, said the government needed to stop the breaches.   I think we really need to take a look at the contractor portion of the employee workforce, because you have to be loyal to America to work for an intelligence agency, otherwise dont do it, Feinstein said. Both U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives intelligence committees have either opened or are expected to open inquiries into the CIA breach, congressional officials said. Some cyber security experts and technology companies have criticized the government for opting to exploit rather than disclose software vulnerabilities, though an interagency review process set up under former President Barack Obama was intended to err on the side of disclosure. Those concerns would grow if U.S. authorities did not notify companies that CIA documents describing various hacking techniques had been compromised. Apple, Alphabet Incs (GOOGL.O) Google, Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) and Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) did not immediately respond when asked if they were notified of a CIA breach before WikiLeaks made its files public. At Apple, none of the vulnerabilities described in the documents provoked a panic, though analysis was continuing, according to a person who spoke with engineers there. Googles director of information security and privacy,  Heather Adkins, said in a statement: As weve reviewed the documents, were confident that security updates and protections in both Chrome and Android (operating systems) already shield users from many of these alleged vulnerabilities. Our analysis is ongoing and we will implement any further necessary protections. One reason the investigation is focused on a potential leak by contractors rather than for example a hack by Russian intelligence, another official said, is that so far there is no evidence that Russian intelligence agencies tried to exploit any of the leaked material before it was published. One European official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the WikiLeaks material could in fact lead to closer cooperation between European intelligence agencies and U.S. counterparts, which share concerns about Russian intelligence operations. U.S. intelligence agencies have accused Russia of seeking to tilt last years U.S. presidential election in Trumps favor,  including by hacking into Democratic Party emails. Moscow has denied the allegation. One major security problem was that the number of contractors with access to information with the highest secrecy classification has exploded because of federal budget constraints, the first U.S. official said. U.S. intelligence agencies have been unable to hire additional permanent staff needed to keep pace with technological advances such as the internet of things that connects cars, home security and heating systems and other devices to computer networks, or to pay salaries competitive with the private sector, the official said. Reuters could not immediately verify the contents of the published documents.  A person familiar with WikiLeaks activities said the group has had the CIA hacking material for months, and that the release of the material was in the works for a long time. In Germany on Wednesday, the chief federal prosecutors office said that it would review the WikiLeaks documents because some suggested that the CIA ran a hacking hub from the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt. We will initiate an investigation if we see evidence of concrete criminal acts or specific perpetrators, a spokesman for the federal prosecutors office told Reuters. Chancellor Angela Merkel is scheduled to visit Washington on March 14 for her first meeting with Trump, who has sharply criticized Berlin for everything from its trade policy to what he considers inadequate levels of military spending.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The disclosure this week of documents describing secret CIA hacking tools shows that intensified U.S. government efforts to prevent leaks by intelligence agency employees and contractors have largely failed, cyber security professionals and intelligence officials say. If the Central Intelligence Agency disclosures are confirmed to be the work of an intelligence agency contractor, as government investigators currently suspect, it would be at least the third public case in recent years in which special software and human resources programs intended to catch so-called insider threats have not  worked. The anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks, which published the CIA documents Tuesday, said it obtained the archive after it circulated among former U.S. government contractors in an unauthorized manner.  Part of the problem in combating leaks is that the number of government employees and contractors with access to highly sensitive information has exploded in recent years, due in part to greater information-sharing across the government that was mandated in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.  Budget constraints that force agencies to rely on contractors rather than permanent staff have also contributed to the problem, intelligence officials say. Government estimates of how many people have been granted Top Secret clearances range from the high hundreds of thousands to more than a million across thousands of public agencies and private companies. Government agencies estimate that there is one insider threat for every 6,000 to 8,000 employees, an intelligence agency contractor said, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of upsetting his employer. The contractor said there is too much sharing of information internally, with many workers having access to material they do not need. Recognizing the dangers, former President Barack Obama signed an executive order creating the National Insider Threat Task Force in 2011, following the disclosures of hundreds of thousands of State Department cables that were stolen by former Army private Chelsea Manning and provided to WikiLeaks.  The order covered virtually every federal department and agency, including the Department of Education, the Peace Corps and other offices not directly involved in national security. The program requires federal employees to monitor co-workers for suspicious actions based on behavioral profiling. Those who fail to report high-risk people or behaviors could face penalties, including criminal charges. Insider threat investigations can also be launched when computer network monitoring detects suspicious user behavior, according to government documents. Monitoring of prospective and current government employees has only increased in recent years. Under a directive issued in May 2016 by James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence, U.S. officials evaluating whether employees should continue to have access to classified information can collect publicly available social media posts of those workers. Despite the new initiatives and a raft of innovative employee monitoring technologies developed by the NSA and private-sector tech companies, insider threats remain the greatest worry across government and industry, said Curtis Dukes, the former head of cyber defense at the National Security Agency who now works at the Center for Internet Security, a non-profit organization committed to protecting against cyber threats. Tuesdays leaks came at a time when U.S. intelligence agencies were already reeling from the discovery that former contractor Harold Martin had allegedly spent 20 years stealing secrets from the NSA and three other intelligence agencies before finally being caught last summer. Martin worked for Booz Allen Hamilton, the same consulting firm that employed Edward Snowden, who in 2013 exposed details about U.S. spying programs. This weeks dump of CIA files is especially alarming because the spy agency is considered the gold standard for monitoring and tracking insiders, according to Larry Pfeiffer, chief of staff to then-CIA director Michael Hayden. Leo Taddeo, chief security officer at Cryptzone and a former special agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigations cyber crime division in New York, said the Sept. 11 attacks prompted a significant expansion in the number of facilities and government contractors who had access to sensitive information. A 2003 report on the attacks concluded the plot could have been disrupted if not for lapses of communication between the CIA and FBI. That finding and others forced a restructuring of how U.S. intelligence agencies share information, overcoming resistance by some officials who worried the new arrangement could create new problems. We need for the right people to see the right dots, so they can connect them, but the counter argument is you increase the insider risk and that compromise has a greater impact, Taddeo said. Chris Inglis, former deputy director of the NSA, gave a presentation entitled How to Catch a Snowden to a jam-packed room last month at the RSA cyber security conference in San Francisco. The talk was so popular that conference organizers had Inglis present twice. Inglis said companies, as well as governments, need to embrace continuous monitoring of employees and the use of behavioral analytics to spot potential leakers, and to directly involve human resources departments in detection efforts. Some companies have been hesitant to adopt such strategies, Inglis said, but a raft of breaches in recent years has led to a growing embrace of more aggressive approaches. The unfortunate truth is youre only going to suffer this one in a million times, but that one in a million can kill you, he said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Arguing that the new travel ban violates the U.S. Constitution, the state asked a Hawaii federal court to grant a temporary restraining order that should apply nationally. U.S. District Court Judge Derrick Watson ruled earlier in the day that the state could sue over Trumps new order, which was signed by the president on Monday.  It is the first legal challenge to the revised order. Watson said the state could revise its initial lawsuit, which had challenged Trumps original ban signed in January. A hearing is set for March 15, a day before the new ban is to go into effect.  The government has said the president has wide authority to implement immigration policy and that the travel rules are necessary to protect against terrorist attacks.  Some legal experts have said court challenges will be more difficult now because changes to the order give exemptions to more people.  The revised travel order changed and replaced the original, more sweeping ban issued on Jan. 27 that caused chaos and protests at airports and was challenged in more than two dozen lawsuits around the country. A federal judge in Seattle put the first order on hold, in a decision upheld by an appeals court in San Francisco. The new order is much more narrowly tailored. It keeps a 90-day ban on travel to the United States by citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, but excludes Iraq and applies the restriction only to new visa applicants. It also removed an indefinite ban on all refugees from Syria.  The order no longer covers legal residents or existing visa holders, and makes waivers possible for some business, diplomatic and other travelers.  Immigration advocates have said the new ban, like the original one, discriminates against Muslims. But the first hurdle in a lawsuit is proving standing to sue, which means finding someone who has been harmed by the policy. With so many exemptions, legal experts have said it might be hard to find individuals that a court would rule have a right to sue. Hawaii claims its state universities would be harmed by the order because they would have trouble recruiting students and faculty. It also says the island states economy would be hit by a decline in tourism. The court papers cite reports that travel to the United States took a nosedive after Trumps actions. The state was joined by a new plaintiff named Ismail Elshikh, an American citizen from Egypt who is an Imam at the Muslim Association of Hawaii whose mother-in-law lives in Syria, according to the lawsuit.   This second Executive Order is infected with the same legal problems as the first Order, the state said in court papers filed on Tuesday. The Presidents order is subjecting a portion of Hawaiis population, including Dr. Elshikh, his family, and members of his Mosque, to discrimination and second-class treatment, Hawaii said. The lawsuit says that Elshikh fears his mother-in-law will not be able to enter the country under the new order. The family is devastated, the filing said.  One of the groups eligible for waivers under the new ban are those seeking to visit or live with a close relative and who would face hardship if denied entry.  Adam Lauridsen, a San Francisco attorney representing students challenging Trumps first order, said the waiver provisions in the new ban are similar to case-by-case exemptions allowed in the first ban. Earlier legal challenges were allowed to move forward despite those waivers, he said. In support of its actions, the Trump administration has cited a section of law that says the president can suspend  entry to the United States by any class of foreigners if he finds it would be detrimental to the interests of the country.

The trademarks - which in theory cover a wide sweep of businesses from hotels to mobile libraries and escorts - underline the complexities and potential concerns over conflicts of interest facing President Trump, who has a sprawling business empire using the Trump name around the world. Trump, a wealthy real estate developer, has previously said he has handed over his business interests to a trust overseen by one of his sons and a Trump Organization executive. He can, however, revoke the trust at will and, as its sole beneficiary, remains linked to it financially. The trademarks - mostly variations in English and Chinese on the name Donald Trump - were given preliminary approval in two lists published on the Trademark Office of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce on Feb. 27 and Monday. Trumps lawyers applied for the trademarks in April last year, mostly registered to Donald J. Trump and listing to the address of Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in New York.  Some U.S. law makers have raised questions about whether Trumps position as President could prompt preferential treatment of his businesses. Trademark lawyers, however, said that the approval process did not seem that unusual. If they were filed in April last year and just now approved, its fairly normal, said Yong Heng Wu, Shanghai-based counsel for MWE China focused on intellectual property, adding the general timeframe for preliminary approvals was 6-9 months. I think the reason why people are paying so much attention to Donald Trump trademarks now is because he became the President of the most powerful country in the world. The trademarks cover business areas including branded spas, massage parlors, golf clubs, hotels, insurance, finance and real estate companies, retail shops, restaurants, bars, bodyguards and escort services. Intellectual property lawyers said trademark applications were often very broad to give the applicant the most comprehensive protection for their brand. Three of them, related to hotel brand Scion that Trumps sons want to expand in the United States, are not directly registered in the Presidents name but via DTTM Operations LLC. The three are also listed to the Trump Tower address. Asked about the approvals, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China had always equally protected trademarks for Chinese and foreign companies, adding that the approvals process had been carried out in line with the law. The preliminary approvals are open to be challenged for around a 90-day period. Barring objections they will be formally registered in late May and early June respectively. Trump and his family, like many business owners, hold trademarks around the world, from business sectors such as apparel in the Philippines to golf clubs in Australia and property in Japan and South Korea. These ties between politics and business have, however, prompted concern from politicians and rights groups who say the President could face potential conflicts of interest related to the extensive business affairs of his family. Alan Garten, general counsel for the Trump Organization, said in a statement the group had been actively enforcing its intellectual property rights in China for over a decade. The latest registrations are a natural result of those long-standing, diligent efforts, and any suggestion to the contrary demonstrates a complete disregard of the facts as well as a lack of understanding of international trademark law. Democratic Senator Ben Cardin, the ranking member on the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called for formal briefings about the Chinese trademark approvals and on the potential constitutional dangers that they present. Cardin has previously introduced a resolution demanding Trump cut his ties with the Trump Organization or risk violating the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, which bars public servants from accepting anything of value from foreign governments unless approved by Congress. Chang Tsi & Partners, listed as acting on behalf of Trumps team for the China trademark applications, did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment on the approvals. Trump received a single trademark approval last month in China for Trump-branded construction services, following a 10-year legal battle. The Associated Press earlier reported the approvals.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top U.S. doctors organization and several hospital groups came out strongly on Wednesday against a Republican plan backed by President Donald Trump to overhaul Americas healthcare system, as Democrats mounted a fierce battle to thwart the bill. Two House of Representatives committees debated the plan late into the night, two days after the proposals were unveiled by Republican leaders. The legislation aims to repeal and replace the Obamacare law, which Republicans call a government overreach that has ruined healthcare in the United States. Trump and fellow Republicans in Congress campaigned last year on a promise to dismantle the signature domestic policy achievement of Democratic former President Barack Obama.  However, they face resistance from conservatives in their own party who have condemned the bill as too similar to the law it is meant to supplant. Democrats, meanwhile, have denounced it as a gift to the wealthy that will take insurance away from millions of people. What theyre doing is very destructive. ... It represents the biggest shift of money to the wealthiest people in our country, the top 1 percent, at the cost of working families, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi told reporters. Doctors and other providers said the bill would probably cause many patients to lose insurance and raise healthcare costs. The American Medical Association urged senior lawmakers in a letter to reconsider drastic changes to Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor. The AMA, which supported Obamacare, said the replacement of income-based subsidies with age-based tax credits to help people buy insurance would make coverage more expensive, if not out of reach, for poor and sick Americans.  Obamacare, formally called the Affordable Care Act, enabled 20 million previously uninsured people to obtain coverage, about half through a Medicaid expansion the new bill would end. Insurers are worried about the affordability of the tax structure and proposed major changes in Medicaid financing. In a letter to Congress, Americas Health Insurance Plans, which represents Anthem Inc and others, indicated that was still a concern, despite many aspects of the draft that would help stabilize the individual insurance market. Seven hospital groups, including the American Hospital Association, Americas Essential Hospitals and the Catholic Health Association of the United States, also voiced opposition. They wrote in a letter to lawmakers that the proposal could lead to tremendous instability for people seeking affordable medical coverage, including children, the elderly and disabled. Republicans control both chambers of Congress and the White House for the first time in a decade. But the bills fate is far from certain, with a number of Republican conservatives saying it is not a full repeal and sets up new entitlement programs. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence met leaders of conservative groups who have concerns about the bill. Im encouraged that the president indicated they are pushing to make changes, David McIntosh from one of those groups, Club for Growth, told reporters after the meeting. A White House official said Trump and Pence were open to constructive improvements that maintain the core principles and get the bill over the goal. The House Ways and Means Committee, with jurisdiction over taxes, and the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees health issues, kicked off what could become marathon sessions working on the legislation. The plan would scrap the Obamacare requirement that most Americans obtain medical insurance and would replace its income-based subsidies with a system of fixed tax credits to coax people to buy private insurance on the open market. Trying to mollify skeptics in his party, House Speaker Paul Ryan, an architect of the plan, touted it as a conservative wish list and monumental, exciting conservative reform. Representative Mark Walker, head of the Republican Study Committee (RSC), the largest group of conservatives in Congress, said RSC leaders might support the bill if two changes are made. The first, proposed by Representative Joe Barton in the Energy and Commerce Committee, would bring forward the end of enrollment in Medicaid expansion by two years to January 2018. The second would make age-based tax credits for purchasing health insurance partially rather than fully refundable. With those changes, wed be a hard yes, Walker told reporters. Democrats were using every procedural maneuver possible to delay the committee work, including demanding votes to adjourn on the House floor. The top Energy and Commerce Committee Democrat, Representative Frank Pallone, called the Republican plan a prescription for disaster and said not a single hearing had been held to develop the bill. Republicans insisted on committee action even though the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) had not yet done its customary assessment of the cost of the measure and how many people it would cover.  White House spokesman Sean Spicer said: If youre looking at the CBO for accuracy, youre looking in the wrong place. Ways and Means Democrats raised questions over the bills proposed tax break for insurance company executives, with Representative Lloyd Doggett calling it a $400 million windfall for insurance company executives. Hospital stocks clawed back some of Tuesdays losses after the bills unveiling. Community Health Systems Inc rose 4.5 percent and Tenet Healthcare Corp gained 1.5 percent. Health insurer shares, including WellCare Health Plans Inc and Aetna Inc, closed moderately higher. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Security experts cite the terrifying hypothetical example of a remote attack on a fully autonomous vehicle with no steering wheel or brakes, in which the passenger would have no recourse to regain manual control of the car. You have a lot of car companies trying to design cars to be better suited to automation, which means theyre more attractive to hackers, said auto consultant Roger Lanctot of Strategy Analytics. A major strategy for automakers is to reduce the number of communications gateways to crucial systems and to require services offered by third parties to go through a single secure path. WikiLeaks documents show the CIA citing vehicle systems and a car operating system from QNX, owned by Blackberry Ltd, as potential mission areas for the CIAs Embedded Devices Branch to consider. The QNX operating system, which is used by most global automakers, provides a a comprehensive, multi-level, policy-driven security model ... to mitigate attacks, the company said in a statement to Reuters. But given the collection of software, hardware and network components that make up a connected car, security is only as strong as its weakest link, it said. While the CIAs interest in cars brought widespread attention, the industry has already received wakeup calls about cars potential to be hacked. Researchers in 2015 used a wireless connection to turn off a Jeep Cherokees engine, prompting a recall of 1.4 million vehicles by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. In September last year, Chinese cyber security researchers hacked a Tesla Inc Model S sedan, remotely tapping the brakes and popping the trunk. The electric carmaker subsequently patched the bugs using an over-the-air fix. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment on its cyber security protocol.  The hacking of the Jeep and the Tesla brought it home to the industry that even if its improbable its technically possible, said Mark Wakefield, global co-head of the automotive practice at AlixPartners.  If a car was seen as vulnerable, it could be a big brand problem, Wakefield said. Hacks could also expose private information shared between car and third parties - credit card numbers, account numbers or passwords - to theft. A January survey by the University of Michigans Transportation Research Institute found that 33 percent of respondents said they were extremely concerned over hacking of full self-driving cars to cause crashes. The number of ways into cars has proliferated, from cell phone signals to dongles. One such gateway is the standard OBD-II port found under the steering wheel historically used for onboard diagnostics. Today, hundreds of after-market devices use the port, whether to monitor driving for insurance needs or provide conveniences like safety alerts. The security of these devices is important, as it can provide an attacker with a means of accessing vehicle systems and driver data remotely, warned the FBI in a March 2016 bulletin on cyber security risks to motor vehicles. Carmakers are also building walls between non-crucial infotainment systems and driving controls so that any breach is blocked before it could compromise key functions like brakes. The first step the industry is tackling is intrusion detection, said Lanctot. But what to do when a breach is detected is complicated, because shutting off parts of a car could be unsafe, he said.  Tesla was first to champion over-the-air technology in which wireless software updates are sent remotely to cars. Although some have argued such updates are a way in for hackers, Tesla and others see them a key protection to upgrade security and repair vulnerabilities quickly.  In January, U.S. lawmakers introduced a bill calling for cyber security standards for new cars but so far U.S. regulators have issued recommendations, not rules, on how carmakers should shield their computer systems from hackers. The industry is years away from solving the cyber security problem, Lanctot said, noting that the first generation of cars built after the Jeep hack that include some kind of detection capabilities will not be seen until early in 2018.

The group said Icahn may have been acting as a lobbyist when he advised President Donald Trump to overhaul the U.S. biofuels program. Icahn, an unpaid adviser to Trump on regulation, submitted a proposal to Trump last month to change the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard by shifting the burden of blending biofuels into gasoline away from oil refining companies, and further down the supply chain to marketers. Public Citizen said that, because Icahn owns a controlling stake in a refinery that could benefit from the proposed change, he may have been required by a 1995 lobbying disclosure law to disclose his discussions with Trump on the subject as lobbying. The group said it has made its request for a probe in a letter sent to Congress on Wednesday morning. All of this has occurred with no record of any (Lobbying Disclosure Act) filings by or on behalf of Mr. Icahn, Public Citizen said in a copy of the letter provided to Reuters. Icahn did not respond to Reuters requests for comment but described the complaint in an opinion piece on The Hill website as a gross misstatement of the facts and said he had vetted his activities with lawyers.  The RFS, signed into law by former President George W. Bush, requires oil companies to mix increasing levels of renewable fuels into gasoline and diesel each year - a requirement that many refiners say costs them millions of dollars. Oil companies can either blend biofuels or buy paper credits, known as Renewable Identification Numbers (RIN), from those that have. Icahn owns an 82-percent stake in refiner CVR Energy Inc (CVI.N), which along with other refining companies, has urged the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to shift the blending obligation away from them. While we are not fighting the Renewable Fuel Standard, I have for months and will continue to speak out against the misguided way in which the EPA has been administering the RFS with regards to the agencys handling of a corrupt RIN market, Icahn said. Efforts to reach the White House were not immediately successful. Carl Icahn is between an ethics rock and a lobbying hard place, said Norman Eisen, co-founder of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington who served as the chief ethics lawyer for former President Barack Obama. If he claims he is an informal advisor, then he is subject to lobbying rules. Icahn has disclosed his role as a Trump adviser to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but he has not registered as a lobbyist. Several Democratic lawmakers have said they want more information about his role in the Trump administration.  Shares of CVR Energy jumped over 1 percent following Icahns response but pared gains and was unchanged at $21.40 by 3:47 p.m. EST  (2047 GMT). Share values have risen about 70 percent since the presidential election. Over that time, Icahns stake has gained over $600 million in value, according to Reuters data.  Last week, the head of a U.S. biofuels group said Icahn told him that Trump was readying an executive order to change the point of obligation for blending under the biofuels program, something both the White House and Icahn have denied. The White House has said it is reviewing Icahns proposal and has not yet taken a position.     ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona introduced a resolution on Tuesday backed by 34 other senators to undo the regulations under a provision that allows Congress to repeal recently approved federal regulations. Representative Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, who chairs a House panel on telecommunications, introduced a companion measure on Wednesday. Republicans control both chambers of Congress. Last week, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission  temporarily blocked some of the rules from taking effect, a victory for internet providers such as AT&T Inc (T.N), Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N). Consumer advocates opposed the FCC move. Under the rules, which were scheduled to take effect last Thursday, internet providers would need to obtain consumer consent before using precise geo-location, financial information, health information, childrens information and web- browsing history for advertising and internal marketing. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, nominated by Republican President Donald Trump on Tuesday to serve a new five-year term, told a Senate panel on Wednesday that consumers would have privacy protections even without the Obama administration rules. Republican commissioners including Pai said in October the rules unfairly give websites like Facebook Inc (FB.O), Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) or Alphabet Incs Google unit (GOOGL.O) the ability to harvest more data than service providers and dominate digital advertising.

In a letter to James Comey, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente, Republican Lindsey Graham and Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse wrote: We request that the Department of Justice provide us copies of any warrant applications and court orders ... related to wiretaps of President Trump, the Trump campaign, or Trump Tower.  Under U.S. law, presidents cannot direct wiretapping. Instead, the federal government can ask a court to authorize the action, but it must provide justification. Asked at a briefing on Wednesday if Trump was the subject of a probe, White House spokesman Sean Spicer replied: There is no reason that we have to think that the president is the target of any investigation whatsoever. Critics of Trump in Congress have accused him of issuing the wiretap allegation to try to deflect attention from investigations into his administrations possible ties to Russia. Some have likened it to Trumps long-held contention that Obama was not born in the United States and thus did not legitimately hold the office of president - an accusation he did not withdraw until 2016. Dianne Feinstein, a Democratic member of both the Senate intelligence and judiciary committees, told CNN she had not seen any evidence that Obama had tapped Trumps phone. Its all rather shocking to me that a sitting president would make this kind of an allegation about a former president without any proof whatsover, she said. I believe its patently false. Graham later told CNN that if the Justice Department does not cooperate with the senators request, subpoenas would be issued. I expect them to come forward as to whether or not a warrant was obtained or sought, Graham said. He chairs a Senate Judiciary subcommittee on crime and terrorism, and Whitehouse is the senior Democrat on the panel. On Saturday, Trump accused Obama of phone surveillance, amid a swirl of questions about possible ties between the Trump presidential campaign and Russian President Vladimir Putin. U.S. intelligence agencies have found that Russia tried to influence  the election. An Obama spokesman said on Saturday that neither Obama nor any White House official had ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen. The spokesmans statement did not address the possibility that a wiretap of the Trump campaign could have been sought by the Justice Department. In their letter, Graham and Whitehouse wrote: We would take any abuse of wiretapping authorities for political purposes very seriously. The senators added: We would be equally alarmed to learn that a court found enough evidence of criminal activity or contact with a foreign power to legally authorize a wiretap of President Trump, the Trump campaign, or Trump Tower. On Tuesday, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes told reporters his panel would consider issuing subpoenas if information being sought on Russias possible role influencing the election was not forthcoming. The committee has scheduled a March 20 hearing and Trumps wiretap allegation is part of that probe. Democrats, questioning the commitment of the Republican-controlled Congress, have been calling for an outside investigation, which so far has been rejected.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - WikiLeaks, the website that specializes in exposing secrets, released thousands of documents that described internal U.S. Central Intelligence Agency discussions on hacking techniques it  used between 2013 and 2016 to circumvent security on electronic devices for spying.  U.S. officials said on Wednesday that CIA contractors were the likely source of the leak. The following are some questions and answers users of consumer electronics may have: Q: How many of the vulnerabilities described in the Wikileaks document are still open to exploit by hackers or spies? A: There is no definitive answer in the documents, which describe attack techniques but often do not give enough detail for even the device and software vendors to understand fullyhow their products were targeted and close the security holes. Software updates have solved many of the flaws but it is unclear how many remain. In a chart of exploits for Apples iPhone, the most recent version listed as hackable was iOS 9.2, which was released in late 2015. Q: What did we learn about the CIAs hacking program? A. WikiLeaks published documents that it says describe CIA tools for hacking into devices including mobile phones, computers and smart televisions. Q: How can you hack a TV? A: WikiLeaks said it identified a project known as Weeping Angel where U.S. and British intelligence agencies developed ways to take over Samsung smart TVs equipped with microphones, forcing them to record conversations when the device appeared to be turned off. Experts have long said smart TVs and other Internet-connected devices can be exploited to monitor a target. Q: Are these revelations new? A: While the specific details are new, it is well known in the cyber security community that intelligence agencies are constantly trying to leverage flaws in technology products to conduct espionage. Q: The documents suggest that the CIA can access information in encrypted messaging apps like WhatsApp and Signal. I thought they were safe from even government spying?  A: No system is perfect. The documents describe ways to get information in those apps on Android devices, but only after gaining full control of those phones. Reuters has not found evidence in the documents released by WikiLeaks that the CIA had figured a way to break the encryption in those apps. Q: Are iPhones also vulnerable? A: The documents discuss ways to get into iPhones as well. One appeared to show a list of Apple iOS security flaws purchased by U.S. intelligence agencies so they could gain access to those devices. Q: What should I do if Im worried? A: Most people do not need to worry about being targeted by intelligence agencies. But everybody should stay on top of software patches so all their computers, mobile phones and other connected devices are running software with the latest security updates. Consumers should balance security concerns with their need to use smart devices. Q: What did we learn about how the CIA may try to make American hacking look like the work of hackers from other countries like Russia?  A: The CIA has a library of attack code taken from multiple sources and sorted by function, including a program from a Russian criminal kit that permits spyware to survive rebooting and a data-destruction tool lifted from a suspected Iranian operation. One purpose of such a collection is to avoid having to write programs from scratch, while another is to confuse anyone who discovers the malware in action.  The documents released so far do not show that the CIA set out to deceive victims into believing they had been hacked by someone else, but it suggests that the agency was capable of doing so if it wanted.  Q: Is this as big as the leaks from former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden? A: The Snowden leaks revealed that the NSA was secretly collecting U.S. call metadata on ordinary Americans. The materials released by WikiLeaks on Tuesday did not appear to reveal the existence of unknown any unknown programs. Instead they supplied details on how U.S. intelligence agencies work to discover and exploit security flaws to conduct espionage.  Q: How damaging is this revelation to U.S. intelligence? A:U.S. intelligence officials say the damage is limited because much of what was published is old, a number of the vulnerabilities in smart TVs and other devices have been known for at least two years and many have been patched. The breach   was discovered late last year according to U.S. officials and most or all of the tools Wikileaks published are no longer in use. In addition, they said, unless additional codes that would enable users to exploit the leaked material are also published, it would be difficult for other countries, groups, or people to use the leaked material against the United States or its allies. Q: Are the documents authentic?  A: Reuters could not immediately verify the contents of the published documents. U.S. officials told Reuters that they believe the documents are authentic. While the CIA has declined to comment, independent cyber security experts and former intelligence agency employees who have looked through them say that they appear to be authentic, citing code words used to describe CIA hacking programs. Q: How did WikiLeaks get the information?  A: Unclear. Someone inside the agency may have leaked the information. Or, someone outside may have figured out a way to steal it. U.S. officials told Reuters on Wednesday that contractors were the likely source for the leak. Q: What has the U.S. government and other governments said in response? A: The White House said U.S. President Donald Trump was extremely concerned about the CIA security breach that led to the WikiLeaks release. Germanys chief federal prosecutors office said it would review the Wikileaks documents which suggest the CIA ran a hacking hub from the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt, and would launch a formal investigation if warranted.

Jared Kushner, a real estate developer who advised Trump during the presidential campaign, was cleared by the U.S. Department of Justice in January to serve as a White House senior adviser. Kushner, who is married to Trumps eldest daughter, Ivanka, has been given a wide range of domestic and foreign policy responsibilities, including working on a Middle East peace deal. In a letter to Deputy White House Counsel Stefan Passantino, Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren and Tom Carper expressed concern over media reports that Kushner is maintaining some business interests, and asked how the White House plans to comply with laws that prohibit federal officials from profiting by government work. Neither the White House nor Mr. Kushners attorneys, however, has confirmed which financial assets Mr. Kushner still controls, making oversight impossible, they wrote with U.S. Representative Elijah Cummings, the senior Democrat on the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in the House of Representatives. They also said the White House, unlike previous administrations, is not posting ethics-pledge waivers on its websites, adding that the public should know the issues from which Kushner must recuse himself. The White House had no immediate comment on the letter. A lawyer for Kushner, Jamie Gorelick, said in a statement: Mr. Kushner is fully complying with the ethics rules, removing himself from active participation in his prior businesses, divesting of substantial assets and recusing himself where appropriate in light of interests that he is not divesting. Before Trump took office on Jan. 20, Gorelick said her client would leave his familys company, divest substantial assets and recuse himself from matters that could affect his financial interests, Bloomberg reported.  Public interest journalism site ProPublica, citing documents submitted to the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, reported in February that Kushner had divested some assets but was keeping other holdings linked to privately held Kushner Companies.     In authorizing Kushners appointment, the Justice Department  ruled that Trump, as president, has special hiring authority that exempts White House positions from laws barring the president from naming a relative to lead a federal agency.  The Democratic lawmakers called on the White House for details on what holdings Kushner maintains, a list of issues he will recuse himself from, and copies of any ethics waivers. They also raised questions about holdings belonging to his wife, who established a clothing and jewelry line, and whether that would lead Kushner to recuse himself from any issues. Trump himself has said he would maintain ownership of his global business empire but would hand off control to his two oldest sons while president.

During his presidential campaign, Trump said he would push for a $1 trillion infrastructure program to rebuild roads, bridges, airports and other public works projects, but he has not presented a specific plan. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said strong public-private partnerships would be key to rebuilding the nations roads, bridges and airports. Infrastructure used to be a point of American pride, but now an overbearing, ineffective regulatory system can keep projects in limbo for years, Spicer said. The government has wasted too much of the taxpayers money on inefficient and misguided projects. The White House sees infrastructure as a potential large job creator but officials have said the federal government cannot shoulder the entire burden. The administration is looking at toll roads, tax credits and other ways to spur private investment. Major real estate and private equity executives attended the meeting, including developer Richard LeFrak, Vornado Realty Trust Chief Executive Officer Steve Roth, and Apollo Global Management co-founderJosh Harris, the White House said.  LeFrak and Roth have been tapped to lead an infrastructure council that Trump plans to create, a spokesman for LeFrak had previously said. The lunch with the CEOs follows his meeting on Tuesday with AFL-CIO union President Rich Trumka to talk infrastructure and other issues. The White House held a meeting of 15 federal agencies last Thursday to begin work on the administrations infrastructure plan. Last month, Trump touted the infrastructure plan in an address to Congress. To launch our national rebuilding, he said, I will be asking Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure of the United States - financed through both public and private capital - creating millions of new jobs. Edward Mortimer, a transportation expert at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, told a Senate panel on Wednesday that without action, the federal highway trust fund would face a serious shortfall starting in 2020, and policymakers would need to come up with $150 billion over six years to maintain current spending. This shortfall will likely result in significant uncertainty, with states possibly delaying major transportation projects, he said. Wednesdays meeting included Vice President Mike Pence, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt, as well as General Atlantic CEO Bill Ford, McKinsey & Co partner Tyler Duvall and Nature Conservancy Managing Director Lynn Scarlett, the White House said. Scarlett said in a statement that any infrastructure package should include natural solutions such as reefs, dunes and wetlands. Other participants in the meeting did not comment or respond to requests for comment.   The American Society of Civil Engineers has graded U.S. infrastructure at D+ and estimated the country needs to invest $3.6 trillion by 2020. In January, Trump signed an executive order aimed at expediting environmental reviews and approvals for all infrastructure projects, especially high-priority projects such as improving the U.S. electric grid and telecommunications systems and repairing and upgrading critical port facilities, airports, pipelines, bridges, and highways.

Comey did not speak with reporters during public appearances in Boston on Tuesday and Wednesday, ignoring questions about the wiretapping accusation that Trump made on Saturday without offering any evidence to support it. Comey, who was appointed FBI director by Barack Obama in 2013, had urged Justice Department officials to refute Trumps claims because it falsely insinuated the Federal Bureau of Investigation broke the law, U.S. officials have said. The department has not acted on his request. The White House said on Monday that Trump still has confidence in Comey despite his assertiveness in challenging Trumps claim. Comey also reiterated a plea for technology companies to enable authorities to access encrypted data on mobile devices and in messaging apps. He said strong encryption had become more popular in recent years, particularly after former intelligence contractor Edward Snowdens revelations about U.S. spying programs.  The use of the technology for scrambling data has made it increasingly difficult for law enforcement to investigate crimes, even when authorities have court orders giving them permission to access data, he said. As evidence, he said that FBI technicians were unable to access data in about 1,200 of some 2,800 devices that state and local agency asked the bureau to help open from October to December, hampering progress in criminal investigations.

Barclays Bank, Deutsche Bank AG, UBS Securities, Royal Bank of Canada, Ally Financial and Pershing Square were among the financial firms listed as Claytons clients at Sullivan & Cromwell, according to a form filed with the Office of Government Ethics. Under the agreement, Clayton will not participate in SEC matters involving the firm for one year. He will also recuse himself from matters involving his former clients for one year after he last provided them legal services. The SEC currently has only two members - Republican Michael Piwowar and Democrat Kara Stein - and they often disagree about policy matters. Should Clayton be confirmed and then recuse himself, the agency will be left deadlocked until other commissioners are nominated and confirmed. At full force, the SEC has five voting members, including the chair. Clayton also promised to divest, within 90 days of confirmation, some 176 assets collectively worth millions of dollars. He did not reply to a request for comment.  Clayton and his wife, Gretchen Butler Clayton, reported assets between $52.3 million and $130.4 million. Because nominees for Executive Branch positions report their assets in broad ranges, it is impossible to calculate a nominees exact net worth. He has assets related to his employment at Sullivan & Cromwell worth between $2.5 million and $8.4 million, the OGE form shows. His wife works at Goldman Sachs & Co, and has assets related to her role at the investment bank worth between $1.1 million and $2.8 million. She has said she will resign her job if he is confirmed. The form also does not detail the specific assets from which Clayton will divest to comply with federal ethics laws. But in his March 3 letter to an ethics officer, Clayton did indicate that he will seek to take advantage of a tax benefit that allows government officials to defer paying capital gains taxes on assets they sell to satisfy ethics requirements, potentially saving him millions of dollars. As a Wall Street attorney, Clayton has worked on notable deals including the initial public offering of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Valeant Pharmaceuticals, the subject of federal investigations related to drug pricing, was listed as one of his clients. Clayton also reported having two corporate clients he could not name due to pending investigations that are not yet public.

Facing questions regarding his inclusion on the council at the Disneys annual shareholders meeting, the chief executive said he had no plans to step down from the group, as some critics have urged him to do. In response to one question, Iger said he did not believe his membership supports or endorses Trumps policies. Another speaker, who identified himself as a member of the Colorado Peoples Alliance, said Igers decision to remain on the council suggests Disney is tacitly endorsing Trumps agenda.  Iger, however, referenced a song from the Broadway musical Hamilton called The Room Where It Happens, saying it was important to have input in a forum where policies are being shaped. I think there is an opportunity, when you are in the room where it happens, to express opinions I believe would be in the best interest of the company and its shareholders, he said at meeting held in Denver. Iger said he would at times express views likely to be adversarial to the president.  Uber Technologies Inc UBER.UL Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick quit Trumps advisory group in February amid pressure from activists and employees who opposed the administrations immigration policies. Iger said immigration had helped Disney in many ways, citing the issue as an example of something he could address on the Trump advisory council.  The United States and Disney have benefited from an open and fair immigration policy, Iger said. I dont happen to believe policies that single people out by religion are fair and just. Iger skipped the first meeting of Trumps advisory council in February to attend a previously scheduled board meeting. He fielded several questions on political topics at the meeting with another speaker suggesting that Disney-owned ABC News holds a liberal political bias, a charge Iger vigorously rejected. They work very, very hard to present news in a fair way, Iger said, adding that he did not agree the media was an enemy of the people, as Trump has written on Twitter. Iger said there were times the Obama administration disliked coverage by ABC News. I am proud of the fact news can be an adversary, Iger said.

The bill would require people to use restrooms that correspond with the gender on their birth certificate, not the gender with which they identify.  It will now go to the Republican-controlled Senate where it is expected to pass. Republican Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, who guides the Senate agenda, has said the legislation is a priority. Analysts do not expect the bill to make it through the state House of Representatives, where there is more concern about the potential economic impact of such legislation. The bill, which focuses on a heated political issue in the United States, is similar to one enacted last year in North Carolina. That law prompted economic boycotts and the loss of sporting events that were estimated to have cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars. The Texas Association of Business released a study in January in which it said that if the legislation were enacted  it could cost Texas as much as $8.5 billion in the states gross domestic product and the loss of more than 185,000 jobs in the first year alone. Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick has challenged the survey and brought North Carolina Republican Lieutenant Governor  Dan Forest to Texas to rally support for the bill. Nearly 70 businesses, including some of the states biggest employers such as American Airlines, sent a letter to Republican leaders this month asking them to reject the bill on the grounds that it would legalize discrimination. THIRD-GRADER TESTIFIES Hundreds registered to testify, and more than 250 people addressed the committee. Some waited more than 12 hours while many bill opponents lined the corridors in the Capitols dome.  At the core of this bill is privacy, Republican state Senator Lois Kolkhorst, the bills sponsor, told the committee. Almost all the testimony was against the bill while supporters said it would help prevent sexual predators from targeting women and children. Chelsa Morrison, whose 8-year-old daughter Marilyn started third grade at a suburban Dallas school after a gender transition, choked back tears as she told the committee that her daughter was bullied and if the legislation was enacted it would be devastating. Marilyn told lawmakers, Trans people are real. You are looking at one right now. This bill is horrifying to me and all of my transgender friends.  She said it would be embarrassing if she were forced to use the boys bathroom. All we got to do is tinkle and get out. Thats all. Her mother said later in a telephone interview that Marilyn attended school in the latter part of last year for about a month, then left because of bullying and bathroom restrictions. She is now being schooled at home. Lieutenant Governor Patrick has called the bill common sense legislation. North Carolina was the tip of the spear, he told reporters this week. We will be next to pass a bill that focuses on privacy, a persons privacy, and public safety. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The financial sector spent $2 billion on political activity from the beginning of 2015 to the end of 2016, including $1.2 billion in campaign contributions  more than twice the amount given by any other business sector, according to the study from Americans for Financial Reform. That works out to $3.7 million per member of Congress and is the most ever tracked by the group, which analyzed spending data going back to 1990. Furthermore, the actual amount is probably higher, because it did not include so-called dark money: funds donated to political advocacy by nonprofit groups. Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N), Prudential Financial Inc (PRU.N) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) all spent more than $10 million each, the report said. On Tuesday, Goldman Sachs released an investment analysis saying that large money center banks stood to profit significantly from the kind of financial deregulation expected from Republican President Donald Trumps administration and a Republican Congress. As much as $218 billion in excess capital could be returned to shareholders or reinvested in the banks themselves if all the deregulation the industry is seeking comes about. Among senators not running for president, Democrat Charles Schumer, now the minority leader, received the largest amount, with $5.3 million coming from financial firms.  Mike Crapo, the Republican chairman of the Senate Banking Committee and who was also in the top 10 from the Senate, received $2.1 million. Jeb Hensarling, the Republican chairman of the House Financial Services Committee who favors financial deregulation, received $1.9 million.  The report did not detail donations to presidential campaigns.   Though Trump has called for significant bank deregulation from both the agencies and via a congressional rewrite of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial deregulation law, there will be pushback from Democrats and others. Goldman conceded in its review that it was unlikely that all Dodd-Frank era regulation would be undone.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": "" WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When the bosses of some of the worlds largest pharmaceutical companies headed to Washington in January to meet U.S. President Donald Trump, it had all the makings of a potentially hostile meeting.  Just weeks before, Trump had sent drug stock prices plummeting after accusing the companies of getting away with murder by charging too much for medicines.  But the Trump who greeted chief executives of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), Novartis (NOVN.S), Merck (MRK.N), Eli Lilly (LLY.N), Celgene (CELG.O) and Amgen (AMGN.O) on Jan. 31 was a surprisingly genial host who even gave them a personal tour of the Oval Office, according to several participants in the breakfast.  There is no question that it was better than it could have been or we thought it could be, said one industry insider familiar with the meeting.  Trump did not repeat his public attacks on the industry. Instead, he focused on outdated regulations that drive costs up for drugmakers, according to participants interviewed by Reuters. The CEOs left with Trumps word that he would streamline regulations and reform the high U.S. corporate tax rate.  Since taking office on Jan. 20, Trump has held at least nine meetings with groups of business leaders, including automakers, airlines, retailers and health insurers. On Wednesday, he was hosting lunch for a group of New York real estate developers and private equity CEOs, during which possible private-public partnerships on infrastructure would be discussed, according to a person briefed on the meeting. In early morning or late-night tweets and in speeches, Trump has lambasted many of these companies for cost over-runs, or high prices, or foreign manufacturing, often knocking down their share prices.  But Reuters interviews with nearly a dozen executives and lobbyists who have taken part in these meetings or have been briefed on them reveal a Trump who is very different from his uncompromising and demanding @realDonaldTrump Twitter handle.  When he meets the nations top chief executives in person, he is a mix of charm and cajoling. This Trump is flexible and inquisitive, a schmoozer who remembers birthdays and often lavishes praise on their companies, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity so they could freely discuss private meetings.  This private side of Trump sheds light on why many CEOs have expressed confidence that the Republican president is good for business, despite his share-denting public attacks. As recently as Tuesday, Trump tweeted he was working on a system to increase competition in the health industry and lower drug pricing, sending pharma shares lower.  In the White House meetings, Trump focuses much of his talk on cutting regulations, the sources said, underscoring one of his administrations key priorities - getting rid of rules imposed by his predecessor Barack Obama. He typically asks which regulations are holding businesses back from adding new jobs and promises to resolve the issues, executives say.  He said one thing for the cameras and the door shuts and then its like kumbaya, said one person who was briefed on a meeting between Trump and a group of CEOs.  He likes to be seen as engaging and buddy buddy with other big important business leaders, said this person.  A former businessman, Trump runs his closed-door meetings with CEOs as if they were a corporate board meeting, attendees said. In contrast to his doctrinaire tweets, he likes to seek input from everyone at the table, and compared to former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, conversations are less scripted.  Trumps approach to these meetings is one of listening and not lecturing, said a senior White House official who has participated in industry meetings. Ive seen a president who is listening and asking questions to get to how he can create a thriving economy, the official said.  An Amgen spokeswoman said Trump made it clear that he wanted to work with the company on U.S. job creation and biotech innovation. Representatives of the other drugmakers declined to comment.  Because so little is known about how Trump interacts privately with CEOs, trade groups and company officials have begun to swap tips on how to approach their meetings with him.  There is this undercurrent of information sharing about what to expect, what to do, said one trade group official who prepared CEOs for a recent meeting with Trump. He said he has gotten a flurry of calls from other industries next in line for a White House visit.  At the end of most meetings, Trump leads CEOs into the Oval Office, showing off paintings, sculptures and the furniture, as well as the rug and curtains he has picked out. He also points out a bust of Martin Luther King Jr., which he inherited from Obama. Then he takes a group photo behind the desk.  He becomes tour guide and brings them over to the Oval Office, the same official said. Hes very proud of the Oval Office.  The White House official said Trump recognized the awe of the Oval Office.  Chief executives of Detroits top three automakers - General Motors Co (GM.N), Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) - were pleasantly surprised when they went to the White House for a breakfast with Trump on Jan. 24.  Since his election, Trump has frequently attacked the car companies for building in Mexico and warned U.S. firms would no longer be able to move U.S. jobs abroad without consequences.  When Trump entered the Roosevelt Room, he greeted GM CEO Mary Barra with a playful tap on the shoulder as he gently prodded her to add jobs in the United States and later pulled out her chair before the meeting started, a review of the video transcripts of the first part of the meeting shows.  He greeted Ford CEO Mark Fields with a Happy Birthday. Its his birthday ladies and gentlemen. Trump said it was a great honor to see Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne.  Trump did not specifically ask them to build plants in the United States - as he had tweeted he would before the meeting - but instead listened to their complaints about regulations and indicated a willingness to help them, people briefed on the meeting said.  Ford declined to comment and referred to Fields comments to dealers in January that Trump had asked for a list of regulations that automakers wanted cut or kept.  GM CEO Mary Barra said in a speech last week that Trump really listened to the automakers, while Marchionne told reporters at the Geneva auto show on Tuesday that Trump was quite willing to make our lives easier in terms of compliance and taxes in order to encourage U.S. job creation.  Trump has been complimentary of his high-profile guests - and at times playful.  After Denise Morrison, chief executive of Campbell Soup (CPB.N), introduced herself in one of those meetings, Trump quickly responded: Good soup.  At another, after Target Corp (TGT.N) CEO Brian Cornell spoke, Trump responded by pronouncing the name of the company as Tar-Jay, a common joke to make the retailer sound more fancy.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""NEW YORK (Reuters) - The House Republican health insurance plan suggests health insurance after Obamacare will be less affordable, investors, insurers and industry sources said on Tuesday, raising questions about future enrollment and insurance company participation. The draft legislation, released on Monday night, rolls back some of the key tenets of former President Barack Obamas signature healthcare law, known as Obamacare, including the individual mandate and the expansion of Medicaid. In addition to eliminating the requirement that most Americans obtain medical insurance, it creates a system of new tax credits to coax people to purchase private insurance on the open market. The bill has the support of President Donald Trump, who has vowed to repeal and replace the 2010 law. But some Republican lawmakers whose support is needed for the final legislation - and Democrats - said they wanted details on how it would affect U.S. consumers.  Under the draft legislation, Obamacares income-based and location-based tax credits are replaced by credits with fixed amounts up to a maximum income level.  Because the bill has just been proposed and aims mostly to repeal the existing law rather than introduce new policies, it is unclear exactly how future changes could make the plan affordable and draw insurers into the market.  But some initial reaction, particularly from hospitals, was critical. The American Hospital Association said in a letter to Congress that it could not support the draft legislation in its current form. The BlueCross BlueShield Association, which represents BCBS insurers across the country that cover the vast majority of the about 10 million people enrolled in 2017 Obamacare plans, said the insurers were glad to see the extension of many Obamacare aspects into 2019. But it emphasized the need for the replacement to be affordable.      It is important that the tax credit for 2020 creates a marketplace that enables people to get the coverage they need at a price they can afford, BCBSA Senior Vice President Alissa Fox said in statement. The Association for Community Affiliated Plans, which represents health plans serving Medicaid for the poor and other public health programs, said it was concerned the structure would raise costs for people currently in the marketplace. Because insurance costs, healthcare costs and incomes vary so dramatically around the country, the new tax credit would affect some people more than others. I think theres a reasonable concern that people in high-cost states who are lower income will have a hard time finding affordable care, said Paul Howard, director of health policy at the conservative Manhattan Institute. But the draft legislation also sets up a $100 billion fund over 10 years that states could use to structure subsidies for their members and offset some of that, he noted. Insurers have also asked to be able to offer plans with fewer benefits that could be sold at lower prices, Howard said. Since the draft removes the mandate requiring people to have insurance, the impact on enrollment from that measure is not clear. Standard & Poors estimated that the draft plan would reduce individual enrollment, now at around 10 million, by 2 to 4 million people. Steve Brozak, managing partner at WBB Securities, said he believed that under the Republican package, people will be forgoing insurance.  He also said that, as it is currently designed, insurers will have difficulty attracting people who do not have an immediate need for healthcare, like younger, healthy people who are less expensive to insure. Still, Brozak expects that this draft is only a first step and likely to change. It is expected to be voted on this month in the House before moving to the U.S. Senate.  The draft plan, along with Republicans proposed restructuring of the Medicaid program for the poor and the loud opposition from some Republican lawmakers, created uncertainty that drove down shares of hospitals and insurers. Republicans will need the buy-in from BlueCross BlueShield insurers like Anthem Inc, particularly after UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N), Aetna Inc (AET.N) and Humana Inc (HUM.N) exited most of the states where they sold individual insurance plans under Obamacare.      Shares of hospital operators sold off, with Community Health Systems (CYH.N) down more than 8 percent and Tenet Healthcare (THC.N) off 7 percent.    Reaction in health insurer stocks was more subdued. Molina Healthcare (MOH.N) fell 1.3 percent and Cigna (CI.N) dropped 1 percent, while Humana (HUM.N) gained more than 2 percent and Anthem (ANTM.N) was little changed. The American Hospital Association and the American Medical Association, which represents doctors, declined to comment on the draft legislation. Support for government-run health insurance has risen over the past five years, according to the Reuters/Ipsos national tracking poll.  Between February and March, 47 percent of Americans said the government should have at least a major role in providing health insurance. That was up from 39 percent who answered the same way when the poll first asked the question in January 2012. The Reuters/Ipsos poll is conducted online in English in all 50 states. The latest poll ran from Feb. 25 to March 6 and included responses from more than 2,700 American adults. It has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 2 percentage points.  polling.reuters.com/#poll/PV4/dates/20170225-20170306/type/overall ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Pyongyangs latest missile launches and the assassination in Malaysia of North Korean leader Kim Jong Uns estranged half-brother have added urgency, driving home the need for Washington to confront the security challenge. All options are on the table, ranging from tighter sanctions aimed at pushing North Korea back into disarmament talks, to a return of U.S. nuclear weapons to South Korea, and even pre-emptive air strikes on North Korean missile installations, senior U.S. administration officials said. They added a consensus was forming around relying for now on increased economic and diplomatic pressure  especially by pressing China to do more to rein in North Korea - while deploying advanced anti-missile defenses in South Korea and possibly in Japan, as well. Among the other possibilities, one U.S. official said, was returning North Korea to the U.S. list of countries that support terrorism.  That would be a response to the suspected use of nerve gas to kill Kims brother at a Malaysian airport last month. It would subject Pyongyang - already heavily sanctioned by the United Nations and individual states, so far to little effect - to additional financial sanctions that were removed when it was taken off the list in 2008.  For now, U.S. officials consider pre-emptive military action far too risky, given the danger of igniting a regional war and causing massive casualties in Japan and South Korea and among tens of thousands of U.S. troops based in both allied countries. Such ideas could gain traction, however, if North Korea proceeds with a threatened test of an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting the United States. Just before he took office in January, Trump tweeted: It wont happen! when Kim said North Korea was close to testing an ICBM. Trump also could opt for escalating cyber attacks and other covert actions aimed at undermining the North Korean leadership, a U.S. government source said. The review is expected to be completed by the end of the month, officials said. Decisions could be held up, however, by the slow pace at which Trump has been filling national security jobs. Trump is known to have little patience for detailed foreign policy discussions, but officials said he seemed to have heeded a warning from his White House predecessor, Barack Obama, that North Korea would be the most urgent international issue he would face - so much so that he requested intelligence briefings on the issue. While officials have stressed the need to persuade China to do more to pressure North Korea, Trumps first concrete response to North Koreas missile tests has been to start installing an advanced anti-missile defense system in South Korea, which has incensed Beijing. Diplomats said the move might reassure U.S. allies but could backfire by antagonizing China, which regards the system as a threat, and make it less willing to step up sanctions on its neighbor. You have to adjust and calibrate all the options based on the facts on the ground, said an administration official, who added that media reports highlighting military options were overblown. The ability to have sanctions that pack some punch and are more dynamic than we have had in the past is going to be dependent to some extent on Chinese cooperation, he said. Chinese diplomats argue that Beijing is doing all it can. Bonnie Glaser at Washingtons Center for Strategic and International Studies said China could close banks that conduct illicit financial transactions with North Korea, prosecute front companies facilitating business, cut off oil exports and expel North Korean workers. Glazer said she saw no good military option. While past talks have failed, she would not be surprised if Trump wanted to try diplomacy. One idea could be to discuss a freeze in North Koreas nuclear and missile programs, which would fall short of current demands for nuclear disarmament. North Korea may insist on being recognized as a nuclear weapons state as a precondition, in which case the U.S. would have to decide whether to make that concession, she said. Evans Revere, a former senior diplomat who dealt with Korea under President George W. Bush, said Washington should pressure North Korea with sanctions, military deployments and covert operations. Doing this would ... compel the regime to rethink its course and make it more likely to return to dialogue and denuclearization, lest it risk collapse, he said. Whether Trump will be willing to tolerate the level of risk needed to make such a strategy work remains unclear. This is an administration that is more inclined to be averse to regime change than previous administrations, the first administration official said. Thats from the top down. This administration intends tocome up with options based on the cards we are dealt; not try to change the deck entirely, which is what regime change is.

In a court filing on Tuesday, Hawaii said it would seek a temporary restraining order against the new travel ban. Hawaiis suit against the original executive order was put on hold.  The Trump administration this week issued the new executive order that supplanted an earlier, more sweeping one which had been challenged in court by several states in addition to Hawaii. The new order is much more narrowly tailored than the first one issued in January. It keeps a 90-day ban on travel to the United States by citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen but excludes Iraq, and applies the restriction only to new visa applicants.  To be sure, the new executive order covers fewer people than the old one, Neal Katyal, one of the lead attorneys for Hawaii, said in an interview with CNN. He said the new travel ban still suffers from the same constitutional and statutory defects. We are confident that the presidents actions are lawful to protect the national security of our country, the Justice Department said in a statement. In a joint filing, Hawaii and the U.S. government asked for oral arguments in the case to be held March 15, a day before the new travel order is set to take effect. Separately, in a case brought by Washington state against the first Trump travel order, the Justice Department on Tuesday said it would voluntarily dismiss its own appeal of a Seattle federal court ruling that had suspended the order. Washington state did not oppose the administrations request to end its appeal, the filing said. Immigration advocates said the new ban still discriminates against Muslims and fails to address some of their concerns with the previous directive. Legal experts said the new ban would be harder to challenge because it affects fewer people living in the United States and allows more exemptions to protect them. Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson on Monday said his office was evaluating whether it would challenge the new order and would likely decide this week. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last month had blocked Trumps first order, saying Washington state would likely be able to prove that it violated constitutional protections. That appeals court ruling has not been withdrawn and its legal reasoning can still be cited as precedent in future cases, Washington attorney general spokesman Peter Lavallee said on Tuesday.

Francisco, who has been serving in an acting capacity in the job, is a lawyer with strong conservative credentials who previously worked at the Jones Day law firm. White House Counsel Don McGahn is one of several other Jones Day lawyers who have joined the administration. Francisco has argued three high-profile cases at the Supreme Court. Most recently, he represented former Virginia Republican   Governor Robert McDonnell in a successful attempt to throw out corruption convictions. The court in June ruled 8-0 in favor of McDonnell. In another case decided last year, he represented religious nonprofits that sought an exemption from a provision of the Obamacare healthcare law that requires employers to provide female workers with health insurance that includes contraception coverage. The high court in May sidestepped a major ruling in that case by sending it back to a lower court. In the third case, Francisco led a business-led challenge to presidential appointment powers, resulting in a 2014 ruling that limited the ability of the White House to fill positions without Senate approval. Francisco served as a White House lawyer from 2001 to 2003 and spent another two years in the Justice Departments Office of Legal Counsel from 2003 to 2005.

It was the second request for Trumps returns by Senate Democrats in as many weeks, part of a Democratic campaign to pressure Republicans in Congress into obtaining the documents that could reveal conflicts of interest posed by the presidents global business empire. Trump has defied decades of precedent by refusing to release his tax returns, saying his tax affairs were under federal audit. The Internal Revenue Service has said that is no obstacle to releasing them publicly. In a letter on Tuesday to Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, two of the panels leading Democrats said Trumps tax returns should be pursued in light of critical national security implications posed by contacts between Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak and Trump associates, including U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions. There is no debate that the conflicts in question pose a threat to American national security and the integrity of the government of the United States, and more and more keep coming to light, wrote Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the committees top Democrat, and Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan. Hatch and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady rejected a request for the returns last Wednesday by Senate Democrats, saying congressional actions that target individual tax returns would constitute an abuse of authority and set a dangerous precedent. On Tuesday, a Hatch spokesman said the Utah Republican had no further comment.  The two Democratic lawmakers said national security had long been a focus of the Senate Finance Committee oversight of issues involving trade, Iran and terrorism. They also said the panel previously sought the tax returns of former Enron Corp executives, oil and gas companies and the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, or ACORN, as part of its oversight duties. Wyden and Stabenow said they wanted the committee to hold a closed session in which lawmakers could conduct a bipartisan review of Trumps returns.  They added: If committee members identify ties or relations to foreign governments within these documents, we will respectfully request the chairman and members of the committee hold a vote to make that information available to the public.

Garcetti, 46, a former City Council member and urban planning expert seeking his second term as mayor, needs to win at least 50 percent of the vote plus one in order to avoid a May run-off race with the second-place finisher. A recent Loyola Marymount University poll found Garcetti backed by 50.1 percent of registered voters, compared with 7.9 percent for his closest rival, Mitchell Schwartz, a political operative of former President Barack Obama during his first White House campaign. But the telephone-and-online survey of 950 people, conducted in January and early February, showed 38.5 percent were still undecided. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus just over three percentage points. Schwartz, 55, has seized on the citys rising crime rate and soaring housing costs, while warning of a looming pension fund crisis, in his bid to unseat Garcetti. The mayor has touted his successful support for a measure to raise the minimum wage in Los Angeles and pointed to the citys employment gains in the aftermath of a nationwide recession. Garcetti enjoys a significant funding advantage, reporting his campaign has amassed more than $3.8 million as of March 1, while Schwartz, the only other candidate to have raised substantial cash, is expected to have spent $790,000, a spokesman said. Schwartz was previously best known as the California state director of Obamas presidential campaign in 2007 and 2008. Before that he served as director of communications at the State Department during President Bill Clintons first term in office. Garcetti, who defeated then-city Controller Wendy Greuel in a run-off four years ago, is the son of former prosecutor Gil Garcetti, whose office tried O.J. Simpson for murder, and lost, while serving as Los Angeles County district attorney. Drawing almost as much attention, and far more money, in Tuesdays municipal elections was the highly contested ballot Measure S, aimed at limiting development by halting spot zoning amendments to the citys General Plan for two years. Measure S supporters say spot zoning permits granted to wealthy real estate interests have spurred runaway construction of high-rise office space and other costly developments that increase congestion and drive up housing costs. Opponents say the measure would go too far and actually undermine city efforts to create more affordable housing. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

I have not seen that evidence, Nunes told a news conference. I think the bigger question that needs to be answered is whether or not Mr. Trump or any of his associates were in fact targeted by any of the intelligence agencies or law enforcement authorities. Trump made the accusation in tweets on Saturday, providing no evidence. An Obama spokesman denied it. Trump has since pressed the House and Senate intelligence committees to expand probes into allegations that Russia meddled in the U.S. election to look into his charge. We are supposed to be kept up to speed on any pertinent counterintelligence investigation, Nunes said. If Trump or any other political campaign, or anybody associated with Trump, was under some type of investigation, that clearly should have risen to the Gang of Eight level. Adam Schiff, the top committee Democrat, also said it did not appear that the group had been appropriately briefed. Schiff said it was a scandal that Trump had levied that accusation against Obama. He said the intelligence panel would address the issue and deal with it quickly. Nunes said his committee planned public hearings as part of its Russia probe, beginning with one on March 20 at which Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey and Admiral Mike Rogers, director of the National Security Agency, were called to testify. Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, former Central Intelligence Agency Director John Brennan and former acting Attorney General Sally Yates were also invited.  Nunes said the panel would not issue subpoenas for that hearing. But if we have to, we will subpoena all information that is pertinent to this investigation if people either ... dont want to appear or if the appropriate agencies do not provide the information we ask for.

Rod Rosenstein, now U.S. Attorney for Maryland, faced tough questioning, especially from Democrats, at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on his nomination by President Donald Trump to fill the Justice Departments No. 2 job. Coming amid persistent questions about ties between Trumps presidential campaign and Russia, Rosensteins nomination has catapulted him into the center of an issue that Trump has been unable to put behind him in his first six weeks in office. California Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein asked Rosenstein, Do you support an independent, outside counsel? He said he could not commit to that approach before learning the facts of the case. My view is that I have a responsibility to not take the job conditional on how I [will handle] a particular case, Rosenstein said. Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from the politically-charged inquiry last week after admitting he met twice with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak during the campaign. Sessions had previously testified he had no contact with Russian officials. Trump fired national security adviser Michael Flynn last month after disclosures that Flynn had discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia with Kislyak before Trump took office and then misled Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded last year that Russia hacked and leaked Democratic emails during the election campaign as part of an effort to tilt the vote in Trumps favor. The Kremlin has denied the allegations. Democrats at the hearing said only a special prosecutor could ensure that the investigation would be free of pressure from Trump, who has accused officials in former Democratic President Barack Obamas administration of trying to discredit him with questions about Russia contacts. Trump called frequently during his campaign for improved relations with Russia. U.S.-Russian relations have been deeply strained in recent years over Moscows military interference in Ukraine, military support for President Bashar al-Assad in Syria and President Vladimir Putins intolerance of political dissent. Republicans at the hearing said it was too soon to know whether a special counsel was appropriate in the case. Rosenstein noted that former Attorney General Loretta Lynch had been asked to appoint a special prosecutor when the allegations first came to light. He said she rejected the request and chose to use career prosecutors in the case. Rosenstein has experience working for a special counsel on investigations involving the presidency. In the mid-1990s he was part of independent counsel Kenneth W. Starrs team of prosecutors who investigated Bill and Hillary Clinton. The 26-year Justice Department veteran is seen by many current and former department officials as a politically neutral pick. Political affiliations are irrelevant to my work, Rosenstein told the committee. Named as Marylands top prosecutor by President George W. Bush, Rosenstein stayed in office through the Obama administration. Mr. Rosenstein should commit to naming a special prosecutor to look into the Trump campaigns ties to Russia, said Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer in a statement.

Garner died in July 2014 after a white police officer put him in a chokehold. The Justice Departments probe into his death has been stalled by internal disagreements over whether federal investigators have enough evidence to proceed, according to news reports. The Rev. Al Sharpton, a civil rights leader from New York, urged Sessions to move aggressively on the case, Sharpton told reporters. Garner, a father of six, was accused of illegally selling cigarettes on a sidewalk when an officer put him in the chokehold from behind and brought him down with the help of other officers. Garner complained repeatedly that he could not breathe. The city medical examiner ruled Garners death a homicide, with asthma and obesity as contributing factors. The Garner case was the only issue on which Sessions promised to take action during Tuesdays 45-minute meeting with six civil rights advocates who raised concerns over his stance on police reform, voting laws and minority rights, the advocates told a news conference. The Justice Department declined to comment on the meeting.  Sessions called three civil rights groups about a week after he was confirmed on Feb. 8 to express his interest in talking with them, Sharpton said. Sessions declined to comment when the advocates urged him to advise President Donald Trump against creating a voter fraud task force, said Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. The advocates cited numerous studies showing such fraud was rare in the United States, she said.

The Senate voted 51-48 to approve a resolution to repeal the Bureau of Land Managements Resource Management Planning rule, known as BLM 2.0, finalized in December by the Obama administration.  The rule updated the 30-year process the agency followed when developing land-use plans across the 245 million acres of federal land it manages. Senators who voted to revoke the rule, such as Republican Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, chair of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said it diluted local authority over decisions about how to use land for grazing, energy and mineral development and recreation, and gave outside voices an outsized say in local matters. Supporters, such as the energy committees top Democrat, Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington, said the rule modernized the existing BLM process to make it more transparent. When it comes to public lands, we want transparency, we want sunshine, we want a bottom-up approach when it comes to land management, Cantwell said.  Republicans have taken advantage of a seldom-used law known as the Congressional Review Act to overturn the BLM 2.0 rule as well as other recently enacted regulations with simple majorities in both chambers, denying senators the opportunity to filibuster and stall a vote. Last month, Republicans repealed a securities disclosure rule aimed at curbing corruption at energy and mining companies and voted to ax methane emissions limits on drilling operations using the CRA.   Some conservation groups said using the CRA to revoke the measure was a knee-jerk and unnecessary measure, and that the land planning rule could have been revised by the BLM.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives have unveiled a plan to replace Obamacare, known formally as the Affordable Care Act, stripping away much of Democratic President Barack Obamas signature domestic policy achievement that insured 20 million Americans.  President Donald Trump and his Republicans had vowed for years to dismantle the law. It was a central campaign issue in 2016. Two House committees will next review the bill, so it could still change substantially. Here are its main provisions:  The Republicans want to eliminate next year Obamacares income-based tax credits that help low-income people purchase individual insurance. These would be replaced with age-based tax credits ranging from $2,000 to $4,000 per year that would be capped at upper income levels. While Obamacares credits provided more assistance to those with lower incomes, those in the Republican plan would be largely based on age.  The Republican bill would abolish most Obamacare taxes, including taxes on medical devices, health insurance premiums, indoor tanning salons, prescription medications and high-cost employer-provided insurance known as Cadillac plans. Those taxes paid for Obamacare. Republicans have not said how they would pay for the parts of the law they want to keep.  The bill also repeals the Obamacare financial penalty for the 2016 tax year for not purchasing insurance, as well as a surtax on investment income earned by upper-income Americans.  And it repeals the mandate that larger employers must offer insurance to their employees. Under Obamacare, more than 30 states, including several Republican states, expanded the Medicaid government health insurance program for the poor. About half of Obamacare enrollees obtained insurance through the expansion. The bill would allow the Medicaid expansion to continue until January 1, 2020, providing states that chose not to expand under Obamacare a window to enroll more people. After that date, the expansion would end and Medicaid funding would be capped on a per-person basis. States that did not expand Medicaid would receive additional funds through a number of changes, including the reinstatement of disproportionate share hospital payments, money that is provided to hospitals that serve a large number of Medicaid and uninsured people. State Medicaid plans would no longer have to cover the same essential health benefits that health insurers on Obamacares exchanges must provide. That fulfills a Republican promise to return more control to the states, as they can decide what their Medicaid plans must cover. The Republican plan would maintain some of Obamacares most popular provisions. It would allow young people to stay on their parents health plan until age 26, ban insurers from discriminating against those with pre-existing conditions and bans insurers from setting a lifetime dollar limit on coverage. But the bill would allow insurers to mark up premiums by 30 percent for those who have a lapse in insurance coverage of about two months or more.  Insurers won another provision they had long sought: The ability to charge older Americans up to five times more than young people. Under Obamacare, they could only charge up to three times more. It would also allow states to set their own ratio.  The measure also provides states with $100 billion to create programs for patient populations, including high-risk pools to provide insurance to the sickest patients. The bill would also revoke federal funding for Planned Parenthood for one year. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, is expected to announce as early as this week the reopening of a review of the rules that were set by the Obama administration for the 2022-2025 period. Automakers say the changes, which would raise the fleet average fuel efficiency to more than 50 miles per gallon by 2025 from 27.5 mpg in 2010, will impose significant costs and are out of step with consumer preferences. They argue they need more flexibility to meet the rules amid low gas prices. Environmentalists, who favor the new standards, say they would reduce fuel costs and greenhouse gases and have vowed to sue if the Trump administration weakens them. These automobile emissions standards are economically feasible and technologically achievable for the auto industry, the Democratic senators, including Edward Markey of Massachusetts and former presidential candidate Bernard Sanders of Vermont, wrote in a letter to Pruitt. It is critical that they remain in place. EPA spokeswoman Cathy Milbourn declined to comment on the letter since the agency has not announced how it will proceed on the vehicle emission standards. The White House also declined to comment. Trade groups representing automakers, including General Motors Co (GM.N), Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T), have asked the EPA to withdraw the rules, which stem from a 2011 deal the industry reached with the U.S. government. The chief executives of GM, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI), along with the top North American executives at Toyota, Volkswagen, Honda, Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS) and others separately have urged President Donald Trump to revisit the decision. The Obama administration in 2011 said the changes would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles and cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years. In July, the EPA estimated the fleet would average 50.8-52.6 mpg in 2025 because Americans were buying more SUVs and trucks. It had until April 2018 to decide whether the standards were feasible under a midterm review, but moved up its decision to a week before President Barack Obama left office. The EPA is also considering taking steps to reverse Californias waiver under the Clean Air Act that allows it to set its own vehicle greenhouse gas emissions standards. California has repeatedly vowed to vigorously contest any efforts to withdraw its authority, and in January the state hired former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to represent it. At the Geneva auto show, Fiat Chrysler Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne told reporters he opposed the Obama administrations decision to finalize the rules. We have simply asked that the case be reopened to understand what the consequences would be of the norms introduced five years ago, Marchionne said, adding that he expects to see a positive reply in the coming days from the Trump administration.

The Nasdaq Biotechnology index .NBI was 0.8 percent lower, pausing momentum for the index, which has climbed about 12 percent this year after a brutal 2016. Im skeptical about what it is that he might do that would actually have a material impact on drug prices, said Paul Heldman, managing partner at Heldman Simpson Partners, which follows healthcare issues for institutional investors out of Washington. I wouldnt rule it out, but Im just not there yet that he has some sort of broad plan that has a big impact in the marketplace that will actually become law, Heldman said. U.S. Representative Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, said he would meet with Trump on Wednesday to discuss efforts to lower prescription drug prices. Trump has long vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare. The House Republicans legislation would eliminate the requirement that most Americans obtain medical insurance and create a system of tax credits to encourage people to purchase private insurance. After Mondays release of the replacement plan, hospital stocks fell, with Tenet Healthcare (THC.N) and Community Health Systems (CYH.N) each down more than 5 percent. Shares of health insurers were mostly modestly higher. Trumps tweet was his latest criticism of drug prices. As president-elect, he said in January that the industry was getting away with murder in what it charges the government for medicines. He told Congress last week that more needs to be done to bring down artificially high prices for prescription drugs. While drug stocks have reacted to Trumps comments, so far there seems to be no there, there, said Ira Loss, senior healthcare analyst with Washington Analysis.  Loss noted that Republicans historically are wary of non-market solutions to drug pricing. I think there is a big disconnect between what hes talking about ... and what the natural instincts of a Republican-controlled Congress are, Loss said. Brad Loncar, manager of the Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF (CNCR.O), said Trumps comments are the type of statement that would have sent biotech stocks down 4 percent six months ago. The fact that hasnt come anywhere near that so far today I think is a good sign the market has learned to wait for specifics on these things and not overreact, Loncar said. Even tweets have a law of diminishing returns. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

McMasters reappointment as President Donald Trumps national security adviser, despite some concern over his handling of a sexual assault case. The committee vote was 23-2, with two abstentions. The complete vote breakdown was not immediately available, but one no came from Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. Gillibrand, a leader of congressional efforts to address sexual assault in the military, said she was concerned about McMasters past decision to allow two service members accused of assault to advance their careers while the case against them was open, in violation of Army regulations. General McMaster was more concerned about hampering these mens careers than following the rules in pursuit of justice, she said in a statement.  The Washington Post reported last week that the Army investigated McMaster and rebuked him in 2015 over a case in which two lieutenants were allowed to attend the elite Army Ranger School despite being under investigation for assault. The case against them was later dropped. The Senate does not normally approve a presidents national security advisor. However, U.S. law requires McMasters reappointment to the new position to be approved because he is an active-duty military officer. A Senate aide said Senator Elizabeth Warren, another Democrat, was the other no vote. Her office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The 2015 deal between Iran and six major powers restricts Tehrans nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of international economic sanctions against the Islamic Republic.  Trump has called the agreement the worst deal ever negotiated. His administration is now carrying out a review of the accord which could take months, but it has said little about where it stands on specific issues. The Trump administration also gave few clues about any potential policy shift on Tuesday in a statement to a quarterly meeting of the U.N. nuclear watchdogs Board of Governors. The United States will approach questions of JCPOA interpretation, implementation, and enforcement with great strictness indeed, the statement to the International Atomic Energy Agencys (IAEA) 35-nation board said, citing the deals full name: the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. But the U.S. statement, the first to the Board of Governors since Trump took office in January, also repeated language used by the administration of former U.S. president Barack Obama, for whom the deal was a legacy achievement. Iran must strictly and fully adhere to all commitments and technical measures for their duration, it said - wording identical to that used in the U.S. statement to the previous Board of Governors meeting in November. The IAEA, which polices the restrictions on Irans nuclear activities under the deal, last month produced a quarterly report saying that Irans stock of enriched uranium had halved after coming close to a limit imposed by the agreement. That report was the first to specify how much enriched uranium Iran has, thanks to a series of agreements between Tehran and major powers clarifying items that would not count toward the stock. Some major powers had criticized previous reports for not being specific enough on items such as the size of the enriched uranium stock, and the U.S. statement called for future reports to be as detailed. We welcome inclusion of the additional level of detail, and expect it will continue in the future, it said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The new order, which takes effect on March 16, keeps a 90-day ban on travel to the United States by citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. It applies only to new visa applicants, meaning some 60,000 people whose visas were revoked under the previous order will now be permitted to enter. Immigration advocates said the new ban still discriminated against Muslims and failed to address some of their concerns with the previous order. Legal experts said it would, however, be harder to challenge because it affects fewer people living in the United States and allows more exemptions to protect them. Trump, who first proposed a temporary travel ban on Muslims during his presidential campaign last year, had said his original Jan. 27 executive order was a national security measure meant to head off attacks by Islamist militants.  It sparked chaos and protests at airports, where visa holders were detained and later deported back to their home countries. It also drew criticism from targeted countries, Western allies and some of Americas leading corporations before a U.S. judge suspended it on Feb. 3.  As threats to our security continue to evolve and change, common sense dictates that we continually re-evaluate and reassess the systems we rely upon to protect our country, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters after Trump signed the new order.  Democrats, a minority in Congress, quickly signaled fierce opposition to what they called a discriminatory ban. The Trump administrations repackaging has done nothing to change the immoral, unconstitutional and dangerous goals of their Muslim and refugee ban, House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement. Farhana Khera, executive director of Muslim Advocates, a civil rights group in Washington, said the Trump administration had doubled down on anti-Muslim bigotry. She told reporters on a conference call: Its crystal clear this is a Muslim ban.  But some Republicans who had been critical of Trumps original order were more positive on the new one. Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he was very encouraged by the approach and pleased that Iraq was removed from the list. Iraq was taken off the banned list because the Iraqi government has imposed new vetting procedures, such as heightened visa screening and data sharing, and because of its work with the United States in countering Islamic State militants, a senior White House official said. Trumps original ban resulted in more than two dozen lawsuits in U.S. courts. The Justice Department estimated 60,000 people had their visas revoked by the first order but senior administration officials said on Monday those visas were now valid again for entry into the United States. By rescinding his earlier executive order, President Trump makes one thing perfectly clear: his original travel ban was indefensible - legally, constitutionally and morally, said    Attorney General Bob Ferguson of Washington state, which succeeded in having the previous ban suspended. His office will likely decide this week on whether to proceed with litigation over the new order, he said. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said he expected the revised order to have the same uphill battle in the courts as the original version. A watered down ban is still a ban, he said in a statement. Despite the administrations changes, thisdangerous executive order makes us less safe, not more, it is mean-spirited, and un-American.It must be repealed. The fact the ban affects fewer people already in the United States means it will be more difficult for opponents to find plaintiffs who have been harmed by the order and thus have legal standing to challenge it, legal experts said.  The revised order expressly makes waivers possible for a foreign national seeking to enter the United States to visit a spouse, child or parent who is a U.S. citizen, or for significant business or professional obligations.   They dotted their is and crossed their ts in trying to anticipate what litigation might result, said Stephen Yale-Loehr, a Cornell Law School professor. The revised order means that tens of thousands of legal permanent U.S. residents - or green card holders - from the listed countries will no longer be affected. The original order barred travelers from the seven nations from entering for 90 days and all refugees for 120 days. Refugees from Syria were to be banned indefinitely but under the new order they are not given separate treatment. Refugees in transit and already approved would be able to travel to the United States under the new order. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who along with several other senior Cabinet members had lobbied for Iraqs removal from the list of banned countries, was consulted on the new order and the updated version does reflect his inputs, Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis said.  Thousands of Iraqis have fought alongside U.S. troops for years or worked as translators since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003. Many have resettled in the United States after being threatened for working with U.S. troops. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

People dont go to places where they dont feel welcome, Taleb Rifai, the secretary general of the tourism organization, told Reuters, before the worlds biggest travel trade fair, ITB Berlin, opens on Wednesday. Trump on Monday signed a revised executive order banning citizens from six Muslim-majority nations from traveling to the United States but removing Iraq from the list, after his controversial first attempt was blocked in the courts. Its not about the details of which countries are included, its about the attitude, Rifai said on Tuesday. Last week, he told Reuters that the United States had lost $185 million in one month after the first ban was introduced and stood to lose tens of millions more each month if similar policies continued. Data from travel analysis company ForwardKeys this week showed that demand for travel to the United States over the coming months had already flattened out following a positive start to the year. But any downturn in demand for travel to the United States is not expected to have an impact on travel in general. International tourist numbers are expected to grow 3 to 4 percent this year from last years 1.24 billion, Rifai said on Tuesday. The world has opened up in incredible ways. There are so many options now. If you want to gamble, you dont have to go to Las Vegas, you can go to Macau instead, he said. Market researcher Euromonitor has cut its forecast for U.S. arrivals by 2020 to 84.2 million from 85.2 million amid uncertainty over the travel ban. Caroline Bremner, head of travel research at Euromonitor, said the seven countries included in the original travel ban represented only 0.1 percent of total inbound travelers there. And so the impact on volume is not going to be as much as the message that the U.S. is sending to business and leisure travelers around the world, about the level of international openness and type of welcome they will receive under the new government, she said.

By way of introduction, Carson shared anecdotes from his past career as a neurosurgeon and praised immigrants who worked long hours to build a better life for their children.

But they too had a dream that one day their sons, daughters, grandsons, granddaughters, great-grandsons, great-granddaughters might pursue prosperity and happiness in this land, he said. Enslaved Africans did not voluntarily come to the United States and were denied freedom for hundreds of years.

The American people deserve it, McCain, a Republican from Arizona, told Reuters. Jason Chaffetz, a Republican lawmaker who heads the U.S. House of Representatives Oversight and Government Reform Committee, told CBS in an interview on Monday that he had not seen anything directly that would support what the president has said. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who heads the Senate Judiciary subcommittee looking into allegations Russia meddled in the election, said the panel would be asking both Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey and the Justice Department whether he had told the law enforcement agency this weekend to reject Trumps wire-tapping claim.

Sessions, then a U.S. senator from Alabama, was a high-ranking player in Trumps 2016 campaign.

On a 49-48 vote, the Senate endorsed a joint resolution under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to overturn the contractor disclosure rule. The U.S. House of Representatives approved it last month, so all that is left to kill the regulation is President Donald Trumps signature on the resolution. The resolution targeting the contractor regulation, dubbed the blacklisting rule by critics, is a part of a larger Republican effort to use the CRA to rollback a swath of federal regulations finalized in the last seven months of the Obama administration.  Trump has signed three CRA resolutions thus far, which eliminated an environmental rule for streams and wetlands, a measure enhancing background checks for mentally ill gun purchasers and a requirement that oil, gas and mining companies report payments to foreign governments. Republican lawmakers have introduced measures targeting more than 30 rules. The CRA is an efficient method to eliminate recently passed rules, as it is much faster than going through the full regulatory process and cannot be filibustered in the Senate. A CRA resolution also bars agencies from issuing substantially similar regulations in the future. The Senate voted on Monday to eliminate the Obama administrations regulation issued last year calling for companies bidding on federal contracts valued at more than $500,000 to disclose violations of 14 U.S. labor and employment laws and their state equivalents, including those governing wage and hour, collective bargaining, discrimination, and safety and health. Associated Builders and Contractors and other trade groups sued to stop the contractor rule and a federal judge in Texas in October blocked most of it from taking effect. The U.S. Labor Department is appealing that ruling at the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, but the legal challenge will be unnecessary once Trump signs the CRA resolution as expected.

Kelly was asked in a CNN interview about the proposal, first reported by Reuters on Friday, in which the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) would change U.S. policy and keep parents in custody while putting children in the care of the Health and Human Services Department. Yes, I am considering - in order to deter more movement along this terribly dangerous network - I am considering exactly that, Kelly said. We have tremendous experience in dealing with unaccompanied minors, he said. They will be well cared for as we deal with their parents. The policy change would allow the government to keep parents in custody while they contest deportation or wait for asylum hearings. Children would be put into the least restrictive setting until they can be taken into the care of a U.S. relative or state-sponsored guardian, said government officials who were briefed on the proposal. Currently, families contesting deportation or applying for asylum are generally released from detention quickly and allowed to remain in the United States until their cases are resolved. A federal appeals court ruling bars prolonged child detention. Let me start by saying I would do almost anything to deter the people from Central America from getting on this very, very dangerous network that brings them up through Mexico into the United States, Kelly said.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The new, more narrowly tailored temporary travel ban President Donald Trump signed on Monday will be more difficult to challenge successfully in court, legal experts said. They said that since his order no longer covers legal residents or existing visa holders, and makes waivers possible for some business, diplomatic and other travelers, challengers are likely to have a harder time finding people in the United States who can legally claim they have been harmed, and thus have so-called standing to sue.  Trumps first executive order signed on Jan. 27 banned travelers from seven Muslim-majority nations - Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen - for 90 days and halted refugee admission for four months, barring Syrian refugees indefinitely. Its hasty implementation caused chaos and protests at airports. The order was hit with more than two dozen lawsuits, many that claimed it discriminated against Muslims. The new ban, which goes into effect on March 16, removes Iraq and adds categories of people who would be exempt from the order. The Trump administration said the executive order is necessary for national security reasons. It also lists groups of people that could be eligible for waivers, including travelers who have previously been admitted to the United States for work or school, those seeking to visit or live with a close relative and who would face hardship if denied entry; infants, young children and adoptees or people in need of medical care, employees of the U.S. government and international organizations among others.      All the exceptions make the new order a lot harder to attack, said Andrew Greenfield, an immigration attorney with Fragomen law firm in Washington D.C.  Trump had promised to make the new directive harder to fight in court and many of the changes were expected. They dotted their is and crossed their ts in trying to anticipate what litigation might result, said Stephen Yale-Loehr, a Cornell Law School professor who specializes in immigration. He said opponents might still be able to find plaintiffs - a U.S. citizen could potentially sue if the government denies a waiver to their foreign spouse for an arbitrary reason, for example. In a legal challenge to the original order, the state of Washington was successful in preventing it from being carried out. A federal judge in Seattle and then an appeals court in San Francisco ruled that Washington could claim standing, in part because the order adversely affected legal permanent residents, known as green card holders, in the state. More than 100 businesses, including many of the best-known tech companies, filed briefs in court that argued their employees were harmed. Bob Ferguson, the Attorney General for Washington State said on Monday that he will likely decide on the next litigation steps this week after consulting with state universities and businesses about potential harms. We need to do our homework and be thoughtful about this, Ferguson said. The U.S. Department of Justice, in a filing in Seattle federal court on Monday, said the new order applies only to those who are overseas and without a visa.  Foreign nationals outside the country who do not have a U.S. visa do not have the same protections under the U.S. Constitution as people already here, legal experts said.  Rosemary Jenks, the director of Government Relations at NumbersUSA, a conservative group that favors less immigration overall, said that the new order would leave the state of Washington having to argue on behalf of unidentified foreign nationals who have not been screened, vetted or processed yet by U.S. authorities. That would be a pretty big stretch, Jenks said. And unlike the old order, the new one lays out with more detail why the specific countries were selected, she said.   Attorneys challenging the ban, including the American Civil Liberties Union said there were still questions about whether or not the ban is justified by national security reasons and the revisions do not address concerns that the order discriminates based on religion.  Adam Lauridsen, a Keker & Van Nest attorney in San Francisco representing students challenging Trumps first order, noted the revised directive still targets Muslim-majority countries.  StephenLegomsky, chief counsel at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in the previous Obama administration,     pointed to statements by Trump about wanting a Muslim ban. That evidence is baked in, you cant change the past, said Legomsky. He said, however, that does not mean the inevitable legal challenges will ultimately be successful in the likelihood that they reach the U.S. Supreme Court. Its not a slam dunk.

The House of Representatives is expected to unveil its legislation soon.  Under a Feb. 10 draft of the legislation made available to several news outlets, Republicans proposed offering an age-based refundable tax credit regardless of income level. That was resisted by conservatives who called it another entitlement program. Critics also said extremely wealthy people would receive the credit even though they do not need it.  In the most recent version of the bill, the tax credits would only be available to those within certain income levels, according to Politico. They would start to phase out for individuals earning $75,000 and households earning $150,000, and would be unavailable for individuals who earn more than $215,000, Politico reported.  Republicans had also initially proposed capping exemptions on employer-provided health coverage, a provision that drew the ire of some conservatives who said the bill would remove Obamacares taxes only to replace it with another.  According to Politico, the latest version of the bill would not include a cap.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Transgender students at U.S. public schools were left in legal limbo on Monday about whether a federal anti-discrimination law enables them to use the bathroom of their choice after the Supreme Court sidestepped a major ruling on the issue. In canceling planned arguments in a bathroom access lawsuit brought by a Virginia transgender high school student, the justices declined to resolve whether transgender students are protected by a law, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, that bars discrimination on the basis of sex in education. Bathroom access has become a key issue in the intensifying battle over transgender rights. North Carolina last year became the first state to require people to use bathrooms matching their gender at birth in public schools and government buildings. About a dozen other states are considering similar measures. President Donald Trumps administration last month rescinded guidance given to public schools last year by former President Barack Obamas administration to permit transgender students to use bathrooms that correspond to their gender identity. We had emphasized this is an urgent situation for transgender students, said Joshua Block, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union who represents Gavin Grimm, the student who brought the case that the Supreme Court dodged. Block said the justices action, which threw out a lower court ruling favoring Grimm and instructed that court to reconsider the matter in light of the Trump administrations stance, was justice delayed not justice denied. In the meantime, the question of whether Title IX protects transgender students will continue to be litigated in lower courts and mostly likely will be decided by the Supreme Court in the coming years, perhaps as early as 2018. A handful of cases are pending in federal courts, including Grimms, all of which could reach the Supreme Court. Courts are also set to decide the related legal question of whether school policies that limit access to bathrooms violate the U.S. Constitutions equal protection guarantee. In Grimms case, the Richmond-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will now take a second shot. Its earlier ruling had been based on the Obama administrations interpretation, now reversed by Trump, that Title IX protects transgender students. The 4th Circuit separately is due to hear arguments in May in a challenge brought to the North Carolina law, which still may be repealed following a public outcry against it. In the most recent ruling, a federal district judge in Pennsylvania on Feb. 27 decided in favor of three transgender students who attend Pine-Richland High School in the Pittsburgh suburbs. The court ruled that the schools refusal to allow the students to use the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity violated their constitutional rights. Other cases are pending in Illinois, Ohio and Wisconsin. We expect and urge all schools to meet their moral and legal responsibility to fully respect and include their transgender students, as thousands of schools around the country have already been doing for years, Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality advocacy group, said after the high courts action.  Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council Christian conservative advocacy group, said the Supreme Courts action provided good news to parents and students concerned about privacy and safety in school showers, locker rooms and bathrooms. State and local officials working together with parents are best equipped to design policies that respect the dignity, privacy, and safety concerns of all students, Perkins said. By the time the transgender bathroom issue returns, the Supreme Court, which has been down one justice for nearly 13 months, likely will have its full complement of nine justices. If Trumps high court nominee, conservative appellate judge Neil Gorsuch, is confirmed by the U.S. Senate, the court would once again have a conservative majority. Gorsuchs confirmation hearing is due to start on March 20. Transgender rights advocates remain hopeful that conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy, the courts regular swing vote who ruled in favor of gay marriage in 2015, will side with the courts liberals on upholding transgender rights.

In one of his first actions as president, Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 23 reinstating the so-called Mexico City policy, known by critics as the global gag rule, which withholds U.S. funding for international organizations that perform abortions or provide information about abortion. Although other Republican presidents have also adopted the policy, Trump broadened the scope to all global health assistance, which may encompass as much as fifteen times more federal funding than previous Republican administrations versions of this policy, the six senators wrote in the letter, which was seen by Reuters. The order withholds half a billion dollars or more in U.S. funds, and aid groups said it was issued with so little guidance that they have been scrambling to figure out how to proceed.  In the letter, the senators said Trumps broader order now includes the Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and all other global health programs funded through the Department of State, Agency for International Development and Department of Health and Human Services. PEPFAR, which enjoys broad bipartisan support in Congress, is the largest provider of AIDS-fighting medicine in the world, and has been credited with saving millions of lives.

The administration has no position either way on this issue at this time, the White House official confirmed to Reuters. The statements come after news last week that Icahn had reached out to the White House regarding the change. The debate centers on the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), a 2005 policy that requires increasing volumes of biofuels to be added to gasoline and diesel each year. Oil refiners including Valero Energy Corp and CVR Energy Inc currently have to show environmental regulators they are meeting those annual mandates, and have urged the government to push this compliance further downstream to fuel blenders and integrated oil companies.  Opponents of the change say it will complicate ensuring compliance and that it could threaten the future of the RFS policy that sets the annual requirements for use of biofuels with gasoline and diesel. Confusion over Trumps plans for RFS sparked wild swings in energy and agricultural markets last week. Carl Icahn, who owns a majority stake in CVR, said he had reached out to the White House about the issue.

(Reuters) - Supporters of Donald Trump clashed with counter-protesters at a rally in the famously left-leaning city of Berkeley, California, on a day of mostly peaceful gatherings in support of the U.S. president across the country.  At a park in Berkeley, across the bay from San Francisco, protesters from both sides struck one another over the head with wooden sticks and Trump supporters fired pepper spray as police in riot gear stood at a distance.  Some in the pro-Trump crowd, holding American flags, faced off against black-clad opponents. An elderly Trump supporter was struck in the head and kicked on the ground.  Organizers of the so-called Spirit of America rallies in at least 28 the countrys 50 states had said they expected smaller turn-outs than the huge crowds of anti-Trump protesters that clogged the streets of Washington and other cities the day after the Republicans inauguration on Jan. 20.  MORE FROM REUTERS * White House asksfor Obama investigation * ReutersTV: Energy pros face a future that doesnt need them *Slideshow: Brutal street battle for Mosul There are a lot of angry groups protesting and we thought it was important to show our support, said Peter Boykin, president of Gays for Trump, who helped organize Saturdays rally in Washington.  In many towns and cities, the rallies did not draw more than a few hundred people. At some, supporters of the president were at risk of being outnumbered by small groups of anti-Trump protesters who gathered to shout against the rallies.  In Berkeley, the total crowd of both supporters and detractors numbered 200 to 300 people, police spokesman Byron White said. Three people were injured in the clash, including one who had teeth knocked out, and police made five arrests.  One Trump supporter who took part in the violence came equipped with a baton, a gas mask and a shield emblazoned with the American flag.  White said police did break up fights between the two sides.  Weve made a number of arrests, its one of those things where we monitor the situation and take action as necessary, he said.  The violence comes a month after mask-wearing protesters at the University of California, Berkeley, shut down a planned speech by a provocative far-right commentator by lighting fires and smashing windows.  On Saturday, smaller skirmishes broke out in other parts of the country.  In Minnesota, 400 Trump supporters packed the state capitol rotunda in St. Paul and were met by a smaller group of counter-demonstrators, according to the Star Tribune. Scuffles erupted and six counter-protesters were arrested, the newspaper reported.  In Nashville, Tennessee, Trump supporters and counter-protesters cursed at each other and occasionally made physical contact, but state troopers broke up the fighting, according to the citys public radio station.  Most rallies appeared to take place without any disruption or violence, like one outside the Michigan State Capitol in Lansing.  How can anyone be disappointed with bringing back jobs? And he promised he would secure our borders, and thats exactly what hes doing, said Meshawn Maddock, one of the organizers of the rally which drew about 200 people.  Brandon Blanchard, 24, among a small group of anti-Trump protesters, said he had come in support of immigrants, Muslims and transgender people, groups that have been negatively targeted by Trumps rhetoric and policies.  I feel that every American that voted for Trump has been deceived, Blanchard said.  More than 200 supporters of the president rallied in downtown San Diego.  After this, I think people will take the hint, said former U.S. Marine David Moore, 42, a participant in the rally. Its okay to voice support for the president and the country.  In Palm Beach, Florida, where Trump is staying this weekend at his Mar-a-Lago resort, the presidents motorcade stopped and Trump stepped outside his car to wave at a crowd of dozens of supporters. A smaller group of protesters stood across the street.  In New York, about 200 people demonstrated their support for the president in front of Trump Tower in midtown Manhattan.

A federal housing voucher allowed Daniels to escape her crime-plagued neighborhood in Dallas, Texas, and move her four children to the suburb of Garland. That move helped Daniels find a good job, working for a property management company. Today, she cherishes the small, two-bedroom house she rents, with a yard where her children can safely play, away from drugs and gang violence in Dallas. But if Daniels, 31, were to lose the $1,082 monthly stipend she receives, she has no doubt what would happen. I would have to move back, she said. I wouldnt be able to afford it. Pulling Americans out of poverty is a subject close to Ryans heart. And President Donald Trump has frequently talked about aiding the inner cities. But the housing assistance provided by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD, could fall victim to fiscal policies under consideration by the White House and Congress, which include a massive tax cut and increased military spending, according to a dozen congressional aides who spoke to Reuters. While the White House has not been specific about its plans for HUD  the budget process remains in flux  it has called for a $54 billion cut in non-military discretionary domestic programs in the next fiscal year, which likely will dramatically impact safety-net programs that are not entitlements such as Medicare and Social Security, budget experts said.      Altogether, housing advocates paint a bleak picture of the landscape for low-income housing under the Trump administration. They warn that deep cuts to housing funds would force some people out of their homes and hollow out grant programs meant to revitalize urban neighborhoods.  There is also a ripple effect, they warn: Rental prices would likely rise alongside declines in affordable housing projects and vouchers available to renters. That would make it tougher for renters to save enough to eventually buy homes. Its a bad cycle, said Carol Galante, a former top HUD official during the Obama administration. It puts pressure on the rental market. The rents are higher and higher so people can save less and less.  HUD provides about 5 million Americans with some form of housing assistance, either through vouchers to renters, subsidies to landlords or public housing projects, which comprises about 85 percent of its budget. It also sends about $8 billion annually directly to communities through grants. Even so, only about one-quarter of those eligible for assistance in the country receive it. Housing advocates say changes to its budget or mandate would be directly felt in low-income communities. They point out that in 2013, when the legislatively mandated budget cuts known as sequestration hit HUD, more than 100,000 renters nationwide lost their housing support. Douglas Rice, an expert at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, estimates that for every 1 percent cut in HUDs budget, 20,000 renters would lose their assistance But critics of the agency, including some Republican lawmakers, say its anti-poverty and community-development programs are inefficient and wasteful, and that it has failed to live up to its mission. Today, the proportion of Americans who live below the poverty line  14.5 percent  is about the same as it was 35 years ago. HUD has also at times had difficulty shaking the image of a bureaucratic agency that is vulnerable to corruption. It was at the center of a bid-rigging scandal during the Reagan Administration. And Alphonso Jackson, the HUD secretary under President George W. Bush, resigned in 2008 amid allegations that he steered contracts to friends. Charges were never brought against Jackson.  There are some sports teams that never seem to gel. I think were a little like that at HUD, said Bud Albright, a Washington lobbyist who worked at the agency when Republican Jack Kemp was secretary in the early 1990s. Trump, who has not been specific on his plans for the agency, selected Ben Carson to lead HUD. The former neurosurgeon and Republican presidential candidate won Senate confirmation last week.  Although Carsons views hew closely to Republican orthodoxy on how too much government can discourage people from working hard, his upbringing in inner-city Detroit gives him a unique perspective: his mother received food stamps to provide for her family and he was raised around housing assistance programs similar to those he will now manage. Carson, who declined requests for interviews by Reuters, has pledged to fight to protect HUDs housing-assistance budget and preserve the agencys community-development initiatives. He also said he would push to include funding to rehabilitate public-housing facilities in Trumps proposed $1 trillion infrastructure plan. But given the White Houses determination to cut domestic spending, Carson will have to fight for every dollar. A HUD spokesman declined to comment on which programs could be hurt by any possible budget cuts. The White Houses Office of Management and Budget did not respond to a request for comment.   Congress, too, is looking to narrow HUDs reach.  Ryan has called for work requirements and time limits on those who receive housing assistance, similar to how child support, food assistance and other welfare benefits function. Tax reform spearheaded by Ryan and Kevin Brady, the House Ways and Means chairman, could ultimately do away with a key tax credit used by developers to build affordable housing, or could drastically curtail the credits use. One vocal critic of HUD is Jeb Hensarling, Republican chair of the House Financial Services Committee, which oversees the housing agency. Hensarling plans to introduce legislation this year to narrow the $1 trillion portfolio of the Federal Housing Administration, which helps low-income and first-time homebuyers purchase homes, his office said. Hensarling has said he fears that if home values drop the FHA would require another federal bailout as it did in 2013, when it received a taxpayer-funded infusion of $1.7 billion to cover its losses. If the cuts to HUDs budget are as severe as some expect, those who are on waiting lists now for vouchers will be staying on them for a very long time, and recipients such as Shiva Daniels, who has been receiving assistance for six years, will be at risk of seeing that support end. That would mean losing her small house, with the yard she sees as a safe haven for her children. It might not feel like its a big deal, but it is, Daniels said. When you feel good, it allows you to do better, and do better for them. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The New York Times reported on Sunday that FBI Director James Comey asked the Justice Department this weekend to reject Trumps wiretapping claim because it was false and must be corrected, but the department had not done so. The report cited senior U.S. officials. The White House asked Congress, controlled by Trumps fellow Republicans, to examine whether the Obama administration abused its investigative authority during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, as part of an ongoing congressional probe into Russias influence on the election. Trump on Saturday alleged, without offering supporting evidence, that Obama ordered a wiretap of the phones at Trumps campaign headquarters in Trump Tower in New York. There was no such wiretap activity mounted against the president-elect at the time, or as a candidate or against his campaign, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who left his post at the end of Obamas term in office in January, said on NBCs Meet the Press. Under U.S. law, a federal court would have to have found probable cause that the target of the surveillance is an agent of a foreign power in order to approve a warrant authorizing electronic surveillance of Trump Tower. Asked whether there was such a court order, Clapper said, I can deny it. Democrats accused Trump of trying to distract from the rising controversy about possible ties to Russia. His administration has come under pressure from FBI and congressional investigations into contacts between members of his campaign team and Russian officials. Attorney General Jeff Sessions bowed out last week of any probe into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election after it emerged he met last year with Russias ambassador while serving as a Trump campaign advisor. Sessions maintained he did nothing wrong by failing to disclose the meetings. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Trump and administration officials would have no further comment on the issue until Congress has completed its probe, potentially heading off attempts to get Trump to explain his accusations. Reports concerning potentially politically motivated investigations immediately ahead of the 2016 election are very troubling, Spicer said in a statement. U.S. Representative Devin Nunes, Republican head of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee examining possible links between Russia and Trumps campaign, said in a statement that any possible surveillance on campaign officials would be part of the probe. Trump made the wiretapping accusation in a series of early morning tweets on Saturday amid expanding scrutiny of his campaigns ties to Russia. An Obama spokesman denied the charge, saying it was a cardinal rule that no White House official interfered with independent Justice Department investigations. The White House offered no evidence on Sunday to back up Trumps accusation and did not say it was true. Spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders, appearing on ABCs This Week, said Trump has made very clear what he believes, and hes asking that we get down to the bottom of this. Lets get the truth here. Trump, who is spending the weekend at his Florida resort, said in his tweets on Saturday that the alleged wiretapping took place in his Trump Tower office and apartment building in New York, but there was nothing found. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said Trump had either made a false accusation, or a judge had found probable cause to authorize a wiretap.

Trump should immediately turn over any evidence he has to support his allegation, said U.S. Senator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican who serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee. What we need to deal with is evidence, not just statements, she said on CBSs Face the Nation, adding she also had not seen evidence of collaboration but we are in the very early stages of our investigation. Trump fired his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, in February after revelations that he had discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia with the Russian ambassador before Trump took office. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary under Obama, said the president did not have the authority to unilaterally order a wiretap of a U.S. citizen. The president was not giving marching orders to the FBI about how to conduct its investigation, Earnest said on ABCs This Week. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Schwarzenegger had announced on Friday that he would not return for a second season of the NBC show. He blamed Trump, an executive producer and former host of the show, for low ratings, describing the presidents involvement as baggage. Trump sees it differently. Arnold Schwarzenegger isnt voluntarily leaving the Apprentice, he was fired by his bad (pathetic) ratings, not by me, Trump wrote in a message on his personal Twitter account. Sad end to great show. The squabble then continued on Twitter. You should think about hiring a new joke writer and a fact checker, a message on Schwarzeneggers Twitter account read, responding to Trump.  NBC, a unit of Comcast Corp on Friday, did not comment on Schwarzeneggers decision not to return for another season, or on the shows future.  Schwarzenegger, a movie star and former California governor, took over as host of Celebrity Apprentice last year. His first season premiered in January, and was watched by around 4 million to 5 million viewers. Trump faced criticism over potential conflicts of interests after winning the presidency last November when he said he would retain an executive producer credit on the show.  On at least one occasion, he has used part of a public appearance as president to scornfully discuss Schwarzeneggers ratings.

Reuters and other news outlets reported earlier this week that the administration plans to propose to Congress cuts in the budgets for the U.S. State Department and Agency for International Development by about one third. We are going to propose to reduce foreign aid and we are going to propose to spend that money here, White House Office of Management Budget director Mick Mulvaney told Fox News on Saturday, adding the proposed cuts would include fairly dramatic reductions in foreign aid. Mulvaney said the cuts in foreign aid would help the administration fund a proposed $54 billion expansion of the U.S. military budget. The overriding message is fairly straightforward: less money spent overseas means more money spent here, said Mulvaney, a former South Carolina Representative. The United States spends just over $50 billion annually on the State Department and USAID, compared with $600 billion or more each year on the Pentagon. Several Republicans this week on Capitol Hill raised concerns about the planned cuts to the State Department. I am very concerned by reports of deep cuts that could damage efforts to combat terrorism, save lives and create opportunities for American workers, said U.S. Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee. A U.S. government website said 20 government agencies plan to award $36.5 billion in foreign assistance programs in more than 100 countries around the world during the current budget year. Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, tweeted earlier this week: Foreign Aid is not charity. We must make sure it is well spent, but it is less than 1% of budget & critical to our national security. Mulvaney said the Trump administration will release its budget proposal on March 16.

Trump made the accusation in a series of early morning tweets just weeks into his administration and amid rising scrutiny of his campaigns ties to Russia. How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!, Trump wrote in one tweet. Id bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election! The remarkable tussle between the current and former presidents just 45 days since the handover of power is the latest twist in a controversy over ties between Trump associates and Russia that has dogged the early days of his presidency. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded last year that Russia hacked and leaked Democratic emails during the election campaign as part of an effort to tilt the vote in Trumps favor. The Kremlin has denied the allegations. Trump has accused officials in Obamas administration of trying to discredit him with questions about Russia contacts. Obama spokesman Kevin Lewis said it had been a cardinal rule of the Obama administration that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice. Neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen. Any suggestion otherwise is simply false, Lewis said in a statement. The statement did not address the possibility that a wiretap of the Trump campaign could have been ordered by Justice Department officials. Trump said the alleged wiretapping took place in his Trump Tower office and apartment building in New York, but there was nothing found. The White House did not respond to a request to elaborate on Trumps accusations. Trump was spending the weekend at his Florida seaside resort, Mar-a-Lago. He was scheduled to meet with Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly before a dinner with officials also including adviser Steve Bannon and White House Counsel Don McGahn, the White House said. Amid a political storm, Sessions on Thursday announced he would stay out of any probe into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election after it emerged he met last year with Russias ambassador, although he maintained he did nothing wrong by failing to disclose the meeting. A Trump spokeswoman said the president spent part of Saturday having meetings, making phone calls and hitting balls at his golf course in West Palm Beach. His supporters, meanwhile, staged small rallies in at least 28 of the countrys 50 states, most of which passed off peacefully. But there were clashes in the famously left-leaning city of Berkeley, California, where protesters from both sides hit each other over the head with wooden sticks. Trumps tweets caught his aides by surprise, with one saying it was unclear what the president was referring to. Members of Congress said Trumps accusations require investigation or explanation. Senator Ben Sasse, a Republican, described the allegations as serious and said the public deserved more information. He said in a statement it was possible that Trump had been illegally tapped, but, if so, the president should explain what sort of tap it was and how he knew about it. U.S. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, called Trumps assertion a spectacularly reckless allegation. If there is something bad or sick going on, it is the willingness of the nations chief executive to make the most outlandish and destructive claims without providing a scintilla of evidence to support them, Schiff said in a statement. Former Obama adviser Ben Rhodes strongly denied Trumps allegations: No president can order a wiretap. Those restrictions were put in place to protect citizens from people like you, Rhodes wrote on Twitter. Trumps administration has come under pressure from Federal Bureau of Investigation and congressional investigations into contacts between some members of his campaign team and Russian officials during his campaign.  Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said he had no knowledge of any wiretapping but was very worried about the suggestion Obama had acted illegally and would also be concerned if in fact the Obama administration was able to obtain a warrant lawfully about Trump campaign activity. Several other Republicans again urged an investigation into a series of intelligence-related leaks. Obama imposed sanctions on Russia and ordered Russian diplomats to leave the United States in December over the countrys involvement in hacking political parties in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. Under U.S. law, a federal court would have to have found probable cause that the target of the surveillance is an agent of a foreign power in order to approve a warrant authorizing electronic surveillance of Trump Tower. Several conservative news outlets and commentators have made allegations in recent days about Trump being wiretapped during the campaign, without offering any evidence. Trumps first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, resigned in February after revelations that he had discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia with the Russian ambassador to the United States before Trump took office.   Flynn had promised Vice President Mike Pence he had not discussed U.S. sanctions with the Russians, but transcripts of intercepted communications, described by U.S. officials, showed that the subject had come up in conversations between him and the Russian ambassador.

The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) said on Friday that starting April 3 it will suspend premium processing for up to six months. Under this expedited procedure, applicants can be eligible for visa approvals within 15 days, instead of a regular review period that can last for up to a few months. The H-1B non-immigrant visa allows U.S. companies to employ graduate-level workers in several specialized fields, including information technology, medicine, engineering and mathematics. USCIS said that during the suspension period, individuals still can request expedited consideration, but must meet certain criteria, such as humanitarian reasons, an emergency situation or the prospect of severe financial loss to a company or individual. The United States currently caps H-1B visas at 65,000 a year, with an additional 20,000 allowed for those who have earned advanced college degrees in the United States. The visa is valid for three years but can be extended for an additional three years. The agency said that suspending premium processing will allow it to reduce a backlog of long-pending visa petitions and thus reduce overall H-1B processing times. The move comes as the Trump administration also has been implementing tougher deportation procedures against illegal immigrants in the United States and has attempted to impose a visa ban on people from seven primarily Muslim countries. That ban was put on hold by a federal court. President Donald Trump campaigned last year on a promise to crack down on immigrants who he said were taking jobs from U.S. citizens.

Nine Democratic senators sent a letter earlier Friday asking Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley to call Sessions before his panel to explain his failure until this week to disclose his contacts with the Russian ambassador during the 2016 presidential campaign.  The letter came a day after Sessions, the countrys top justice official and a key ally of Republican President Donald Trump, removed himself from any investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the election. Grassley replied that he had no plans for a hearing. Instead, Sessions on Monday will submit written answers to questions posed in the Democratic lawmakers letter, such as why he did not come forward sooner to detail his communications with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak, Justice Department spokesman Peter Carr said. On Thursday, Sessions said he met Kislyak in his Senate office two months before the election as well as at an event with other ambassadors at the Republican National Convention. During the Senate confirmation process to become attorney general, Sessions denied having any contact with Russian officials during the campaign.  Sessions told reporters he had done nothing wrong by failing to disclose the contact with Kislyak. The Washington Post first disclosed the meetings on Wednesday. Many Democrats, who are pushing for a broad probe of ties between Trump campaign associates and Russian operatives, called for Sessions to resign.  Trump, however, has backed his attorney general and accused Democrats of blowing the issue out of proportion for political purposes.     On Friday, he accused Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the Senate, of double standards for having met Russian President Vladimir Putin himself.         We should start an immediate investigation into @SenSchumer and his ties to Russia and Putin. A total hypocrite! Trump said in a tweet that included what appeared to be an old picture of Schumer and Putin smiling as they ate donuts. Schumer, who has called for Sessions resignation, responded in a tweet that he was willing to swear under oath that his contact with Putin and the Russian leaders associates occurred in 2003 and in public with the media present.   Two U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity on Thursday, said Sessions was one of many subjects of a government investigation of any contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia. While there is nothing legally wrong with such meetings, the reported contacts raise questions about the White Houses statements that it knew of no further communications with Russian officials beyond those by ex-national security adviser Michael Flynn, who was fired last month.  The Russia controversy has dogged the early days of the Trump administration and threatens to obscure its push to cut taxes, repeal the Obamacare healthcare law and deal with other top domestic priorities. Democratic senators including Dianne Feinstein and Richard Blumenthal said in their letter that Sessions decision to step back from campaign-related investigations was welcome. But they said his previous answers to questions about Russia were incomplete and misleading. Given the seriousness of this matter, we do not believe that a written submission to correct the record is sufficient, they said in the letter. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded last year that Russia hacked and leaked Democratic emails during the election campaign as part of an effort to tilt the vote in Trumps favor. The Kremlin has denied the allegations. On Friday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the controversy looked like a witch hunt, the RIA news agency reported. Trump called frequently during his campaign for improved relations with Russia, which have been deeply strained in recent years over Moscows military interference in Ukraine, its support for President Bashar al-Assad in Syria and Putins intolerance of political dissent. With his administration on the defensive over Russia, Trumps enthusiasm seems to have cooled, and his top foreign policy advisers have begun talking tougher about Moscow.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Parents who immigrated illegally to the United States and now fear deportation under the Trump administration are inundating immigration advocates with requests for help in securing care for their children in the event they are expelled from the country. The Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles (CHIRLA) advocacy group has been receiving about 10 requests a day from parents who want to put in place temporary guardianships for their children, said spokesman Jorge-Mario Cabrera. Last year, the groupsaid it received about two requests a monthfor guardianshipletters and notarization services.    At the request of a nonprofit organization, the National Lawyers Guild in Washington D.C. put out a call this week for volunteer attorneys to help immigrants fill out forms granting friends or relatives the right to make legal and financial decisions in their absence. In New Jersey, immigration attorney Helen Ramirez said she is getting about six phone calls a day from parents. Last year, she said, she had no such calls. Their biggest fear is that their kids will end up in foster care, Ramirez said. President Donald Trumps administration has issued directives to agents to more aggressively enforce immigration laws and more immigrants are coming under scrutiny by the authorities. For parents of U.S. citizens who are ordered removed, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency accommodates, to the extent practicable, the parents efforts to make provisions for their children, said ICE spokeswoman Sarah Rodriguez. She said that might include access to a lawyer, consular officials and relatives for detained parents to execute powers of attorney or apply for passports and buy airline tickets if the parents decide whether or not to take the children with them. Randy Capps of the Migration Policy Institute (MPI), a Washington-based non-profit that analyzes the movement of people worldwide, said that while putting contingency plans in place is a good idea, he does not think the level of fear is justified. During the previous administration of President Barack Obama, a Democrat, the likelihood of both parents being deported was slim, Capps said.    He doubts there will be a huge shift under Republican Trump toward deporting both parents. The odds are still very low but not as low as they were  and this is just the beginning of the administration, he said. About five million children under the age of 18 are living with at least one parent who is in the country illegally, according to a 2016 study by MPI. Most of the children, 79 percent, were U.S. citizens, the study found. In the second half of 2015, ICE removed 15,422 parents who said they have at least one U.S.-born child, according to ICE data. Obama was criticized for being the deporter in chief after he expelled more than 400,000 people in 2012, the most by any president in a single year. In 2014, the Obama administration began focusing on a narrower slice of immigrants, those who had recently entered the country or committed serious felonies. Trump has said he would still prioritize criminals for deportation. In rural New Jersey, Seidy Martinez and her husband Jose Gomez have begun the difficult conversations with their 10-year-old daughter about what would happen if her parents were deported. Martinez, a house cleaner, and Gomez, who works on a horse farm, are both from Honduras. They entered the United States illegally, and do not have papers, unlike their daughter, who has been granted asylum, and their 3-year-old son, a U.S. citizen. Now we are worried all the time. We dont have anything that would allow us to stay here, said Martinez. Our main concern is what will happen to our children.  She has told her daughter that she could live with her aunt in Miami and is considering drafting paperwork that would give her relative some legal rights if she and her husband are deported. The 10-year old tries to comfort her mother. She tells me, Mami, tranquila. Dont be afraid, I am scared too but dont worry everything will be OK.  Rebecca Kitson, an immigration attorney in Albuquerque, New Mexico, says she advises her increasingly nervous clients to have the kind of conversations Martinez and her husband are having with their children.  She said she urges parents to be specific in their instructions. If Mom doesnt come home by a specific time, who do [the kids] call? said Kitson.  Immigration groups are offering low-cost services. CHIRLA, for example, offers a free sample letter and help filling it out, which then must be notarized at a cost of about $10. But some parents here illegally say they have had trouble finding affordable help. Melvin Arias, 39, a New Jersey landscaper from Costa Rica who entered the United States illegally 13 years ago, said he decided after hearing news of stepped-up immigration enforcement to take legal precautions for his five-year-old son and six-month old daughter, who are both U.S. citizens. But when he asked for help from two different lawyers, Arias was told preparing legal documents would cost him between $700 and $1,250. He is looking for a cheaper way to obtain the paperwork he needs. If there comes a time when both of us have a problem, I want there to be a responsible person who can come and get [the children] for us, to take them to wherever we might be, Arias said.

Part of the reason for the proposal is to deter mothers from migrating to the United States with their children, said the officials, who have been briefed on the proposal. The policy shift would allow the government to keep parents in custody while they contest deportation or wait for asylum hearings. Children would be put into protective custody with the Department of Health and Human Services, in the least restrictive setting until they can be taken into the care of a U.S. relative or state-sponsored guardian. Currently, families contesting deportation or applying for asylum are generally released from detention quickly and allowed to remain in the United States until their cases are resolved. A federal appeals court ruling bars prolonged child detention. President Donald Trump has called for ending catch and release, in which migrants who cross illegally are freed to live in the United States while awaiting legal proceedings. Two of the officials were briefed on the proposal at a Feb. 2 town hall for asylum officers by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services asylum chief John Lafferty.  A third DHS official said the department is actively considering separating women from their children but has not made a decision. HHS and the White House did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement to Reuters, DHS said: The journey north is a dangerous one with too many situations where children - brought by parents, relatives or smugglers - are often exploited, abused or may even lose their lives. With safety in mind, the Department of Homeland Security continually explores options that may discourage those from even beginning the journey, the statement said. U.S. Representative Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat whose district includes about 200 miles (320 km) of the border with Mexico, slammed the proposal. Bottom line: separating mothers and children is wrong, he said in a statement. That type of thing is where we depart from border security and get into violating human rights, he said. About 54,000 children and their guardians were apprehended between Oct. 1, 2016, and Jan. 31, 2017, more than double the number caught over the same time period a year earlier.  Republicans in Congress have argued women are willing to risk the dangerous journey with their children because they are assured they will be quickly released from detention and given court dates set years into the future. Immigrant rights advocates have argued that Central America's violent and impoverished conditions force mothers to immigrate to the United States and that they should be given asylum status. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2m4aPAs) Implementing the new policy proposal could create lifelong psychological trauma, said Marielena Hincapie, executive director at the National Immigration Law Center. Especially for children that have just completed a perilous journey from Central America. Hincapie said the U.S. government is likely to face legal challenges based on immigration and family law if they decide to implement the policy. The policy would allow DHS to detain parents while complying with a 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals order from July 2016 that immigrant children should be released from detention as quickly as possible. That order said their parents were not required to be freed. To comply with that order, the Obama administration implemented a policy of holding women and children at family detention centers for no more than 21 days before releasing them. Holding mothers in prolonged detention could also strain government resources, said Randy Capps of the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington-based non-profit. You are talking about a pretty rapid increase in the detention population if you are going to do this, Capps said. The question is really how much detention can they afford. Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly last week ordered immigration agents to deport or criminally prosecute parents who facilitate the illegal smuggling of their children. Many parents who arrive on the U.S.-Mexico border with their children have paid smugglers to guide them across the dangerous terrain. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

In another effort to deter leaks, White House spokesman Sean Spicer demanded that some aides there surrender their phones so they could be checked for calls or texts to reporters, Politico reported on Sunday.  Word of the inspection quickly leaked. Trump said later he supported Spicer. He added I would have handled it differently than Sean. But Sean handles it his way and Im OK with it, he said in an interview with Fox News.  On Friday, Spicer did not respond to requests for comment on his reasons for demanding the phones from his staff. Two sources familiar with Mnuchins first meeting with senior Treasury staff said he told them that their telephone calls and emails could be monitored to prevent leaks. One of the sources said that staff were told that monitoring could become policy. Asked about Mnuchins comments to his senior staff, a Treasury spokesman said: Secretary Mnuchin had a discussion with staff about confidential information not being shared with the media nor any other sources. In the course of that conversation, the idea of checking phones was not discussed. Asked in a follow-up email whether Mnuchin had raised the possibility of monitoring phones or emails as a matter of policy, the Treasury spokesman replied: It was not discussed.  Attempts by Republican and Democratic presidents to limit leaks are not new. During Republican Richard Nixons administration, the FBI wiretapped White House aides and journalists. Trumps predecessor, Democrat Barack Obama, aggressively pursued leaks to try to control the narrative, as White House aides put it. New York Times reporter James Risen, whose articles led to investigations of leaks, said the Obama administration prosecuted nine cases involving whistleblowers and leakers, compared with three by all previous administrations combined. Leonard Downie, a former executive editor of the Washington Post, said it was too early to make historical comparisons. He said it is rare to learn about an administrations internal efforts to impose message discipline. At the State Department, the fear of getting caught in a leak investigation or running afoul of White House positions is so acute that some officials will discuss issues only face-to-face rather than use phones, email, texts or other messaging applications, two State Department officials said. There is a climate of intimidation, not just about talking to reporters, but also about communicating with colleagues, said one official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Acting State Department spokesman Mark Toner did not respond directly to the officials statements but said Secretary of State Rex Tillerson aimed to foster an open climate where new ideas are raised and considered on their merits. There does have to be some degree of trust among colleagues in order to have those kinds of conversations, Toner said.   There also is high anxiety in parts of DHS,  three officials there said. They said some officials fear phone calls and emails are being monitored to try to find who leaked the draft intelligence  report to the Associated Press. Reuters has no independent evidence that this is the case. The report found that being a citizen of countries covered by Trumps Jan. 27 temporary immigration ban - Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen - was an unreliable indicator of terrorist threat. The DHS did not respond to several requests for comment. Before Trumps Jan. 20 inauguration, National Security Council officials drafting memos, or packages, for the president on a classified computer system could choose other officials who should have input, several current and former officials said. Under a change made after Trump took office, staffers now cannot choose who may see and edit a memo. Instead, access is approved by the office of the NSC executive secretary, retired Army lieutenant general Keith Kellogg. Asked about the new restrictions, National Security Council spokesman Michael Anton said: President Trump takes very seriously the criminal release of classified information critical to U.S. national security. Access procedures are designed to ensure that appropriate personnel see material relevant to their duties, while protecting sensitive information. One U.S. official called the new system inefficient, saying Kelloggs office may not know who has a stake in any given issue and may not share the drafts widely enough. Steven Aftergood of the nonprofit Federation of American Scientists Project on Government Secrecy, which works to limit official secrecy, said the policy change suggested the White House wants to tighten control over internal deliberations. He said restricting access to information adds friction to the decision-making process and predicted that inferior policy decisions are a likely result. Spicer did not immediately comment on Friday on whether the new procedure might harm policy-making. An administration official said the White House changed the access procedures about a month ago in reaction to leaks of the contents of Trumps conversations with the president of Mexico and the prime minister of Australia. Asked if the change had made the NSC less efficient, this official replied: No, because we are being conscientious about ensuring that all relevant staff members and experts are included on materials that they need to see.

Tillerson declined to unveil the report in person, breaking with precedent established during both Democratic and Republican administrations. A senior U.S. official answered reporters questions by phone on condition of anonymity rather than appearing on camera, also a break with precedent. The report speaks for itself, the official said in response to a question about why Tillerson did not unveil it. Were very, very proud of it. The facts should really be the story here. The report, mandated by Congress, documents human rights conditions in nearly 200 countries and territories and is put together by staff in U.S. embassies. This years report was largely completed during former President Barack Obamas tenure. According to the report, Philippine police and vigilantes killed more than 6,000 suspected drug dealers and users since July and extrajudicial killings have increased sharply in the Philippines in the last year. Philippine officials say their government does not tolerate human rights violations or state-sponsored extrajudicial killings. The reports language on Russia remained broadly similar to that of years past, noting the countrys authoritarian political system dominated by President Vladimir Putin. President Donald Trump has said he would like to improve U.S. relations with Russia. Traditionally, the secretary of state unveils the report with public comments emphasizing the centrality of human rights in U.S. foreign policy and highlighting specific findings. Tillersons Democratic predecessors John Kerry and Hillary Clinton gave public comments on the report in 2013 and 2009, their first years in the post, respectively, and continued to present it throughout their tenures.  In 2005, during Republican President George W. Bushs administration, the undersecretary of state for global affairs, Paula Dobriansky, presented the report on camera on behalf of Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. So far in his one-month tenure, Tillerson has not held a news conference and has mostly refrained from answering questions from the media. Human rights groups criticized the way the report was rolled out. Its just signaling a lack of basic interest and understanding in how support for human rights reflects whats best about America, said Rob Berschinski, senior vice president for policy at Human Rights First. Berschinski was deputy assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor until Jan. 20, and helped coordinate the report. On Friday, the U.S. official quoted from Tillersons confirmation hearing to offer proof that he views human rights conditions as crucial to U.S. interests, adding, These statements are very clear about our commitment to human rights. In the introduction to this years report, Tillerson wrote our values are our interests when it comes to human rights. But in his confirmation hearing, Tillerson sidestepped questions on human rights conditions in other countries, declining to condemn countries like Saudi Arabia and the Philippines, saying he wanted to see the facts first. Republican Senator Marco Rubio on Friday said on his Facebook page he was disappointed that the secretary of state did not personally present the latest report. American leadership in defense of basic human rights, on behalf of those whose voices have been silenced, is needed now more than ever, Rubio wrote.

The Trump administration has called for faster removal of immigrants in the United States illegally, but immigration courts, which rule on asylum applications and deportation appeals, are weighed down by a record backlog of more than 542,000 cases. On Jan. 23, Trump froze hiring for all federal government positions, except for military personnel and in some other limited circumstances.  New Attorney General Jeff Sessions determined that Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) positions can continue to be filled, EOIR spokeswoman Kathryn Mattingly told Reuters in an email response to questions about the freeze.  As such, EOIR is continuing to advertise and fill positions nationwide for immigration judges and supporting staff, Mattingly said. The immigration courts are run by the Justice Department, unlike federal courts which are independent.   In a Feb. 20 enforcement memorandum, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said that long delays in immigration court hearings were unacceptable and allow removable aliens with no plausible claim for relief to remain unlawfully in the United States for many years.  There are currently 301 sitting immigration judges in 58 courts nationwide, falling short of the 374 positions Congress has authorized. More than 50 immigration judge candidates are at various stages of the hiring process, which typically takes about a year, according to EOIR. The courts would need about 520 judges to eliminate the backlog, according to a July 2016 study by the advocacy group Human Rights First. The new immigration enforcement guidelines expand the number of people that could be targeted for deportation. Depending on the circumstances, immigrants who are arrested or detained by immigration agents have the right to claim asylum or request deportation relief in immigration court. The issue for the immigration court has really just been the pressing crush of cases, said retired immigration judge Eliza Klein, who sat on the bench in Miami, Boston and Chicago from 1994 to 2015. Judges are told this case is a priority this week and this other kind of case is a priority next week, she said.    ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Its specific to new pipelines or those that are being repaired, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters on Air Force One, when asked about a report by Politico that Keystone would not need to use U.S. steel, despite Trumps order issued on Jan. 24. Since this one is already currently under construction, the steel is already literally sitting there, its hard to go back. Everything moving forward would fall under that executive order, Sanders said. The southern leg of Keystone is completed and started pumping oil in 2013. Some pipe segments that could be used for Keystone XL, which would bring oil from Alberta, Canada to Nebraska, have already been built. Former Democratic president Barack Obama rejected TranCanada Corps (TRP.TO) multibillion-dollar pipeline, saying it would not benefit U.S. drivers and would contribute emissions linked to global warming.  Trumps order expedited the path forward for TransCanada to reapply to build Keystone XL.  In weeks after issuing the order, Trump said in speeches and in meetings, including one with manufacturing CEOs, that Keystone would be required to use U.S. steel. In a speech this week to a joint session of Congress, Trump softened that stance saying new pipelines would have to be made with it. Economists told Reuters days after Trump issued the order that the steel requirement had many loopholes, would not be easily enforceable, and could violate international trade law. Even if there were no loopholes, U.S. steelmakers would receive negligible benefit from Keystone XL, because they have limited ability to meet the stringent requirements for the project. The office of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said it welcomes the allowance of non-U.S. steel, calling it a recognition that the integrated Canadian and U.S. steel industries are mutually beneficial.  TransCanada said it was encouraged by the White House statement on non-U.S. steel and that its presidential permit application on Keystone was making its way through the approval process. Canadian Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said on Twitter that allowing non-U.S. steel was important for companies like Evraz Steel, a local subsidiary of Russias Evraz PLC, which had signed on to provide 24 percent of the steel before Keystone XLs rejection by Obama.

The move by the Republican governor of a Democratic-leaning state is intended in part to signal the gap between his positions and those of the Republican-controlled Congress, many of whose members oppose Planned Parenthood because the organization provides abortions. U.S. laws already prohibit federal money from being used for abortion, but currently allow the Medicaid low-income health program to cover other services, such as screening and treatment for cancers and sexually transmitted diseases. Governor Baker is a strong supporter of womens health and believes the commonwealth has a responsibility to ensure access to the important health care services offered by Planned Parenthood in all corners of our state, Baker spokeswoman Lizzy Guyton said in a statement. The administration is prepared to fund these services should the federal government pursue changes that would block care for women and families here in Massachusetts. Currently about $2 million of the groups $21.5 million budget in the state comes from reimbursements for services to Medicaid patients. Those funds cover treatments for some 10,000 patients a year, about a third of its total, the group said. At a time when extreme politicians in Congress want to block millions of people from accessing essential preventive care at Planned Parenthood health centers, it is reassuring to see Governor Baker put the health and wellbeing of our communities ahead of politics, said Dr. Jennifer Childs-Roshak, chief executive of the Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts. As the governor of a liberal-leaning state that was the first in the nation to legalize gay marriage more than a decade ago, many of Bakers positions on social issues are to the left of national Republicans. He last year signed a law protecting the rights of transgender people and also supports abortion rights. The willingness to step in to fill a budget gap is a pronounced move for a former healthcare executive who has made reining in the states budget a key goal of his administration.

The U.S. Transportation Department said in a notice Friday it is suspending a public comment period on the review of the practices to allow the presidents appointees the opportunity to review and consider this action. Airlines generated $3.8 billion in baggage fees in 2015 and the Obama administration said in October it was formally exploring requiring airlines and ticket agents to provide consumers with prices that include service fees for baggage and other services alongside fares at points of sale.  Separately, the Trump administration is also extending the compliance date for a new regulation requiring reporting of data for mishandled baggage and wheelchairs in aircraft cargo compartments for one year - until Jan. 1, 2019. Airlines for America, the industry trade group representing American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O), United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N), Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) and others, praised the decision. Todays action is a common sense measure reinforcing that the airline industry is capable of making the decisions that best serve our customers, our employees and the communities we serve, the airlines group chief executive Nicholas Calio said in a statement. The group added the airline industry operates under 13,000 regulations across 13 agencies, many of which are outdated, obsolete and in need of reform. President Donald Trump met with airline chief executives last month and asked them to identify regulatory hurdles preventing job growth in the industry. A study commissioned by a travel agencies trade group, the Travel Technology Association, in 2014 found that restricting the ability to comparison-shop would result in ticket prices increasing more than 11 percent. Airline shares rose on the news. JPMorgan said in a research note Friday that the the protections never mattered in the first place - the financial impact of the Obama protections was largely irrelevant, in our view.  The Obama administration efforts were very modest, JPMorgan said, and did not propose limiting airlines ability to pursue ancillary revenue, such as an outright ban on bag fees.  But JPMorgan added: U.S. airlines appear to increasingly have the ear of a sympathetic, regulatory-averse administration. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Trump said in late January he felt absolutely that the practice of waterboarding - a form of simulated drowning - worked as an intelligence-gathering tool. He also said he would defer on the issue to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who disagrees with him about its usefulness. U.N. special rapporteur on protecting human rights Ben Emmerson told the U.N. Human Rights Council that, hearing Trump extol torture as a weapon against terrorism shortly after his inauguration was enough to make my blood run cold. Making his final public comments after six years in the independent post, Emmerson later told reporters that Trump was the first democratically-elected head of state to positively advocate torture.  That is a state of affairs which lays down the gauntlet, it lays down a precedent. Emmerson, a British barrister and international criminal justice expert, said that Trumps comments showed a staggering level of ill-preparedness to govern.  Emmerson also told reporters that rescinding former President Barack Obamas executive order to close the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba would be a grave retrograde step. The center was a legal black hole for security suspects in custody without charge, he said. The U.S. delegation to the 47-member state forum in Geneva did not take the floor to respond. Emmerson also said senior officials from George W. Bushs administration should be prosecuted for allowing torture, Emmerson added. Officials responsible for the secret detention, rendition and torture programs run by the CIA included those in the most senior positions under Bush, he said. Gina Haspel, a veteran clandestine Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) service officer who ran one of the agencys black site prisons set up after the 9/11 attacks, has been named deputy director of the U.S. spy agency. Concerns have also been raised about Trumps nominee for director of national intelligence, former Republican Senator Dan Coats, and his record on the previous U.S. use of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques, such as waterboarding, which are widely seen as torture. If one of the most powerful nations in the world, a permanent member of the Security Council, is once again prepared to abandon our collective values on the pretext of defending them, then one is left to wonder whether anything at all has been achieved in the last 15 years, Emmerson said.

From the start of November to the end of January, investors poured $1.8 billion into actively managed equities funds in the socially responsible category, according to Lipper data. In the same period, there was a net outflow of $133 billion from funds that do not have environmental or social mandates. Trump was elected president on Nov. 8. Investors worried that Trumps policies may imperil causes they believe in are hoping an influx of flows will help keep companies alive. If clients see the federal government withdrawing from a space they think is important, they may actually be more active in wanting to enforce their views through the dollars allocated, said Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at Standish Mellon Asset Management. The inflows are a boon for fund managers but also a challenge, requiring them to find companies whose share prices have a chance to climb despite less favorable federal policies. For instance, shares of solar energy companies took a beating after the election, sliding 11 percent by year end on concerns the future of U.S. tax credits under a Trump administration, though they have recovered somewhat since then. Still, cautious fund managers from Fidelity, New Alternatives, Calvert Investments and others are scrutinizing water technology and wind power shares, which should benefit from new federal infrastructure spending and a push by states such as California toward more renewable power generation. Managers say water technology stocks should see an uptick from Trumps campaign promise to spend $1 trillion on repairing and improving the countrys infrastructure. Wind stocks are attractive as that energy source is proving more cost-effective in growing areas of the country like California, which plans to get half its energy from renewable sources by 2030.  If you look at where the policy is changing the fastest, its at the state level, and we see places like California continuing on that trend regardless of what is happening on the federal level, said Kevin Walenta, who manages the Fidelity Select Environment and Alternative Energy portfolio. He has been adding to his positions in Spanish wind energy company Iberdrola SA and US-based water and plumbing company Comfort Systems USA Inc. Trump has not yet called for ending tax credits for solar and other renewable energy, though he has expressed doubt about the role of solar energy, bemoaned the loss of coal-mining jobs and blamed wind turbines for ruining picturesque landscapes. Ahead of the election, power companies had already started to pivot away from solar and invest more in wind, with companies including Southern Co, NextEra Energy Inc and Xcel Energy Inc announcing plans to expand wind-generating capabilities at a time when technology has helped lower its cost. [L1N1FZ1GR].  Wind power costs average between $32 and $62 per megawatt hour before subsidies, compared with an average between $49 and $61 per megawatt hour for utility-scale solar arrays without subsidies, according to a December 2016 report from Lazard. Coal power, which Trump has pledged to revive, costs between $60 and $143 per megawatt hour, the report notes. With that cost structure, along with the potential increase in jobs from building and maintaining wind turbines, even solidly Republican states should continue to invest in renewables, said Murray Rosenblith, co-portfolio manager of the New Alternatives Fund. Rosenblith has been adding to his positions in wind companies Vestas Wind Systems and Gamesa Corporacion Tecnologica SA, both of whose shares are up 10 percent or more since the start of the year. These are growing industries in states that are bringing back jobs, he said.

You can hear it from my lips: We will not sell or transfer public lands, he said.  The department manages about a fifth of the countrys surface, including national parks, forests and tribal territories, from the Arctic to the Gulf of Mexico.  Zinke said he wanted to change the structure of the department, which includes the National Parks Service and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, to give more authority to rangers and land managers outside the District of Columbia.  The last time the Department of Interior has been reorganized was about 100 years ago, so the reorganization is going to be bold, he said.  Zinke, who arrived on horseback for his first day at the department, did not provide specifics but said he would rely on input from Interiors sub-agencies and bureaus.  The ex-Navy SEAL said employee surveys showed the farther staffers were from Washington, the unhappier they were because they felt they dont have authority.  Zinke, whose home state of Montana is one-third federal land, addressed career employees who face an uncertain future under Republican President Donald Trump.

He told reporters after his speech that he would review some executive actions from the waning days of the administration of former president Barack Obama, a Democrat, that had placed more federal land off-limits to development.  Those orders include limits to drilling in sensitive offshore areas like the Atlantic coast and Arctic, as well as a ban on new federal coal mining leases.   I think I am going to review everything that didnt go through Congress, Zinke said.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said on Thursday he would stay out of any probe into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election but maintained he did nothing wrong by failing to disclose he met last year with Russias ambassador. Sessions, a longtime U.S. senator who was an early and high-ranking player in President Donald Trumps campaign before becoming the countrys top law enforcement official, announced the decision after several fellow Republicans in Congress suggested the move would be appropriate. I have recused myself in the matters that deal with the Trump campaign, Sessions told reporters at a hastily arranged news conference. Sessions said he had been weighing recusal - ruling himself out from any role in the investigations - even before the latest twist of the controversy over ties between Trump associates and Russia that has dogged the early days of the Trump presidency. The president backed Sessions, saying Democrats had politicized the issue and calling the controversy a total witch hunt. Sessions announcement did nothing to quell concerns among congressional Democrats, a number of whom called for Sessions to step down. Trump and Republicans who control Congress are trying to move past early administration missteps and focus on issues important to them, including immigration, tax cuts and repealing the Obamacare healthcare law. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded last year that Russia hacked and leaked Democratic emails during the election campaign as part of an effort to tilt the vote in Trumps favor. The Kremlin has denied the allegations. Sessions denied he had contact with Russian officials when he was asked directly during his Senate confirmation hearing to become attorney general whether he had exchanged information with Russian operatives during the election campaign. He told reporters he was honest and correct in his response, although he acknowledged he should have slowed down and mentioned he had met with the ambassador in his role as a senator. I never had meetings with Russian operatives or Russian intermediaries about the Trump campaign, Sessions said, adding he felt he should not be involved in investigating a campaign in which he had had a role. In a statement on Thursday night, Trump said Sessions did not say anything wrong. He could have stated his response more accurately, but it was clearly not intentional.      Sessions meetings with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak were disclosed on Wednesday night by the Washington Post. Sessions received Kislyak in his Senate office in September and also met him in July at a Heritage Foundation event at the Republican National Convention that was attended by about 50 ambassadors. Trump fired national security adviser Michael Flynn last month after disclosures that Flynn had discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia with Kislyak before Trump took office and that Flynn misled Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations. The recusal means Sessions, a powerful member of Trumps inner circle, will not be briefed on details of any probe. Should the Federal Bureau of Investigation decide to move forward with charges, Sessions would not be in a position to weigh in on whether the Department of Justice should take the case. House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi urged Sessions to resign and said his narrow recusal and sorry attempt to explain away his perjury were inadequate. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said Sessions explanation for failing to tell the Senate about his meetings is simply not credible. He called on Sessions to step down and said the Justice Department should name an independent prosecutor to investigate Russian interference. Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee asked the FBI to launch a criminal investigation into Sessions statements to  Congress about his communication with Russian officials. Sessions is one of many subjects of a government investigation of any contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia, two U.S. officials familiar with the probe said. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Sessions was not now a target of the probe by the FBI, the Treasury Department, the CIA and the National Security Agency. The investigation, one of the officials said, had a number of subjects because of the numerous contacts between associates of Trump, including Flynn, and the Russian Embassy in Washington as well as Russian and some Ukrainian businessmen and companies. At least two other officials in Trumps campaign said they also spoke with the Russian ambassador at a conference on the sidelines of the July convention last July, USA Today reported on Thursday. Trumps son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner also met with Kislyak in December at Trump Tower in New York, an administration official said on Thursday, confirming a report in the New Yorker. While there is nothing legally wrong with such meetings, the reported contacts raise questions about the White Houses repeated statements that it knew of no further contacts with Russian officials beyond those by Flynn. Trump has accused officials in former Democratic President Barack Obamas administration of trying to discredit him with questions about Russia contacts. The White House dismissed the disclosure of the Sessions meetings as a partisan attack, saying his contacts with the ambassador had been as a member of the Armed Services Committee. Trump called frequently during his campaign for improved relations with Russia, drawing criticism from Democrats and some Republicans. Ties with Russia have been deeply strained in recent years over Moscows military interference in Ukraine, military support for President Bashar al-Assad in Syria and President Vladimir Putins intolerance of political dissent. With his administration on the defensive over Russia, Trumps enthusiasm seems to have cooled, and his top foreign policy advisers have begun talking tougher about Moscow. The Russian Embassy in Washington, shrugging off the uproar, said on Thursday it was in regular contact with U.S. partners. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Ford, in Newport News, Virginia, Trump said he wanted the U.S. military to have the finest equipment in the world. Trump this week proposed a $54 billion increase over last year in defense spending, boosting the Pentagon budget to $603 billion, and said he wanted to launch the biggest military buildup in American history to make up for what he called a depleted armed forces. Some Republican lawmakers want more money for defense and others, along with Democrats, are opposed to his option for offsetting the cost of the buildup in the U.S. budget. He would cut foreign aid and other non-defense programs by $54 billion. Trump said he would like to get the U.S. Navy back up to having 12 aircraft carriers. The Navy currently has 10. I just spoke with Navy and industry leaders and have discussed my plans to undertake a major expansion of our entire Navy fleet, including the 12 (aircraft)-carrier Navy we need, Trump said, receiving applause. We also need more aircraft, modernized capabilities and greater force levels, he said. Additionally, we must vastly improve our cyber capabilities. There are questions about how the increase in the budget will be spread across the different service branches and which weapons programs will get priority.  During the campaign, Trump said he would increase the Armys troop strength and increase the number of ships in the Navy to 350 from about 275 ships. The timeline and the exact cost of the buildup is unclear. Trump said the Navy will soon be the largest its been.  The U.S. Navy peaked at 6,768 ships in 1945 at the end of World War Two and by 1990 it still had 570 ships, even though the ships now are more advanced and capable.  We are going to have very soon the finest equipment in the world, he said. We will give our military the tools you need to prevent war and, if required, to fight war and only do one thing. You know what that is? Win. Win. Trump said the Gerald R. Ford and other new ships project American power in distant lands. Hopefully, its power we dont have to use. But if we do, theyre in big, big trouble, he said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

President Donald Trump has long signaled his intention to reverse former Democratic President Barack Obamas climate-change initiatives. But the Republican president has vowed his planned overhaul of green regulation would not jeopardize Americas water and air quality. The 23-page 2018 budget proposal, which aims to slice the environmental regulators overall budget by 25 percent to $6.1 billion and staffing by 20 percent to 12,400 as part of a broader effort to fund increased military spending, would cut deeply into programs like climate protection, environmental justice and enforcement. Politico and other news outlets reported the staff and overall budget cuts earlier, but the source disclosed new details on the impact the cuts would have on programs and grants to states. Environmentalists slammed the proposed cuts, which must be approved by the Republican-led Congress. The agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the budget proposal or its counter proposal. The White House said it had no comment. Under the proposal, which was sent to the EPA this week, grants to states for lead cleanup would be cut 30 percent to $9.8 million, according to the source, who read the document to Reuters. Grants to help Native American tribes combat pollution would be cut 30 percent to $45.8 million. An EPA climate protection program on cutting emissions of greenhouse gases like methane that contribute to global warming would be cut 70 percent to $29 million. The proposal would cut funding for the brownfields industrial site cleanup program by 42 percent to $14.7 million. It would also reduce funding for enforcing pollution laws by 11 percent to $153 million.  The budget did not cut state revolving funds for programs, that Congress tapped last year to provide aid to Flint, Michigan, for its lead pollution crisis.   All staff at a research program, called Global Change Research, as well as 37 other programs would be cut under the plan. Some of the cuts are unlikely to pass the Republican-led Congress as they are popular with both Democrats and Republicans. Congress would be unlikely to approve a proposal to cut all staff in a diesel emissions program, for example.   Scott Pruitt, the new head of the EPA, told U.S. mayors on Thursday he would make a priority of cleanups of industrial and hazardous waste sites and improving water infrastructure, even as the White House proposed severe proposed cuts to those programs. In this budget discussion that is ongoing with Congress that is just starting, there are some concerns about some of these grant programs that EPA has been a part of historically, Pruitt said. I want you to know that with the White House and also with Congress, I am communicating a message that the brownfields program, the Superfund program and the water infrastructure grants and state revolving funds are essential to protect, he said.   Greenpeace spokesman Travis Nichols said: As a candidate, Trump made a big deal out of EPAs failure in Flint, but now hes cutting 30 percent out of lead cleanup in his proposed budget. This is an example of his empty promises to do right by the American people. Officers of the Environmental Council of the States, composed of local regulators, raised concerns to the White House and EPA about the budget process, which they said lacked input by directly affected states. ECOS officers will meet with the environment team of the Office and Management and Budget, a White House office, on Friday and have slated a teleconference with Pruitt in March.  ECOS head Alexandra Dapolito Dunn said states had been hopeful after Pruitts confirmation hearing that they would get resources to do their work. Now they are feeling very vulnerable, she said.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - With his administration on the defensive over investigations into alleged Russian meddling in last years election, U.S. President Donald Trump is no longer tweeting praise for his Kremlin counterpart. Less than five weeks after he took office, the chances of a spring thaw in relations between Washington and Moscow  once buoyed by an apparent bromance between Trump and President Vladimir Putin during the U.S. political campaign  are looking much dimmer, U.S. officials say. His top foreign policy advisers have started talking tougher on Russia, and the apparent cooling of Trumps approach follows the resignation last month of his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, a vocal advocate of warmer ties with Moscow. He was replaced by Army Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster, who is more hawkish on Russia and allied with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a retired Marine Corps general. In one other sign of a stiffening attitude, two officials said the administration had offered the job of top Russia adviser at the National Security Council to Russia scholar Fiona Hill, a leading Putin critic. Her books include Mr. Putin, Operative in the Kremlin, an allusion to the Russian leaders past as a KGB officer. It was not immediately known whether she had accepted the post.  Pressure also has come to bear from Trumps fellow Republicans in Congress, long wary of his campaign overtures to Putin, and from European allies anxious over any sign that the president might prematurely ease sanctions imposed on Russia after its annexation of Crimea and support for pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine. Posing fresh obstacles to rapprochement with Russia, analysts say, is mounting evidence that Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the presidents son-in-law Jared Kushner, and other members of Trumps team communicated with Russian officials during and after the presidential campaign. The mushrooming inquiry - which is now focused on Sessions and his contacts with Moscows ambassador to Washington - has fueled calls for expanded investigations into allegations that Moscow sought to sway the elections outcome. There is so much panic in the U.S. political establishment over Russia right now that Trump will be boxed in on what he can do, said Matthew Rojansky, a Russia expert at the Wilson Center think tank in Washington. White House officials say there were no improper contacts, and Russia denies any meddling. While Trump has yet to lay down his Russia policy, most signs suggest no swift changes in the relationship, which sank to a post-Cold War low under his predecessor Barack Obama, mostly due to bitter differences over Syria and Ukraine. Mattis sought to reassure NATO allies during a visit to Europe last month, telling them there would be no military cooperation between the United States and Russia in the near future. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley this week denounced Russia for casting a veto to protect the Syrian government from Security Council action over accusations of chemical weapons use, and also recently insisted the United States would not recognize Russias seizure of Crimea. Trumps openness to closer ties to Russia and his emphasis, particularly during the campaign, on fighting terrorism sparked concerns among current and former U.S. officials that he might trade away U.S. interests in other areas in exchange for military and intelligence cooperation against groups such as Islamic State. Trumps language on Russia now has shifted somewhat from campaign days, when he tweeted his admiration for Putin as a strong leader, and the Russian president paid him compliments. Trump told a news conference in mid-February that, I would love to be able to get along with Russia, but added that, Its possible I wont be able to get along with Putin.     Two senior European officials this week told reporters in Washington they discerned an evolution in the Trump administrations stance toward Russia, saying there appeared to be no desire to engage in such a grand bargain in which, for example, Ukraine-related sanctions might be eased in return for Russian action on other issues. What we consider reassuring is that, at least during our meetings, nobody came with this idea of a grand bargain, with the idea of a big deal, said one senior European official on condition of anonymity. Said a second senior European official: Vis-a-vis Russia, to be frank I have the impression that the analysis and the positions of this administration are probably now closer to our position than (they) may have been two or three months ago.  Recent Russian actions have created new complications, including a stepped-up offensive by pro-Russian separatist forces in eastern Ukraine and what the Pentagon described as the bombing this week by Russian and Syrian aircraft of U.S.-backed Syrian rebels  something Moscow denied had happened. For its part, the Kremlin said on Wednesday it was patiently waiting for some kind of actions from the Trump administration so that it could understand what the future holds for relations. We have heard different statements from President Trump, Dmitry Peskov, Putins spokesman, told reporters. U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican member of the Foreign Relations Committee and former 2016 presidential candidate, had words of caution for Trump about future dealings with Putin. We have had two presidents - a Republican and a Democrat - previous to the current president who thought they could do such a deal with Vladimir Putin, he said on the Senate floor on Wednesday. Both of them fell on their face because they did not  understand what they were dealing with. It is my sincerest hope that our current President doesnt make the same mistakes, Rubio said.

The governors are worried that repealing former President Barack Obamas 2010 healthcare law without a detailed replacement will take coverage away from millions of Americans and land the states with a large financial hit.  Pressure from governors is just one of the challenges facing President Donald Trumps administration as it tries to  scrap Obamas Affordable Care Act, one of the Republicans signature election campaign promises. During the hour-long meeting, the governors presented Pence and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price with a proposal to reform the Medicaid program for the poor, the sources said.  Under Obamacare, more than 30 states - including about a dozen with Republican governors - expanded Medicaid by allowing those who earned incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level to enroll.   The governors plan would allow those states to maintain the Medicaid expansion and enable other states to also expand, according to a copy of the proposal seen by Reuters. States could choose to expand Medicaid to any income level at or below 138 percent and retain enhanced federal funding for the program. The proposal would also give states more flexibility in how they manage their Medicaid programs and cap spending for certain populations.  House Republicans have yet to agree on a single detailed policy proposal and many say it will not be in place before 2019. On Thursday, a draft Obamacare repeal bill by the House Republicans was available for Republican members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee to read in a room on Capitol Hill but was not publicly released. It was not clear whether the governors demands were addressed in the latest version of the draft bill.  The President and Vice President have been very clear that governors and states will play a critical role in the repeal and replacement of Obamacare, said Marc Lotter, a Pence spokesman.  Ohio Governor John Kasich also met with Trump on Friday and briefed him on the governors plan. In his address to Congress on Tuesday, Trump said that state governors should be given the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out.  Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady met on Thursday with Republican members of the Senate Finance Committee and discussed the Medicaid expansion. Were still a long ways off, Walker said. The same things they (lawmakers) hear from their members are the same things we hear in the states, is how do you balance states that didnt take the expansion and states that did. How do we make sure we find a good way? he said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Zinke, who was a first-term Montana Congressman and a former Navy SEAL, arrived for his first day at work at the Interior Department in Washington on a horse named Tonto escorted by mounted U.S. Park Police officers. Zinke, an avid angler and hunter, lifted the lead ammunition ban in one of two secretarial orders, which he said were meant to expand access to public lands and increase hunting, fishing, and recreation opportunities nationwide. President Barack Obamas Fish and Wildlife Service had issued the lead ban on Jan. 19, one day before the inauguration of President Donald Trump, to protect birds and fish from lead poisoning. The move was met with sharp criticism from the National Rifle Association (NRA), which called it Obamas final assault on gun owners and sportsmens rights.  The Interior Department, which is in charge of conserving fish, wildlife and their habitat, manages one-fifth of the land in the United States. It employs more than 70,000 people across the United States.        Zinke also signed an order on Thursday that would direct federal agencies to identify areas where recreation and fishing can be expanded and sought recommendations for expanding access to public lands and improving fishing and wildlife habitat. This package of secretarial orders will expand access for outdoor enthusiasts and also make sure the communitys voice is heard, he said. The NRA, as well as hunting and fishing groups including the Congressional Sportsmens Foundation, National Shooting Sports Foundation, Ducks Unlimited and the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership attended the signing of the orders.

On Wednesday, Schiff said the committee would investigate allegations of collusion between Republican Donald Trumps 2016 presidential campaign and Russia as part of its probe into allegations of Russian meddling in the election.

The decision late Wednesday by U.S. District Judge Susan Wigenton clears the way for the two defendants to be sentenced on March 15. Bridget Kelly, a former deputy chief of staff under the Republican governor, and Bill Baroni, the former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, were convicted in November of orchestrating the shutdown of access lanes at the George Washington Bridge in September 2013. U.S. prosecutors said the resulting gridlock in Fort Lee, New Jersey, was intended to punish the towns Democratic mayor for declining to back Christies re-election campaign. Christie has not been charged in the case and has denied any knowledge of the plan. But Kelly and another conspirator, former Port Authority official David Wildstein, both testified that Christie was aware of the lane closures before they occurred. Wildstein pleaded guilty and appeared at trial as the governments star witness. In asking for an acquittal or a new trial, Kellys lawyers had argued that Wigenton erred when she instructed jurors that they could convict the defendants even if prosecutors failed to prove they had intentionally targeted the mayor for retribution. The motivation for the scheme, Kellys lawyers said, was at the core of the governments case. But Wigenton said motive, while central to the prosecution, is not a required element of the crimes for which Baroni and Kelly were convicted. The government was under no obligation to introduce evidence of motive, although motive helps present a coherent narrative of events to a jury, she wrote. Lawyers for Baroni and Kelly did not immediately respond to requests for comment. They can still ask a U.S. appeals court to overturn the verdict after sentencing has taken place. A spokesman for New Jerseys chief federal prosecutor, U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman, declined to comment on the ruling. The scandals fallout helped sink Christies once-promising political career.

The Senate voted 62 to 37 in support of Perry. Perry, 66, was governor of Texas from 2000 to 2015, making him the longest-serving governor of the oil-producing state in its history.   As energy secretary, Perry would lead a vast scientific research operation credited with helping trigger a U.S. drilling boom and advancements in energy efficiency and renewables technology, and would oversee Americas nuclear arsenal. In his Senate confirmation hearing, Perry said much of his focus running the department would be in renewing the countrys nuclear weapons arsenal. Trump wants to ensure the arsenal is at the top of the pack and said the United States had fallen behind in its nuclear weapons capacity. Democratic lawmakers expressed worry Perry would weaken the departments functions and potentially target its army of scientists focused on climate and clean energy research. Perry sought to reassure them saying he would protect scientists and the growing renewable energy industry. Democratic Oregon Senator Ron Wyden, a senior Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said Perry had failed to persuade him he would push back against Trump administration plans to cut the departments budget and focus on clean energy R&D. As Trump is threatening to slash DOEs budget, Gov. Perry hasnt convinced me hes up to the task of creating those jobs and putting points on the board in the fight against climate change, Wyden said.

The Senate Committee on Finance voted 13-12 to support Seema Verma to run the $1 trillion Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Verma is the owner of SVC, a healthcare consulting firm, and has helped redesign Medicaid programs in several states, including Indiana. She worked in Indiana to expand Medicaid to include thousands of additional low-income residents. Those residents are required to make small monthly payments toward their care through health savings accounts. It is a model that could influence how the Trump administration thinks about providing health care to low-income people. In a speech to Congress on Tuesday, Trump said the government should help Americans buy health insurance through the use of tax credits and expanded health savings accounts. Verma has worked closely with Vice President Mike Pence, who as governor of Indiana awarded her the Sagamore of the Wabash award, typically bestowed on those who have rendered distinguished services to the state or to the governor. Republican Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah said in a statement that addressing the challenges facing Medicare and Medicaid will require a strong partnership with the administration. Verma, he said, will help facilitate that partnership and as we work to repeal and replace Obamacare, she will play a vital role in realigning the focus on patient-centered solutions. Speaking before a preliminary vote on Wednesday, Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon expressed concern that in her confirmation hearing last month, Verma had failed to answer questions about how she would tackle high drug prices. He also said that while helping manage the state of Indianas health program, her firm was being paid by companies that were providing services and products to the program. She was on both sides of the deal, he said. Verma has denied any wrong-doing. In a Jan. 31 letter to the Department of Health and Human Services, she outlined various steps she would take to avoid any conflicts of interest if confirmed as administrator of CMS, including divesting her financial interest in SVC Inc within 90 days of confirmation.

The draft bill, titled the Encouraging Employee Ownership Act, is being rolled out by Virginia Democrat Mark Warner and Pennsylvania Republican Pat Toomey and will be made public as soon as Thursday, according to a spokeswoman for Warners office. The measure comes at the same time that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to shift its regulatory gears to focus more intently on ways to boost capital formation more broadly. Critics have said the SEC has in the past neglected this mission, as the number of initial public offerings have fallen while the number of regulatory requirements placed on companies has increased. Wall Street deal-making attorney Jay Clayton, who was nominated by President Donald Trump to serve as chairman of the SEC, is expected to make capital formation a centerpiece of his tenure. He is still awaiting his confirmation hearing before the Senate Banking Committee, and a date has not yet been announced. The bill that Warner and Toomey plan to unveil, which has been endorsed by the private supermarket chain Wegmans, would amend an SEC rule that governs how private companies give stock options and other equity awards to their employees.   The rule exempts private companies from being required to register their securities with the SEC - a lengthy and expensive undertaking. However, in order to qualify for the exemption, companies must meet certain conditions. Under the rule, if a company collectively grants more than $5 million in stock awards to its employees during a one-year period, then certain disclosure requirements are triggered - including the need to produce financial statements that are prepared in accordance with U.S. accounting rules. The $5 million trigger was set in 1988, and has not been updated or pegged to inflation, Warners spokeswoman said. Under the proposed legislation, the threshold would be increased to $10 million before triggering disclosure obligations.  Additionally, the amount would be automatically indexed to inflation every five years.          The bill comes at a time when Congress is expected to take up legislation to loosen rules believed to stifle economic growth. This committee is expected to play a crucial role in helping craft such legislation.        ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The rapid start of construction, promised throughout Trumps campaign and in an executive order issued in January on border security, was to be financed, according to the White House, with existing funds and resources of the Department of Homeland Security.  But so far, the DHS has identified only $20 million that can be re-directed to the multi-billion-dollar project, according to a document prepared by the agency and distributed to congressional budget staff last week.  The document said the funds would be enough to cover a handful of contracts for wall prototypes, but not enough to begin construction of an actual barrier. This means that for the wall to move forward, the White House will need to convince Congress to appropriate funds.  MORE FROM REUTERS* Ivanka encouraged Trumps change of tone*Pelosi calls on Sessions to quit*Who is in the race to patent bitcoin tech? An internal report, previously reported by Reuters, estimated that fully walling off or fencing the entire southern border would cost $21.6 billion - $9.3 million per mile of fence and $17.8 million per mile of wall.  DHS officials did not respond to a request for comment on this story.  Trump has said he will ask Congress to pay for what existing funds cannot cover and that Mexico will be pressured to pay back U.S. taxpayers at a later date.  Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan has said he will include funding for a border wall in the budget for next fiscal year. He has estimated the cost to be between $12 billion and $15 billion.  Many Republican lawmakers have said they would vote against a plan that does not offset the cost of the wall with spending cuts.  In the document it submitted to Congress, the DHS said it would reallocate $5 million from a fence project in Naco, Arizona, that came in under budget and $15 million from a project to install cameras on top of trucks at the border.  The surveillance project was awarded to Virginia-based Tactical Micro, but was held up due to protests from other contractors, according to the DHS document. Tactical Micro could not be reached for comment.  The DHS only searched for extra funds within its $376 million budget for border security fencing, infrastructure and technology, so it would not have to ask for congressional approval to repurpose funding, according to the document.  Contractors cannot begin bidding to develop prototypes until March 6 but more than 265 businesses already have listed themselves as interested parties on a government web site.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trumps signal of a new openness to immigration reform in a speech to the U.S. Congress did little to win over Democrats who would be essential to revamping the nations immigration laws. Any goodwill Trump may have sparked with his mention of a chance for real and positive immigration reform in Tuesdays speech, his first to a joint session of Congress, was soon dashed by rhetoric that Democrats said tarred and misrepresented most immigrants. The speech he gave was one of the most anti-immigrant speeches that we heard any president ever give, Senate Democratic leader Charles Schumer said on Wednesday. What offended Democrats, a minority in both chambers, was Trumps reference to past incidents in which one illegal immigrant viciously gunned down two California law enforcement officers and another viciously murdered a 17-year-old boy. Trump built a base of support for his 2016 presidential campaign by vowing to fight illegal immigration, including a pledge to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. On becoming president in January, he immediately issued a temporary visa ban against seven Muslim-majority countries, later blocked by federal courts. He also suspended a refugee program and initiated tougher deportation procedures. Major immigration reform efforts failed in Congress under Trumps predecessors, Democratic President Barack Obama and Republican George W. Bush, because of deep divisions among lawmakers and Americans over the issue. The challenges include how to protect illegal immigrants who came to the United States as children, and how to deal long-term with the estimated 11 million people living in the country without proper documentation. Legislation putting illegal immigrants in line for citizenship threatens to alienate Trumps core conservative voters. Trump said in his speech that reform was possible if both Democrats and Republicans were willing to compromise.     Even before Tuesdays address, immigration reform-minded Republicans and Democrats in Congress were holding informal lunches and dinners, as well as conversations on the floors of the House of Representatives and Senate about the possibility of Trump eventually moderating his stance. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus will meet on Thursday and discuss how, or whether, to react to Trumps signal of openness to reform at a time when a feeling of fear and hopelessness pervades Latino communities, one House Democratic aide said.  Republican Representative Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida, a leading voice for overhauling immigration laws, hoped that once the White House dealt with healthcare and tax reforms this year, Trump might tackle vexing immigration problems. Remember that old adage that only Nixon could go to China, said Diaz-Balart, a self-described optimist and son of Cuban immigrants who has labored for years over immigration laws. He was referring to Richard Nixon, who in 1972 became the first U.S. president to visit the Peoples Republic of China despite having built his political career as the arch-enemy of communist governments. After Tuesdays speech, a major change in tone will likely be needed for Democrats to engage with Republicans. Democratic Representative Luis Gutierrez of Illinois challenged Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Trump adviser Steve Bannon, who have both taken a hard line on illegal immigration, to pledge support for immigration reform, Absent that, I dont believe a thing (they) have to say on the administrations interest in reforming immigration law, Gutierrez told reporters. Gutierrez is of Puerto Rican descent and has worked in the past with Republicans on immigration legislation. Some prominent Republicans said progress on the first major immigration reform since 1986 was still possible. Senator John McCain of Arizona, who helped win Senate passage in 2013 of a sweeping bipartisan immigration law rewrite that subsequently died in the House, said of Trumps upbeat remarks: I would hope that would open the door for negotiations and support for legislation. Senator Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican who joined with McCain and others in 2013, said if there was an opportunity to go forward, Trump would likely want to pair bills that would be supported by opposing sides in the immigration debate. For example, Flake speculated, the president might support putting into law temporary protections shielding dreamers from deportation - people who entered the United States as children. In return, conservatives could win new legislation on border security or expedited deportations, he said, a trade-off Democrats might not want to make.

A White House official said the order was likely to come on Monday. Federal courts blocked Trumps Jan. 27 executive order that  temporarily barred travelers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.  Trump has said the travel limitations were necessary to protect the United States from attacks by Islamist militants. Americans were deeply divided over the measure, which had some support but stirred national protests and were condemned by prominent U.S. companies and allies.  There are currently 5,200 American troops deployed in Iraq to assist Iraqi and Kurdish forces in retaking Mosul - the last city in Iraq under the control of Islamic State militants.  Iraqis have fought alongside U.S. troops for years and have worked as translators. Many Iraqis have resettled in the United States following threats over their affiliation with U.S. troops.   The United States also relies on Iraq to provide visas for a substantial contracting force that supports the U.S. military presence.

Republicans, who control the White House and Congress, are united in their opposition to former Democratic President Barack Obamas signature 2010 healthcare law, but have so far failed to agree on the details of how to replace it. We should help Americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts, Trump said. But it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by our government. Democrats are ardently opposed to tampering with Obamacare, which provided coverage to millions of previously uninsured people. A draft Republican replacement for Obamacare would include an age-based monthly tax credit that Americans who do not get health insurance through their employer could use to buy coverage and take from job to job.  Some Republicans have voiced resistance to that plan.  The presidents comments were also a nod to health insurers - whom Trump met with on Monday - who say tax credits are necessary to keep people in the market. The fact that he used the word tax credits is a signal to congressional Republican ranks that he supports their proposals, said Tom Miller, a resident fellow in health policy at the American Enterprise Institute think tank.  Trump also said Americans should be able to buy insurance across state lines, a proposal favored by health insurers because it would enable them to offer plans in states with fewer regulatory hurdles.  Trump said state governors should be given resources and flexibility on Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor, and ensure that no one is left out. That appeared to be an attempt to ease concerns from the more than 30 governors who expanded Medicaid coverage under Obamacare.  But Trump offered few details on how he would reconcile House Republican plans to unwind the expansion of Medicaid with promises to maintain coverage for those who gained health insurance under Obamacare.  He also reaffirmed that those with pre-existing conditions should have access to coverage but did not say how that would be accomplished. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The biggest speech of Trumps month-old presidency was the product of a 10-day effort with his top aides.  While he unveiled no significant changes to policy, the tone of Trumps speech was a far cry from his bleak American carnage inaugural address when he took office on Jan. 20. The Republican president dropped some of the fierce rhetoric that had been a staple of his first weeks in office. He called for national unity and avoided a repeat of his attacks on Democratic opponents and media organizations. Polls conducted immediately after the speech showed a clear majority of Americans approved of the softer approach and aides described Trump as buoyed by the reception. A senior White House official said Ivanka Trump made  recommendations for the speech during a brainstorming session in the Oval Office on Sunday, helping her father decide on a new approach aimed at easing concerns over whether he had the right temperament to govern effectively.  He had a lot of voices around him giving him ideas and suggestions that he incorporated, but he really set out to achieve that optimistic tone and that was something she was supportive of. She encouraged him to do that, one official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. She had a role, said another. She helped set the tone. Ivanka Trump also persuaded her father to speak favorably about affordable child care and paid family leave, policies she has long backed and which could draw support from Democrats in Congress, said another official with some knowledge of how the speech evolved. Her fingerprints are visible on the tone, but especially on those parts of it like maternity leave that matter to her, the official said. Ivanka Trump, 35, the presidents older daughter, has emerged as an influential informal adviser for her father, particularly on issues important to women and minorities.  After his election victory last November, she stepped away from her business interests in New York to move to Washington and is frequently seen at her fathers events. A White House official said Trump was the principal author of the speech but had a lot of help in drafting it, including from his daughter. Trump made the final changes to his speech during a marathon session on Tuesday, working closely with Vice President Mike Pence, chief strategist Steve Bannon, chief of staff Reince Priebus and chief speechwriter Stephen Miller. Ivanka Trumps husband, Jared Kushner, is a senior White House adviser with particular interest in trade deals and Middle East diplomacy.  The couple have been among the presidents closest confidants since his election campaign, and Kushner also helped in the drafting of the speech to Congress.  Others involved in the last round of deliberations were White House aides Hope Hicks, Kellyanne Conway and Sean Spicer. Ivanka Trump was not in the sessions on Tuesday. Ivanka Trump accompanied her father to Dover Air Base in Delaware on Feb. 1 to welcome home the remains of U.S. Navy SEAL William Ryan Owens, who was killed in a raid on al Qaeda in Yemen. At the speech on Tuesday, Owens widow, Carryn Owens, wept openly when Trump led the crowd in applauding her husbands service. Standing next to her was Ivanka Trump. Presidential historian Thomas Alan Schwartz of Vanderbilt University said it was hard to find a similar example in recent history of a presidential daughter having a big influence. Its a way of reaching out on social issues and social welfare issues or issues that sometimes the Republicans are less identified with, he said.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump told Congress on Tuesday he was open to immigration reform, shifting from his harsh rhetoric on illegal immigration in a speech that offered a more restrained tone than his election campaign and first month in the White House. Trump, in a prime-time address to a country that remains divided over his leadership, set aside disputes with Democrats and the news media to deliver his most presidential performance to date, seeking to regain the confidence of Americans rattled by his leadership thus far. The presidents speech was long on promises but short on specifics on how to achieve a challenging legislative agenda that could add dramatically to budget deficits. He wants a healthcare overhaul, broad tax cuts and a $1 trillion public-private initiative to rebuild degraded roads and bridges. Trump built a base of support behind his presidential campaign by vowing to fight illegal immigration. In his speech, he took a more moderate tone, appealing to Republicans and Democrats to work together on immigration reform. He said it was possible if both Republicans and Democrats in Congress were willing to compromise, although he also said U.S. immigration should be based on a merit-based system, rather than relying on lower-skilled immigrants. Comprehensive immigration reform eluded his two predecessors, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican George W. Bush, because of deep divisions within Congress and among Americans over the issue. Trump said reform would raise wages and help more struggling families enter the middle class. I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to strengthen our nations security, and to restore respect for our laws, said the Republican president. Trumps first month in office was dominated by a fight over his temporary travel ban on people from seven Muslim-majority nations, repeated attacks on the news media and harsh personal criticism of judges who blocked his immigration order. In his speech on Tuesday, he appeared to look for a reset, trying to move past a chaotic period that sowed doubts about his ability to govern effectively. The time for trivial fights is behind us, he said. Financial markets showed a muted reaction as Trump gave few specifics or new details. Early signs showed Trumps speech drew a positive response. A CNN/ORC poll found 57 percent of viewers thought Trumps speech was very positive and 69 percent said they felt more optimistic about the future of the country. Hes lost his foot and mouth disease, said Tom Beckwith, 71, of Seminole, Florida. This was a tremendous speech. Hes cured. Still, there was plenty of evidence of ongoing partisan divisions. In the chamber of the House of Representatives where Trump spoke, Democrats sometimes sat in silence and turned their thumbs down at his remarks. Many women lawmakers wore white in a subtle show of protest. Democratic Senator Christopher Coons of Delaware called Trumps speech one of the most coherent public addresses hes given in a month. But Coons said he viewed Trumps forthcoming budget proposals as gravely concerning, citing the presidents plan for paying for a defense buildup by cutting foreign aid and other programs. Much of Trumps speech focused on solving problems at home in line with his America first rhetoric. Apart from criticizing Obama for increasing the national debt, Trump did not mention the federal budget deficit, which will severely limit any new spending programs. On immigration, Trump again pledged to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, but he made no mention this time of Mexico paying for it. He also said he would shortly take new steps to keep our nation safe, referring to a new executive order he is to sign to replace one embroiled in the courts. Trump focused part of the speech on foreign policy, stressing his support for NATO but insisting allies pay more for their defense. In a possible nod to his bid to warm relations with Russia, which he did not mention by name, Trump said: America is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align. Trump has been criticized for his praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin. A U.S. congressional committee is investigating contacts between Trumps election campaign and Russia to see if there were any inappropriate communications. We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict, said Trump, who said, however, he would embark on a big defense buildup. Trump said he wanted to provide massive tax relief to the middle class and cut corporate tax rates. But he did not offer specifics and failed to comment on the most pressing tax issue facing Congress, a proposed border adjustment tax to boost exports over imports. Lawmakers have been looking to Trump for more leadership on an issue that has divided corporate America and Republicans in Congress. Trump called on the Republican-led Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare with reforms that expand choice, increase access and lower costs.  Republicans remain divided on how to accomplish that goal and Democrats vehemently oppose tampering with a system that provides health insurance for millions of low-income Americans. While Trumps comments lacked detail, it was the first time he publicly supported tax credits to help Americans purchase their own coverage, a nod to health insurers who say they are necessary to keep people in the market. Former Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear said in the Democratic response to Trumps speech that you and your Republican allies in Congress seem determined to rip affordable health insurance away from millions of Americans who most need it. In the most emotional moment of the night, Trump singled out Carryn Owens, the widow of U.S Navy SEAL William Ryan Owens, who was killed in a raid on al Qaeda in Yemen.  Owens, tears streaming down her face, clasped her hands and looked upward from her spot in the balcony as lawmakers and the president applauded her in the longest ovation of Trumps hour-long speech.  Trump said the mission that her husband participated in obtained vital intelligence that could be used against Islamist militants, taking issue with news reports quoting U.S. officials who said little was gained from the raid.

A White House source had previously said the new order was likely to be announced on Wednesday. More than two dozen lawsuits were filed in U.S. courts against the Jan. 27 travel ban, which temporarily barred entry to the United States for people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, as well as halting the U.S. refugee program. The ban was suspended by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, ruling in a case brought by Washington state. The Trump administration then said it would produce a new order. Theyre putting out the finishing touches on that executive order. It should be out in the next few days, Vice President Mike Pence told CBS program This Morning.  The original order triggered chaos at airports as people, including legal residents known as green card holders, were temporarily blocked from entering the country and federal agencies tried to interpret the new guidelines. The administration has said it is likely the new directive will exclude legal permanent residents, making it harder for opponents to challenge the ban.  Pence did not elaborate on the revised directive. The Associated Press, citing unidentified U.S. officials, reported late on Tuesday that the new order will remove Iraq from the list of countries whose citizens face a temporary travel ban.

The group, founded a year ago by Florida lawmakers looking to slow the effects of global warming, like coastal flooding, now has 13 Republicans and 13 Democrats. It is committed to keeping an even number of members of both parties. The group hopes to become a counter-balance to President Donald Trumps new administration, which includes several doubters of the science of climate change.  This is a place where Democrats and Republicans are working together on problem thats really difficult to solve, said Daniel Richter, the caucus spokesman and legislative director for the Citizens Climate Lobby, a non-profit whose volunteers encourage members of Congress to join the caucus. Not all Republicans accept the idea that human activity is causing global temperatures to rise, a conclusion reached by an overwhelming majority of scientists. Others accuse Democrats of overly politicizing a scientific issue in an attempt to demonize their opponents. Trump, a Republican, has expressed skepticism about climate change, speculating during his campaign that global warming was a hoax and concern over it was a money-making industry. Richter said he hoped the caucus can one day be as powerful as the House Freedom Caucus, a group of Republicans whose votes en bloc have become a strong force for conservative activism, scuttling new legislation its members ideologically oppose. But he said, with Congress strongly weighted in favor of Republicans, the caucus will need at least a dozen more Republican members to become a significant force.

The Senate had been scheduled to continue voting on a package of legislation negotiated by Senate President John Cullerton and Republican Leader Christine Radogno in an effort to end Illinois 20-month budget stalemate. The chamber passed some of the bills on Tuesday. But Cullerton told the chamber on Wednesday that Rauner decided to inject himself in this process and doesnt want this approved in this form, a move, he said, that removed Republican votes for the bills. For now we are in a holding pattern, Cullerton said, adding that the chamber would be ready to start voting again as soon as we get word there is Republican support. Rauner spokeswoman Catherine Kelly said while some progress has been made, more work is needed to achieve a good deal for taxpayers. Although the governor has not been involved in the Senate negotiations, his proposed fiscal 2018 budget incorporates aspects of the deal to fill a funding gap. Illinois, the nations fifth-largest state, is limping through a record-setting second consecutive fiscal year without a complete budget due to an ongoing feud between Rauner and Democrats who control the legislature. A six-month fiscal 2017 budget expired on Dec. 31. The states pile of unpaid bills has mushroomed to $12 billion, while its unfunded pension liability has climbed to $130 billion. As a result, Illinois credit ratings, which have been downgraded six times since January 2015, are the lowest among the 50 states. The Senates bipartisan legislative package includes bills to complete the fiscal 2017 budget, hike taxes, cut pension costs by about $1 billion annually, authorize borrowing to pay down the bill pile, expand casino gaming and freeze local property taxes.  All of the bills are tied to each other, so that if one failed to pass the entire package would go down. While Cullerton expressed frustration with the governors action during a post-session press conference, Radogno was more optimistic.  I know the governor will be joining us to get in trying to get that done, she said on the Senate floor.We need to get this done and done soon. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The document publicly released to Congress on Wednesday signals that the administration may try to push the limits of what is acceptable under WTO rules in its quest to make good on campaign promises to slash U.S. trade deficits with China and Mexico, and bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States. The document represents a departure from the Obama administrations strict adherence to WTO compliance in its challenges to unfair foreign trade practices. Unlike earlier presidents, Trump is signaling a willingness to impose import restrictions  especially against a country like China  where the justification under WTO rules for doing so may be highly questionable, said Chad Bown, a senior fellow and trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. The downside of the United States going down this path is thatit is likely that other countries will follow suit immediately, Bown added. The USTR document said it was not in the United States interest to let some WTO rulings undermine the use of effective remedies that the Geneva-based trade body expressly allows to fight unfair trade.    Accordingly, the Trump administration will act aggressively as needed to discourage this type of behavior  and encourage true market competition, the USTR said in the document. Laying out many of Trumps trade plans in writing for the first time, the document said the Trump administration plans to strictly enforce U.S. trade laws, defend U.S. national sovereignty over trade policy, and use all possible leverage to open foreign markets to U.S. exports, the document said.  It makes clear the Trump administrations view that U.S. law supersedes WTO rules  a view that could be invoked should Congress adopt a border tax adjustment plan to impose new taxes on imports that is later challenged as violating WTO tariff rules by other member countries. The Trump administration will aggressively defend American sovereignty over matters of trade policy, the report said. The nominee to be Trumps top trade negotiator, veteran steel industry lawyer Robert Lighthizer, in 2010 advocated aggressive interpretations of WTO provisions that might help us deal with Chinese mercantilism. Lighthizer is awaiting confirmation by the U.S. Senate. He served as a deputy USTR in the Reagan administration, helping to negotiate import quotas on Japanese goods in the 1980s, with the help of powerful trade law provisions that have largely gone unused since the WTO was launched in 1995.

U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly is set to visit Canada this month for talks on the border and the influx of people, said the source, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. Hundreds of people, mainly from Africa but also the Middle East, have walked across the border, seeking asylum. They are fleeing President Donald Trumps crackdown on illegal immigrants, migrants and refugees agencies say. It is not common to have so many asylum seekers based in the U.S. looking for refuge in Canada over such a short period. Scott Bardsley, a spokesman for Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale, said the majority of people crossing in recent weeks held valid passports and U.S. visas. The influx poses a political risk for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who faces pressure from the left, which wants him to let more in, and from the right, which fears an increased security risk. He must also ensure the issue does not complicate his relations with Trump.  We are talking with our counterparts in the United States to ensure that were addressing this situation properly, Trudeau told reporters in Calgary, Alberta. Security experts have said the asylum-seekers could pose a threat if the flow picks up once the weather improves and authorities do not take additional steps. Canadian and U.S. officials speak daily about the border crossers and law enforcement agencies from both nations met in Montreal last month to plot strategies, the source said. The U.S. side asked Canada to provide details of the asylum seekers, in particular, how they had entered the United States and what their status was there.  The Montreal summit grouped representatives from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), the Canada Border Services Agency, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency. RCMP spokeswoman Annie Delisle confirmed the meeting took place, and said the two sides agreed on an action plan which outlines a collaborative approach to dealing with the influx.  An official in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said the crossings were very limited and did not represent a major security concern. Frankly, it is far more embarrassing to this country than it is threatening, said the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.  The official, and a second person directly involved in border affairs, said U.S. authorities had not mounted a major effort to beef up border security, in part because they lack manpower and equipment. A senior Canadian security source classified the risk as medium- to long-term, since it was likely that those crossing the border really were seeking asylum. Vast stretches of the 5,500-mile (8,900-km) frontier are unguarded and the more images spread of people walking across, the more vulnerable Canada could become, said the source. If we keep this up for a while, and it becomes known that the border really is porous, then people will use it as an opportunity to put (operatives) in, said the source. Exact numbers are hard to calculate, since not all authorities release details. In January and February, 143 people walked illegally over the border into Manitoba, local police said. As of Feb. 13, some 3,800 people had made an asylum claim in 2017, up from the same period last year, said Bardsley. That number, though, includes all people seeking asylum, and the government would not break down the figures. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

During the televised address, Trump acknowledged in the audience Megan Crowley, a college student who has Pompe disease - a rare muscle disorder that can be treated with an expensive enzyme replacement therapy.  But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megans life, from reaching those in need, the president said. If we slash the restraints, not just at the FDA but across our Government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan. Trump has in the past excoriated drugmakers for charging astronomical prices, while acknowledging how complicated the nations healthcare system is. Representatives of the Trump administration could not immediately be reached for comment on Wednesday on whether the president believes the treatment price for Pompe disease is fair.  Trumps comments on Tuesday night highlight an issue central to the industry and investors - the potential for deregulation of the FDA, the agency charged with approving pharmaceutical products. I think Trump used this example somewhat cynically as a way of trying to advance the deregulatory agenda, said Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, a researcher at Harvard Medical School. The FDAs standards actually promote innovation because patients dont want just any old drug - they want drugs that work. Megans father, John Crowley, now chief executive at Amicus Therapeutics Inc, started a biotech company in 1998 to seek a treatment for Pompe disease.  In 2006, the FDA - after a nine-month review - approved infused enzyme replacement therapy Myozyme for patients born with the condition. A similar drug, Lumizyme, was approved in 2010 for late-onset Pompe disease and is now used regardless of a patients age.  The average annual cost of treatment is $298,000, according to Paris-based Sanofi SA, which now owns the drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, drugs for rare diseases - defined as those that treat fewer than 200,000 patients - are given a range of incentives including seven years of marketing exclusivity.    Pharmaceutical companies know they get a free pass for very expensive drugs for orphan diseases, whereas they dont for mainstream diseases, said Joel Hay, professor of pharmaceutical economics and policy at the University of Southern California. The National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) applauded Trumps recognition, but disagreed with the idea that the regulatory process needs an overhaul.     Our patients deserve the same quality therapies as everyone else, and to weaken the standards will only threaten our population with unsafe, ineffective therapies, NORD said in a statement on Wednesday.      Pompe disease, affecting 5,000 to 10,000 people worldwide, prevents the body from making enough of an enzyme used by heart and muscle cells to convert a form of sugar called glycogen into energy. When glycogen builds up in these cells it can lead to disability and death. NORD estimates that around 30 million Americans suffer from 7,000 rare diseases.

Defying decades of precedent, Trump has refused to release his tax returns while his tax affairs are under federal audit. Democrats and other critics contend that the documents could show whether his global business empire poses any conflicts of interest as the president moves his agenda forward on issues ranging from tax reform to foreign relations. In a letter dated Wednesday, seven Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee urged the panels Republican chairman, Orrin Hatch, to request the documents from the U.S. Treasury so that lawmakers can review them in a closed session and determine whether the returns can be released to the public. Democrats in the House of Representatives said they planned to pose a similar request on Thursday to Hatch and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady in a bipartisan letter signed by 140 lawmakers, including House Republicans Mark Sanford of South Carolina and Walter Jones of North Carolina. The Democratic efforts face long odds in the Republican-controlled Congress. Three attempts in the House have met with defeat this year. Hatch and Brady responded to the Senate request in a joint letter saying Democrats were suggesting an abuse of the tax-writing committees statutory authority that would set a dangerous precedent.  Democrats say they hope to create a bipartisan juggernaut to require the disclosure of Trumps and future presidents tax returns by pushing forward on multiple fronts.  On Monday, the House voted down a Democratic effort seeking the Republican presidents returns, with Sanford and Jones voting present rather than opposing the measure.  Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine told an interviewer last month she could be open to a subpoena of Trumps taxes as part of a Senate Intelligence Committee probe of alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential elections. On Wednesday, Politico quoted Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina as saying he wanted presidential candidates to be required by law to release their tax returns beginning in 2020.

The delay of the Senates consideration of Montenegros accession to the alliance has fueled questions about whether Trumps administration and his party will stand up to Russia despite the presidents desire for better relations. Moscow opposes any further expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Montenegro, a former Yugoslav republic with a population of 650,000, hopes to win the approval of all 28 NATO allies in time to become a full member at a summit in May. By late February, it had been approved by 24. Members see Montenegros accession as a way to counter Russias efforts to expand its influence in the Balkans. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has twice voted in favor of Montenegro, first in December and again in January. But objections by Republican Senators Rand Paul and Mike Lee have blocked a vote in the full Senate. At a September hearing, Paul questioned the wisdom of angering Russia by allowing a tiny country that could not play a significant role in defending the United States to join the trans-Atlantic alliance. I think we need to think this through, and we need to have a little bit more of a debate, he said then. On Wednesday, Paul said he still objected. Im not so sure what they add to our defense. So Im not so sure its a great idea that somehow Montenegros going to defend the United States, Paul told Reuters. A spokesman for Lee said the senator objected only to the Senate considering the matter with a quick voice vote, saying he wanted a roll call so every members position would be recorded. Lee has not made his opinion on Montenegros accession public, the spokesman said. Asked if a roll call vote would be scheduled, a spokesman for Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he had no updates to provide. If there is a Senate vote, Montenegros accession is expected to receive the two-thirds majority needed to pass. Montenegrin Foreign Minister Srdjan Darmanovic told Reuters last month that he had been assured that the Senate would ratify his countrys accession by May.     Trump has called for closer ties to Moscow and criticized NATO as obsolete. In his speech to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night, he reaffirmed support for the alliance, but said he expects U.S. allies to pay more of the cost of their own security needs. Montenegrin officials blame Moscow for an extended campaign intended to prevent the country from joining NATO. Last month, they said they had evidence Russia was involved in a plot to overthrow its government during an election last October, an accusation Moscow dismissed. The charges echoed assertions by U.S. intelligence that Russia sought to interfere in the 2016 U.S. election. Trump could still keep Montenegro from joining by refusing to formally deposit the countrys Protocol of Accession. Doing so would signal a significant rift with his own party in Congress.

This Trump was part deal-maker, part salesman, asking for unity and trying to repackage his populist message in more palatable terms.  He was less combative, less thin-skinned and more inclusive.  And where five weeks ago at his inauguration, he slammed Washingtons politicians as out-of-touch elitists who prospered at the expense of the public, his message on Tuesday night was different: I need you, Republicans and Democrats alike. Always a showman, the reality TV star-turned-politician laid out plenty of promises: A massive infrastructure and public works program; tax cuts for the middle class; immigration reform; a healthcare overhaul; an education bill. All of it would require congressional action, likely by different coalitions of conservatives, moderates and Democrats.  This is our vision. This is our mission, Trump said. But we can only get there together. Trump, a Republican who has taunted Democrats over his 2016 election victory and publicly fumed as they held up his Cabinet nominees, did not criticize them this time. Repeatedly, he asked for their help, arguing that the countrys problems call for bipartisan solutions.  After weeks of attacks on the media, political rivals and the judges who ruled against his executive order to temporarily ban travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, Trump finally eased off, although his proposals were short on specifics.

The challenges are going to be the details on his policies. He was presidential tonight in a way he has not been before this, said Republican consultant Matt Mackowiak. The address appeared to show some recognition by the White House that Trumps bombastic go-it-alone style has its limits. After a parade of executive orders, Trump must now turn his attention to the big-ticket items on his agenda requiring legislative action.  Hes done all he can unilaterally, said Bradley Blakeman, a former aide to President George W. Bush. Now he needs to pass bills. Even though Republicans control Congress, Blakeman said Trump needs Democrats to build a majority that would allow conservative Republicans to oppose some of his more centrist proposals, such as hefty infrastructure spending and talks on immigration reform.  The president is as transactional a person as weve ever seen, Blakeman said. He understands that you might not like this deal, but I need you for three other deals.  Despite the softer tone, Trumps divisive policies and months of hostile rhetoric will not be forgotten by his adversaries. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, in a round of television interviews on Wednesday morning, dismissed Trumps speech as detached from reality, saying the softer tone did not match the administrations hard-line agenda presented so far. His speeches are populist. Theyre aimed at the working folks who supported him. But his governing and what he does is hard right, favoring special interests over the working class, Schumer told CBS. Nancy Pelosi, the leading Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives, told MSNBC that Trump gave a good sales pitch but has offered little in the way of concrete proposals: All they have is rhetoric. We dont have any reality in terms of any legislation. Congressional Democrats said they liked Trumps infrastructure program, his childcare tax credit, his call to reduce the prices of prescription drugs, and his vow to preserve some key elements of former President Barack Obamas signature 2010 health insurance law. Democrats remain troubled, among other things, by Trumps desire to slash domestic programs to increase military spending, his plans to reduce taxes for the wealthy and corporations, as well as his aggressive policy to deport illegal immigrants.   To be sure, the more foreboding elements of Trumps campaign rhetoric were still present, albeit slightly dialed-down. As he did during the campaign, he portrayed a country in ruinous economic shape and plagued by terrorism, drugs, gangs, and illegal immigrants. In coming days, the White House is likely to release a revised version of its travel ban, reigniting a controversy that overshadowed the first weeks of Trumps presidency. [nL2N1GE0SB] Trump came into the address struggling with public opinion. In an interview with Fox News he acknowledged that he and his staff had not been effective communicators. The most recent Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll found about 48 percent of Americans disapproved of Trumps performance, with 46 percent backing him, poor numbers for a new president.  Mackowiak said Trumps address could reverse his fortunes in a crucial moment for his presidency. His public support will improve from this speech, he said.   But John Geer, a public-opinion expert at Vanderbilt University, was not convinced. Hes going to have to do more than give a speech.   ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration does not want to reform an internet surveillance law to address privacy concerns, a White House official told Reuters on Wednesday, saying it is needed to protect national security.     The announcement could put President Donald Trump on a collision course with Congress, where some Republicans and Democrats have advocated curtailing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, parts of which are due to expire at the end of the year. We support the clean reauthorization and the administration believes its necessary to protect the security of the nation, the official said on condition of anonymity. The FISA law has been criticized by privacy and civil liberties advocates as allowing broad, intrusive spying. It gained renewed attention following the 2013 disclosures by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden that the agency carried out widespread monitoring of emails and other electronic communications. Portions of the law, including a provision known as Section 702, will expire on Dec. 31 unless Congress reauthorizes them. Section 702 enables two internet surveillance programs called Prism and Upstream, classified details of which were revealed by Snowden. Prism gathers messaging data from Alphabet Incs Google , Facebook Inc , Microsoft Corp, Apple Inc  and other major tech companies that is sent to and from a foreign target under surveillance. Upstream allows the NSA to copy Web traffic flowing along the internet backbone  located inside the United States and search that data. U.S. intelligence officials say the programs are vital to national security. Democratic and Republican lawmakers have said reforms to Section 702 are needed, in part to ensure the privacy protections on Americans are not violated. The U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee met Wednesday to discuss possible changes to the law. Though FISA is intended to govern spy programs intended for foreigners, an unknown amount of communications belonging to Americans are also collected due to a range of technical and practical reasons. Such collection has been defended by U.S. intelligence agencies as incidental, but privacy groups have said it allows for backdoor seizures of U.S. data without proper judicial oversight and could impact thousands or millions of Americans. For years lawmakers have sought an estimate on how many Americans are caught in the crosshairs of the foreign intelligence programs, saying it is necessary to consider changes to Section 702.  On Tuesday former Senator Dan Coats, Trumps nominee for director of national intelligence, told a Senate panel he would do everything I can to publicly disclose such a figure before the laws expiration, though he stopped short of guaranteeing it.  Section 702, he added, was the crown jewels of the intelligence community. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Conway came under criticism last month when she said on television that Americans should go buy Ivankas stuff, in comments that appeared to violate government ethics rules prohibiting the use of public office to endorse products or advance personal business gains. In a letter to a government ethics watchdog agency, White House Deputy Counsel Stefan Passantino said he met with Conway after her comments and that she committed to follow the rules in the future. The Office of Government Ethics has said the White House should consider taking disciplinary action against Conway. But there was no mention in Passantinos letter of any disciplinary action. We concluded that Ms. Conway acted inadvertently and is highly unlikely to do so again, Passantino said in the letter to Office of Government Ethics Director Walter Shaub.  It is noted that Ms. Conway made the statement in question in a light, off-hand manner while attempting to stand up for a person she believed had been unfairly treated and did so without nefarious motive or intent to benefit personally, the letter said.  Conway spoke about Ivanka Trumps products after department store chain Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) said it was dropping the brand of the presidents older daughter. A day before her appearance on television, Trump complained on Twitter that Nordstrom had treated his daughter unfairly by dropping her line. Representative Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives oversight panel, criticized the White House response, saying other federal employees would likely be suspended if they made similar comments endorsing products or services. Norman Eisen, a former ethics adviser to President Barack Obama, said each federal agency decides for itself how to handle such violations. He said he would have preferred a tougher response from Trumps White House, but he said Passantinos handling of the situation appeared reasonable.

(Reuters) - While U.S. President Donald Trump tried to win over skeptics in Congress on Tuesday, he never had to worry about losing the faithful at the Quaker Steak and Lube. About two dozen fans of the 45th president gathered at the bar and restaurant in Clearwater, Florida, still committed to Trump despite the tumult of his first 40 days in office. They praised the Republican presidents first address to a joint session of Congress, both for its familiar content and his newly deferential tone. He nailed it. He knocked it out of the park, said Dean Mears, 58, of Clearwater, who watched with about two dozen others under large-screen TVs that were tuned to Fox News, the presidents favored cable news channel.  Like Trump supporters in other parts of the country, they praised the presidents more inclusive and less bombastic language as he also promised that America must put its own citizens first, crack down on illegal immigration and build up the military. The milder Trump contrasted markedly with the candidate who insulted his rivals during the 2016 campaign, recently branded the news media the enemy of the people and was caught making vulgar remarks about grabbing women on a decade-old video. In Boone County, Kentucky, the vice chairwoman of the local Republican Party, Phyllis Sparks, said she liked that Trump spoke not only to his base but to all Americans. Kirt Jacobs, a Louisville entrepreneur, said Trump was all about we and very little, if any, about me. In the Denver suburbs, a voter who supported Marco Rubio in last years Republican nominating contest, said Trump validated her vote for him in November. He had a much softer tone - more presidential - but stayed true to his principles, said Kathleen Johnson. He wasnt blaming people and sounded more comforting. A CNN/ORC national poll found that 78 percent of respondents who watched the speech had a positive reaction. With 3 million tweets, Trumps speech was the most tweeted- about presidential address to Congress, surpassing the previous record of 2.6 million for Obamas 2015 State of the Union speech, a Twitter spokesman said.  At the Quaker Steak and Lube, the praise began beforehand, with a rally on the sidewalk outside where supporters waved signs reading: America First and Florida for Trump. They were mostly greeted by honking horns of approval, but also a few passing drivers who shouted expletives.  Trump won 46 percent of the national popular vote in last years election, 2 percentage points behind Democrat Hillary Clinton, but prevailed in the Electoral College state-by-state tally needed to win the White House. Nationally, his approval rating has sagged to a low level for a new president, around 44 percent, according to an average of recent polls by Real Clear Politics. Trump has been shaken by investigations into his campaigns possible ties to Russia, his misstatements about his levels of support, and a federal courts halt to his executive order temporarily banning entry into the country for people from seven Muslim-majority nations. Clearwater, on the Gulf Coast, sits in Pinellas County in the heart of Florida, where the past four statewide elections have been decided by about 1 percentage point. Trump, a part-time Floridian, flipped the results from the last two presidential elections in Pinellas County in his favor after former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, carried the county in 2008 and 2012.  The county has long been a retirement destination, especially among those leaving the Midwest. It is about 75 percent white, 11 percent black and 9 percent Latino, according to 2015 census data.     Speaking just before the address, Ron Sanders, 65, a Baptist pastor living in nearby Seminole, Florida, wanted to hear Trump tackle illegal immigration, which the president did. He also hoped Trumps speech would help to bring in line moderate Republican senators who have been critical of some of his early efforts, which is not yet certain. Hes sticking to what he said. Its not discouraging Trump at all, said Sanders, wearing a cowboy hat colored like an American flag. Hes going full guns ahead. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Trump said he was open to a broad overhaul of the U.S. immigration system, a shift from his hardline campaign rhetoric. He emphasized his desire to focus on problems at home by boosting the U.S. economy with tax reform, a $1 trillion infrastructure effort and an overhaul of President Barack Obamas signature healthcare law, known as Obamacare.    BRIAN REYNOLDS, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, NEW ALBION PARTNERS, NEW YORK The speech showed the softer side of the President, but I think the media had let investors know this would be the case, so no surprise for markets on that front. The speech lacked specifics as it related to financial markets. Again I dont think that is a surprise. With no surprises and few financial specifics, it is likely that equity investors will focus on how many of his themes can be passed by Congress given how late it is getting in the legislative calendar. Skepticism over the likelihood of policy enactment may create a brief pullback in stocks at some point. There was nothing in the speech, or in the Presidents agenda, that is likely to alter the behavior of corporate bond investors, who have been driving this equity bull market for eight years via debt-fueled buybacks. They bought a strong $18 billion of new corporate bonds on Tuesday in advance of the speech, and they will likely be back at work on Wednesday, putting their cash flows to work. I believe that these flows are likely to keep any stock market pullback brief and shallow. BUCKY HELLWIG, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, BB&T WEALTH MANAGEMENT, BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA: The speech was a summary of Trumps policies.  Stocks could move higher tomorrow as nothing has changed and stock investors are still expecting infrastructure build out, tax and regulatory relief, and changes in Affordable Care, but the timetable has not been clarified for these. Republican constituents may pressure Congress to step up the pace in moving the Trump agenda forward. Some specifics: pressure on drug margins, completion across state lines for healthcare organizations, military expenditures increasing  but nothing new here. Fed policy will get more attention this week and next.  Manufacturing PMI tomorrow and employment report next Friday (March 10) will be watched.  Yellen will be speaking this Friday.  Fed funds futures showing a higher probability of  an increase at the FOMC March 15 meeting. J.J. FELDMAN, PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT MIRACLE MILE ADVISORS IN LA: There was nothing really new, he said. It was a good speech in that it was more uniting than divisive but from the market perspective it was status quo, This probably wasnt the venue but if new details on tax reform are not coming soon theres going to be disappointment for sure. JUAN PEREZ, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, TEMPUS CONSULTING, WASHINGTON: Trump said a lot of things that are positive for financial markets such as spending a huge amount for infrastructure. Overall there were no real surprises as these are pronouncements that we have heard before. However, I expect that market gains from his speech would be subdued by the continued tone of protectionism in his statements. Anytime, you attack trade deals as Trump did, the market gets nervous. PAUL CHRISTOPHER, HEAD GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST  AT WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT INSTITUTE IN ST. LOUIS, MO.  I was impressed though, or at least relieved, that it wasnt like his inauguration speech, it wasnt a challenge or a gauntlet thrown down to the opposition or to other countries. It was a speech that was more balanced and more presidential-sounding.  But even as a state of the union address, which it sounded a lot like, it wasnt very specific. It especially and could have and didnt prioritize all of these different things he was talking about. Some of the policies are going to be very expensive - a trillion dollars for infrastructure, $100 billion a year, extra defense spending - the budget may not have room for all of that.  He didnt talk at all about how they were going to fund any of that. He also didnt talk about tax reform, which I expected he would give Congress some marching orders in terms of what he wants - he hardly said anything about tax reform.  He talked about the Affordable Care Act but again he didnt talk about any of the directives of are we going to repeal and replace now or repeal and replace later. He did say he wanted continuity but moderate Republicans are not convinced the conservative Republicans have that as a priority. So it may be even difficult to pass the ACA repeal in this budget bill.  He was effective at reaching out to the other side, he was effective at times in being able to connect items. For example, connecting education as the way to break the cycle of poverty and then morphing or transitioning into violent crime and cutting down on that. Those were effective points and effective transitions.  But again not enough detail for investors and certainly the markets were chopping around while he was speaking. It wasnt a big market mover and we still have to wait for the details. I dont think we are going to see much change.  There is no reason to sell, he didnt throw water on any of the agenda, he simply didnt clarify it any. I think the market is going to be positive. The market continues to see him as a good-for-business president. Hes very pragmatic when it comes to business. In terms of getting these grand visions done, I dont think the market gives so much importance to that. When he spoke about cost cutting, that immediately resonates with everyone on Wall Street. Thats easy stuff. Thats low hanging fruit. Its really hard to grow revenues. But its really easy to cut costs. There is so much fat. Its so over regulated. This is easy stuff. He said enough of that during the speech that he will resonate well. I think some people were probably looking for some meat on the bones. He definitely covered everything. It was more of a laundry list. There wasnt a lot of details. To me, the tax reform is something everybody wants. Repatriation of money abroad is something that ever wants. Why not take care of those and then take care of the dicey things? Like Obamacare and immigration. OMER ESINER, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST AT COMMONWEALTH FOREIGN EXCHANGE IN WASHINGTON DC (Trumps) mention of historic treaties and NATO specifically was reassuring for our allies globally, and in that sense it was probably reassuring for global financial markets as well. (The speech) was still probably light on actual details on the fiscal side of things. We got mention of a trillion dollar infrastructure spending package. I think its very early so I wouldnt necessarily hang my hat on that number. It was largely absent of any major focus on the tax side of things. In terms of overall details, on the fiscal side of the equation, it was probably pretty light. But I think despite that on some level the market might be reassured by the more or less balanced tone of the speech. It was much more presidential than some of the previous speeches and commentary weve gotten from the president. PAUL NOLTE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT IN CHICAGO The devil is going to be in the details and I think thats why you didnt see the futures move too terribly much. The markets are still, show me what you are going to do, how is this all going to work and how are we paying for it. Thats going to take probably a couple weeks to a couple months to get laid out. Everybody is looking for more details and were still waiting.  I think expectations right now are really high all the way around and its going to be a process. Were going to have to wait to see some of this develop. STEVE MASSOCCA, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AT WEDBUSH SECURITIES IN SAN FRANCISCO  I thought it went pretty well, certainly no land mines or explosions. From an investors perspective there was no new information, no surprises good or bad. From the perspective of where money goes tomorrow, I dont see what we have learned thats new or different. ... But he burnished his image, so theres a positive there. Hes a pro business president so thats a good thing. RANDY FREDERICK, VICE PRESIDENT OF TRADING AND DERIVATIVES FOR CHARLES SCHWAB IN AUSTIN, TEXAS He pretty much didnt say anything he hadnt said before so markets have no reason to react overly positively or overly negatively ... Would the market have liked details sure, but I dont think it was expecting them.  If anything the market might move moderately higher tomorrow. It pulled back moderately today. The uptick in volatility today was a preparation for the potential for a downside move ... It was a little bit of hedging going on before an event that could move the market.  A key focus for Wednesday will be Personal Consumption Expenditures, a key inflationary measure that the U.S. Federal Reserve watches, Frederick said. BRIAN JACOBSEN, CHIEF PORTFOLIO STRATEGIST AT WELLS FARGO FUNDS MANAGEMENT IN MENOMONEE FALLS, WISCONSIN:  He was surprisingly detailed about what to replace Obamacare with. Its likely Congress will be able to take that up shortly as part of the 2017 budget and then quickly pivot to the 2018 budget which will deal with tax reform. That plan is much less developed, but he has time. On taxes, Jacobsen said: Every deduction and credit that would need to be eliminated to lower tax rates in a budget-neutral way has strong defenders. Thats how those deductions and credits got there. So, well just have to watch and wait to see which special interests President Trump will take on. TIM GHRISKEY, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER OF SOLARIS GROUP IN BEDFORD HILLS, NEW YORK. It seemed to be a somewhat kinder and gentler Trump. He wasnt attacking individuals like he often does. This remains a very pro-growth agenda and the markets like that, but I didnt hear anything new that would make it necessarily move ahead, except that he stuck to his guns to make his agenda items happen. STOCKS: U.S. stock futures were stronger at the start of Trumps address, with major indices 0.3 percent higher. They eased those gains as he spoke, with the S&P 500 E-mini futures last up 0.2 percent.  BONDS:  U.S. Treasury futures TYv1 dipped slightly ahead of his speech, and were last down 0.4 percent. FOREX: The dollar erased its earlier gains in Asia, with the market jittery as Trumps speech was short on details on his economic stimulus. The dollar/yen eased to around 112.80 yen JPY= from the days high of 113.375 yen hit earlier, on hopes the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates this month.

Following are some of the main themes of Trumps speech: Trump promised new steps shortly to keep out those who would do us harm and said his administration had been working on improved vetting procedures. He said the vast majority of people convicted for terrorism-related offenses since the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, had come from outside the United States and vowed the country should not become a sanctuary for extremists.  He said the United States should switch away from lower-skilled immigration and adopt a merit-based system, adding that  Republicans and Democrats could work together to achieve immigration reform as long as it focused on improving jobs and wages and strengthening the countrys security.  Construction of a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border will begin soon, Trump said. Throughout his election campaign and in the first weeks of his presidency, Trump said Mexico would pay for the wall, but he made no mention of that on Tuesday. Trump called on Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare. He said reforms should lower the cost of healthcare and ensure people with pre-existing conditions have access to coverage. He proposed tax credits and expanded health savings accounts for people to purchase health insurance. Legal reforms should also protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance, he said. Trump vowed historic reform to reduce the corporate tax rate to make U.S. companies more globally competitive and promised massive tax relief for the middle class. He gave no new details on the tax reforms he would like to see and made no  mention of a border adjustment tax that lies at the heart of a Republican proposal in the House of Representatives. Trump said Congress will be asked to approve legislation for a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure, financed through both public and private channels. Buy American and Hire American will be the guiding principles, he said. Trump promised to send to Congress a budget to rebuild the military, billing it as one of the largest-ever increases in defense spending. He vowed to work with U.S. allies, including in the Muslim world, to destroy Islamic State, describing the radical militant group as a network of lawless savages. He vowed support for NATO but said U.S. partners must meet their financial obligations. He also reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with Israel.

Trump and his fellow Republicans who control Congress are seeking to unravel former Democratic President Barack Obamas initiatives to combat global climate change, which they say are costly for U.S. business and have hampered drilling and mining without providing any clear benefits. Rescinding the federal coal leasing moratorium is part of that executive order, which has lots of different components, including the Clean Power Plan, the White House official, who asked not to be named, told Reuters. The official said the order was scheduled to come next week. The Clean Power Plan is Obamas centerpiece initiative to combat climate change, requiring states to slash emissions of carbon dioxide, but it was never implemented due to legal challenges launched by several Republican states. Legal experts have said Trump could begin the process of killing the regulation by having the Environmental Protection Agency ask the courts to return it to the agency for review, effectively ending its legal defense. Killing the coal mining ban would be easier. Trump could reverse the ban by asking the Department of Interior to lift it and resume its coal leasing program. Obamas administration imposed the temporary ban on new federal coal leases in January 2016 as part of a broad environmental and economic review of the program aimed at ensuring lease deals account for coals contribution to global climate change and yield fair returns to taxpayers. But it angered some Western state lawmakers and people in the mining industry, who said it stymied development. Trump has already rolled back some Obama-era green regulations, including the Stream Protection Rule limiting coal mining waste dumping, and the Waters of the U.S. rule that expands the waterways under federal protection.

Five members of the U.S. House of Representatives and eight senators from both the Democratic and Republican parties wrote to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to support the Asia-Pacific Stability Initiative (ASPI) proposed in January by John McCain, chair of the Senate Armed Service Committee. Copies of the letters were seen by Reuters. Their signatories include members of the armed services committees in both houses of Congress. McCains proposal calls for $1.5 billion annually for five years to 2022 to boost U.S. munitions stocks in the region, build new military infrastructure, such as runways, and help allies and partners increase their capabilities. The House letter urged Mattis to incorporate McCains proposal in the fiscal 2018-22 defense budgets. The Asia-Pacific region holds many interests for U.S. foreign policy that will require our government to continue to prioritize our time, energy and resources there, it said. The letter called former President Barack Obamas policy of giving precedence to the Asia-Pacific sound and it was critical that this be continued under President Donald Trump. It expressed concern about the eroding military and economic balance that is the result of the Peoples Republic of Chinas two-decade military modernization, combined with the effect of years of sequestration on the U.S. military and our foreign policy apparatus. The Senate letter also expressed concern about increasing Russian activity in the region and North Koreas nuclear and missile programs. ASPI will show both allies and adversaries that the U.S. remains committed to ensuring peace and security in a region that contains the worlds three largest economies, four most populous countries, six of the worlds largest armies, and five of the seven U.S. mutual defense agreements, it said. Trump has vowed to take a tougher line with China and to build up the U.S. military, although it is unclear whether he will succeed in lifting caps on defense spending that have been part of sequestration legislation. China is due to announce its defense budget for this year this weekend, and its navy is likely to secure significant new funding as Beijing seeks to check U.S. dominance of the high seas and step up its projection of global power.

The department proposed a 60-day delay of the fiduciary rule, which requires retirement advisers to put the interests of clients ahead of their own. It was slated to take effect on April 10, but Trump asked the department to review the rule one more time for its impact on investors. Industry analysts and consumer groups agreed it could be the first of multiple delays as the department begins a comprehensive review of the Obama-era regulation, after Trump in February issued an executive order directing the department to review the rule. A 60-day delay is relatively short to undertake the type of economic and legal analysis that theyre contemplating, which suggests to me that this isnt just going to be a 60-day delay, Its likely going to be a string of delays, said Micah Hauptman, with the Consumer Federation of America. The proposed delay should have a calming effect on the marketplace, which had been hanging in limbo ahead of the April 10 effective date, said Denise Valentine, a senior analyst with Aite Group, which advises the financial services industry on regulatory issues. All along weve kind of known that the rule is very likely to be amended. I dont think it will be killed, Valentine said. The public will have 15 days from the publication of the proposed delay in the Federal Register on Thursday to comment on the delay itself before the Labor Department can formalize it. There will also be a 45-day window to submit comments or information related to other aspects of Trumps memorandum.  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which has sued to kill the rule, on Wednesday praised the proposed delay. When former President Barack Obamas administration finalized the rule last year, it said it was a move to help Americans saving for their retirement. But critics in the financial services industry say the rule would limit the ability of advisers to service clients who cannot afford to pay for financial advice and must use products that carry commissions or other indirect costs. When Trump issued the executive order, White House spokesman Sean Spicer called the rule a solution in search of the problem at a briefing ahead of the signing. The move drew fire from Democrats and other critics, who said it showed the Republican White House was aligned with Wall Street, not middle-income Americans. Industry groups, however, praised the delay proposed on Wednesday. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association said it would allow the new administration an opportunity to review the rules impact on investors and the market.

Ryan Zinke, a U.S. Representative from coal-producing Montana, won confirmation by a vote of 68 to 31, with several Democrats joining Republicans, who lead the chamber. The former Navy SEAL commander is an avid hunter and angler who is popular with many outdoor enthusiasts, including Trumps son Donald Jr.  Many environmentalists, however, are concerned about Zinkes zeal for exploiting coal and other fossil fuels. As a one-term Congressman, Zinke worked to boost mining, including supporting an effort to end a coal leasing moratorium on federal lands. Forty percent of U.S. output comes from federal lands that are  mostly in Wyoming and Montana. In his confirmation hearing in January Zinke said he would consider an expansion of energy drilling and mining on federal lands but would ensure that sensitive areas were protected.  Democrats who voted against Zinke, including Senators Maria Cantwell and Chuck Schumer, questioned his support of fossil fuel development on federal lands. Congressman Zinke says hes a dyed in the wool conservationist, but doesnt have the record to back it up, said Schumer, the Senates top Democrat. That should concern every outdoor enthusiast, every lover of our great and grand national parks. Zinke will head an agency that employs more than 70,000 people across the country and oversees more than 20 percent of federal land, including national parks such as Yellowstone and Yosemite.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - In formulating a new executive order limiting travel to the United States, President Donald Trump has promised to make the directive harder to fight successfully in court than the one he issued in January.  One way the administration will likely try to do that, legal experts say, is to shape the order more narrowly to undercut the opportunity for states and other opponents to sue by showing courts they have standing, or the ability to argue the presidents order causes them harm. But legal experts said a new order, which a White House source said was expected this week, was unlikely to fully eliminate the ability of challengers to pursue legal actions.  More than two dozen lawsuits were filed in U.S. courts against the initial travel ban, which temporarily barred travelers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. In one case, which ultimately got the order temporarily suspended, the state of Washington claimed standing in part because the ban affected Washington residents living and working legally in the United States as permanent residents known as green card holders.  By excluding legal permanent residents from a new order, something the administration has said is likely, the president would make it harder for opponents to challenge the ban. Larry Klayman, founder of the conservative advocacy group Freedom Watch, said that with a narrower order, legal standing could be a real problem for potential challengers. If youre not a citizen, or if youre not a permanent resident, you have no constitutional rights, Klayman said. Trump has said travel limitations are necessary to protect the United States from attacks by Islamist militants. Americans were deeply divided over the measure, which had some support but was condemned by prominent U.S. companies and allies. The initial order caused chaos at airports, as people,  including green card holders initially, were temporarily blocked from entering the United States.  Some of those people, and several states, challenged the order. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, ruling in the Washington case, said the ban likely violated the states due process rights and suspended it.  The 9th Circuit also ruled that Washington had legal standing to challenge the ban, over objections from the Department of Justice.  Stephen Legomsky, former chief counsel for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services under President Barack Obama, said a narrower ban weakens the arguments for standing but doesnt entirely eliminate them. Legomsky noted that, in general the Constitution does not apply to people outside the United States, but that is not iron clad.  A U.S. citizen whose spouse was barred from visiting by the order, for instance, could argue that he or she had standing to challenge it. Or a state university might argue that the order negatively affected it.  In its ruling, the 9th Circuit said Washington state had standing because it was harmed by Trumps order, specifically noting that faculty at the states universities from those seven countries would be prohibited from traveling for research or academic collaboration.  The universities reputations depend on the success of their professors research, the court wrote. The one thing legal experts on all sides of the issue agree on is that the new order will be challenged in courts.  No matter what they do there will be litigation, said Stephen Yale-Loehr. He said he thinks it likely challengers will be able to establish standing, leaving the courts to decide whether the ban is legal. At that point, Yale-Loehr says, the wording of the new order will become crucial. If they limit the executive order to people who have never been to the U.S. before, they might win on the merits eventually, he said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

In his first nationally televised speech to Congress since taking office on Jan. 20, Trump sought to reassure allies still uneasy over doubts he raised during the 2016 presidential campaign about his commitment to their defense and to maintaining a U.S. global leadership role. But he also made clear that he expects those countries to shoulder more of the burden of their own security needs, echoing a campaign message that some allies had taken advantage of Washingtons generosity in providing them a security umbrella. Our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world, Trump told a joint session of Congress. It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies across the globe. He specifically assured NATO allies of his new administrations continued commitment to the decades-old alliance. However, he made no mention of one of the main sources of European concern: his friendly overtures during the campaign toward Russian President Vladimir Putin. We strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two World Wars that dethroned fascism and a Cold War that defeated communism, Trump said. But our partners must meet their financial obligations, he said. And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. Then, deviating from his prepared remarks, Trump added: In fact, I can tell you the money is pouring in. Very nice. But he offered no specifics. Some critics had accused Trump of failing to recognize the benefit that accrued to the United States of having strong democratic allies helping to stabilize volatile areas like the Middle East, Ukraine and South Asia. Trumps remarks followed the deployment earlier this month of senior Cabinet members to Brussels, Bonn and Munich, Germany, aimed at calming European worries. The Europeans heard from Defense Secretary James Mattis that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization military alliance was not obsolete after all, despite Trumps suggestions to the contrary. Vice President Mike Pence told them that Russia would be held accountable for its actions in Ukraine.  Mattis made his first foreign trip to South Korea and Japan, where he sought to ease  concerns about what Trumps self-styled America First strategy means for U.S. foreign policy in Asia. While seeming to tackle some of the doubts of U.S. allies, Trump still made clear that he wanted them to do more. We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East, or the Pacific, to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost, he said.

The draft document, due to be sent to the U.S. Congress on Wednesday, marks the first time the new administration has laid out its trade plans in writing, the Times said. Ever since the United States won its independence, it has been a basic principle of our country that American citizens are subject only to laws and regulations made by the U.S. government  not rulings made by foreign governments or international bodies, the report said, according to the Times. Accordingly, the Trump administration will aggressively defend American sovereignty over matters of trade policy, the report said, according to the Times. The Wall Street Journal, which also said it reviewed the  document, said the policy represents a dramatic departure from the Obama administration, which emphasized international economic rules and the authority of the WTO, a body that regulates trade and resolves disputes among its members. By contrast, the Trump administration will more assertively defend U.S. sovereignty over trade policy, ramp up enforcement of U.S. trade laws, and use all possible sources of leverage to encourage other countries to open up their markets, the document said, according to the Journal. The White House did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.  Congress requires the president to submit the administrations trade policy annually by March 1. In the face of Republican concerns, a congressional aide said language in the draft challenging the WTO could still be toned down in a final, public version, the Journal reported. Washington is facing several important WTO decisions, particularly involving China. Potentially the most important is a WTO complaintfiled in December by Beijing against the EU and the United States for blocking Chinas request to be treated as a market economy under the institutions rules. A final ruling could still be years away. But were the U.S. to ignore a finding in Chinas favor it could have major consequences for the WTO as a venue for resolving trade disputes before they fester into destructive trade wars, the Times said.

Republicans, who control the White House and Congress, are in agreement in their opposition to former Democratic President Barack Obamas signature healthcare law but the details are proving knotty. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said separately that an effort was under way to get both chambers and the White House to agree on a plan to eliminate and replace the Affordable Care Act.    Were not there yet, McConnell told reporters, hours before Trump was due to address a joint session of Congress. Theres a lot of discussion about how to craft that, what combination of legislation and regulation will get us to where we want to get, he said. Meanwhile, Republican conservatives in the House signaled resistance to replacement draft legislation that would limit tax breaks on some employer-sponsored healthcare plans and offer tax credits based on age rather than income to help consumers buy insurance.  Its a new entitlement program, said Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, chairman of a 40-member bloc of Republican lawmakers known as the House Freedom Caucus.  It raises taxes on the middle class to give subsidies to others who could indeed be millionaires, he added. It also comes down to a plan that doesnt reduce the cost of healthcare. Ryan had promised legislation on Obamacare after lawmakers returned to Washington this week from a 10-day recess. On Tuesday, he told reporters that the White House, Senate and House were working on a single plan to repeal and replace the healthcare law. He insisted there were no rival plans. At the end of the day, when we get everything done and right, were going to be unified on this, Ryan said. Meadows said it would become clear within 48 hours whether the draft has enough support to pass the House. He said he supported a different bill introduced by Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and Representative Mark Sanford of South Carolina. Paul said conservative lawmakers are concerned congressional leaders are discussing a plan that would include new entitlements that the government cannot afford. Were not just going along with whatever they try to shove down our throats, Paul told CNN. Were going to be a big part of this. Conservatives will be listened to or there wont be a repeal, he said. The Paul-Sanford bill would expand the use of health savings accounts (HSAs) to pay for healthcare costs and offer tax credits to people who contribute to HSAs.  Another Freedom Caucus member, Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, said he also favored the replacement bill put forward by Paul and Sanford. We could bring back affordable health insurance, he said.

Ross, speaking to reporters after the speech, said that Trump was merely pointing out an export tax inequity between the United States and many other countries, not specifying how it should be remedied. Trump said he was asking for a change in the way U.S. imports are taxed, saying that other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes, but the United States charges nothing or almost nothing on imports. Trump referred to tariffs of 100 percent by some countries on U.S.-made Harley-Davidson Inc (HOG.N) motorcycles, saying that the company was used to being mistreated in foreign markets. They werent even asking for a change, but I am, Trump told the joint session of Congress. Asked if Trumps remarks on the topic effectively endorsed a  plan by House of Representatives Republicans to levy a border tax of about 20 percent on imports into the United States, Ross said, No, he did not. What he addressed was the issue that needs to be solved,  which is theres inequitable treatment of the U.S. Other countries have a value-added tax which they rebate on exports, Ross said. He said the World Trade Organization has turned down past U.S. requests to allow American companies to deduct income taxes paid on exports. The proposed border tax is under attack from import-heavy businesses but is supported by large exporters, such as manufacturers. Border advisability, other programs are possible ways of solving that. But I didnt hear him coming out clearly in favor of any one system, said Ross, who was sworn in earlier on Tuesday. Trump has not clearly endorse or opposed the border tax proposal, although he spoke favorably of it in a Reuters interview. He has also called the proposal too complicated. Asked if WTO compliance was a crucial factor in the solution, Ross, a billionaire investor and corporate turnaround expert, said that the first negotiation over export tax would be with Congress.

I think this is something that needs to be investigated and addressed, former Republican Senator Dan Coats told the Senate Intelligence Committee during his confirmation hearing to be the top U.S. intelligence official. Coats, 73, a former member of the intelligence panel, also promised that it would have full access to all of the documents and other materials needed for an investigation. I have no intention of holding anything back from this committee, Coats said. Trump denounced intelligence agencies for their assessment that Russia sought to influence the election on his behalf, prompting concerns about his support for them. Trump has also repeatedly praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, leading some in Washington worry that he might not take a hard enough line in dealings with Moscow. In his opening statement, Coats addressed that concern by listing activity by Russia, along with that of China and North Korea, as among the main challenges faced by the United States. Russias assertiveness in global affairs is something I look upon with great concern, which we need to address with eyes wide open and a healthy degree of skepticism, Coats said. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence was created after the Sept. 11 attacks to oversee all 16 U.S. intelligence agencies and improve communications among them. One concern about Coats was his record on the U.S. use after the 2001 attacks of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques, such as waterboarding, which are widely seen as torture. In 2015, he was one of the few lawmakers who opposed legislation sponsored by Republican Senator John McCain that made the use of such techniques illegal. Coats promised that he would follow the law, saying he voted against that legislation because he wanted to at least have a discussion about the best way to proceed if intelligence agencies wanted to obtain crucial information quickly. Coats also strongly defended U.S. government surveillance programs, though he said he would do everything I can to publicly disclose an estimate of the number of Americans caught in the crosshairs of internet surveillance programs intended to target foreigners.  But he stopped short of guaranteeing such a disclosure, which privacy advocates in Congress have requested for years and said is necessary to properly debate possible reforms to a surveillance law that expires at the end of 2017.  Although he was ambassador to Germany under President George W. Bush, Coats would be the first director of national intelligence who has not spent most of his career in the military, in intelligence agencies or as a diplomat. Coats, who is popular with Democrats and his fellow Republicans, is expected to be easily confirmed. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Trump administration officials said on Monday they sought to  increase Pentagon spending and offset that with sharp cuts in other areas. One official familiar with discussions about the State Department budget said the agency could see spending cut by as much as 30 percent. Other officials have speculated that the total cut in the combined budgets of the State Department and the Agency for International Development could be as great as 37 percent. I am very concerned by reports of deep cuts that could damage efforts to combat terrorism, save lives and create opportunities for American workers, said U.S. Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee. Royce said his panel would thoroughly review the budget request when Trump sends it to Congress. The United States spends just over $50 billion annually on the State Department and foreign assistance, compared with $600 billion or more each year on the Pentagon. But the administrations proposals are just the start of negotiations on a federal budget that must be passed by Congress. Several leading lawmakers said diplomacy and foreign aid, often called soft power, ensure national security in tandem with military forces and weapons.Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he discussed the issue with Trumps secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, at a meeting on Tuesday and planned to discuss it in greater detail after the White House submits its budget. Asked on Tuesday if the Senate would pass a budget that cuts the State Department budget by a third, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell responded, probably not. Senator Lindsey Graham, the Republican chairman of the Senate subcommittee responsible for the State and Foreign Aid budgets, said Trumps idea would be dead on arrival in Congress. It would be a disaster. If you take soft power off the table, then youre never going to win the war. Whats most disturbing about the cut in the State Departments budget, it shows a lack of understanding of what it takes to win the war, he said on MSNBC. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain said it was shortsighted to cut diplomacy and aid, even though he wants $640 billion in defense spending, far more than the $604 billion proposed by the White House. Im very much opposed, McCain told reporters when asked for his view of proposed State Department and aid cuts. So many of those programs are very important. Theyre a popular target, but theyre very important. Senator Marco Rubio, a member of both the Senate foreign relations and intelligence committees, noted that foreign aid is a tiny portion of the U.S. budget. Foreign aid is not charity. We must make sure it is well spent, but it is less than 1% of budget & critical to our national security, he said on Twitter. The top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Ben Cardin, said he thought enough members of Congress would oppose such a plan to kill it, even though Republicans have  majorities in both houses of Congress and a budget bill would need only a simple majority to pass.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - The White House on Tuesday denied that President Donald Trump planned to issue an executive order to change the national biofuels program, after the U.S. Renewable Fuels Association (RFA) said Trumps team had informed the group an order was pending. Trading in U.S. refinery shares, fuel futures and corn prices was turbulent on the news of the pending order and its subsequent denial, as investors puzzled over what it would mean for the price of gasoline, ethanol and shares of companies that produce them. The RFA issued a statement early on Tuesday that said a member of the Trump administration had called to inform the group the president intended to sign an executive order that would shift the onus on combining biofuels with gasoline away from refiners. The order would require companies further down the supply chain, such as retailers who sell gasoline, to shoulder that load. Refiners have long requested this change, saying the biofuels program has hammered their profits.  White House spokeswoman Kelly Love, however, said on Tuesday afternoon there is no ethanol executive order in the works. Ethanol and fuel retail groups reacted quickly to the reports. Trumps regulation adviser, billionaire investor Carl Icahn, is majority owner of CVR Energy (CVI.N), a refining company that would benefit from the change. That stock is up 80 percent since Trumps election in November. Even after the White House denial, RFA Chief Executive Officer Bob Dinneen stuck by his statement, saying there is certainly something in the works, but theyre not going to confirm it until they are ready to roll with it. He declined to identify who in the Trump administration contacted the association. Despite our continued opposition to the move, we were told the executive order was not negotiable, Dinneen said. The Renewable Fuel Standard requires fuel companies to use increasing amounts of biofuel blended with gasoline and diesel. Former U.S. President Barack Obama expanded the rules, which started under his predecessor, George W. Bush, when gasoline prices were near records. Refineries without operations designed to blend biofuels such as ethanol into gasoline have to pay for renewable fuel credits, known as RINs, to meet U.S. environmental standards to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The cost for refiners has increased sharply in the last few years; nine major publicly traded refiners paid $2.5 billion in 2016 for RINs costs, a 78 percent increase from 2015.  Among those that have pushed for the change is Icahn, who holds an 82 percent stake of CVR. That companys shares jumped on Tuesday before paring gains after the White House denial; they ended up 3.5 percent on the day to $22.92 a share, on heavier-than-usual trading volume of 1.7 million shares.  Icahn was unavailable for comment, and CVR declined to comment.  Emily Skor, CEO of biofuel trade group Growth Energy, expressed concern about any role Icahn may have played in planning changes to the program. I assure you this is no deal for anyone but Carl Icahn, she said. If we had been approached with this deal, we would have flat-out rejected it.  Seven Democratic senators, including Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, sent a letter to the White House this month, saying Icahns role as an adviser to Trump created financial conflicts of interest and called for a review.     Shares of U.S. refiner Valero (VLO.N), which would also benefit from the changes, ended up 1 percent on Tuesday to close at $67.95 a share.  Biofuel organizations and groups representing fuel retailers and integrated oil companies like the U.S. units of Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L) and BP Plc (BP.L) have opposed the change, which they say will complicate managing the program.  One source said the RFA was told the executive order would include incentives for ethanol and biodiesel in a tradeoff for the blending shift. Those changes could include a waiver to allow greater volumes of ethanol to be blended into gasoline in the summer, a review of how the Environmental Protection Agency estimates emission impacts of biofuels, and support for a congressional tax credit for domestic producers of biodiesel, the source said. Chicago Board of Trade corn futures Cc1 ended up about 1.7 percent. CBOT soyoil BOc1, which is used for biodiesel, rose 4.8 percent.  Compliance credits used to meet the annual biofuel blending standards traded around 43 cents on Tuesday from 47 cents to 48 cents previously, paring big morning losses.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The National Security Agency risks a brain-drain of hackers and cyber spies due to a tumultuous reorganization and worries about the acrimonious relationship between the intelligence community and President Donald Trump, according to current and former NSA officials and cybersecurity industry sources. Half-a-dozen cybersecurity executives told Reuters they had witnessed a marked increase in the number of U.S. intelligence officers and government contractors seeking employment in the private sector since Trump took office on Jan. 20.  One of the executives, who would speak only on condition of anonymity, said he was stunned by the caliber of the would-be recruits. They are coming from a variety of government intelligence and law enforcement agencies, multiple executives said, and their interest stems in part from concerns about the direction of U.S intelligence agencies under Trump.   Retaining and recruiting talented technical personnel has become a top national security priority in recent years as Russia, China, Iran and other nation states and criminal groups have sharpened their cyber offensive abilities. NSA and other intelligence agencies have long struggled to deter some of their best employees from leaving for higher-paying jobs in Silicon Valley and elsewhere. The problem is especially acute at NSA, current and former officials said, due to a reorganization known as NSA21 that began last year and aims to merge the agencys electronic eavesdropping and domestic cyber-security operations. The two-year overhaul includes expanding parts of NSA that deal with business management and human resources and putting them on par with research and engineering. The aim is to ensure that were using all of our resources to maximum effect to accomplish our mission, NSA Director Mike Rogers said. The changes include new management structures that have left some career employees uncertain about their missions and  prospects. Former employees say the reorganization has failed to address widespread concerns that the agency is falling behind in exploiting private-sector technological breakthroughs. A former top NSA official said he had been told by three current officials that budget problems meant there was too little money for promotions. That is especially important for younger employees, who sometimes need two jobs to make ends meet in the expensive Washington D.C. area, the official said. Morale is as low as Ive ever seen it, said another former senior NSA official, who maintains close contact with current employees. Asked about the risk of losing talent from NSA and other agencies, White House spokesman Michael Anton said Trump had sought to reassure the intelligence community by visiting the CIA headquarters on his first full day in office. Anton also pointed to the military spending increase in Trumps budget proposal released on Monday.  It will likely take more than a visit to the CIA to patch up relations with the intelligence community, the current and former officials said. Trump has attacked findings from intelligence agencies that Russia hacked emails belonging to Democratic Party operatives during the 2016 presidential campaign to help him win, though he did eventually accept the findings.  In January, Trump accused intelligence agencies of leaking  false information and said it was reminiscent of tactics used in Nazi Germany. The breadth of any exodus from the NSA and other intelligence agencies is difficult to quantify. The NSA has seen a steady rise in the attrition rate among its roughly 36,000 employees since 2009, and it now sits at a little less than six percent, according to an NSA spokesman. NSA director Michael Rogers said last year that the attrition rate was 3.3 percent in 2015, suggesting a sharp jump in departures since then. Several senior NSA officials who have left or plan to leave, including deputy director Richard Ledgett and the head of cyber defense, Curtis Dukes, have said their departures were unrelated to Trump or the reorganization. Some turnover is normal with any new administration, government and industry officials noted, and a stronger economy has also improved pay and prospects in the private sector.  During this time the economy has been recovering from the recession, unemployment rates have been falling and the demand for highly skilled technical talent has been increasing, an NSA spokesman said, when asked to comment on the reports of employee departures. In a statement, Kathy Hutson, NSAs chief of human resources, said the agency continues to attract amazing talent necessary to conduct the security mission the nation needs. Some NSA veterans attribute the morale issues and staff departures to the leadership style of Rogers, who took over the spy agency in 2014 with the task of dousing an international furor caused by leaks from former contractor Edward Snowden. Concern about Rogers reached an apex last October, when former Defense Secretary Ash Carter and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper recommended to then-President Barack Obama that Rogers be removed.  The NSA did not respond to a request for comment on the recommendation last fall that Rogers be replaced.  Rogers is now expected to retain his job at NSA for at least another year, according to former officials. Rogers acknowledged concerns about potential morale problems last month, telling a congressional committee that Trumps broadsides against the intelligence community could create a situation where our workforce decides to walk.  Trumps criticism of the intelligence community has exacerbated the stress caused by the reorganization at the NSA, said Susan Hennessey, a former NSA lawyer now with Brookings Institution.  The tone coming from the White House makes an already difficult situation worse, by eroding the sense of common purpose and service, she said.  A wave of departures of career personnel, Hennessey added,  would represent an incalculable loss to national security.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Chinas state news agency, Xinhua, quoted Yang as saying China was willing to work with Washington to enhance exchanges on all levels from top down and to broaden communication and coordination on regional and global issues, while respecting each others core interests and major concerns. This will help promote sustained, steady and healthy development of the China-U.S. relations, which will benefit the peoples of not only both nations but also the whole world, Xinhua quoted Yang as saying. The meeting was the latest exchange aimed at resetting relations between the worlds two largest economies following a rocky start after the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president. On Monday, Yang, who outranks Chinas foreign minister, met at the White House with Trump, who has attacked China on issues from trade, to the South China Sea and North Korea. They discussed shared security interests and a possible meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, according to a senior U.S. administration official.

In December, Trump incensed Beijing by saying the United States did not have to stick to the one China policy, under which Washington acknowledges the Chinese position that there is only one China, of which Taiwan is a part. He later agreed in a phone call with Xi to honor the policy. In an interview with Reuters last week, Trump urged China to do more to rein in North Koreas nuclear and missile programs.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is seeking what he called a historic increase in defense spending, but ran into immediate opposition from Republicans in Congress who must approve his plan and said it was not enough to meet the militarys needs. The proposed rise in the Pentagon budget to $603 billion comes as the United States has wound down major wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and remains the worlds strongest military power. The plan came under fire from Democratic lawmakers, who said cuts being proposed to pay for the additional military spending would cripple important domestic programs such as environmental protection and education. A White House budget official, who outlined the plan on a conference call with reporters, said the administration would propose increasing defense by $54 billion or 10 percent. That represents the magnitude of the increase over budget caps Congress put in place in 2011. But Mick Mulvaney, the White House budget director, said the plan would bring the Pentagons budget to $603 billion in total, just 3 percent more than the $584 billion the agency spent in the most recent fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 30, 2016. The rise would be slightly higher than the countrys current 2.5 percent rate of inflation. President Trump intends to submit a defense budget that is a mere 3 percent above President (Barack) Obamas defense budget, which has left our military underfunded, undersized, and unready to confront threats to our national security, John McCain, the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a statement. The defense boost would be balanced by slashing the same amount from non-defense spending, including a large reduction in foreign aid, the White House budget official said. Trump does not have the final say on federal spending. His plan for the military is part of a budget proposal to Congress, which, although it is controlled by his fellow Republicans, will not necessarily follow his plans. Budget negotiations with lawmakers can take months.  McCain told reporters he would not vote for a budget with the slight military increase and thought it would face opposition in the Senate. Trump told state governors at the White House his budget plan included a historic increase in defense spending to rebuild the depleted military of the United States of America. He said his proposal was a landmark event and would send a message of American strength, security and resolve to other countries.  Officials familiar with Trumps budget blueprint said the plan would call for cuts to agencies including the State Department and the Environmental Protection Agency.       One official familiar with discussions over States budget said the agency could see spending cut by as much as 30 percent, which would force a major department restructuring and elimination of programs.  The United States spends about $50 billion annually on the State Department and foreign assistance. More than 120 retired U.S. generals and admirals urged Congress on Monday to fully fund U.S. diplomacy and foreign aid, saying such programs are critical to keeping America safe. Trump has vowed to spare middle-class social programs such as Social Security and Medicare from any cuts.  Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in the House of Representatives, said Trumps plan to slash funding for federal agencies to free up money for the Pentagon showed he was not putting American working families first. A $54 billion cut will do far-reaching and long-lasting damage to our ability to meet the needs of the American people and win the jobs of the future, Pelosi said. The president is surrendering Americas leadership in innovation, education, science and clean energy.  An official familiar with the proposal said Trumps request for the Pentagon included more money for shipbuilding, military aircraft and establishing a more robust presence in key international waterways and choke points such as the Strait of Hormuz and South China Sea. That could put Washington at odds with Iran and China. The United States already has the worlds most powerful fighting force and it spends far more than any other country on defense. About one-sixth of the federal budget goes to military spending. Trump has said previously he would expand the Army to 540,000 active-duty troops from its current 480,000, increase the Marine Corps to 36 battalions from 23   or as many as 10,000 more Marines  boost the Navy to 350 ships and submarines from 276, and raise the number of Air Force tactical aircraft to 1,200 from 1,100. He has not said where he would place the extra hardware and forces or made clear what they would be used for. The United States has been shutting some of its military bases in recent years.  Trump has also said he would bolster the development of missile defenses and cyber capabilities. Last week, he told Reuters the United States had fallen behind on nuclear weapon capacity.

State Councilor Yang Jiechi, Chinas top diplomat, met Trump briefly after talks with the new U.S. National Security adviser, H.R.

A senior U.S. administration official said discussions included bilateral cooperation and the possibility of arranging a meeting between Trump and Xi, but no date was set. The official said the meeting with Trump lasted five to seven minutes. White House spokesman Sean Spicer called it an opportunity to say hi to the president before Yang left.

Ensuring the steady and healthy development of China-U.S. ties will surely benefit both peoples and the world as a whole, the ministry paraphrased Yang as saying.

The U.S. Senate voted 72-27 to confirm the 79-year-old corporate turnaround experts nomination, with strong support from Democrats. Ross is set to become an influential voice in Trumps economic team after helping shape the presidents opposition to multilateral free trade deals such as the now-scrapped Trans-Pacific Partnership.  Ross drew votes from 19 Democrats and one independent, partly because of an endorsement from the United Steelworkers union for his efforts in restructuring bankrupt steel companies in the early 2000s, which saved numerous plants and thousands of jobs. Ross was criticized by some Democrats as another billionaire in a Trump Cabinet that says it is focused on the working class, and for being a vulture investor who has eliminated some jobs. Reuters reported last month that Rosss companies had shipped some 2,700 jobs overseas since 2004.   The investor will oversee a sprawling agency with nearly 44,000 employees responsible for combating the dumping of imports below cost into U.S. markets, collecting census and critical economic data, weather forecasting, fisheries management, promoting the United States to foreign investors and regulating the export of sensitive technologies. While commerce secretaries rarely take the spotlight in Washington, Ross is expected to play an outsize role in pursuing Trumps campaign pledge to slash U.S. trade deficits and bring manufacturing jobs back to America. Trump has designated Ross to lead the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada, a job that in past administrations would have been left to the U.S. Trade Representatives office. Ross will join other major players on the economic team, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Gary Cohn, director of the White House National Economic Council. Some experts said Ross could serve as a counterweight to advisers such as Peter Navarro, the University of California-Irvine economics professor who heads Trumps newly created White House National Trade Council. Navarro has advocated a controversial 45 percent across-the-board tariff on imports from China that Trump threatened during his campaign.        I expect that Ross will quickly become the administrations chief trade spokesman, and that Navarros influence will be felt indirectly, rather than through public statements or testimony, said Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow and trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. At his confirmation hearing, Ross downplayed chances of a trade war with China, while calling it the most protectionist large economy. He vowed to level the playing field for U.S. companies competing with Chinese imports and those trying to do business in Chinas highly restricted economy. Ross, estimated by Forbes to be worth $2.9 billion, built his fortune in the late 1990s and early 2000s by investing in distressed companies in steel, coal, textiles and auto parts, restructuring them and often benefiting from tariff protections put in place by the Commerce Department.

The secretary of the Treasury actually makes the decision and I expect him to do what all previous secretaries of the Treasury have done, at least all the ones that Im familiar with, to use those measures to extend that date, Mulvaney said in an interview on Fox News. But we will deal with it, he said, certainly before Congress recesses in August. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said at his Senate confirmation hearing last month that he would like to see an increase in the debt ceiling sooner rather than later to avoid another standoff with Congress that could upset financial markets. The United States is one of few nations in which the legislature must approve periodic increases in the legal limit on how much money the federal government can borrow. Rather than setting a specific dollar limit on the debt, Congress in 2015  simply suspended the ceiling until March 15, allowing normal borrowing to continue.   The debt ceiling will reset at the total debt level outstanding on that day, but Congress will need to approve a new debt ceiling or extension. As of Feb. 23, the federal debt stood at about $19.88 trillion, according to Treasury data.  But analysts estimate that Treasury can continue to borrow and avoid a payment default for several months past March 15 even with no action from Congress as it deploys its extraordinary cash management measures. In the past, the Treasury has been able to stave off depletion of its cash reserves with steps such as temporarily halting investments in some pension funds for federal workers and suspending sales of certain securities to state and local governments. Although such steps are known as extraordinary measures, they are routinely used by Treasury during debt ceiling debates.   In 2011, Standard & Poors downgraded the U.S. credit rating for the first time after a gridlocked Congress waited until the government was possibly within hours of defaulting on its debt to raise the ceiling.

Devin Nunes, Republican chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, also said there was no need for a special prosecutor and dismissed a suggestion that Trump should release his tax returns to clear up allegations he has business ties to Russia. What are we going to appoint a special prosecutor to do, exactly? he asked reporters. Nunes, who was a member of Trumps presidential transition team, said U.S. intelligence officials had not yet presented the committee with evidence of contacts between Trump campaign staff and Russian intelligence. Its been looked into and theres no evidence of anything there, Nunes told a news conference, called after a weekend report by the Washington Post that the Trump administration asked him and Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr to call journalists to knock down reports about possible collusion. The story fueled concerns about whether congressional committees led by Trumps fellow Republicans would conduct a serious investigation of the politically charged allegations. Nunes acknowledged that the White House had given him a reporters number, but said the administration had not asked him to knock down reports. He said his communications with news organizations was intended to promote transparency. Underscoring the partisan divide, Representative Adam Schiff, the intelligence committees top Democrat, told his own news conference later on Monday that a non-partisan investigation would be most effective, insisting it was too early to comment on any evidence. When you begin an investigation, you dont begin by stating what you believe to be the conclusion, he said. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said Nunes remarks raised serious questions about stonewalling. Potential contact between Trumps presidential campaign and Russia, and possible Russian attempts to influence the 2016 election on Trumps behalf, have prompted Democrats to demand a select committee or special prosecutor. Most of Trumps fellow Republicans in Congress have resisted such suggestions, prompting Democrats to contrast their approach with their multiple investigations of 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, including her use of a private email server. Republican Representative Darrell Issa broke with the party line by calling for an independent review. I want the Trump administration to be successful and that starts with embracing high standards for openness and transparency, he said in a statement. Schiff said he was not confident that James Comey, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, would provide investigators with all the information they would need. Comey, a Republican, drew furious criticism from Democrats for saying just before the election that he was looking at emails related to Clintons use of a private server. Nunes said he did not want U.S. citizens to be hauled before Congress because of news reports about their potential ties to Russia. We cant have McCarthyism back in this place, he said, alluding to the notorious 1950s Senate hearings into Americans potential ties to Communism.

In a report issued on Jan. 13, a week before President Donald Trump took office, the Justice Department said Chicago police routinely violated the civil rights of people. It cited excessive force, racially discriminatory conduct and a code of silence to thwart investigations into police misconduct. Chicago and federal officials signed an agreement in principle to create a court-enforced consent decree addressing the issues revealed by the probe when the report was released.

He added that Mattis would discuss the plan, which is primarily a written one with accompanying graphics, with members of the Cabinet-level Principals Committee. The review of U.S. strategy comes at a decisive moment in the U.S.-led coalition effort against Islamic State in both Iraq and Syria, and could lead to relaxing some of the former Obama administrations policy restrictions, like limits on troop numbers.

The U.S. military-led review includes input from Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, as well as from the Treasury Department and the U.S. intelligence community. Davis said that in addition to diplomacy, the plan would include a military framework that builds on capabilities and goals on the battlefield. Experts have said the Pentagon could request additional forces, beyond the less than 6,000 American troops now deployed to both Iraq and Syria, helping the U.S. military go farther and do more in the fight. They also said the Pentagon may focus on smaller-scale options like increasing the number of attack helicopters and air strikes as well as bringing in more artillery. The military may also seek more authority to make battlefield decisions. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Trump was not scheduled to appear at any of this weeks events, which were taking place at venues ranging from a park in the small town of Gravette, Arkansas, to the plaza outside the Georgia State Capitol building in downtown Atlanta. I just think we need to support our president, said Vivian Phillips, a 60-year-old retired schoolteacher who drove more than seven hours from her West Virginia home to Atlanta, where about 200 people gathered on an overcast day.  Phillips held a sign reading adorable deplorable from West Virginia, referring to a disparaging comment made by Democrat Hillary Clinton during the campaign about Trump supporters. In Denver, about 150 people met on the steps of the state capitol to voice their support for the president, sing patriotic songs and listen to speakers. Many waved American flags, and some held signs bearing Trumps campaign theme: Make America Great Again. One woman held a sign with a photograph of Hillary Clinton and the words: Get Over It. Im here to let the president know hes not alone although it seems like that at times, said Karen Eitzel, 56, a Denver Republican who was accompanied by her husband, Jack, a 62-year-old retired utility worker. In Brea, California, in traditionally conservative Orange County, about 60 people stood outside a shopping mall chanting Build the wall and God bless America, God bless Donald Trump and carrying sings that read Trump loves you and Trump all the way. Demonstrators marched wearing red hats with signs that read Donald Trump 45h President, and carrying flags and banners, some reading Make America Great Again. Passing motorists honked and cheered in support.  In Mandeville, Louisiana, outside New Orleans, almost 100 people, many dressed in the red, white and blue colors of the American flag, gathered at a pavilion to voice their support. The crowd, which included a Trump impersonator, carried signs such as We Love Trump and Support Our President. Some of the rally organizers came out of the Tea Party movement, a large, informal network of anti-establishment conservatives that has become an increasingly powerful force in Republican politics since its beginnings in 2009.  A group called Main Street Patriots said it helped organize so-called Spirit of America rallies in at least 33 of the 50 states, both on Monday and Saturday. Most of the rallies are scheduled for Saturday, when larger crowds are expected. Raucous rallies, often filling sports arenas, became a hallmark of Trumps presidential campaign, in contrast with lower-key events staged by Clinton. Earlier this month, Trump rekindled that energy for the first time since his election in a freewheeling rally in Melbourne, Florida.  But Trumps crowds have rarely regrouped since Novembers election, while large protests by people who oppose Trumps policies, particularly his crackdown on immigration, have become more frequent.

We must work together to save Americans from Obamacare  you people know that and everyone knows that - to create more competition and to bring down prices substantially, Trump told insurers at a meeting at the White House. The gathering took place a day before Trump was to deliver a major policy speech to the U.S. Congress. In attendance at the meeting were insurers who participate in the Obamacare health insurance exchanges as well as some that have pulled most or all of their Obamacare individual insurance offerings. The president needs insurers to participate in the individual insurance market to keep up competition and keep costs in check. The speech to Congress is a chance for Trump to elaborate on his healthcare policy, one of his top domestic priorities. Trump and Republicans have vowed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, former President Barack Obamas signature piece of domestic policy, but have not released details yet. Trump told the insurers that his changes would include expanded healthcare savings accounts, which are tax-free savings accounts typically used with high-deductible insurance plans, and the sale of health plans across state lines. He also said that he wanted states to have more flexibility but did not provide details. Trump previously discussed these ideas on the campaign trail. It is unclear how they would be implemented, or what changes he might make to Medicaid expansion, another key component of the Obamacare law. Trump told insurers, including UnitedHealth Group Inc, Anthem Inc and Aetna Inc, that he was directing Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price to work with them to ensure a smooth transition to the new plan. The administration recently granted the insurers one of their biggest requests and proposed a rule that would tighten eligibility verification for subsidized plans and allow them to seek unpaid premiums. Trump is also seeking support from the nations governors for changes. The Obamacare law, which extended health insurance to 20 million Americans, has been popular in many states, even those controlled by Republicans. But it has also been criticized for its steep premium increases. At a meeting with Trump and governors on Sunday, Price said he expected to have a new healthcare plan in three to four weeks, to which Trump responded he hoped to see a plan in two weeks, said Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe.  Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval said many conversations during this weekends meeting of the National Governors Association centered on Medicaid, the massive government health insurance program for the poor, and how to ensure those who received coverage under the Medicaid expansion could maintain coverage. Trump said on Monday that he wanted to win support from Democrats for the plan. McAuliffe, a Democrat, said it would be disastrous for Republicans to repeal Obamacare without a proper replacement. The political rhetoric of the campaign has hit the reality of governing, he said.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

(Reuters) - California legislative leaders on Monday demanded detailed information from the Trump administration on immigration arrests and raids in the most populous U.S. state, amid growing concern that agents are targeting non-criminals for deportation. Citing reports that agents for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, had gone to churches, schools and courthouses to find and arrest illegal immigrants, the legislature used the federal Freedom of Information Act to request all records of enforcement actions taken or planned since Republican Donald Trump was sworn in as president on Jan. 20. Despite saying hed only target dangerous criminals, President Trumps executive orders target practically every undocumented person in California, said Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Len, who signed the request along with Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon. ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.      California is home to nearly 3 million illegal immigrants among a total non-citizen population of 5.4 million, according to the legislature and the Public Policy Institute of California,  making the state a crucible for Trumps new get-tough immigration policies. Trump recently broadened the categories of people who could be targeted for immigration enforcement to anyone who had been charged with a crime, removing an Obama-era exception for people convicted of traffic misdemeanors. He has also proposed faster deportation for illegal immigrants who cannot show they have been in the country for more than two years. But Trump has also said agents are targeting dangerous criminals, not ordinary people, and that he will not take action against those protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, which protects young people brought to the United States as children. Earlier this month, immigration officers nationwide arrested more than 680 people in the country illegally in a broad enforcement action that alarmed many immigrant groups. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said on Feb. 13 that the operations, conducted in at least a dozen states, were routine. But immigrant rights advocates said the operations were more sweeping than those conducted during the administration of former Democratic President Barack Obama. Protests erupted in several states over the raids and other arrests. Among those arrested were an Arizona mother who was detained when she went in for a meeting with ICE, and a 23-year-old man detained near Seattle who held a work permit under DACA but who agents said had gang affiliations. In their letter, de Leon and Rendon said that 74 percent of Californias non-citizens live in households with citizens, meaning mass deportations could separate spouses from each other, or children from their parents. All of these parents and children are potentially at risk of separation at the hands of ICE, the lawmakers wrote. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Lester Packingham, a registered sex offender due to a statutory rape conviction, challenged the North Carolina law as a violation of his free speech rights under the U.S. Constitutions First Amendment. The court heard an hour of oral arguments in Packinghams appeal of his conviction for violating the statute in 2010 when he posted a message on Facebook expressing his surprise at a traffic citation being dismissed. Justice Elena Kagan mentioned Donald Trumps Twitter feed, which he used as a candidate and now as U.S. president, as an example of how social media has become vital in the political sphere. The president is speaking to the people through this medium, Kagan said. The case, which tested the social media smarts of the notoriously tech-averse justices, is the latest of several in recent years that have explored constitutional rights in the digital age. The North Carolina law, enacted in 2008, makes it a felony for people on the states sex offender registry to use online services that can lead to social interactions with minors.  Leading social media companies like Facebook and Twitter are covered by the law. Opponents of it have raised concerns that the law could be interpreted as covering other online activity in which users must create profiles and can interact with other users. That even could include certain news websites. Packingham was on North Carolinas sex offender list because of his 2002 conviction at age 21 on two counts of statutory rape of a 13-year-old girl. Kagan, the youngest of the justices at 56, appeared to speak for the social media generation as she repeatedly mentioned how central to life online interactions have become in recent years. Her questions indicated concerns that the law was written so broadly that it goes beyond the intended purpose of preventing contact between sex offenders and children. So whether its political community, whether its religious community, I mean, these sites have become embedded in our culture as ways to communicate and ways to exercise our constitutional rights, havent they? Kagan asked at one point. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the 83-year-old liberal and the oldest member of the court, appeared to share Kagans view. The point is that these people are being cut off from a very large part of the marketplace of ideas. And the First Amendment includes not only the right to speak, but the right to receive information, Ginsburg said. Justice Samuel Alito, a conservative who is 10 years older than Kagan, was more skeptical of peoples reliance on social media, saying they can get information from other sources as they did a decade ago. But Alito conceded: Now, I know there are people who think that life is not possible without Twitter and Facebook and these things, and that 2003 was the Dark Ages. The law does not require proof that the user intended to use a particular service for an illegal purpose. It also exempted chatrooms and photo-sharing sites, which Kagan seemed to find perplexing because that would be where what she called the most dangerous activity would take place. Packingham was convicted of violating the law after local police saw the Facebook post he wrote upon avoiding the traffic citation. Praise be to GOD. WOW! Thanks JESUS, he wrote. Some of the justices over the years have shown a lack of familiarity with cutting-edge technology even as they set legal rules on such issues as police surveillance and intellectual property protections worth billions of dollars. Last week, Justice Sonia Sotomayor referred to popular video-sharing website YouTube as the You Tube, prompting some amused reactions on Twitter.

The ban was blocked by federal courts, although the administration is working on a new order.  Farhadi chose two Iranian-Americans - a female engineer and a former NASA scientist - to represent him at the ceremony. Anousheh Ansari, an engineer who was the first female space tourist, read a statement on Farhadis behalf calling the travel ban inhumane.  Dividing the world into the us and our enemies categories creates fear, a deceitful justification for aggression and war, Ansari said, reading from Farhadis statement.  According to screenshots circulating on Twitter, the @USAdarFarsi account posted a message around 1 a.m. EST congratulating Farhadi on the award, which was Irans second Oscar victory. The tweet was then deleted, although it is unclear exactly when.  A congratulatory tweet was posted, a State Department spokeswoman said. We later removed the post to avoid any misperception that the USG (U.S. government) endorsed the comments made in the acceptance speech.  A second State Department official said the decision to delete the tweet was made within the department.  The @USAdarFarsi account, which launched in February 2011 and seeks to engage directly with Iranians, had previously tweeted messages about The Salesman, including on Jan. 24, when it noted its Academy Award nomination and sent best wishes to Farhadi.  That tweet, which is still online, was published days before Trump issued the travel ban that sparked Farhadis protest.  Farhadi also won an Oscar in 2012 in the same category for his film A Separation. In his acceptance speech that year, Farhadi referred to tensions at the time between Iran and the United States over Tehrans nuclear program, and said the Iranian people despise hostility and resentment.

Corrects second paragraph to past tense from present tense, corrects paragraph 5 to clarify ambassador spoke before event.) By Julia Harte WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Kuwaiti government could pay up to $60,000 to President Donald Trumps hotel in Washington for a party it held on Wednesday in an early test of Trumps promise to turn over profits from such events to the U.S. Treasury. The Kuwait Embassy hosted an event to mark their National Day. Similar National Day celebrations at the Trump International Hotel for a crowd of several hundred can run from $40,000 to $60,000, according to cost estimates from the hotel seen by Reuters. The hotel declined to comment on the figures. One of Trumps lawyers, Sheri Dillon, pledged at a Jan. 11 press conference to donate any Trump Hotel profits from foreign governments to the U.S. Treasury. The White House and Alan Garten, the general counsel for the Trump Organization, did not return calls for comment on whether any profits from foreign government payments to the hotel have been donated. Dillons firm declined to comment.  Kuwaiti Ambassador Salem al-Sabah told Reuters he was paying the Trump Hotel an amount similar to what he had paid the Four Seasons hotel to host a previous National Day event. He said on Wednesday before the event that he expected it to draw 500 or 600 people, but declined to disclose specific cost details. The Four Seasons, which declined to comment, also charges prices in the $40,000 to $60,000 range for such events, according to cost estimates seen by Reuters.  A watchdog group led by former ethics lawyers for the Obama and George W. Bush administrations sued Trump in federal court in January, accusing him of violating the Constitution by allowing foreign government payments to businesses he owns.  Some ethics lawyers say even if Trump turns over all of the profits from the Kuwait National Day party, he would still be in violation of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits government officials from accepting any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State. They say all of the income from the event, not just profits, would need to be donated to the U.S. Treasury to avoid contravening the constitutional ban. Trump resigned in February as an officer of Trump Old Post Office LLC, the company that operates the hotel, but Richard Painter, Bushs chief ethics lawyer, said the resignation made no difference as long as Trump retained an interest in it.   The ethics experts say Trump is still technically a recipient of payments to his hotels because he still has an ownership interest in them.  Dillon, Trumps lawyer, argued at the Jan. 11 press conference that payments to Trumps hotels do not violate the Constitution because paying for a hotel room is not a gift or a present and it has nothing to do with an office. She also said that a separate law banning federal employees from engaging in matters affecting their financial interests does not apply to the president. The head of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics agreed in public remarks in January but said it was consistent policy of the executive branch for the president to nevertheless avoid financial conflicts of interest.  The office declined to comment when asked by Reuters whether Trump would be contravening the Constitution if he did not turn over all hotel income from foreign governments. Four Democratic U.S. lawmakers asked the Government Accountability Office on Feb. 16 to assess whether Trump had made any payments to the Treasury resulting from profits at his hotels. GAO spokesman Chuck Young said the request was still being reviewed and the agency had not yet decided what to do about it. When the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee was asked on Feb. 23 whether it would be tracking payments from foreign governments to Trump Hotels, and from the hotels to the U.S. Treasury, a spokeswoman for the committee declined to comment.

The Denver-based Independence Institute sued the Federal Election Commission, arguing the law requiring such disclosure violated its free speech rights under the U.S. Constitutions First Amendment. The Supreme Court affirmed a lower courts ruling last year in favor of the commission. It was the latest in a decade-long series of cases brought by conservatives aiming to roll back federal campaign finance restrictions. The Independence Institute was supported in the case by influential Republican and conservative voices including Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the  Judicial Watch legal activist group as well as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce business group. The institute, ahead of the 2014 congressional elections, had sought to run a radio advertisement about increasing prison costs, telling listeners to urge their Colorado U.S. senators to support sentencing reform. Because the ad mentioned a senator by name in the lead up to an election, it triggered a provision in the 2002 campaign finance statute known as the McCain-Feingold law requiring the institute to file with the election commission and disclose any donors supporting the ad. The law was enacted to combat an explosion of what is known as soft money in campaigns through so-called sham issue advertisements, which cloaked partisan advocacy in discussions of public policy. Though the Supreme Court allowed unlimited campaign spending by corporations and unions in its landmark 2010 decision in the Citizens United v Federal Election Commission case, the court also upheld disclosure requirements for campaign ads. The Federal Election Commission said that for more than a century federal law has required organizations that influence elections to disclose information about their funding sources, a principle upheld in the Citizens United ruling. The Independence Institute sued in federal court in Washington in a bid to keep the names of its donors secret, arguing that its proposed ad focused on the sentencing reforms that senators were considering, not any senators re-election campaign.  Last October, a three-judge panel of the federal court ruled against the group, saying it would be impossible to distinguish genuine issue ads that reference candidates from campaign-style ads that openly promote or disparage a candidate.

An executive order signed by Trump on Jan. 25 aiming to toughen enforcement of U.S. immigration law rattled the European Union as it appeared to suggest Europeans would not be given the same privacy protections as U.S. citizens. The order directs U.S. agencies to exclude persons who are not United States citizens or lawful permanent residents from the protections of the Privacy Act regarding personally identifiable information. Securing equal treatment of EU citizens was key to agreeing the Umbrella Agreement which protects law enforcement data shared between the United States and the EU.  And the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield - which makes possible about $260 billion of trade in digital services - was only clinched after Washington agreed to protect the data from excessive surveillance and misuse by companies. In the first written confirmation since the executive order stoked uncertainty over transatlantic data flows, the U.S. Department of Justice said the executive order did not affect either the Umbrella Agreement or the Privacy Shield. Section 14 of the Executive Order does not affect the privacy rights extended by the Judicial Redress Act to Europeans. Nor does Section 14 affect the commitments the United States has made under the DPPA (Umbrella Agreement) or the Privacy Shield, Bruce Swartz, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, wrote to the European Commission in a letter seen by Reuters. EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova, who will travel to the United States at the end of March, said she was not worried but remained vigilant. The EU-U.S. Privacy Shield is used by almost 2,000 companies including Google (GOOGL.O), Facebook (FB.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) to store data about EU citizens on U.S. servers.

The vote will insert a major new voice into Trumps economic team, one that strongly influenced his criticism of the North American Free Trade Agreement and a now-scrapped Asia-Pacific trade deal. Ross nomination is scheduled for a vote on Monday at around 7 p.m. (0000 GMT). It was advanced by the Senate in a 66-31 procedural vote on Feb. 17, signaling solid support from Democrats. Part of that support stems from praise that Ross has drawn from the United Steelworkers union for his efforts in restructuring several bankrupt steel companies in the early 2000s, saving numerous plants and thousands of jobs. But he also has come under criticism from some left-wing groups as another billionaire in a Trump cabinet that claims to be focused on the working class, and for being a vulture investor who has eliminated jobs. Reuters reported last month that Rosss companies have shipped some 2,700 jobs overseas since 2004.   The 79-year-old investor will oversee a sprawling agency with nearly 44,000 employees responsible for combating the dumping of imports below cost into U.S. markets, collecting census and critical economic data, weather forecasting, fisheries management, promoting the United States to foreign investors and regulating the export of sensitive technologies. While Commerce secretaries rarely take the spotlight in Washington, Ross is expected to play an outsize role in pursuing Trumps campaign pledge to slash U.S. trade deficits and bring manufacturing jobs back to America. Trump has designated Ross to lead the renegotiation of NAFTA with Mexico and Canada, a job that in past administrations would have been left to the U.S. Trade Representatives office. Ross will join other major players on the economic team, including U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Gary Cohn, director of the White House National Economic Council. Some experts said Ross could serve as a counterweight to advisers such as Peter Navarro, the University of California-Irvine economics professor who heads Trumps newly created White House National Trade Council. Navarro has advocated a controversial 45 percent across-the-board tariff on imports from China that Trump threatened during his campaign.        I expect that Ross will quickly become the administrations chief trade spokesman, and that Navarros influence will be felt indirectly, rather than through public statements or testimony, said Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow and trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. At his confirmation hearing, Ross downplayed chances of a trade war with China, while calling it the most protectionist large economy. He vowed to level the playing field for U.S. companies competing with Chinese imports and those trying to do business in Chinas highly restricted economy. Ross, estimated by Forbes to be worth $2.9 billion, built his fortune in the late 1990s and early 2000s by investing in distressed companies in steel, coal, textiles and auto parts, restructuring them and often benefiting from tariff protections put in place by the Commerce Department.

One of the officials said Trumps request for the Pentagon included more money for shipbuilding, military aircraft and establishing a more robust presence in key international waterways and chokepoints such as the Strait of Hormuz and South China Sea. A second official said the State Departments budget could be cut by as much as 30 percent, which would force a major restructuring of the department and elimination of programs. The officials requested anonymity because the draft budget had not been made public yet.  Trump, in a speech to conservative activists on Friday, promised one of the greatest military buildups in American history. Some defense experts have questioned the need for a large increase in U.S. military spending, which already stands at roughly $600 billion annually. By contrast, the United States spends about $50 billion annually on the State Department and foreign assistance. The amounts that Trump is proposing to add to the Pentagon budget and trim elsewhere are not yet publicly known.  John Czwartacki, a spokesman for the White Houses Office of Management and Budget, said the budget blueprint would be released in mid-March. It would be premature for us to comment - or anyone to report - on the specifics of this internal discussion before its publication, he said in a statement. The budget plans that the White House is expected to send to departments and agencies on Monday are just one stage in a lengthy process. The agencies can argue for more funding, and final spending plans must be approved by the U.S. Congress. Trumps budget assumes annual economic growth of 2.4 percent, the second official said. While campaigning for the presidency last year, Trump called for a national goal of 4 percent economic growth. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, speaking on Fox News earlier on Sunday, said Trumps budget would not seek cuts in federal social programs such as Social Security and Medicare.

Since they now control the White House and Congress, Republicans are under pressure to fulfill their pledge to repeal and replace the Obamacare law although they have found no easy way to do it.  The law has proven popular in many states, even those controlled by Republicans, and it enabled millions of previously uninsured people to get affordable coverage, although steep premium increases angered some.   Trump is to talk about healthcare, among other topics, in a nationally televised address on Tuesday night to a joint session of Congress. Trump reiterated his pledge to repeal and replace the Obamacare law in remarks at a black-tie dinner for the National Governors Association. Were going to be speaking very specifically about a very complicated subject, Trump said. I think we have something that is really going to be excellent. Republicans have yet to agree on a single detailed policy proposal to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Some moderates want to revise the law and not abandon it entirely while conservatives want to repeal it completely. Still to be worked out are details including the future of Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor that was expanded in more than 30 states under Obamacare, and how a new healthcare law would be funded. Trump said he would be discuss healthcare on Monday when he meets some of the governors who are in Washington for the National Governors Associations annual meeting. Trump cast his first weeks in office in a positive light despite stumbles including an executive order aimed at banning people from seven Muslim-majority nations that was immediately embroiled in a court challenge. Weve made a lot of promises over the last two years, and many of those promises already are kept so weve very honored by that, he said. Trump turned the microphone over to Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat who chairs the governors association. McAuliffe is a long-time supporter of former President Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary, whom Trump defeated in the Nov. 8 presidential election. McAuliffe told Trump, We want to work with you on creating jobs and strong healthcare system. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Mnuchin said Trump would also use a major policy speech to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night to preview some elements of his sweeping plans to cut taxes for the middle class, simplify the tax system and make American companies more globally competitive with lower rates and changes to encourage U.S. manufacturing. Speaking on Fox News Channels Sunday Morning Futures program, Mnuchin, who has acknowledged that tax reform is his top policy priority, said the budget plan would not seek cuts to federal benefits programs known as entitlements. We are not touching those now. So dont expect to see that as part of this budget, OK, Mnuchin said of the programs, according to a transcript provided by Fox. We are very focused on other aspects and thats whats very important to us.And thats the presidents priority. Trump during his election campaign promised not to cut Social Security, Medicare healthcare for seniors nor Medicaid healthcare for the poor. Preservation of these programs, coupled with a middle-class tax cut, would aid the retirees and working class Americans who make up a significant portion of Trumps political base. In a transcript of the Fox News Channel interview, Mnuchin said Trump will be touching on tax reform in his speech. Mnuchin said the plan would cut the number of tax brackets and create a level playing field for U.S. companies to be able to compete in the world. But Wall Street, which has sent stocks to record highs on anticipation of Trumps tax cut plans, has grown impatient and could react negatively to a lack of substantive details about the plan in Trumps speech, financial analysts said.    With both chambers of the U.S. Congress in Republican hands, Trump has the potential to enact major elements of his legislative agenda.  But divisions with the Republican Party over the approach on Obamacare and taxes could prove to be an obstacle. Some Republican lawmakers have urged Trump to lay out more specifics on his policy plans, saying that more White House engagement is needed to build momentum in Congress for his agenda. Mnuchin offered little new information and said key tax plan  elements were not yet settled. He said Trump was looking at a reciprocal tax that would help create more trade parity with other countries. Trump administration officials have complained that many countries charge value-added taxes on imports while exempting exports from taxation. But Mnuchin again said he was still studying very carefully a House Republican border tax adjustment plan that would levy a 20 percent tax on imports to encourage more U.S.-based production and exports. That plan aims to raise more than $1 trillion in revenue over a decade to offset lower tax rates for businesses. There are certain aspects that the president likes about the concept of a border-adjusted tax, there are certain aspects that hes very concerned about, Mnuchin said.  He added that the Trump administration would work with the House of Representatives and Senate to craft a combined plan that takes the best of all of this when we bring it forward. In a comment suggesting that Trumps budget and tax plans may use aggressive revenue assumptions, Mnuchin said the administration fundamentally believes in dynamic scoring, a budget calculation method that assumes that a lower tax burden boosts revenues by encouraging economic activity. The Congressional Budget Office has previously used mainly static scoring methods that assume very conservative economic effects of tax and budget changes.

The guidelines, which were issued in September, call on automakers to voluntarily submit details of self-driving vehicle systems to regulators in a 15-point safety assessment and urge states to defer to the federal government on most vehicle regulations. Automakers have raised numerous concerns about the guidance, including that it requires them to turn over significant data, could delay testing by months and lead to states making the voluntary guidelines mandatory.      In November, major automakers urged the then-incoming Trump administration to re-evaluate the guidelines and some have called for significant changes. Automakers called on Congress earlier this month to make legislative changes to speed self-driving cars to U.S. roads. Chao, in her first major public remarks since taking office last month, told the National Governors Association: This administration is evaluating this guidance and will consult with you and other stakeholders as we update it and amend it, to ensure that it strikes the right balance. She said self-driving cars could dramatically improve safety. In 2015, 35,092 people died in U.S. traffic crashes, up 7 percent and the highest full-year increase since 1966. In the first nine months of 2016, fatalities were up 8 percent. Chao, noting research that 94 percent of traffic crashes were due to human error, said: Theres a lot at stake in getting this technology right. She said the Trump administration wanted to ensure it is a catalyst for safe, efficient technologies, not an impediment. In particular, I want to challenge Silicon Valley, Detroit, and all other auto industry hubs to step up and help educate a skeptical public about the benefits of automated technology.    Companies including Alphabet Incs self-driving car Waymo unit, General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co, Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL], Tesla Inc and other are aggressively pursuing automated vehicle technologies. Chao said she was very concerned about the potential impact of automated vehicles on employment. There are 3.5 million U.S. truck drivers alone and millions of others employed in driving-related occupations. She also said she would seek input from states as regulators develops rules on drones. We will ask for your input as the (Federal Aviation Administration) develops standards and regulations to ensure that drones can be safely integrated into our countrys airspace, she said.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a deputy White House press secretary, said congressional investigations into possible Russian hacking of Democratic groups would have to run their course before Sessions needed to decide whether to step aside from the FBI probes. Sessions was a top adviser to President Donald Trump, a Republican, during the 2016 presidential campaign.  I wasnt saying that he shouldnt recuse himself or that he should, Sanders told ABCs This Week. My point is I dont think were there yet. Lets work through this process. U.S. intelligence analysts have concluded that Russia tried to help Trump win the White House by discrediting Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and her party through cyber attacks. President Barack Obama, a Democrat, expelled Russian diplomats in retaliation in December.  Moscow has denied the accusations. The FBI is investigating alleged Russian election-related hacking and financial transactions by Russian people and companies believed to have links to associates of Trump, according to current and former government officials. Trump has dismissed the controversy about ties between his aides and Russia as a ruse perpetrated by a hostile news media. Russia talk is FAKE NEWS put out by the Dems, and played up by the media, in order to mask the big election defeat and the illegal leaks, Trump wrote on Twitter on Sunday. Trump fired his national security adviser, Michael Flynn, three weeks into the new administration after disclosures surfaced that Flynn had discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia with the Russian ambassador to the United States before Trump took office and misled Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations.  Democrats have been pushing for an independent investigation into whether there were links between the Trump campaign team and Russian officials.  The attorney general must recuse himself, House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said on ABC.  Republican lawmakers echoed the White House, saying the investigations must take their course. Senator Tom Cotton said it was premature to talk about a special prosecutor.

Sanders, who spoke a day after Democrats chose Tom Perez, a veteran of former President Barack Obamas administration, as their new party chairman, said it was also crucial for progressives to do more to mobilize grassroots supporters to take on Republican President Donald Trump.  We need a total transformation, the 75-year-old U.S.  senator from Vermont said on CNNs State of the Union.  We need to open up the party to working people, to young people and make it crystal clear that the Democratic Party is going to take on Wall Street, its going to take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry, its going to take on corporate America that is shutting down plants in this country and moving our jobs abroad, he added. Democrats are struggling to recover from an electoral rout in November in which they lost not only the White House, but both chambers of the U.S. Congress. Republicans won the governors office in 33 states, up from 31, and increased their dominance in state legislatures. The unexpectedly strong challenge from Sanders, a Democratic socialist, to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary laid bare the fissures within the party. Sanders calls to rein in big businesses echoed a campaign theme that energized his supporters during the Democratic primary. Sanders had backed U.S. Representative Keith Ellison, a liberal from Minnesota, to lead the Democrats but threw his support behind Perez after Saturdays vote. Perez promptly made Ellison his deputy after the election. Trump seized on the result to reprise a favorite phrase from the presidential campaign, calling the race for Democratic National Committee chairman totally rigged. Bernies guy, like Bernie himself, never had a chance. Clinton demanded Perez! he said in a Twitter post on Sunday. Perez, who was labor secretary under Obama, promised to rebuild the Democratic Party and redefine its mission from the grassroots up. Thats what we have to do as Democrats, help elect people in statehouses, presidency, local government and everywhere in between, Perez said on NBCs Meet the Press.  Democrats did not invest enough in their party infrastructure and grassroots organizing and ignored large swathes of rural America, Perez said in a round of television appearances. Trump swept those areas and the Rust Belt region in the Midwest with his talk of bringing jobs back to America and renegotiating the trade deals many blamed for their loss.

Members of the Democratic National Committee, the administrative and fundraising arm of the party, picked Perez on the second round of voting over U.S. Representative Keith Ellison, a liberal from Minnesota. Following one of the most crowded and competitive party leadership elections in decades, Perez faces a challenge in unifying and rejuvenating a party still reeling from the Nov. 8 loss of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. He immediately made Ellison his deputy. After losing the presidency and failing to recapture majorities in Congress, party leaders are anxious to channel the growing grassroots resistance to Trump into political support for Democrats at all levels of government across the country. We are suffering from a crisis of confidence, a crisis of relevance, Perez, a favorite of former Obama administration officials, told DNC members. He promised to lead the fight against Trump and change the DNCs culture to make it a more grassroots operation. Perez, the son of Dominican immigrants who was considered a potential running mate for Clinton, overcame a strong challenge from Ellison and prevailed on a 235-200 second-round vote. Ellison, who is the first Muslim elected to the U.S. Congress, was backed by liberal leader U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. The showdown between candidates backed by the establishment and progressive wings of the party echoed the bitter 2016 primary between Clinton and Sanders, a rift Democrats will try to put behind them as they turn their focus to fighting Trump. Those divisions persisted through the months-long race for chair, as many in the partys liberal wing were suspicious of Perezs ties to the establishment and some Democrats raised questions about possible anti-Semitism in Ellisons past. Some Ellison supporters chanted Not big money, party for the people after the result was announced. But both Perez and Ellison moved quickly to bring the rival factions together. At Perezs urging, the DNC suspended the rules after the vote and appointed Ellison the deputy chairman of the party. I am asking you to give everything youve got to support Chairman Perez, Ellison told DNC members after the vote. We dont have the luxury, folks, to walk out of this room divided. Perez said the party would come together. We are one family, and I know we will leave here united today, Perez said. A united Democratic Party is not only our best hope, it is Donald Trumps nightmare. Trump took a dig at Perez and Democrats in a tweet offering his congratulations on the election. I could not be happier for him, or for the Republican Party! Trump said. Perez and Ellison wore each others campaign buttons and stood shoulder-to-shoulder at a news conference after the vote. Perez said the two had talked for some time about teaming up, and Ellison said they had good synergy. We need to do more to collaborate with our partners in the progressive movement, Perez said, adding he and Ellison would look for ways to channel this incredible momentum in the protests against Trump and against Republican efforts to repeal President Barack Obamas healthcare plan. Sanders issued a statement congratulating Perez and urging changes at the DNC. It is imperative that Tom understands that the same-old, same-old is not working, Sanders said. We must open the doors of the party to working people and young people in a way that has never been done before. The election offered the DNC a fresh start after last years forced resignation of chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who stepped aside when the release of hacked emails appeared to show DNC officials trying to help Clinton defeat Sanders in the primaries. Both Perez and Ellison have pledged to focus on a bottom-up reconstruction of the party, which has lost hundreds of statehouse seats under Obama and faces an uphill task in trying to reclaim majorities in Congress in next years midterm elections. Perez said he would redefine the role of the DNC to make it work not just to elect Democrats to the White House but in races ranging from local school boards to the U.S. Senate, pledging to organize, organize, organize. I recognize I have a lot of work to do, he said. I will be out there listening and learning in the weeks ahead. Perez fell one vote short of the simple majority of 214.5 votes needed for election in the first round of voting, getting 213.5 votes to Ellisons 200. Also on the first ballot were four other candidates  Idaho Democratic Party Executive Director Sally Boynton Brown, election lawyer Peter Peckarsky, and activists Jehmu Greene and Sam Ronan.

I think there are some regulations that in the near-term need to be rolled back in a very aggressive way. And I think maybe next week you may be hearing about some of those, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt told the Conservative Political Action summit in Washington DC. Pruitt added the EPAs focus on combating climate change under former President Barack Obama had cost jobs and prevented economic growth, leading many Americans to want to see the EPA eliminated completely. I think its justified, he said. I think people across this country look at the EPA much like they look at the IRS. I hope to be able to change that.     Pruitt was confirmed as EPA head last week. His appointment triggered an uproar among Democratic lawmakers and environmental advocates worried that he will gut the agency and re-open the doors to heavy industrial pollution. He sued the EPA more than a dozen times as his states top attorney and has repeatedly cast doubt on the science of climate change.  But his rise to the head of the EPA has also cheered many Republicans and business interests that expect him to cut back red tape they believe has hampered the economy. Trump campaigned on a promise to slash regulation to revive the oil and gas drilling and coal mining industries. Pruitt mentioned three rules ushered in by Obama that could meet the chopping block early on: the Waters of the U.S. rule outlining waterways that have federal protections; the Clean Power Plan requiring states to cut carbon emissions; and the U.S. Methane rule limiting emissions from oil and gas installations on federal land. A Trump official told Reuters late Friday that the president was expected to sign a measure as early as Tuesday aimed at rescinding the Waters of the U.S. rule. Pruitt said in his comments to the CPAC summit that rule had made puddles and dry creek beds across this country subject to the jurisdiction of Washington DC. Thats going to change. He also suggested longer-term structural changes were in store at the EPA.  Long-term, asking the question on how that agency partners with the states and how that affects the budget and how it effects the structure is something to work on very diligently, Pruitt said. Like Trump, he said cutting regulation could be done in a way that does not harm water or air quality. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

(Reuters) - U.S. Senator Tim Scott faced a quandary on Saturday in hosting his town hall: he promised to meet with his South Carolina constituents, but he wanted to avoid the kind of adversarial free-for-all so many Republicans encountered this week. Scott decided to ban placards from his North Charlestown meeting in hopes of averting the raucousness that erupted at dozens of town halls during the first congressional recess of Donald Trumps month-old presidency. The senator also required the crowd submit questions in writing ahead of time after other Republican lawmakers faced a wave of anger on issues ranging from Trumps immigration and healthcare policies to the presidents ties to Russia.  Despite Scotts precautions, arguments broke out and constituents told one another to shut up, though many in the audience - mostly white and over the age of 50 - said the senator remained respectful and sincere. And it never degenerated into an all-out shouting match. Scott, the only African-American Republican in the U.S. Senate, began his town hall by pulling slips of paper from a box and reading the questions aloud. But the overflow audience of 300, evenly divided between Trump opponents and supporters, reacted with loud boos and cheers, even before he could begin to answer. To a question about a rise in hate crimes, Scott said the trend predates the presidents campaign.  We can blame Trump for a lot of things but I dont think we can blame him for this one, he said, following a pattern of distancing himself from Trump without directly criticizing him. Some people have come to the conclusion that this president has already failed, Scott said. I hope that most of us, whether you voted for him or not, hope that he succeeds. When asked about Trumps repeated denunciations of the media, Scott said he believed the press was more biased than in the past. Even so, he said, I do not believe the press is an enemy to the American people, a phrase coined by the president. Still, the meetings format started to break down almost from the outset, with the audience shouting asides, while others tried to silence them. Scott answered some of the comments, but if he was interrupted, he tried to talk over the offender. The confrontational tone of this weeks town halls is part of a tide of anti-Trump protests, marches and rallies that show little sign of abating just over a month into the new administration.  The anti-Trump energy has prompted talk of a liberal-style Tea Party movement, in reference to the protests in 2009 that helped reshape the Republican Party and arguably laid the groundwork for Trumps surprise electoral victory last year.    At Scotts town hall, the senator did allow a mother to stand up and tell her story. She said one of her two premature children died and the other was 6 years old with medical bills totaling more than $2 million, she said tearfully.  The Affordable Care Act is imperfect but it is a good law. It saved my family, she said to a standing ovation, referring to the health care program known as Obamacare. Thats a heartbreaking story, Scott said, pointing out that he chose ACA coverage for himself and his staff. Even so,    Obamacare is not sustainable. The session almost broke down when a man stood up and faced the crowd as audience members were peppering Scott with loud comments. Let the man answer the question, the man said on the senators behalf. Sit down and shut up.  Two men who wore red Make America Great Again hats clapped loudly. Arguments broke out in the crowd.  Eventually, Scott threatened to walk out. I know we prefer to blame Trump for our incivility, he said. Let me ask, if we want to continue this conversation, that we do so in a way that no one feels threatened. His admonitions appeared to work. Order was eventually restored, and Scott gave up on picking questions from the box and started calling on audience members if they raised their hands. The session ended on a relatively civil note.

Ronald Reagan was the last president to sit out the event after he was shot in 1981. Some news outlets such as Bloomberg News and the New Yorker have said they will not host the lavish after-parties that have been a fixture of past events.

Trump used remarks to the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), an organization that gave him one of his first platforms in his improbable journey to the U.S. presidency, to defend his unabashed America first policies. Ahead of a nationally televised speech to Congress on Tuesday, Trump outlined plans for strengthening the U.S. military, already the worlds most powerful fighting force, and other initiatives such as tax reform and regulatory rollback. He offered few specifics on any initiatives, including the budget request that is likely to face a harsh reality on Capitol Hill: At a time when he wants to slash taxes for Americans, funding a major military buildup without spending cuts elsewhere would add substantially to the U.S. budget deficit. Trump said he would aim to upgrade the military in both offensive and defensive capabilities, with a massive spending request to Congress that would make the countrys defense bigger and better and stronger than ever before. And, hopefully, well never have to use it, but nobody is going to mess with us. Nobody. It will be one of the greatest military buildups in American history, Trump said. Appealing to people on welfare to go to work and pledging to follow through on his vow to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border, Trump drew rounds of applause from the large gathering of conservatives, many of them wearing hats emblazoned with the presidents campaign slogan, Make America Great Again. His speech was heavy on the nationalist overtones from his campaign last year, focusing on promises to boost U.S. economic growth by retooling international trade deals, cracking down on immigration and boosting energy production. Trump is looking to put behind him a rocky first month in office. An executive order he signed aimed at banning U.S. entry by people from seven Muslim-majority countries became embroiled in the courts and he had to fire his national security adviser, Michael Flynn, for Russian contacts before Trump took office. With the federal budget still running a large deficit, Trump will have to fight to get higher military spending through Congress. In his speech, he complained about spending caps put in place on the defense budget dating back to 2011. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Trumps proposed budget for this year will be very clear on how to fund the military spending increase. Trump also heaped criticism on what he called purveyors of fake news, seeking to clarify a recent tweet in which he said some in the U.S. news media should be considered an enemy of the people. He said his main beef was the medias use of anonymous sources. They shouldnt be allowed to use sources unless they use somebodys name. Let their name be out there, Trump said. His comments came on the same day CNN reported that White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus asked FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe to deny a Feb. 14 report in the New York Times that said Trumps presidential campaign advisers had been in frequent contact with Russian intelligence officers. The request came after McCabe told him privately the report was wrong. A senior administration official said on Friday that FBI Director James Comey told Priebus later that the story was not accurate. Priebus asked if the Federal Bureau of Investigation could set the record straight, but Comey said the bureau could not comment, the official said. Trump has repeatedly chosen to make news media criticism a focus of his public remarks since taking office on Jan. 20. The speech allowed Trump to put his stamp firmly on the conservative political movement, even as some activists fretted that his immigration and trade policies go too far.  With Trump in the White House and Republicans holding majorities in both houses of Congress, CPAC and the thousands of conservative activists who flock to the event each year from across the country are seeing their political influence rising.

Trump signs an executive order aimed at repealing or simplifying federal regulations. Trump criticizes the FBI for failing to stop leaks of national security information to the media and directs the agency to find those who pass on classified information. Russian politicians close to the Kremlin say Trumps declared aim of putting the U.S. nuclear arsenal at the top of the pack risks starting a new Cold War-style arms race between Washington and Moscow. China dismisses renewed pressure from Trump over its role in North Korea, saying the crux of the matter is a dispute between Washington and Pyongyang. China says it has no intention of using currency devaluation to its advantage in trade, responding to Trumps description of China as the grand champions of currency manipulation. Mexico does not need U.S. financial aid, Interior Minister Miguel Angel Osorio Chong says, after Trump ordered a report on such assistance given by the United States to its southern neighbor over the last five years. ANTI-TRUMP MOVEMENT Raucous town hall meetings held by Republican Congress members are the latest outburst in a relentless series of rallies, marches and protests that shows no signs of abating more than 30 days into the Trump administration. Germany does not yet have a full picture of the approach Trumps administration is taking on foreign, security and trade policy but is keen to engage with Washington on these issues, a Foreign Ministry spokesman says.

The talks, between senior North Korean foreign ministry envoy Choe Son Hui and former U.S. officials, were scheduled to take place on March 1 and 2 in New York but were called off after Choe was denied a visa, the Journal said. It was not clear what led the State Department to deny the visa but North Koreas test-firing of a ballistic missile on Feb. 12 and the murder of North Korean leader Kim Jong Uns half brother in Malaysia may have played a role, the report said. South Korean and U.S. officials have said they believe North Korean agents assassinated Kim Jong Nam, the estranged half brother of Kim Jong Un, on Feb. 13. A U.S. State Department official denied so-called track two discussions had been scheduled. The U.S government had no plans to engage in track 2 talks in New York, the official said, declining comment on individual visa cases.

Choe, director general for North American affairs at the Norths foreign ministry, has previously met former U.s. officials and academics, the last time in November in Geneva for informal discussions.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - An emboldened Mexico hardened its opposition to President Donald Trump on Friday by saying it would retaliate if the United States imposed a border tax and that it can afford to lose financial aid that might be pulled to pay for a border wall. Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said Mexico could respond to any tax the United States were to unilaterally impose on imports from its southern neighbor to finance the wall with levies on select goods, aimed at U.S. regions most dependent on exports south of the border. Without a doubt, we have that possibility, and what we cannot do is remain with our arms crossed, Videgaray said in a radio interview. The Mexican government would have to respond. The statements by Videgaray and Interior Minister Miguel Angel Osorio Chong, who minimized the potential impact of the rumored loss of U.S. security aid, toughened the defiant tone from Mexico since President Enrique Pena Nieto last month canceled a trip to meet Trump over the wall dispute. Mexicans are angry at Trumps calls for U.S. firms not to invest south of the border, insults to immigrants and threats to make Mexico finance the border wall. The peso currency has weakened on concerns he will hurt Latin Americas No. 2 economy.  Pena Nieto had faced criticism he was too accommodating with Trump but got a much needed ratings boost after cancelling the summit. A plan to deport third-country nationals to Mexico fueled outrage this week. Mexican officials were publicly blunt with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Homeland Security John Kelly over Trumps immigration and trade proposals in a visit to Mexico on Thursday.  Osorio Chong told local radio that Mexican officials rejection of Trumps bid to send non-Mexican illegal migrants from the United States to Mexico was very clear. They asked us if (non-Mexican illegal immigrants) could be here while they are going through the legal process there. We said that there was...absolutely no way.  Videgaray said the trade strategy would replicate a 2009 campaign of retaliatory tariffs that helped Mexico win a dispute with the United States. On Wednesday, the minister mentioned Iowa, Texas and Wisconsin as states that could be targeted in a conversation with lawmakers leaked to two newspapers. This is not our preference, he said. Mexico believes in free trade. A U.S. executive order on Jan. 25 that mandated the construction of a border wall also required government agencies to report the financial assistance they gave Mexico in the past five years, leading to speculation Trump wants to redirect the aid to pay for its construction.  Osorio Chong said on Friday that Mexico had no need for such financial aid from the United States, signaling that it would not come close to paying for the estimated $21.6 billion cost of the wall.  Like in other middle-income emerging economies, many in Mexico consider it humiliating to take aid from wealthy countries. A large part of U.S. aid to Mexico comes through the Plan Merida program, under which the U.S. Congress allocated $2.6 billion to security assistance between 2008 and 2016.  Of that, $1.6 billion had been disbursed by November 2016, according to the U.S. Congressional Research Service. When they realize whats left of Merida, they will understand that its not even that significant, Osorio Chong told local radio. We dont object to them moving these resources... Mexico now has its own capabilities, he said. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency said on Friday it will accept proposals next month for the design of Trumps wall, a first step in picking vendors. Videgaray said a meeting of Tillerson, Kelly and Pena Nieto in Mexico City was a short courtesy visit.  He said in a more substantial meeting of the ministers, Kelly told him that deportations of undocumented immigrants from the United States would not be militarized, after Trump characterized the process as a military operation.

Reporters for CNN, The New York Times, Politico, The Los Angeles Times and BuzzFeed were not allowed into the session in the office of press secretary Sean Spicer. Spicers off-camera briefing, or gaggle, replaced the usual televised daily news briefing in the White House briefing room. He did not say why those particular news organizations were excluded, a decision which drew strong protests. Reuters was included in the session, along with about 10 other news organizations, including Bloomberg and CBS. President Donald Trump has regularly attacked the media and at a gathering of conservative activists on Friday he criticized  news organizations that he said provide fake news, calling them the enemy of the American people. Spicer said his team decided to have a gaggle in his office on Friday instead of a full briefing in the larger White House briefing room and argued that we dont need to do everything on camera every day.  Reporters at the Associated Press and Time magazine walked out of the briefing when hearing that others had been barred from the session.  Off-camera gaggles are not unusual. The White House often invites handpicked outlets in for briefings, typically for specific topics. But briefings and gaggles in the White House are usually open to all outlets and they are free to ask anything. A pool reporter from Hearst Newspapers was included in the gaggle on Friday and gave full details to the entire press corps. Media outlets allowed into the gaggle also shared their audio with others. Spicers decision drew a sharp response from some of the media outlets that were excluded. Nothing like this has ever happened at the White House in our long history of covering multiple administrations of different parties, Dean Baquet, executive editor of The New York Times, said in a statement.  We strongly protest the exclusion of The New York Times and the other news organizations. Free media access to a transparent government is obviously of crucial national interest. The White House Correspondents Association, or WHCA, also protested. The WHCA board is protesting strongly against how todays gaggle is being handled by the White House, said Jeff Mason, president of the association and a Reuters reporter. During the election campaign last year, Trumps team banned a few news organizations, including The Washington Post and BuzzFeed, from covering his campaign rallies for a period of time to protest their coverage. CNN posted a Twitter message on Friday afternoon saying: This is an unacceptable development by the Trump White House. Apparently this is how they retaliate when you report facts they dont like. Well keep reporting regardless. Ben Smith, editor-in-chief of BuzzFeed News, said in a statement: While we strongly object to the White Houses apparent attempt to punish news outlets whose coverage it does not like, we wont let these latest antics distract us from continuing to cover this administration fairly and aggressively. On Friday, Spicer said the White House plans to fight against what it says is unfair coverage. I think were going to aggressively push back, he said.  Were just not going to sit back and let false narratives, false stories, inaccurate facts get out there. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Trump is expected to direct the Environmental Protection Agency to withdraw the Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule, which expands the number of waterways that are federally protected under the Clean Water Act. The rule was finalized by the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in May 2015, and was blocked by a federal appeals court pending further court challenges. The rule has faced intense opposition from Republicans in Congress, farmers and energy companies. Critics contend the rule vastly expands the federal governments authority and could apply to ditches and small isolated bodies of water. The EPA under President Barack Obama said the rule protects waters that are next to rivers and lakes and their tributaries because science shows that they impact downstream waters. A White House spokeswoman did not comment on Friday. Trump is also expected to issue other environmental executive orders as early as next week, including a reversal of the Obama administrations clean power plant rule and instructing the Interior Departments Bureau of Land Management to lift a ban on new coal mining leases on federal lands. EPA administrator Scott Pruitt told The Wall Street Journal last week that he planned to quickly withdraw the clean power plant and WOTUS rules. Theres a very simple reason why this needs to happen: Because the courts have seriously called into question the legality of those rules, Pruitt told the newspaper. Withdrawing the water and power plant rules will take time to meet regulatory requirements and will likely face court challenges from some Democratic state attorneys general and environmental groups. Last month, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to resolve a dispute over what court should handle challenges of the water regulation. The justices said they would hear an appeal by the National Association of Manufacturers of a Cincinnati-based federal appeals courts ruling that gave itself jurisdiction to review challenges to the Clean Water Act regulation. The industry group wants challenges to the rule to be heard in district courts. Dozens of agricultural groups, states and municipalities had sued to block the rule. The challengers contend the agencies change improperly expanded federal regulatory power. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

In a document on the federal governments website for business opportunities, the CPB said it would release a request on or about March 6 asking companies for prototype ideas for a wall to be built near the U.S.-Mexican border. After reviewing the ideas submitted by vendors, the agency will evaluate and select the best designs by March 20, then issue a request for proposals by March 24 in which vendors would be asked to price out the cost of building the proposed wall. The document says multiple awards for the barrier are expected by mid-April as part of the process, an aggressive schedule for a government construction project. Its going to start soon. Way ahead of schedule, way ahead of schedule, Trump told the Conservative Political Action Conference on Friday. A spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the solicitation published on Friday had everything to do with the wall that Trump has proposed. The spokesman said the initial request for information was to give industry the opportunity to tell the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees CBP, what is possible in constructing a border wall. Once we get feedback from the vendors, well look at the ones that are most feasible, the spokesman said. That would be followed by the request for proposals to firm up exactly how much constructing the wall would cost. A U.S. Department of Homeland Security internal report seen by Reuters this month indicated the border wall would be a series of fences and walls that would cost as much as $21.6 billion to build and take more than three years to complete. The reports estimated price tag is much higher than a $12 billion figure cited by Trump in his campaign and estimates as high as $15 billion from Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The plan laid out what it would take to seal the border in three phases of construction of fences and walls covering just over 1,250 miles (2,000 km) by the end of 2020. With 654 miles (1,046 km) of the border already fortified, the new construction would extend almost the length of the entire border. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

I dont want to get into the wall, Kuczynski, a former Wall Street investment banker said in a video distributed by his office. Were interested in the free movement of people ... I emphasized that to President Trump and we prefer bridges to walls. Kuczynski has previously likened Trumps wall proposal to the Berlin Wall and once joked that he would cut off ties with the United States if Trump were elected president. Kuczynski later congratulated Trump on his surprise electoral victory and described their talk on Friday as cordial and constructive. Trump called Peru, a country of 30 million in South America, a fantastic neighbor and said it was an honor to have Kuczynski in the White House, according to video showing the two posing for pictures after the meeting. Kuczynski said the two leaders only briefly discussed Perus fugitive former President Alejandro Toledo, whom Peru had asked Trump to deport from the United States under a provision of migratory law that allows for deportations to preserve diplomatic ties. This is a matter of the judiciary that was not discussed for more than a few seconds, Kuczynski said of Toledo. Up until a week ago, Kuczynskis centrist government had seen deporting Toledo as a better alternative to a potentially lengthy process of Perus judiciary seeking his arrest and eventual extradition. Toledo is wanted in connection with a far-reaching graft probe and has denied prosecutors allegations that he took $20 million in bribes from Brazilian builder Odebrecht SA. In discussing migration, Kuczynski said he emphasized to Trump that only 70 Peruvians out of 1 million living in the United States are in jail, 200,000 of whom are there illegally.

Ambassador Dan Fried argued that since becoming a world power over a century ago, the United States had largely pursued an open, rules-based world, rejected spheres of influence where great powers bully their neighbors and contributed to the longest period of general peace in the West since Roman times. This track record suggests that an open, rules-based world, with a united West at its core, is an asset and great achievement, and a foundation for more, the former assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs said as he wrapped up a nearly 40-year career at the U.S. State Department. Yet, some argue that this is actually a liability, that values are a luxury, that in a Hobbesian or Darwinian world we should simply take our share, the largest possible, he added. The comment was an implicit rebuke to the America First approach in which Trump has pledged to end what he sees as decades of other nations freeloading on U.S. security and exploiting trade agreements harmful to U.S. workers. In his speech, Fried noted how improbable victory in the Cold War appeared in the 1980s and he hailed the freeing of swathes of Europe, including Poland, where he served as U.S. ambassador, from Soviet domination. This great achievement is now under assault by Russia, he said. It is for the present generation to defend and, when the time comes again, extend freedom in Europe. While Fried is a skeptic of Russian intentions, colleagues described him as a pragmatist who led efforts to work with Russia as a White House aide under Bill Clinton after the fall of the Berlin Wall and later when serving George W. Bush. He is the latest member of a generation of experienced hands who have left U.S. diplomatic ranks in recent months. Some, like Fried, have retired voluntarily, while others Trump chose not to retain. Many current and former U.S. officials are troubled by Trumps openness to closer ties with Russia, fearing this could lead to acquiescence in its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and, more broadly, in Russian domination of its other neighbors. Free trade advocates are also worried by Trumps decision to abandon the 12-nation Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal, his desire to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and his suggestion he could impose punitive tariffs. Fried argued against a winner-take-all attitude in which the great powers each try to carve up the world to their advantage. Spheres of influence ... would mean our acquiescence when great powers  starting with Russia and China  dominated their neighbors through force and fear, while creating closed economic empires, he said.  America would essentially retreat from whole areas of East Asia, Central Asia, and Eastern Europe. In what appeared another implicit criticism of the current  administration, whose efforts to clamp down on immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations and on refugee admissions have been stymied by the courts, Fried said:  We are not an ethno-state, with identity rooted in shared blood. The retiring diplomat also urged current officials to serve Trump and new Secretary of State Rex Tillerson with loyalty, dedication and courage. Help Secretary Tillerson. He deserves it. And he needs it. And help the president as well, putting your backs into it. Among those who spoke at the event were former Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken, who took a dig at how long it has taken Trump to fill State Department jobs, including his own.

Trump signed the directive in the Oval Office with chief executives of major U.S. corporations standing behind him including Dow Chemical Co DOW.N, Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) and U.S. Steel Corp (X.N).  The sweeping order directs every federal agency to establish a task force to ensure each has a team to research all regulations and take aim at those deemed burdensome to the U.S. economy and designate regulatory reform officers within 60 days and must report on the progress within 90 days. Excessive regulation is killing jobs, driving companies out of our country like never before, Trump said before signing the order. Every regulation should have to pass a simple test; does it make life better or safer for American workers or consumers? The effort is part of a Republican push to undo many of the actions of former President Barack Obama, who left office last month after two four-year terms.  In 1981, President Ronald Reagan created a presidential task force on regulatory relief but that effort did not establish task forces at the cabinet level. Other presidents including Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, carried out attempts to reduce or streamline government regulations. Trumps order requires agencies to measure and report progress in achieving the presidents directives. Each task force will make recommendations on which regulations to repeal or simplify, Trump said. The order says agencies should seek to repeal regulations that inhibit job creation, are ineffective, impose costs that exceed benefits or create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with regulatory initiatives and policies. Trump on Friday said the United States does not need 75 percent of the repetitive, horrible regulations that hurt companies, hurt jobs. The Republican has vowed a sweeping cut in U.S. regulations and previously ordered agencies to repeal two rules for every new one adopted.     Trumps chief strategist Steve Bannon told a gathering of conservatives on Thursday that deregulation, which he called the deconstruction of the administrative state, was a top priority for the administration.     Scott Slesinger, legislative director at the Natural Resources Defense Council environmental group, said this order is a directive to kill the safeguards Americans depend on for clean air, drinkable water and safe food.  The Trump administration says executive orders from the previous government cost hundreds of billions of dollars. The Obama administration said the benefits of those regulations to the public far outweighed the costs. The White House said the Obama administration finalized more than 3,000 regulations. Many of those were required by Congress. Robert Verchick, president of the Center for Progressive Reform, a think tank, criticized Trumps new order as clearly aimed at embedding his overtly political, anti-protections agenda at federal agencies that are supposed to be using science and expertise to safeguard us all. U.S. Chamber of Commerce senior vice president Neil Bradley praised the Trump administration for tackling the regulatory state head on.... We look forward to working with the federal agencies to help identify rules that harm the economy and threaten jobs.    The order Trump signed in January sets an annual cap on the cost of new regulations but does not apply to most financial reform rules introduced by the Obama administration. The Trump administration also ordered a freeze on regulations pending review and has stopped some regulations from taking effect. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - While President Donald Trump has suggested that the United States must expand its nuclear arsenal, many experts say U.S. nuclear forces are unrivaled and will remain so as they undergo a modernization program that could cost more than $1 trillion. In an interview with Reuters on Thursday, Trump said the United States has fallen behind on nuclear weapon capacity. He pledged to ensure that, Were going to be at the top of the pack.  While Moscow currently deploys 200 more strategic nuclear warheads than the United States does, both countries are bound by the 2010 New START treaty to slash their deployed strategic warheads to no more than 1,550 each by February 2018, the lowest level in decades. The accord also limits their deployed land- and submarine-based missiles and nuclear-capable bombers.         However, nuclear weapons experts say, the 30-year modernization program, which maintains many existing weapons and their computers, communications, electronics, and other systems, is more important than having as many warheads as Russia has. Trump says we cant fall behind. Fall behind who and how? said Stephen Schwartz, an independent nuclear weapons expert.  It is not clear to me, and its not clear to many of my colleagues what the president is talking about when he pledges to expand U.S. nuclear weapons capacity, Schwartz said. Moreover, the U.S. advantage is based not on the numbers of warheads it can field compared to Russia, but on more advanced delivery systems.     Most of Moscows nuclear force - now being modernized, as well - is comprised of land-based ICBMs whose locations it discloses to Washington under arms control accords, said Schwartz, former publisher of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists leading journal. The United States maintains an invulnerable fleet of nuclear-armed submarines beneath the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans that are immune from detection, he said. In contrast, Russias accident-prone missile submarines rarely conduct their deterrence patrols far from their docks.    In a fiscal 2012 report to Congress, the Pentagon assessed that even if Russia broke out of the limits imposed by the New START treaty and deployed more nuclear weapons, it could not gain strategic advantage over the United States. The Russian Federation, therefore, would not be able to achieve a militarily significant advantage by any plausible expansion of its strategic nuclear forces, even in a cheating or breakout scenario under the New START Treaty, the report said.   Trump clearly needs to get a briefing on the capacity of U.S. nuclear forces, said Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, a leading arms control organization. The 30-year U.S. modernization program is intended to maintain the American advantage. It upgrades and extends the lives of every U.S. nuclear weapons system  intercontinental ballistic missiles, long-range bombers and submarines  and their warheads. In addition, the Pentagon has drawn up plans to replace many systems with a new bomber, new ballistic missile submarine, and new missiles. Many lawmakers and experts are concerned about the price tag of the effort, given the high cost of repairing and modernizing the countrys conventional military forces and the budgetary demands of non-military programs. The costs of the modernization program  has been estimated at as much as $1 trillion over the next 30 years. But a report published this month by the Congressional Budget Office indicated that the overall cost is rising. Nuclear force plans set out by the Pentagon and the Energy Department  the caretaker of the U.S. nuclear arsenal  in their fiscal 2017 budget requests would cost an estimated $400 billion during only the 10-year period ending in fiscal 2026.

(Reuters) - The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People on Friday said it would not hold its convention in North Carolina and urged other organizations to boycott the state in protest of laws adopted by the Republican-led legislature. The civil rights groups described the move as the first step in an economic boycott that could be expanded in North Carolina and replicated in other states that enact laws limiting voting rights and protections for gay and transgender people. NAACP leaders asked artists, religious groups, educators and sports leagues to join the effort. If we demonstrate the power of the purse, then we will demonstrate the power of democracy, the NAACPs president and CEO, Cornell William Brooks, told reporters in Raleigh. Brooks did not provide a timeline for a wider boycott, but the organization said an internal task force would explore it. The NAACP said it was calling for the boycott in response to North Carolina laws such as House Bill 2, which bars transgender people from using government-operated bathrooms that match their gender identity and bans cities from setting a minimum wage above the state level. The organization said state lawmakers need to create fair election districts that do not dilute the black vote and repeal a new measure seen as weakening the executive powers of newly elected Democratic Governor Roy Cooper. What has happened in North Carolina makes this state one of the battlegrounds over the soul of America, said the Rev. William Barber II, president of the North Carolina NAACP chapter. Conventions, corporations and sports leagues including the National Basketball Association already relocated events or halted new jobs planned for North Carolina after lawmakers passed H.B. 2 last March, costing the state more than $560 million, according to the online magazine Facing South. So far, however, efforts to repeal the measure have failed.  Senate leader Phil Berger, a Republican, said Cooper should take a stance against the NAACPs boycott. Its time for him to show some leadership as North Carolinas governor, condemn William Barbers attempt to inflict economic harm on our citizens, and work toward a reasonable compromise that keeps men out of womens bathrooms, Berger said in a statement.

Bloomberg reported earlier on Friday that top executives from U.S. health insurers would attend a meeting, based on unnamed sources. The White House has not confirmed the Bloomberg report. Trump has pledged to repeal and replace Obamacare, former President Barack Obamas national healthcare law that redesigned the U.S. insurance market for individuals. It is not clear yet what Republicans will agree upon to replace the current insurance. Insurers say any new plans are not likely to hit the market before 2019. Insurers have also asked for changes to the individual insurance market that would go into effect for 2018 to make the market more attractive to the industry, where some plans have lost hundreds of millions of dollars because member costs were higher than they expected. The Trump administration proposed a rule last week to address some insurer concerns, but insurers would also like to see the elimination of an industry-wide tax on health insurance premiums - though the tax is on hiatus this year -  and a promise that the government will continue to provide cost-sharing subsidies to certain individual insurance members.  Since taking office on Jan. 20, Trump has held a series of White House meetings with executives from different sectors including those from manufacturing companies, pharmaceutical makers, technology businesses and car makers.

Jackie Evancho, 16, requested the meeting in a Twitter message late on Wednesday, minutes after the administration revoked landmark guidance to public schools to let transgender students use the bathrooms of their choice. I am obviously disappointed in the @POTUS decision to send the #transgender bathroom issue to the states to decide.  #sisterlove, she wrote from her account, @jackieevancho.  Trump gave me the honor of singing at the inauguration, she added in another tweet. Pls give me & my sis the honor 2 meet with u 2 talk #transgender rghts.  On Thursday evening former Olympic gold medalist and transgender activist Jenner also weighed in on social media, telling Trump on Twitter that from one Republican to another, this is a disaster and asking the president to call her. White House spokesman Sean Spicer, asked at a briefing if Trump would meet with Evancho, said the president would welcome a meeting with her. As of Thursday evening, more than 10,000 Twitter users had liked the request by Evancho, a classical crossover singer who rose to fame on the TV show Americas Got Talent.  Evancho was the first performer announced for Trumps inauguration ceremony, an event that a number of other entertainers shunned because of the presidents views.  Trump, a Twitter user, has not responded to the request, Evancho said on Thursday during an appearance with her sister, Juliet, on ABCs Good Morning America. I just want to enlighten him on what my sister - Ive seen her go through every single day in school, she said.  Juliet Evancho, a high school senior, said the president needed to know about the threats facing students who identify as a gender other than the one with which they were born. Ive had things thrown at me, she said. Ive had people say pretty horrible things, and the unsafe environment is just very unhealthy. The Evancho family is suing Juliets Pittsburgh-area school district over her right to use womens bathrooms.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation, the nations top law enforcement agency, did not answer a request for comment on Trumps remarks on Twitter.

The request came after McCabe told him privately the report was wrong. A senior administration official said on Friday that FBI Director James Comey also told Priebus later the story was not accurate. Priebus asked if the FBI could set the record straight, but Comey said the bureau could not comment. Priebus asked if he could say intelligence officials assured him the story was inaccurate, and Comey said he could, the official told reporters. The FBI is investigating Russian interference in the Nov. 8 U.S. election. FBI counterintelligence agents are also examining financial transactions by Russian individuals and companies who are believed to have links to Trump associates. There are investigations that are going on and those investigations must find out exactly what Russia was doing in the United States, Senator Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told CNN on Friday. We need a complete investigation and we certainly dont want the White House at all trying to influence that investigation. U.S. Representative John Conyers said any White House attempt to influence the FBI was deeply troubling.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Details of potential Obamacare replacements by U.S. House Republicans emerged in news reports on Friday, as Republican lawmakers have vowed to introduce new legislation in the coming weeks. Republicans have yet to agree on a single detailed policy proposal to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, the signature domestic policy of former Democratic President Barack Obama.  Still to be worked out are details including the future of Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor that was expanded in more than 30 states under Obamacare, and how a new healthcare law would be funded.  One emerging scenario among Republicans is that the millions of people who received health coverage through the expansion of Medicaid would be grandfathered in, according to the Washington Post. States that did not expand Medicaid could receive more money through increased federal disproportionate share payments used to help hospitals that serve a large number of uninsured patients.  And a draft Republican replacement plan for Obamacare, which news outlet Politico uploaded to its website, would cap the amount of money given to states for Medicaid and end tax subsidies based on income for the purchase of individual plans in 2020.  House staffers would not comment on the authenticity of the document, which was dated Feb. 10. President Donald Trump and Republicans have said they would present a plan for repealing and replacing Obamacare in the coming weeks.   It is not clear whether there is sufficiently broad support among Republican lawmakers for all of the measures in the draft proposal, or how the plans might change as they move through congressional committees.  The draft addresses the major issues and is a serious proposal for transitioning out of Obamacare, said Ed Haislmaier, a senior research fellow and healthcare policy expert at the Heritage Foundation who was on Trumps transition team.  Clearly the details will continue to evolve and well be watching as they do, he said in an emailed statement to Reuters. U.S. health insurance executives, many of whom have lost hundreds of millions of dollars on the Obamacare individual insurance markets, are due to meet with Trump on Monday, according to a Bloomberg report. A Blue Cross Blue Shield Association spokeswoman confirmed it was invited to the meeting and will attend. Republicans have repeatedly pledged not to pull the rug out from millions of Americans who gained access to healthcare under the law, and recent polls show more respondents favoring Obamacare than opposing it.  The Kaiser Family Foundation found broad bipartisan support for maintaining federal funding for the Medicaid expansion, with 84 percent of respondents saying it was important to do so, according to a survey released on Friday. The poll also found the law has record levels of support, with more Americans now viewing it favorably than unfavorably.  Obamacare has failed. We welcome any and all efforts to repeal and replace it that put patients first, said Caitlin Oakley, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Democrats decried the draft proposal on Friday and said it would cause millions of Americans to lose their health insurance.  The deeply harmful path House Republicans have laid out would spell disaster for families nationwide, U.S. Senator Patty Murray, a Washington state Democrat, said in a statement. President Trump, who promised families he would provide insurance for everyone, should be the first to oppose it. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. Department of Homeland Security plan to add more than 5,000 border enforcement agents will present logistical challenges and might be unnecessary, according to former government officials familiar with earlier pushes to accelerate border hiring. Three former top officials at U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) told Reuters in interviews that ramping up hiring at the agency, as outlined in a directive on Tuesday, would beexpensive, while rapid expansion poses the risk of corruption if screening protocols for recruits are relaxed.  The officials said the agency should get what it needs to secure the border, but they questioned whether such a major staff expansion was necessary, noting that apprehensions at the border have dropped.  Congress is going to be looking at this very carefully and looking for justification for this kind of money to make sure they dont write a check that is not necessary, said W.Ralph BashamwhoheadedU.S. Customs and Border Protection during the George W. Bush administration. The question will be do we need more agents or do we need money for technology and infrastructure, he said.  Additional enforcement officers are central to President Donald Trumps sweeping plan to crack down on illegal immigration, outlined in Jan. 25 executive orders on border security and interior enforcement. Tuesdays Homeland Security guidance for implementing those orders called for adding more than 5,000 border patrol agentsand 10,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE,officers, who enforce immigration laws in the countrys interior, among other duties. The White House and Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a question about the rationale behind the number of personnel requested. At the end of the day, the goal is to get control of the border and enhance the security of the country, said White House assistant press secretary Michael Short in an email.  The proposed hiring surge would be the largest since the Bush administration, when Congress funded an expansion of border enforcement following the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks. That effort doubled the number of border patrol agents from nearly 10,000 in 2001 to nearly 20,000 by 2008, according to CBP. The agency was required to meet tight time requirements for hiring, said Bashamwhowas appointed commissioner in 2006 The laser focus on quick hiring, and its cost, ended up sucking all the air out of other parts of the department, Basham recalled, leaving gaps for other spending needs. Basham said he supports CBP getting adequate resources and was encouraged that the new Department of Homeland Security guidelines did not mandate a deadline to complete the hiring. But he questioned the need for a renewed expansion of the force. More than 1.6 million migrants were apprehended trying to cross the U.S.-Mexico border illegally in 2000 compared to 400,000 last year, according to CBP statistics. Currently the flow is not really anywhere near where it was, Basham said.  Jim Wong, who was Deputy Assistant Commissioner of CBPs Office of Internal Affairs from 2009 to 2011, said money might be better spent on other department needs.   Throwing more human resources at the issue is not necessarily the best way to approach it, he said.      The union representingborder patrolagents, which backed Trump in the presidentialelection, has long supported adding personnel, saying more manpower is needed to secure the border, said union spokesman Shawn Moran. Homeland Security spokespeople declined to estimate how much the increased hiring would cost. The 2017 fiscal year budget request for staffing at current levels of more than 21,000 border patrol agents was about $3.8 billion for salary, overtime and benefits,or about $180,000 per officer on average, although officers with different levels of seniority earn different wages. Additional costs could include housingfor agents workingin remote areas,equipment and support staff, former officials said. In the last budget cycle, the agency requested funding for 300 fewer officers than the year before to instead invest in replacing aging radios and vehicles. CBP said the request reflected realistic agent hiring expectations. Gil Kerlikowske, who headed CBP for three years under President Barack Obama, said one risk of rapid hiring is quality control. When you speed up the process and dont take the requisite time you pay a price later in things like corruption, Kerlikowske said. During the Bush-era hiring surge, the Border Patrol had problems screening candidates, and internal corruption cases soon spiked, according to congressional testimony and government documents. Congress then passed the Anti-Border Corruption Act in 2010, which made polygraph testing mandatory for all border patrol agents. Since then, tests have revealed candidates who were compromised by drug cartels or were heavy drug users themselves. But the polygraph test and other controls have also slowed the hiring process. A 2012 GAO report found that between 2008 and 2012, only 40 percent of applicants passed their polygraph exams. In addition to polygraph tests, applicants now undergo a rigorous hiring process, including a cognitive exam, fingerprinting, financial disclosure, fitness tests, medical examinations and background checks, according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Kerlikowske said when he left the agency at the time of Trumps inauguration there were 1,200 authorized but unfilled openings for border patrol agents due to the difficulty of finding and vetting enough qualified candidates.

Rossello, who took office on Jan. 2, met with Mnuchin to discuss his efforts to put Puerto Ricos financial house in order, a statement from the governors office said. Rossello has signed more than 20 bills and executive orders aimed at cutting spending and fostering economic growth, but Puerto Rico faces a long haul out of an economic crisis characterized by a 45 percent poverty rate, near-insolvent public pensions and healthcare systems, and almost $70 billion in debt.  Under former President Barack Obama, the Treasury took a hands-on approach in Puerto Rico, working with federal lawmakers on legislation aimed at giving the U.S. territory a way to cut debt. President Donald Trump has given little indication of how his administration may handle Puerto Rico.  The islands finances are under the supervision of a federally appointed board. Rossello on Tuesday is scheduled to present the board with a 10-year blueprint for the islands fiscal turnaround.  The board has said the plan should find $4.5 billion a year in savings and revenue, including a 10 percent reduction in pension benefits and $1 billion in annual savings on healthcare spending. In an interview with Reuters on Thursday, Rossello said his plan will generally meet the boards criteria, with some exceptions, particularly on healthcare spending. A $1 billion reduction in healthcare would not only severely hamper the people of Puerto Rico, it would also cripple what is a healthy industry, the healthcare industry, Rossello said. Puerto Ricos Medicare system is on the brink of insolvency, in part because, as a U.S. territory, it receives proportionately less federal reimbursement than states. Rossello has said he will lobby the federal government to increase such funding, but the board has said the turnaround plan should not assume any funding changes or help from Washington.

Trumps remarks in an interview with Reuters late on Thursday appeared to contrast sharply with comments he made last month when he labeled the EU a vehicle for Germany, called Brexit a great thing and said more countries would follow Britain out of the bloc.  European diplomats were quick to credit Vice President Mike Pence with persuading his boss of the Unions merits after himself being convinced by top EU officials he met in Brussels at the start of the week. Officials said it was unclear, however, if Trumps policies would match the pro-EU language which Pence used on Monday or that of White House strategist Steve Bannon, whose scepticism about the bloc had been reflected in Trumps earlier comments. As Pence was preparing to fly to Europe to reassure allies that Trump backed the NATO defense pact and wanted cooperation, Bannon told Germanys ambassador last week that Washington would deal with individual states, but not the EU. In the Reuters interview, Trump delivered a conciliatory message. When asked if he supported the European Union as a governing body for the continent, he said: I do, sure ... The EU, Im totally in favor of it. I think its wonderful, if theyre happy. If theyre happy, Im in favor of it. Pence 1, Bannon 0 - at the end of the first quarter, one senior EU official said. These statements clearly, explicitly, go against what Bannon has been saying, said another.  We are starting to see traces of pragmatism in Washington, a third senior EU foreign policy official said. A senior diplomat spoke of the Union now seeing some return on the investment in laying out its concerns to Pence over the risk of reversing decades of active U.S. encouragement for Europe to pool its sovereignty and resources. But the question remained: Will Trump be saying the same thing tomorrow? Asked about Trumps new remarks, a Commission spokesman said only that the EU executive read them with interest.  On Monday, EU officials said they were reassured that Pence had understood a strong message from European Council President Donald Tusk and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, in separate meetings, that the EU as a bloc was good for the United States. Pence clearly understood something in the meeting, one EU official said of talks with Tusk, a former Polish prime minister who said that he spoke with unusual directness in the talks. At a news conference, Pence repeatedly name-checked the Union as a partner, in contrast to earlier statements on his European visit that focused only on U.S. cooperation with Europe. Tusk, jailed during Soviet-backed military rule in Poland, seized on Pence bringing up his own youthful travels to divided Cold War Berlin to remind him at the news conference of commitments made by an earlier Republican president, Ronald Reagan.  I think Pence was surprised by the strength of Tusks questions and anxiety, an EU official said of the earlier meeting between the two men. He said he would take the message back to Trump.

The winter meeting of the National Governors Association running through Monday is expected to showcase rare bipartisan agreement on the need for more federal help in upgrading roads, bridges and airports, said Scott Pattison, the groups executive director. Theres just this pent-up demand to deal with, whether its a crack in a dam, a bridge, whatever it is, Pattison said in a telephone interview. Although there is little movement on Capitol Hill to make Trumps infrastructure vow a reality, governors have sent the White House a list of 428 projects they say are ready to go with some extra federal spending. The National Governors Association has not released the list but checks with some states hinted at the projects. Democratic California Governor Jerry Brown has asked for $120 billion, saying that since the state made up 12 percent of the U.S. economy it deserves 12 percent of Trumps $1 trillion package. Were not talking about a few million, were talking about tens of billions, Brown said of the infrastructure proposal this month as he sought federal aid to deal with a leaking dam and flooding. Among Californias big-ticket items is construction of a high-speed rail system linking San Francisco and Los Angeles. Colorado and Minnesota want help building statewide broadband systems, with Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton, a Democrat, saying his state needs $150 million for its broadband grid. Republican Kansas Governor Sam Brownbacks top priority is $122 million for interstate highway repairs. South Carolina and Virginia want federal aid to deepen ports, among other projects. In a letter to Trump, Republican Governor Henry McMaster said South Carolina also needed help replacing roads and bridges. An appropriation of $5 billion from your infrastructure plan will help us bridge this economic gap, he wrote. Pattison said governors wanted a toolbox of financing options, including municipal bonds, cash, public-private partnerships and federal matching funds. The governors are scheduled to meet with Trump on Sunday evening and again on Monday morning. One of the speakers at the governors conference, Leo Hindery, a managing partner at New Yorks InterMedia Partners, will tell state executives that creating a federal infrastructure bank is the only way to fund the hundreds of billions of dollars needed for public works. The United States has long been criticized for its lagging public works spending. The American Society of Civil Engineers has graded U.S. infrastructure at D+ and estimated the country needs to invest $3.6 trillion by 2020. During his campaign, Trump said he wanted action on infrastructure in his first 100 days as president. That now seems unlikely. He also talked about creating a tax credit to encourage private sector investment. Trumps plans to create an infrastructure council have yet to get started.

I am generally comfortable with assessing civil monetary penalties in Foreign Corrupt Practices Act cases, Acting SEC Chairman Michael Piwowar said in remarks at the Practising Law Institutes SEC Speaks conference. According to academic literature, there is evidence that when such violations are revealed to the market, the stock price does not always fall, and may even increase, he added. Piwowars comments come at a time when many on Wall Street have been questioning whether the Justice Department and the SEC will ease enforcement of the FCPA. Prior to being elected, President Donald Trump expressed concern about the FCPA, calling it a horrible law that should be changed. In addition, Trumps pick to lead the SEC, attorney Jay Clayton, previously chaired a committee at the New York City Bar Association which drafted a paper that was somewhat critical of how the law was being enforced. Clayton is still awaiting U.S. Senate confirmation. Piwowars comments suggest there is likely to be some support among SEC commissioners to continue pursuing foreign bribery cases, given the impact FCPA disclosures have on share prices. Piwowar is well known for being critical about how the SEC decides when to assess corporate penalties generally, amid concerns that sizeable fines against public companies may in some cases unduly punish ordinary shareholders who are already victims of the alleged wrongdoing. He previously voted against imposing penalties against JPMorgan Chase & Co over its London Whale trades. The SEC did not win authority from Congress to seek penalties until 1990, and even then, the agency was slow to embrace the practice until after the major accounting scandals at companies like Enron and Worldcom. But in 2006, then-SEC Chair Chris Cox shifted gears amid concerns from some SEC officials about corporate penalties and issued guidance that spells out factors the commission should consider when determining whether to levy them. Piwowar said on Friday he closely follows those guidelines. It is entirely appropriate to discipline and punish corporate malefactors who violate our laws,  he said.  But the SEC must remember the innocent investors who are also victims, he added. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The central Peoples Bank of China did not respond to a request for comment. In a commentary, the official Xinhua news agency said criticising China for manipulating its currency to prop up trade was a major myth that has been circulating in Washington for quite a long time. Since July 2005, China has decided to unpeg the yuan against the U.S. dollar, and allow it to fluctuate against a basket of currencies so as to better reflect the market changes. Over the years, the renminbi has appreciated substantially against the dollar, it said. Trump has frequently accused China of keeping its currency artificially low against the dollar to make Chinese exports cheaper, stealing American manufacturing jobs. But he did not act on a campaign promise to declare China a currency manipulator on his first day in office. The yuan fell 6.6 percent against the dollar in 2016, its biggest annual drop since 1994, as it was pressured by worries about slowing Chinese growth and more recently by a resurgent dollar, which has spurred capital outflows from many emerging markets. Chinese authorities have taken numerous steps in recent months to curb capital flight to support the weakening yuan currency, while trying to bring in more foreign investment. Geng said there was no basis for the continued devaluation of the Chinese currency and he hoped the relevant side can fully and correctly view the renminbi exchange rate issue.  But Chinas foreign exchange regulator said this month the  economy still faced weak global demand and financial market volatility caused by expectations of further interest rate rises by the U.S. Federal Reserve.

Congress to impose curbs on visas for skilled workers that threaten the South Asian nations tech sector, which employs more than 3.5 million people. Speaking to Reuters, Trade Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said New Delhi had reached out to the administration of President Donald Trump to stress the importance of Indias $150-billion IT services industry to U.S. citizens.  Indias investments in the United States have provided jobs to U.S. citizens, she said in an interview. That has to be brought to the notice of the U.S. administration. The comments come days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged Washington to keep an open mind on admitting skilled Indian workers. Indian software companies such as Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd shot to prominence in the 1990s by helping Western firms stamp out the Y2K bug. Trumps America First rhetoric on jobs, however, has put their biggest market under threat.  A bill was introduced in the U.S. Congress last month to more than double the minimum salary of H-1B visa holders, which could significantly boost costs for IT companies, whose margins are already being squeezed. New Delhi has backed a move by NASSCOM, Indias high-tech industry association, to lobby U.S. lawmakers and companies to urge the administration not to crack down on allowing its skilled workers into the United States. A NASSCOM delegation is now in the United States to make its case to officials on Capitol Hill and in the White House.   We will have to engage with the new administration, Sitharaman said. Our engagement at every level is intact and continuing. The United States is Indias biggest trading partner, but trade in goods between the two countries has been stagnant, at around $67 billion, for the last three years. Indian software exports to the U.S. rose more than 10 percent, to $37 billion, in the last fiscal year from a year earlier. Indian nationals are by far the largest group of recipients of the 65,000 H-1B visas issued annually to new applicants under a cap mandated by Congress. More than 60 percent of the U.S. employees of Infosys hold H-1B visas. A global pact on services trade would go a long way towards settling disputes over professional visas, Sitharaman said.  If only there is a framework...you will know how movement can happen and how certain restrictions can or cannot come, she said. Its time for countries to sit together and look at it.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Thursday he wants to ensure the U.S. nuclear arsenal is at the top of the pack, saying the United States has fallen behind in its weapons capacity. In a Reuters interview, Trump also said China could solve the national security challenge posed by North Korea very easily if they want to, ratcheting up pressure on Beijing to exert more influence to rein in Pyongyangs increasingly bellicose actions. Trump also expressed support for the European Union as a governing body, saying Im totally in favor of it, and for the first time as president expressed a preference for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but said he would be satisfied with whatever makes the two sides happy. Trump also predicted his efforts to pressure NATO allies to pay more for their own defense and ease the burden on the U.S. budget would reap dividends. They owe a lot of money, he said. In his first comments about the U.S. nuclear arsenal since taking office on Jan. 20, Trump was asked about a December tweet in which he said the United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capacity until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes. Trump said in the interview he would like to see a world with no nuclear weapons but expressed concern that the United States has fallen behind on nuclear weapon capacity. I am the first one that would like to see ... nobody have nukes, but were never going to fall behind any country even if its a friendly country, were never going to fall behind on nuclear power.  It would be wonderful, a dream would be that no country would have nukes, but if countries are going to have nukes, were going to be at the top of the pack, Trump said. Russia has 7,000 warheads and the United States, 6,800, according to the Ploughshares Fund, an anti-nuclear group. Russia and the United States have far more weapons than is necessary to deter nuclear attack by the other or by another nuclear-armed country, said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the independent Arms Control Association non-profit group.  The new strategic arms limitation treaty, known as New START, between the United States and Russia requires that by February 5, 2018, both countries must limit their arsenals of strategic nuclear weapons to equal levels for 10 years. The treaty permits both countries to have no more than 800 deployed and non-deployed land-based intercontinental and submarine-launched ballistic missile launchers and heavy bombers equipped to carry nuclear weapons, and contains equal limits on other nuclear weapons. Analysts have questioned whether Trump wants to abrogate New START or would begin deploying other warheads. In the interview, Trump called New START a one-sided deal. Just another bad deal that the country made, whether its START, whether its the Iran deal ... Were going to start making good deals, he said. The United States is in the midst of a $1 trillion, 30-year modernization of its aging ballistic missile submarines, bombers and land-based missiles. Trump also complained that the Russian deployment of a ground-based cruise missile is in violation of a 1987 treaty that bans land-based American and Russian intermediate-range missiles. To me its a big deal, said Trump, who has held out the possibility of warmer U.S. relations with Russia. Asked if he would raise the issue with Putin, Trump said he would do so if and when we meet. He said he had no meetings scheduled as of yet with Putin. Speaking from behind his desk in the Oval Office, Trump  expressed concern about North Koreas ballistic missile tests and said accelerating a missile defense system for U.S. allies Japan and South Korea was among many options available. Theres talks of a lot more than that, Trump said, when asked about the missile defense system. Well see what happens. But its a very dangerous situation, and China can end it very quickly in my opinion. China has made clear that it opposes North Koreas nuclear and missile programs and has repeatedly called for denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and a return to negotiations between Pyongyang and world powers. But efforts to change Pyongyangs behavior through sanctions have historically failed, largely because of Chinas fear that severe measures could trigger a collapse of the North Korean state and send refugees streaming across their border. Trumps meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe earlier this month in Florida was interrupted by a ballistic missile launch by North Korea. Trump did not completely rule out possibly meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at some point in the future under certain circumstances but suggested it might be too late. Its very late. Were very angry at what hes done, and frankly this should have been taken care of during the Obama administration, he said. According to Japanese news reports, the Japanese government plans to start debate over the deployment of a U.S. missile defense system known as the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, and the land-based Aegis Ashore missile defense system to improve its capability to counter North Korean ballistic     missiles. The strength of Trumps remarks in favor of the EU took some Brussels officials by surprise after his support for Britains vote last summer to exit from the EU. Im totally in favor of it, Trump said of the EU. I think its wonderful. If theyre happy, Im in favor of it. Statements by him and others in his administration have suggested to Europeans that he sees little value in the Union as such, which Trump last month called a vehicle for Germany.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday spoke positively about a border adjustment tax being pushed by Republicans in Congress as a way to boost exports, but he did not specifically endorse the proposal. Trump, who has lashed out at U.S. companies for moving operations and jobs to countries such as Mexico, had previously sent mixed signals on the proposal at the heart of a sweeping Republican plan to overhaul the tax code. It could lead to a lot more jobs in the United States, Trump told Reuters in an interview, using his most approving language to date on the proposal. Trump sent conflicting signals about his position on the border adjustment tax in separate media interviews in January, saying in one interview that it was too complicated and in another that it was still on the table. The proposal has divided American businesses. Critics say the planned 20 percent tax on imports could be passed along in higher prices to consumers, including manufacturers that rely on imported goods to make their products. Some critics have warned of a potential global trade war which would sharply curtail U.S. and world economic growth. Advocates say U.S. exporters will gain as their revenues will be excluded from federal taxes. They say the tax on imports will encourage domestic production and cause the already strong dollar to rise, offsetting upward pressure on import prices. Trump has also called for a 35-percent border tax on U.S. companies that move jobs abroad and import products back into the U.S. market. It has been unclear in the past if those references referred to the border adjustment proposal. I certainly support a form of tax on the border, he told Reuters on Thursday. What is going to happen is companies are going to come back here, theyre going to build their factories and theyre going to create a lot of jobs and theres no tax. White House spokesman Sean Spicer also came to the defense of border adjustment on Thursday, disputing the claim that it could lead to higher consumer prices. That benefits our economy, it helps American workers, it grows the manufacturing base, Spicer told reporters at a White House briefing.         The Mexican peso MXN= weakened slightly against the U.S. dollar immediately after Trump's comments and was last trading at 19.68 per dollar. Earlier on Thursday, the Mexican currency hit its strongest level since Trump's Nov. 8 election victory. Stocks of retailers, which could be hurt by border adjustment, weakened on Wall Street after Trumps remarks. The S&P 500 retailing index .SPXRT ended down 1 percent. Shares of Wal-Mart Stores (WMT.N) slipped and closed down 0.6 percent. Trump said his administration will tackle tax reform legislation after dealing with Obamacare, the health insurance system that his fellow Republicans have bashed since it was put in place in 2010 by his predecessor, President Barack Obama. Earlier on Thursday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC the Trump administration aimed to formulate a tax plan with support from the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and Senate and pass it before August. Lawmakers and corporate lobbyists say the border adjustment tax could die in Congress, potentially jeopardizing the prospects for tax reform, mainly because of opposition from a handful of Senate Republicans.  But experts say Trumps endorsement could change the political climate. If Trump supports it, that makes it considerably more likely, Harvard Business School professor Mihir Desai told Reuters. Trumps comments were followed by dueling statements from lobbying groups.  A statement from the pro-border adjustment American Made Coalition said the White House was sending its strongest signals yet that its leaning toward supporting the House blueprint with border adjustability.  The Americans for Affordable Products coalition that opposes the border adjustment tax issued a statement saying Trumps remarks were consistent with what hes already said and that it was impossible to know if they were specific to any individual legislative policy.  Trump spoke to Reuters after meeting with more than 20 chief executives of major U.S. companies to discuss ways to return manufacturing jobs to the United States, one of the linchpins of his 2016 presidential campaign. Many CEOs of large multinationals back the border adjustment tax. The chiefs of 16 companies, including Boeing Co (BA.N), Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) and General Electric Co (GE.N), sent a letter to Congress on Tuesday urging support for it. A border adjustment has emerged as the most controversial segment of the House Republican tax reform blueprint. Under the House plan, it would raise more than $1 trillion in revenues to help pay for a corporate tax cut. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

In an exclusive interview with Reuters, Trump said he has not held back in his assessment that China manipulates its yuan currency, despite not acting on a campaign promise to declare it a currency manipulator on his first day in office. Well they, I think theyre grand champions at manipulation of currency. So I havent held back, Trump said. Well see what happens. During his presidential campaign Trump frequently accused China of keeping its currency artificially low against the dollar to make Chinese exports cheaper, stealing American manufacturing jobs. But Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin told CNBC on Thursday he was not ready to pass judgment on Chinas currency practices. Asked if the U.S. Treasury was planning to name China a currency manipulator any time soon, Mnuchin said he would follow its normal process of analyzing the currency practices of major U.S. trading partners. The Treasury is required to publish a report on these practices on April 15 and Oct. 15 each year.   We have a process within Treasury where we go through and look at currency manipulation across the board. Well go through that process. Well do that as we have in the past, Mnuchin said in his first televised interview since formally taking over the department last week. Were not making any judgments until we go continue that process. A formal declaration that China or any other country manipulates its currency requires the U.S. Treasury to seek negotiations to resolve the situation, a process that could end in punitive tariffs on the offenders goods. The U.S. Treasury designated Taiwan and South Korea as currency manipulators in 1988, the year that Congress enacted the currency review law. China was the last country to get the designation, in 1994.  The current situation is complicated because Chinas central bank has spent billions of dollars in foreign exchange reserves in the past year to prop up the yuan to counter capital outflows. The International Monetary Fund said last year that the yuans value was broadly in line with its economic fundamentals. The U.S. Treasury also said in its last currency report in October that its view of Chinas external imbalances had improved somewhat. Trumps pronouncements about the yuan could also complicate matters for Mnuchin as he prepares for his first meeting next month with his Group of 20 finance minister counterparts in Baden Baden, Germany.

So were going to start making good deals. ON RUSSIAS DEPLOYMENT OF A CRUISE MISSILE IN VIOLATION OF ARMS CONTROL TREATY  To me, its a big deal ... If I meet (Putin), if and when we meet, I would bring it up. Its a big deal. Because its a violation of an agreement that we have. I know exactly whats going on between China and North Korea and everybody else. But I dont like talking about military strategy in newspapers ... Im not liking it. This didnt take place under the Trump administration, this took place under the Obama administration. Many things took place that should not have been allowed. One of them is the building of a massive, you know, massive military complex in the middle of the South China Sea. And dont forget Ive only been here for four weeks. This is something that took place and has been started three years ago and you were in a much better negotiating position three years ago. I am not happy about it. I think theyre grand champions at manipulation of currency. So I havent held back. Well see what happens. Well, we appreciate that. You know, I have a very, very good, Ive had very good phone calls with the president, President Xi, and Ive had very, very good talks with him, and the call is a start. But we have a very big problem and a very dangerous problem for the world with North Korea. ... I think China has tremendous control over North Korea. Whether they say so or not is up to them, but they have tremendous control over North Korea. I think they could solve the problem very easily if they want to. Its very dangerous and something should have been done about it years ago. Its very dangerous and very unacceptable. ... And very unfair to Japan. ON TALK OF ACCELERATING MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM FOR JAPAN AND SOUTH KOREA Theres talks of a lot more than that. Well see what happens. But its a very dangerous situation, and China can end it very quickly in my opinion. ... Its one of many things that can be done. Missile defense is one of many things that can be done. ON WHETHER MEETING WITH KOREAN LEADER KIM JONG UN IS A POSSIBILITY I guess ... I would never say no. It may be very late. Its very late in the picture right now. ... Were very angry at what hes done, and frankly this should have been taken care of during the Obama administration. ON THE BORDER ADJUSTMENT TAX PROMOTED BY REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS It could lead to a lot more jobs in the United States. ... I certainly support a form of tax on the border because everybody else does. Were the only country, were one of the very few countries, possibly the only country, that has no border tax. And thats not a tax to the consumer, because thats going to be a tax to companies and its going to be a tax to other countries much more so than it is to the consumer. Thats a tax to other countries. And what will happen is, dont forget there is no tax if we make our product in the United States. So I dont consider it a tax. Thats a tax if companies are buying their product outside of the United States. But ... if they make their product in the United States, there is no tax. So what is going to happen is companies are going to come back here, theyre going to build their factories and theyre going to create a lot of jobs and theres no tax. Were going to have a corporate tax cut ... anywhere from 15 to 20 percent (as a target for the corporate tax rate). ... Were going to have other things that are very good and were going to have a tremendous regulatory cut because the regulations are piled up on top of each other and youll have many regulations for the same thing within different industries and its out of control. The regulations in this country are out of control. And it makes it hard for businesses to even open in the United States. Were going to get rid of a lot of the unnecessary regulations. Were going to submit legislation. Were going to be working with Congress to do legislation, yes. .... Were mandated to do the healthcare first. We have to. And thats for budgetary reasons. So the healthcare will come first. Its moving along really well. I would say before the middle of March. ... We have a very, very good healthcare plan which will give great healthcare to great numbers of people. We have to also remember, Obamacare is a disaster. It doesnt work. It just doesnt work. So we have a plan that will be a far better plan which will cost people less money, which will cost our country less money also cause Obamacare is very expensive for the country. And we will be submitting sometime during the month of March. ... Itd be repeal and replace. ... The tax reform comes immediately thereafter. The economy, we have close to 100 million people that are not working. Were going to get the economy revving again through meetings like I had today with the biggest companies in the world and the biggest manufacturers in the world, through tax reform, and through regulatory reform, and it will take a little period of time, but yeah, were going to have, I mean, we had massive deficits under Obama, under President Obama, massive deficits, and until it gets kicked in, therell be some deficits but something which we can very easily handle. We have a $70 billion trade deficit with Mexico, which is unacceptable. Unacceptable. On top of the $70 billion, many of our jobs and companies have fled to Mexico, and that, and they sell their product back in the United States. Its just not acceptable. So, hopefully, well be able to work something out with Mexico, well see. Maybe we will, maybe we wont. ... We have the right to do a lot of things that I havent done yet. We have a lot of rights that people dont know about and they never did know about until I came along. ON THE TWO-STATE SOLUTION IN ISRAEL I like the concept of the two-state solution. People have been talking about it for so many years now, it so far hasnt worked. But I am satisfied with whatever makes both parties happy. I do, sure. I have very good relations with the EU. But I thought that the UK would pull out of Brexit and I was right. ...  But the EU, Im totally in favor of it. I think its wonderful, if theyre happy. If theyre happy  Im in favor of it.

I said two things: Its obsolete because it doesnt cover terrorism. They have now opened up a division to cover terrorism, solely because of me.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""BRANCHBURG, N.J./VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (Reuters) - U.S. Representative Leonard Lance, who has held more than 40 town hall-style meetings with constituents in his central New Jersey district, has never faced a crowd like he did on Wednesday. The Republican endured catcalls, chants and caustic questions from more than 1,000 residents at a local college, while hundreds of others outside brandished signs with messages like Resist Trump. Parallel scenes have played out across the country this week during the first congressional recess since Donald Trump became president. Republican lawmakers returning home confronted a wave of anger over a spectrum of issues, including immigration, healthcare and Trumps possible ties to Russia. The raucous meetings are the latest in a relentless series of rallies, marches and protests that shows no signs of abating more than 30 days into the new administration. The anti-Trump energy has prompted talk of a liberal-style Tea Party movement, in reference to the protests in 2009 that helped reshape the Republican Party and arguably laid the groundwork for Trumps surprise electoral victory last year. Some of the lessons to draw from that are persistence, repetition, not taking no for an answer, said Victoria Kaplan, the organizing director for the grassroots progressive group MoveOn. Since the day after Trumps inauguration, when millions of protesters joined womens marches worldwide, left-wing organizers have sought to harness that anger to fuel a lasting political campaign. Hundreds of progressive groups have sprung up across the country - some affiliated with national organizations like Indivisible or MoveOn - to help coordinate. At town halls in New Jersey and Virginia this week, constituents came armed with red disagree signs they held aloft to register their disapproval of what they heard from their representatives.  Some U.S. senators, such as Pat Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, have faced weekly protests outside their offices, and a Pennsylvania healthcare network set up a town hall this week with an empty suit in place of Toomey, who declined to attend. More marches are scheduled across the country in the coming months, including several major events in Washington, tied to gay rights, science and a push for Trump to release his tax returns. The sheer volume of protests - last week, there were three nationwide calls for action within a five-day span - has some political observers wondering how long it can last. But several experts who study protests said the level of outrage may be increasing, rather than subsiding, after a tumultuous first month in which Trumps words and actions created fresh outrage among liberals almost daily. Were not anywhere near reaching a saturation point for protest, said Michael Heaney, the author of Party in the Street: The Antiwar Movement and the Democratic Party after 9/11 and a University of Michigan professor. If anything, its just getting started. The key for organizers is to convert large-scale protests into sustained action by building databases of names and encouraging locally based events, experts said. You cant just have the diehards, said Dana R. Fisher, a University of Maryland professor who studies collective action. And then you need to channel them into new types of activism. When Fisher surveyed participants at the womens march in Washington, she found one-third were attending their first protest - the highest percentage she has ever observed. This is unprecedented, she said. But theres nothing thats not unprecedented about the Trump presidency. Some Republicans have dismissed the protests as manufactured. Trump on Tuesday tweeted that so-called angry crowds in Republicans districts were planned out by liberal activists. But Kaplan of MoveOn said the vast majority of actions were organic. A weekly conference call the group hosts to discuss the movement has attracted a bigger number of participants each week, with 46,000 people joining the latest discussion. We are firing on all cylinders to catch up with grassroots protests, she said. That is a demonstration of energy and sustainability. Experts also said social media has made it far easier to organize mass protests quickly and efficiently. In what Kaplan said was a sign the protests are having an impact, many Republicans have eschewed town halls this week to avoid confrontations. There were fewer than 100 in-person Republican town halls scheduled for the first two months of the year, compared with more than 200 in the same period in 2015, according to a Vice report. In Louisiana on Wednesday, residents shouted down Republican Senator Bill Cassidy as he tried to explain his healthcare proposal. Scott Taylor, a freshman Republican representative in Virginia, sparred with hundreds of impassioned constituents on Monday at his own event. Like Lance, whose district voted for Hillary Clinton over Trump, Taylor is already a midterm target for Democrats. Taylor said in an interview after the town hall that he recognized many of the attendees from the local Democratic Party. Its not like theyre just some new organic people who just came about and are concerned, Taylor said.  But not everyone was a Democrat. Austin Phillips, a 22-year-old Trump voter, told Taylor at the town hall he was worried about losing healthcare coverage if Obamacare is repealed. Trump has talked about wanting to repeal it, Phillips, who is self-employed and purchased insurance through an exchange created by the law, said in a later interview. If they quickly repeal it with no replacement lined up, then theoretically everybody would lose their insurance. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Their statements evoked the opposition expressed by many businesses last year when the state of North Carolina passed a law that forces transgender people to use public restrooms matching their gender assigned at birth. The resulting boycotts have cost North Carolina more than $560 million in economic activity, according to the online magazine Facing South. Companies lacked the same opportunity to protest with their dollars in this instance, since the Trump administration action pertains to schools, but still signaled they stood with the Obama policy of using the federal government to expand transgender civil rights. Its ultimately going to come down to the business community to stop it because its so bad for business, said Christopher Gergen, chief executive of Forward Impact, an entrepreneurial organization based in Raleigh, North Carolina. In unveiling the new direction on Wednesday, Trump administration officials argued that transgender policies should be an issue for the states to decide.  The action taken by the administration is troubling and goes against all that we believe in, Yahoo said in a statement. Social conservatives have hailed the decision by the Justice and Education departments to defer transgender bathroom policies to the states, calling it a victory for privacy and traditional  values. But companies have tried to persuade state and local governments to side with transgender people. We support efforts toward greater acceptance, not less, and we strongly believe that transgender students should be treated as equals, Apple said in a statement.  Microsoft President Brad Smith looked to history as a guide, referencing the date that the Emancipation Proclamation took effect, when President Abraham Lincoln declared freedom for slaves. Since Jan. 1, 1863, the federal government has played a vital role in protecting the rights of all Americans. Lets not stop now, Smith said on Twitter. Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey joined other tech firms criticizing the Trump administrations position.  Rolling back rights for transgender students is wrong, Dorsey said in a tweet on Thursday. Twitter and Square stand with the LGBTQ community, always. In response to the North Carolina law, companies such as Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) and PayPal (PYPL.O) canceled expansion plans, costing the state jobs. By invoking states rights, the Trump administration is potentially emboldening legislatures in other states that are considering laws similar to North Carolinas HB2.

DONT MISS Video:Trump's plan to hire more border patrol agentswould be costly Trump asks NASA to explore putting crew on rocket's debut flight Details emerge of Republicans' plans to replace Obamacare The bill makes no mention of former President Bill Clinton or former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, for whom the Little Rock airport was re-named four years ago - as Bill and Hillary Clinton National Airport/Adams Field - but its author does not hesitate to identify its target.  You have a president who was impeached for having an affair with an intern in the Oval Office and then disbarred, said state Sen. Jason Rapert, the bills author and one of the Arkansas legislatures most outspoken conservatives.  President Clinton was impeached in 1998 by the U.S. House of Representatives, which accused him of obstructing justice by lying under oath about a sexual relationship with a White House intern, Monica Lewinsky.Clinton was acquitted in a Senate trial the following year.  Hillary Clinton served as attorney to the citys airport commission during her husbands tenure as governor of Arkansas.At the conclusion of her husbands presidency she won a Senate seat in New York.  She was appointed secretary of state by President Barack Obama, who defeated her for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination.Clinton won the nomination last year but was defeated by President Donald Trump.  Rapert, whose Senate district does not include Little Rock, said he introduced the legislation after several Arkansans across the state had expressed to him their discomfort with naming its largest airport after the controversial Clintons.  He conceded his legislation might not win approval.  But we can prevent this sort of thing in the future, he said.  City officials have defended re-naming the airport, although sometimes tersely.  I think the name of the airport is appropriate and I support retaining it, said Meredith Catlett, a member of the terminals governing commission.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and other top White House officials urged conservative activists on Thursday to set aside  differences and unite behind President Donald Trumps agenda stressing tough trade and immigration policies. Addressing the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, in suburban Maryland, outside Washington, Pence rallied the large group of Republicans who helped elect Trump on Nov. 8.  My friends, this is our time. This is the chance weve worked so hard for so long to see. This is the time to prove again that our answers are the right answers for America, Pence said. Trump was due to address CPAC on Friday. Earlier on Thursday, Trumps chief strategist, Steve Bannon, known as a forceful influence in the White House, made a rare public appearance to appeal for support for the Republican president. We want you to have our back in upcoming battles, Bannon told the gathering, denouncing media criticism of Trump. He appeared onstage along with White House chief of staff Reince Priebus. The early days of the new administration have been marked by deep post-election divisions between Trump backers and liberals over the presidents temporary travel ban on people from seven Muslim-majority countries, as well as moves to increase deportations of illegal immigrants and build a wall on the border with Mexico. While conservatives celebrate Trumps role in delivering them victory in Novembers election, his agenda veers from traditional right-wing principles like limited government and open trade. Republicans who control the White House and Congress are also arguing over how to dismantle and replace former Democratic President Barack Obamas landmark healthcare law. Bannon and Priebus both sought to dispel a sense of disorder in the White House portrayed in media accounts. Referring to media criticism of Trump and echoing the presidents attacks on the media, Bannon warned: Its going to get worse every day as Trump presses forward with his 2016  campaign promises. If you think theyre going to give you your country back without a fight you are sadly mistaken, said Bannon, who formerly ran the confrontational right-wing website Breitbart News. He blamed the corporatist, globalist media that are adamantly opposed to an economic nationalist agenda under Trump. The CPAC conference, once a fringe event but now decidedly in the Republican mainstream, is being attended by an estimated 10,000 activists. White House adviser Kellyanne Conway, in remarks to the group, credited Trump with revitalizing the Republican Partys right wing.  Every great movement ends up being a little bit sclerotic and dusty after a time, and I think they (conservatives) need an infusion of energy, Conway said. CPAC organizers are trying to steer clear of controversy over the alt-right movement, a loose grouping that includes neo-Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semites whom Trump has been slow to denounce. Breitbart has a following among some of those groups and Bannon in the past had called the media organization a platform for the movement. Some Breitbart staffers were scheduled to participate in CPAC panel discussions. We dont think theres any role for the alt-right in the conservative movement, Matt Schlapp, head of the American Conservative Union, which organizes CPAC, said in a phone interview. Just a month into his presidency, Trump is already being compared by some conservatives to their hero, former President Ronald Reagan, who swept into office in 1981 with a small-government, free-trade, tax-cutting agenda that energized the Republican right wing and molded the views of many of the CPAC faithful. Trump so far has been pitch-perfect with conservatives as he starts his administration, said Schlapp. Even so, some conservatives, including some at CPAC, are nervously watching Trump.  Trump has proposed a major expansion of government to police immigration. He has already canceled a trade deal with Asia-Pacific neighbors and sharply criticized one among the United States, Mexico and Canada. I always worry any discussion about trade competition and tariffs ... misdirects the focus, said CPAC stalwart Grover Norquist, a powerful advocate of low taxes and small government. On taxes, Trump has backed cuts in rates, but his position on a Republican tax package under debate in Congress is unclear.  Schlapp credited Trump with naming the most conservative Cabinet in a half-century and nominating a Supreme Court justice, Neil Gorsuch, who has conservatives blessings. Trump has also thrilled conservatives by working hand in glove with congressional Republicans on overturning or gutting a handful of Obama-era regulations, including one that prevented coal companies from dumping waste into rivers and streams.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico on Thursday expressed worry and irritation about U.S. policies to two of President Donald Trumps top envoys, giving a chilly reply to the new administrations hard line on immigration, trade and security.    Comments by Trump about a military operation to deport criminals added to the tense atmosphere, and prompted a clarification from Homeland Security chief John Kelly, one of the U.S. officials visiting Mexico City. The U.S. government angered Mexico this week by saying it was seeking to deport many illegal immigrants to Mexico if they entered the United States from there, regardless of nationality. It is the latest point of friction between neighbors that have also been at odds over Trumps vow to build a wall on the border and his attempts to browbeat Mexico into giving concessions on trade.  There exists among Mexicans worry and irritation about what are perceived to be policies that could be harmful for the national interest and for Mexicans here and abroad, Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray told a news conference.  He was speaking after talks in the Mexican capital with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Kelly, who later met with President Enrique Pena Nieto. The Mexican leader scrapped a summit meeting with Trump in January as tensions rose.  Tillerson and Kelly emphasized traditionally strong U.S.-Mexico ties and both sides pledged further dialogue on migration, trade and security issues. Pena Nieto said the talks were a sign of the will to build a constructive relationship.  Two Mexican newspapers leaked comments from Videgaray, however, that bolstered the perception that Mexico is taking a more robust approach to its dealings with Trump, following jibes that Pena Nieto should stand up to his counterpart. If the United States taxes imports from Mexico, there will be a response that hits them where it hurts, La Jornada and Reforma reported Videgaray as saying, based on recordings obtained of a closed-door session with lawmakers on Wednesday.  Videgaray warned of counter-taxes and tariffs targeting U.S. congressional districts most reliant on exports to Mexico if Trump started limiting trade. Kelly and Tillerson were more measured in their words than either the Mexicans or Trump, who said on Thursday a military operation was being carried out to clear bad dudes such as gang members and drug lords from the United States.  Kelly said there would be no use of military force in immigration operations, and no, repeat, no mass deportations. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Trumps comment was meant to describe the flawless manner that U.S. immigration and border authorities worked. There were some signs of congeniality behind closed doors. Tillerson drank tequila with Mexican counterparts at dinner on Wednesday night, a person familiar with the event said. Pena Nietos office described the U.S. officials as professional and constructive.  Looking stern as he stood beside the U.S. visitors, Videgaray said it was a complex time for U.S.-Mexican relations, which have gone downhill quickly since Trumps election last November.             Videgaray and Pena Nieto have been criticized at home for being too willing to engage with the Republican president, who has repeatedly cranked up tension with the country ahead of key meetings.  Opposition politicians and a handful of protesters demanded that Pena Nieto snub the visitors, and even Economy Minister Idelfonso Guajardo had said the meeting with the president on Thursday might not happen, depending on the tone of the talks in the morning.  Mexico relies heavily on exports to its neighbor. But stakes are also high for the United States, not least because a breakdown in relations with Mexico could affect extensive cooperation on the fight against narcotics and stemming the flow of Central American illegal immigrants that reach the U.S. border.  Interior Minister Miguel Angel Osorio Chong said the two countries needed to strengthen intelligence sharing, as well as take more action to stem the flow of weapons and drug money from the United States and to shut down criminal organizations, . Mexico needs the United States, and the United States also needs Mexico. Our countries will always be neighbors so the best thing would be to have agreements that work for both equally, Osorio Chong said in comments at the Foreign Ministry. In a concession to Mexican concerns, both Kelly and Tillerson acknowledged the need to stop arms and drug proceeds moving south, and praised Mexicos extensive programs to turn back Central American immigrants traveling north. There is no mistaking that the rule of law matters along both sides of our border, Tillerson said. None of the officials made direct references to the deportation of immigrants from third countries to Mexico, or to paying for the border wall planned by Trump, a red-flag issue for Mexico.

The bills, collectively known as the Preserve California package, aim to make existing federal clean air, water, and endangered species laws enforceable under state law and protect federal lands in the state from being sold to oil companies.  The goals and objectives of these measures... is to do everything within our power to make sure the federal government doesnt encroach on our far-reaching progressive policies, California Senate Leader Kevin de Leon said during a press conference in Sacramento on Thursday. The Trump administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the bills. If the bills become law, they could set the stage for legal battles between the left-leaning state and the conservative Trump administration, which have already clashed over President Donald Trumps policies on immigration. After the presidential election, California Democrats hired former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, who served in the Obama administration, to help in any legal battles with the Trump administration. De Leon said that while the state is not looking to go to court against the administration over the proposed policies, it will deploy Holder as needed.  The less that we use Eric Holder, the better, de Leon said. The more we use Eric Holder, that means bad things are happening towards California.  One of the bills released on Thursday is designed to prevent federal lands in the state from being opened up to development and would give the state the right to halt the sales of federal land.  There are prominent members of Congress and prominent members of the Trump administration who are on the record supporting a large-scale sell off of our federal lands, said Senator Ben Allen, the bills author.  Either opening them up to mineral and oil and gas exploitation or direct sales to corporations who want to use those lands for commercial gain, he said. Another bill would shield whistleblowers in federal agencies who are also licensed to practice in California from losing their professional certification under state law.  It would also direct state environmental and public health agencies to protect any data under state law, even if parties in Washington D.C. order their censorship or destruction, according to Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson, the bills author.

In his first month in office, Trump has pressured a number of U.S. companies to hire in the United States but he has yet to publicly propose legislation tackling the big economic issues he campaigned on in 2016, including a job-boosting tax or infrastructure program. He will address a joint session of Congress on Feb. 28. In a meeting with some two dozen CEOs at the White House, Trump said the United States had lost about one-third of manufacturing jobs since it joined the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994 and asserted about 70,000 factories have closed since China joined the World Trade Organization 16 years ago.   But the Bureau of Labor Statistics says the number of private sector manufacturing facilities in the United States has fallen less than that, from nearly 400,000 in 2001 to 344,000 last year. Lower wages, automation, foreign competition and other factors account for the steep decline in manufacturing jobs, experts say.    Trump has promised to roll out proposals that he says could have favorable ramifications for companies, including a plan to overhaul the tax code and an infrastructure package that was part of his presidential campaign promises to create millions of jobs. He has declined to specify what he had in mind. Were going to find out how we bring more jobs back, he told the CEOs.  General Electric Co (GE.N) chief executive Jeff Immelt said after the meeting in a Twitter post that tax reform a high priority for job creation. Business community will come together to help find a workable solution. Ken Frazier, CEO of Merck & Co (MRK.N), told reporters it is very clear the president is interested in lessening the tax burden. Several of the CEOs who met Trump are part of a coalition that supports a so-called border adjustment tax, which would impose a 20 percent tax on goods that are imported into the country while providing write-offs for goods that are exported.  In an interview with Reuters, Trump spoke favorably about the border adjustment tax proposal being pushed by Republicans in the U.S. Congress, but did not specifically endorse it.  Trump is scheduled to dine at a Washington hotel on Thursday evening with members of The Business Council, a group of major U.S. company CEOs, including Immelt, Goldman Sachs Lloyd Blankfein and JP Morgan Chases Jamie Dimon.

Timothy Sedlak, 43, pleaded guilty in federal court in Manhattan to attempting to access protected computers without authorization. Prosecutors accused him of trying to gain access to an unnamed New York-based charitable organizations network. I knew that what I was doing was wrong, Sedlak said in court. Neither prosecutors nor Sedlak named the organization from which he tried to get access to emails. In a court filing obtained by Reuters that summarized a U.S. Secret Service interview in 2015 with Sedlak, an agent said he was questioned about notes they found referencing former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and her daughter, Chelsea Clinton. Sedlak, who called himself a private investigator, told the agents he was researching whether charities were unintentionally providing funding to Islamic militant groups, and said the Clintons came up in his research, the filing said. The filings description of the Clintons matched prosecutors descriptions of two previously unnamed individuals who were said to be executives at the charity and an individual who has been publicly affiliated with it. Chelsea Clinton is the vice chair of the foundation, which was started by her father, former U.S. President Bill Clinton. Its full name is the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation. The filing was downloaded by Reuters on Feb. 3. It was later replaced by a redacted version removing the Clintons names. Clinton Foundation representatives did not respond to requests for comment. The investigation into Sedlak, of Ocoee, Florida, predated probes into cyber attacks on Democrats during the 2016 presidential election. U.S. intelligence agencies in January released an assessment indicating that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered  cyber attacks to help Republican Donald Trumps electoral chances by discrediting Clinton. Sedlak launched about 390,000 unsuccessful attempts to gain unauthorized access to the charitable organizations computer network, according to prosecutors. Following his arrest in 2015, authorities discovered files on his computers containing child pornography, including images depicting Sedlak sexually abusing a toddler, prosecutors said. Sedlak was separately charged in Florida, where a federal jury in Orlando in May found him guilty of charges he produced and possessed child pornography.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump, who has vowed to stop U.S. manufacturing from disappearing overseas, will seek job-creation advice on Thursday from at least five companies that are laying off thousands of workers as they shift production abroad. Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N), United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), Dana Inc (DAN.N), 3M Co (MMM.N) and General Electric Co (GE.N), are offshoring work to Mexico, China, India and other countries, according to a Reuters review of U.S. Labor Department records.  Executives from the five companies are among a group of business leaders due to meet with Trump on Thursday to discuss how to help the president deliver on his promise to increase factory employment, according to the White House. About 2,300 U.S. workers at these five companies stand to  lose their jobs within the next two years as a result of offshoring, according to the Labor Departments Trade Adjustment Assistance Program, which provides retraining benefits to workers displaced by global trade. Reuters obtained the information through a Freedom of Information Act request.  The companies confirmed the planned job cuts to Reuters. It is not clear whether the other 19 executives due to meet with Trump on Thursday are currently offshoring work, as the TAA program does not cover all workers who lose their jobs due to global trade. The lost jobs amount to a small fraction of the hundreds of thousands of U.S. workers employed by those involved in the meeting. General Electric, for example, employs 125,000 U.S. workers, financial filings show. On the campaign trail and in the White House, Trump has painted globalization as a zero-sum game that has enriched low-wage countries while leaving the United States littered with abandoned factories and underemployed workers, and he has threatened to tax companies that offshore U.S. jobs. The experience of companies on Trumps task force, however, shows the reality is more complex in a world where they are serving customers across the globe. Several said they were creating many new U.S. factory jobs even as they move work to other countries.  Its not clear whether Trump will opt for the carrot or the stick. Trump plans to meet business leaders to hear their reasons for why theyre going offshore, said a White House aide who spoke on condition of anonymity.  Blue-collar workers who share Trumps skepticism of global trade say they will be watching closely to see if he will try to save their jobs.    I dont think hes a typical politician, so there is hope alive for middle-class families that he will do something, said Scott Schmidt, one of 222 workers at a GE engine plant in Waukesha, Wisconsin who are due to lose their jobs later this year when the company shifts production to Canada.  General Electric CEO Jeffrey Immelt is among those due to meet with Trump on Thursday. GE says it is closing its Waukesha plant because Congress has hobbled the U.S. Export-Import Banks ability to finance large export orders while most other industrialized nations still offer such financial support. The company says it laid off 225 workers last year at a Houston factory for the same reason, shifting production to France, the United Kingdom and Hungary.     GE says it is also closing an Ohio factory and laying off 180 workers because consumers are buying fewer of the florescent and incandescent light bulbs they make there. What production remains will be handled by a factory in Hungary. The U.S. economy lost 6 million manufacturing jobs from 2000 to 2010, roughly one-third of its total, in part due to offshoring, but the sector has added 900,000 jobs since then, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Multinational companies say labor costs now are only one factor they consider when deciding where to manufacture. An auto maker, for example, may decide to build a particular model in the country where sales are strongest, prompting parts suppliers to set up there as well so they can turn around orders quickly.  The offshoring picture is also more complex than official statistics indicate as a shuttered factory in the United States does not always mean a new factory abroad. When auto-parts maker Dana Corp closes a factory later this year in Glasgow, Kentucky that is operating at 20 percent of capacity, one of its plants in Ohio will pick up the work, along with other factories in Mexico, India and China. Dana CEO James Kamsickas is among those scheduled to meet with Trump on Thursday. The company plans to hire nearly 700 U.S. workers over the next three years as it expands factories in four U.S. states, spokesman Jeff Cole said.     That is little comfort to the 223 people in Kentucky who will lose their jobs.    It seems like all these CEOs and companies have turned their backs on the American worker, said Dana employee Tim Wells, one of those who will be laid off. The group also includes United Technologies CEO Gregory Hayes, who took heat from Trump last year for planning to move jobs from Indianapolis to Mexico. The company struck a deal with the incoming president in November to preserve roughly 700 jobs in exchange for $7 million in tax breaks. United Technologies says it still plans to lay off 786 workers at a separate Indiana plant and move production to Mexico this year. The company is also moving work from a facility in Arden Hills, Minnesota, resulting in a loss of 72 jobs. Most of that work is staying in the United States but some is moving to Poland, spokeswoman Bethany Sherman said, and some of the affected workers will be offered positions elsewhere. The company is adding more than 1,000 new jobs in the United States, Sherman said. Other participants include Caterpillar Chairman Doug Oberhelman, who oversees a company that is laying off 712 workers in the American South and Midwest and moving the work to China, Mexico, Italy, France and Germany as it weathers the largest sales slump in its history. A Caterpillar spokesman said it is simultaneously creating 1,300 new manufacturing jobs elsewhere in the United States.  Also due to participate is Inge Thulin, CEO of 3M, which is eliminating 130 jobs in suburban Cincinnati and moving production to Mexico. The company says it has added more than 2,000 U.S. manufacturing jobs over the last five years. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"
"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - President Donald Trumps administration on Wednesday revoked landmark guidance to public schools letting transgender students use the bathrooms of their choice, reversing a signature initiative of former Democratic President Barack Obama.   Reversing the Obama guidelines stands to inflame passions in the latest conflict in America between believers in traditional values and social progressives, and is likely to prompt more of the street protests that followed Trumps Nov. 8 election. Obama had instructed public schools last May to let transgender students use the bathrooms matching their chosen gender identity, threatening to withhold funding for schools that did not comply. Transgender people hailed the step as  victory for their civil rights. Trump, a Republican who took office last month, rescinded those guidelines, even though they had been put on hold by a federal judge, arguing that states and public schools should have the authority to make their own decisions without federal interference.     The Justice and Education departments will continue to study the legal issues involved, according to the new, superseding guidance that will be sent to public schools. About 200 people gathered in front of the White House to protest against Trumps action, waving rainbow flags and chanting: No hate, no fear, trans students are welcome here. The rainbow flag is the symbol of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, or LGBT, people. We all know that Donald Trump is a bully, but his attack on transgender children today is a new low, said Rachel Tiven, chief executive of Lambda Legal, which advocates for LGBT people. Conservatives such as Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who spearheaded the lawsuit challenging the Obama guidance, hailed the Trump administration action. Our fight over the bathroom directive has always been about former President Obamas attempt to bypass Congress and rewrite the laws to fit his political agenda for radical social change, said Paxton, a Republican. Transgender legal advocates have criticized the states rights argument, saying federal law and civil rights are matters for the federal government to enforce, not the states. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the administration was pressed to act now because of the pending U.S. Supreme Court case, G.G. versus Gloucester County School Board. That case pits a Virginia transgender boy, Gavin Grimm, against officials who want to deny him use of the boys room at his high school. Although the Justice Department is not a party in the case, it typically would want to make its views heard. The Trump administration action on Wednesday also withdrew an Education Department letter in support of Grimms case. Ive faced my share of adversaries in rural Virginia. I never imagined that my government would be one of them. We will not be beaten down by this administration, Grimm, 17, told the protest outside the White House. The federal law in question, known as Title IX, bans sex discrimination in education. But it remains unsettled whether Title IX protections extend to a persons gender identity.  Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement that the Obama guidelines did not contain sufficient legal analysis or explain how the interpretation was consistent with the language of Title IX. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman vowed to ensure Title IX and his states civil rights protections are enforced. President Trumps decision to rescind anti-discrimination protections for transgender students is yet another cruel move by an administration committed to divisive policies that roll back the clock on civil rights, he said in a statement.  The courts are likely to have the final say over whether Title IX covers transgender students. The Supreme Court could pass on that question in the Virginia case and allow lower courts to weigh in, or go ahead and decide what the law means. Obamas Education Department issued the guidance in response to queries from school districts across the country about how to accommodate transgender students in gender-segregated bathrooms. It also covered a host of other issues, such as the importance of addressing transgender students by their preferred names and pronouns and schools responsibility to prevent harassment and bullying of transgender children. Thirteen states led by Texas sued to stop the Obama guidelines, and a U.S. district judge in Texas temporarily halted their full implementation. The White House previously boasted of Trumps support for LGBT rights, noting in a Jan. 31 statement that he was the first Republican presidential nominee to mention the community in his nomination acceptance speech. Revoking the guidance shows that the presidents promise to protect LGBT rights was just empty rhetoric, James Esseks, director of the American Civil Liberties Unions LGBT project, said in a statement.

The U.S. government on Tuesday said it would seek to deport many illegal immigrants to Mexico if they entered the United States from there, regardless of their nationality, prompting a fiery response from Mexican officials. Calling the measure unilateral and unprecedented, Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said new immigration guidelines would top the agenda of meetings in Mexico City with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly. The stakes are high for the United States, since Mexico has warned that a breakdown in relations could affect its extensive cooperation on the fight against narcotics and on stemming the flow of Central American migrants that reach the U.S. border  Talking points from a senior official show Mexicans plan to seek more information on Trumps executive orders at the summit. Officials plan to say, We are worried about the consequences that these can have for Mexican nationals, in the United States, the notes show. As part of its response, Videgaray said Mexicos foreign ministry would get involved in legal cases in the United States where it considered the rights of Mexicans had been violated. The Mexican government will take all the measures legally possible to defend the human rights of Mexicans abroad, especially in the United States, Videgaray said.  The visit, which will include meetings with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, as well as military, finance and interior officials, is supposed to focus on border security, law enforcement and trade, according to the state department.   But hopes for a thawing in relations are low, after a series of botched meetings last month deepened tensions between the historic allies.  The relationship... is at such a historic low that it would be wishful thinking to assume that new concrete agenda items to advance [it] will come at this point, Jason Marczak, director of the Atlantic Councils Latin America Economic Growth Initiative said.  Pena Nieto abruptly canceled a planned January summit with Trump after the real estate mogul suggested the Mexican leader should not come if he refused to pay for a border wall.  And Trump signed his first executive orders to punish sanctuary cities and build the wall, which could cost around $21.6 billion, the first time Videgaray traveled to Washington to negotiate with counterparts last month. Trump has also threatened to rip up a key trade deal between the United States and Mexico if he cannot renegotiate it to favor American interests.  The Tuesday guidance also calls for the hiring of 15,000 more immigration agents, while subjecting immigrants who cannot show they have been in the country for more than two years to expedited removal.

The order, which was quickly implemented, caused chaos at airports around the world as visa holders heading to the United States were pulled off planes or turned around upon arrival at U.S. airports.  Americans were deeply divided over the order, which was condemned by prominent U.S. companies and allies before being temporarily blocked by federal courts.

Leahy, a Democrat who has been key in efforts to normalize relations, was leading a bipartisan group of five U.S. senators and a representative on a three-day visit to the Communist-run island to discuss ties and explore business opportunities. Cuba watchers are looking closely for signs of how the fragile U.S. detente with Cuba will fare under Republican President Donald Trump, who has threatened to backtrack on it if he does not get a better deal. Analysts say Cuba has played its cards well so far by not responding shrilly to such provocation and demonstrating its continued willingness to engage under the new president. Castro wants reform to continue, he wants the movement forwards to continue, said Leahy at the news conference in the U.S. embassy, after meeting with the Cuban president on Tuesday. The number of people he had from his administration talk to us made it very clear they want us to continue. The delegation met with Cubas foreign, trade and agriculture ministers as well as with Castro. The group included Republican Senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi who on Monday oversaw the signing of agreements between Cuba and two Mississippi ports. Increasingly this issue of normalizing relations with Cuba is bipartisan, this isnt just Democrats, there are a lot of Republicans that believe we ought to do this as well, said Representative James McGovern, a Democrat. Support for the detente was also growing among the business and academic communities, said McGovern, who was traveling with a group of U.S. biotech experts keen to explore the sector in Cuba. The movement is more significant in the U.S.A. today than at any time in my career in the Senate, said Leahy. And I am the dean of the Senate, I have been there the longest, added Leahy, who was first elected to the Senate in 1974.  The White House said earlier this month that the Trump administration was in the midst of a full review of all U.S. policies towards Cuba. The visit came as a diplomatic incident highlighted continuing concerns about restrictions on human rights on the island. Cuban authorities prevented the head of the Organization of American States (OAS), a former Chilean minister and an ex-president of Mexico from traveling to Cuba to attend an award ceremony on Wednesday hosted by dissidents. Cuba opposes anything that legitimizes dissidents, who it claims are mercenaries funded by foreign interests. It also views the OAS as an imperialist instrument of the United States. OAS chief Luis Almagro reported that Cuban authorities said they were astonished at his involvement in anti-Cuban activities which were an unacceptable provocation. A U.S. embassy official attended the ceremony, organized by the Latin American Network of Youth for Democracy, a group opposed to the Communist government. Almagros seat was left empty in symbolic protest. It may not be the smoothest of paths but it will continue, Leahy said of the U.S.-Cuban detente. I would not be here today on one more trip if I didnt think that continuation of that progress is inevitable. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Speaking after he greeted a plane full of Guatemalans deported back from the United States, Kelly said U.S. authorities were not carrying out mass deportations of immigrants and would follow the law.  But he stressed that deportees would be returned their home countries more quickly than in the past. If youre a Guatemalan who is considering paying a great deal of money to a coyote (smuggler) to bring you to the United States, youll be wasting your money, Kelly said at a Guatemalan Air Force base where 347 deportees earlier arrived on a flight.  You will be returned very quickly, he said. Kelly left Guatemala shortly after speaking to reporters, headed for Mexico where he and U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson were expected to explain new U.S. immigration measures to their counterparts. U.S. immigration courts have a large backlog of cases, meaning it can take years to deport some undocumented immigrants.  In recent years, tens of thousands of Central American children and families have moved to the United States, many seeking asylum from ruthless street gangs. Kelly made his comments a day after his department said it planned to deport non-Mexican irregular immigrants to Mexico, regardless of their nationality. The plan angered Mexican officials, with their lead negotiator and Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray saying there was no way Mexico would accept it.

The Senates 24-16 vote to override, which fell short of a two-thirds majority requirement, came just hours after the House overrode the veto. The measure would have increased individual income tax rates and ended a business tax exemption to raise an additional $590 million in fiscal 2018, which begins on July 1. Republican Governor Sam Brownback said on Tuesday night that he planned to veto it because the legislature failed to fulfill my request that they find savings and efficiencies before asking the people of Kansas for more taxes. Kansas is not the only state with Republicans controlling both the governors office and legislature to have skirmishes over taxes.  Michigan Governor Rick Snyder has pushed back against a legislative move to phase out the states income tax by 2057. On Tuesday, House lawmakers revised the proposal to gradually reduce the rate from 4.25 percent to 3.90 percent in 2021, when it would result in a $1.1 billion drop in revenue, according to a legislative analysis. Half of a billion dollars will come due in 2019 and over one billion by 2022, years in which we have planned funding specifically to invest in modernizing our states infrastructure, Snyder said in a statement. In Oklahoma, where revenue is sinking, Governor Mary Fallin proposed expanding the sales tax base to services to raise about $834 million for the fiscal 2018 budget. Lieutenant Governor Todd Lamb, who was elected separately from Fallin, resigned from the governors Cabinet last week, citing the tax plan. While I respect the determination with which Governor Fallin met her obligation to present a balanced budget to the legislature, I cannot support her proposed tax increases, Lamb, who remains lieutenant governor, said in a statement. In Kansas, Brownback enacted legislation in 2012 reducing tax rates by as much as 29 percent in a move intended to improve the states business climate. But state coffers have shrunk, causing Kansas to miss revenue targets. This month, S&P offered a pessimistic assessment on the states finances, revising the outlook on Kansas AA-minus credit rating to negative from stable, citing structural budget pressures.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has shown little patience for dissent, but that trait is likely to be tested by his new national security adviser, Army Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster. McMaster is joining the White House staff with views on Russia, counterterrorism, strengthening the military and other major security issues that diverge not only from those of the Trump loyalists, but also from those the president himself has expressed.     A military intellectual whose ideas have been shaped more by experience than by emotion, more by practice than by politics, and more by intellect than by impulse may also find himself in political terrain that may be as alien, and perhaps as hostile, to him as the sands and cities of Afghanistan and Iraq were. McMaster will not be alone, however. His prominent administration allies include Defense Secretary Jim Mattis; Marine General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee; as well as many of the soldiers who have served with him. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said on Tuesday that Trump told McMaster hes got full authority to structure the national security team the way he wants. Trump, however, already has taken the unusual step of adding Steve Bannon, his chief strategic adviser known for right-wing ideological views, to the White House National Security Council. The real potential for flashpoints is with some of the people that Steve Bannon has brought into the administration ... people who see things very ideologically, said Andrew Exum, a former Army officer and Defense Department Mideast policy official and McMaster friend for more than a decade. Trumps early missteps on immigration and other issues have strengthened the leverage available to not only H.R. McMaster, but also Defense Secretary Mattis and Secretary (of State Rex) Tillerson potentially, Exum said. One of the first tests of McMasters influence will be the administrations review of U.S. policy in Syria, and more broadly against Islamic militancy. The reviews results are due early next week, Pentagon officials said on Tuesday. Bannon said last June that the United States and its European allies are fighting a global existential war against Islam. McMasters approach to defeating Sunni Muslim militants has been more nuanced, resting largely on separating extremists from the vast majority of the local population.As commander of the Armys 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment, then-Colonel McMaster prepared his troopers for retaking the city of Tal Afar on the Iraqi-Syrian border in 2005 by having some of them dress in traditional Arab dishdashas, recruiting Arab-Americans to play the part of locals, and teaching his troops how to determine if a household was Sunni or Shiite by looking at the pictures hung on the walls.McMaster ordered his soldiers never to call the Iraqis they encountered hajjis, which many Americans used as a derogatory term for the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca. Writing in the journal Military Review, he warned that emphasizing force, as Trump has done in his vows to bomb Islamic State into oblivion, could backfire.In Iraq, an inadequate understanding of tribal, ethnic, and religious drivers of conflict ... sometimes led to military operations (such as raids against suspected enemy networks) that exacerbated fears or offended the sense of honor of populations in ways that strengthened the insurgency, he wrote. That is not to say McMaster is a shaved-headed intellectual hesitant to use force. Twenty-one of his troopers were killed in action in Tal Afar, and one unit suffered 40 percent casualties. A second early test for McMaster will be Russia policy. Unlike his predecessor, Michael Flynn, and Trump himself, McMaster regards Moscow as an adversary rather than a potential partner.Last May, at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, McMaster cited Russias annexation of Crimea and support for rebels in eastern Ukraine as evidence of a broader effort to collapse the post-World War Two, certainly the post-Cold War, security, economic, and political order in Europe and replace that order with something that is more sympathetic to Russian interests.A third area where McMasters thinking differs from the presidents rhetoric is the size and shape of the U.S. military. Trump has promised to add tens of thousands more soldiers, expand the Navy to 350 ships from 282, and provide the Air Force with the 1,200 fighter aircraft they need, according to his campaign website.In his scholarly 2015 Military Review article, which has 39 footnotes, including one citing Greek historian Thucydides account of the Peloponnesian War, McMaster argued that promising victory delivered rapidly from stand-off range, based on even better surveillance, intelligence, information, and precision strike capabilities is a fallacy that confuses targeting enemy organizations with strategy.The question now is whether McMasters views will have sufficient force to alter the course of U.S. policy set by the president and his closest aides. The real challenges hes going to confront, I think, are not the challenges of strategy and the global responsibilities of the worlds only superpower, said John Nagl, a retired Army colonel who helped rewrite U.S. counterinsurgency doctrine for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. He knows how to deal with those things. Nagl continued. The challenges hes going to confront are moral, dealing with an administration that has not always been clear in its support for American values.        Whatever his odds, McMaster took the job not simply because his commander-in-chief could order him to do it. Those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it, he once said. Those who ignore them are doomed to watch.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

By Anna Ringstrom and Jeff Mason STOCKHOLM/WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - A day after falsely suggesting there was an immigration-related security incident in Sweden, President Donald Trump said on Sunday his comment was based on a television report he had seen. Trump, who in his first weeks in office has tried to tighten U.S. borders sharply for national security reasons, told a rally on Saturday that Sweden was having serious problems with immigrants. You look at whats happening last night in Sweden, Trump said. Sweden. Who would believe this? Sweden. They took in large numbers. Theyre having problems like they never thought possible. No incident occurred in Sweden and the countrys baffled government asked the U.S. State Department to explain. My statement as to whats happening in Sweden was in reference to a story that was broadcast on @FoxNews concerning immigrants & Sweden, Trump said in a tweet on Sunday. Fox News, a U.S. channel that has been cited favorably by Trump, ran a report Friday about alleged migrant-related crime problems in the country. A White House spokeswoman told reporters on Sunday that Trump had been referring generally to rising crime, not a specific incident in the Scandinavian country. Swedens reported crime rate has risen since 2005 but the annual government survey that asks Swedes whether they have experienced any of a broad range of crimes shows that rates are roughly unchanged over the last 10 years, even as Sweden has taken in hundreds of thousands of immigrants from war-torn countries like Syria and Iraq. Trumps comment confounded Stockholm. We are trying to get clarity, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Catarina Axelsson said. Swedens embassy in the United States repeated Trumps tweet about having seen the Fox report, and added, We look forward to informing the U.S. administration about Swedish immigration and integration policies. Trump has been widely criticized for making assertions with little or no supporting evidence. He has said more than 3 million people voted fraudulently in the U.S. election, which officials say is false, and incorrectly stated that he won by the most decisive margin in decades. Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom appeared to respond to Trump on Saturday by posting on Twitter an excerpt of a speech in which she said democracy and diplomacy require us to respect science, facts and the media.  Her predecessor was less circumspect. Sweden? Terror attack? What has he been smoking? Questions abound, former Foreign Minister Carl Bildt wrote on Twitter. Other Swedes mocked Trump by posting pictures of reindeer, meatballs and people assembling IKEA furniture. #lastnightinsweden my son dropped his hotdog in the campfire. So sad!

The Center for Media and Democracy has sought the release of emails between energy companies and Pruitt for the past two years, saying they show energy companies drafted language that Pruitts attorney general office then used in suing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the office he now heads, over regulations on energy operations.   The center had sued Pruitt on Feb. 7, ahead of the Senate vote to confirm his nomination by President Donald Trump, to release the records detailing his communications with energy companies.  The attorney generals office released more than 7,500 pages of emails late on Tuesday, holding back an unknown number of documents it called exempted or privileged. Oklahoma Judge Aletia Timmons is reviewing those documents, but there is no set time for when or if they would be released. Among the documents released were communications between Devon Energy and Pruitt's office that suggest the company gave the Oklahoma officials language on limits on methane emissions at oil and gas operations. Pruitt's office then used this language in suing the EPA over the regulations, the documents suggest. (bit.ly/2lFEymC)  The EPA did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Devon serves as a resource with information and expertise for decision makers, and its contact with Pruitt was consistent with its policy of engaging with policymakers, company spokesman John Porretto said. Nick Surgey, a research director at the Center for Media and Democracy, called the document release a major breakthrough that revealed a close and friendly relationship between Pruitts office and the oil and gas industry, with frequent meetings, calls, and dinners. The center said before the release of the emails that Pruitts office had violated Oklahomas Open Records Act by delaying their issuance. Critics of Pruitts nomination to head the EPA were concerned over his record on the environment - he sued the agency more than a dozen times on behalf of his oil-producing state and has doubted the science of climate change - and Democrats in the Senate held an all night debate last week trying to stop his confirmation vote until the emails were released. He was confirmed on Friday with two Democrats from energy-producing states voting for him.  A spokesman at the Oklahoma attorney generals office would not say how many documents were sent to the judge for review or how it decided which ones to fully release. The office went above and beyond what is required under the Open Records Act by producing records that would typically be considered ones outside the laws scope, the office said in a release.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump delivered his first public condemnation of anti-Semitic incidents in the United States on Tuesday after a new spate of bomb threats to Jewish community centers around the country and vandalism in a Jewish cemetery. Several of the centers were evacuated for a time on Monday after receiving the threats, the JCC Association of North America said, and another center was evacuated on Tuesday morning in San Diego, California, according to police. Also, vandals toppled about 170 headstones at the Chesed Shel Emeth Society cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri, over the weekend. The anti-Semitic threats targeting our Jewish community and community centers are horrible and are painful and a very sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil, Trump told reporters.  He was speaking at the end of a tour of the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, which Trump said showed why we have to fight bigotry, intolerance and hatred in all of its very ugly forms. The comments marked a change for Trump, who had not explicitly and publicly condemned the threats against Jews when asked last week. Instead, he spoke more generally about his hopes of making the nation less divided. The president reacted with anger at a news conference last week when a journalist from a Jewish magazine asked how his government planned to take care of a rise in threats. Trump berated the reporter for asking a very insulting question, appearing to believe the reporter was accusing him of being anti-Semitic. Number one, I am the least anti-Semitic person that youve ever seen in your entire life, the president said, adding that he was also the least racist person. Trump has often noted that one of his daughters is a convert to Judaism, he has Jewish grandchildren and he employs many Jews in his business.  Trumps daughter Ivanka, a close adviser to her father who practices Orthodox Judaism, responded to the latest threats in a message on her Twitter account on Monday evening. America is a nation built on the principle of religious tolerance, she said. We must protect our houses of worship & religious centers.   On Tuesday, Trump again declined to answer a question about what action he would take to address the threats to Jewish organizations. Sean Spicer, a White House spokesman, said later that Trump would respond through deed and action over the coming months and years. BAND-AID  Trumps derogatory campaign rhetoric against Muslims and Mexican immigrants won enthusiastic backing from prominent white supremacists who embrace anti-Jewish, anti-black and anti-Muslim ideologies. It also drew greater media attention to fringe extremist groups.  Trump has disavowed their support. His chief strategist, Steve Bannon, is the former publisher of Breitbart, a news website popular among right-wing extremist groups. The Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect in New York, which has criticized the Trump administration repeatedly over anti-Semitism, said his comments were too little too late. The presidents sudden acknowledgement is a Band-Aid on the cancer of anti-Semitism that has infected his own administration, Steven Goldstein, the groups executive director, said in a statement. Spicer rejected the characterization. I wish that they had praised the president for his leadership in this area, he told reporters when asked about Goldsteins comment. Hopefully as time goes by theyll recognize his commitment to civil rights. Jewish groups criticized the White House for omitting any mention of Jews in its statement marking Holocaust Memorial Day last month. The White House said the omission was deliberate since the Nazis also killed people who were not Jews, if in smaller numbers. The stated goal of the Nazis was the extermination of Jews. One day after speaking at a security summit in Munich, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence spent Sunday morning walking through the grounds of the Dachau concentration camp in Germany with a camp survivor.  Over the course of the U.S. Presidents Day holiday on Monday, bomb threats were sent to 11 Jewish community centers, including ones in the Houston, Chicago and Milwaukee areas, according to the JCC association. They were found to be hoaxes, as was another threat that forced the evacuation of a center in San Diego on Tuesday morning, according to police. No arrests were made. The FBI has said it is investigating recent threats as possible civil rights violations. The Council on American-Islamic Relations, a prominent Muslim human rights group, has offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of anyone behind the threats, saying Muslims felt a duty to support any targeted minority group. The incidents on Monday followed three waves of bomb threats so far this year. In all, at least 69 incidents at 54 Jewish community centers in 27 states and one Canadian province have been reported, according to the JCC association.

The Department of Homeland Security guidance to immigration agents is part of a broader border security and immigration enforcement plan in executive orders that Republican Trump signed on Jan. 25.  Former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, issued an executive order in 2012 that protected 750,000 immigrants who had been brought into the United States illegally by their parents. Trump has said the issue is very difficult for him.  Trump campaigned on a pledge to get tougher on the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States, playing on fears of violent crime while promising to build a wall on the border with Mexico and to stop potential terrorists from entering the country. Trumps planned measures against illegal immigrants have drawn protests, such as an event last week that activists called A Day Without Immigrants to highlight the importance of  foreign-born people, who account for 13 percent of the U.S. population, or more than 40 million naturalized American citizens. A banner declaring Refugees Welcome was posted on the base of the Statue of Liberty, a symbol of American acceptance of immigrants, before park rangers removed it on Tuesday, WABC television reported. DHS officials, on a conference call with reporters, said that although any immigrant in the country illegally could be deported, the agency will prioritize those deemed a threat. These include recent entrants, those convicted of a crime and people charged but not convicted of a crime. Some details of the guidelines were detailed in a draft memo seen on Saturday.   Many of the instructions will not be implemented immediately because they depend on Congress, a public comment period or negotiations with other nations, the officials said. Mexican immigration officials immediately objected to part of the new rules. The guidance also calls for the hiring of 10,000 more U.S. Immigration and Customs (ICE) agents and 5,000 more U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents. The DHS will need to publish a notice in the Federal Register subject to review in order to implement one part of the plan that calls on ICE agents to increase the number of immigrants who are not given a hearing before being deported.  The new rules would subject immigrants who cannot show they have been in the country for more than two years to expedited removal. Currently, only migrants apprehended near a U.S. border who cannot show they have been in the country more than 14 days are subject to rapid removal.  The memos also instruct ICE to detain migrants who are awaiting a court decision on whether they will be deported or granted relief, such as asylum. DHS officials said they are reviewing what jurisdictions may have laws in place that prevent the amount of time immigrants can be held. The agency also plans to send non-Mexican migrants crossing the southern U.S. border back into Mexico as they await a decision on their case. The DHS officials said this plan would be dependent on partnerships with the Mexican government and would not be implemented overnight.  The guidelines were released a day before U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly were due in Mexico City for talks with President Enrique Pena Nieto and Mexican officials. An official from Mexicos Foreign Ministry said the government would tell Kellys team to that it was impossible for Mexico to accept deportees or asylum applicants from foreign countries, and would ask them to explain their plan. The deportation of Mexicans would be one of the governments major concerns at the meeting, said the official, who declined to be named.

Secretary Tillerson and State Councilor Yang affirmed the importance of a constructive bilateral relationship, the U.S. statement said. The two sides agreed on the need to address the threat that North Korea poses to regional stability. The call follows a meeting between Chinas Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Tillerson on Friday, their first face-to-face encounter since Tillerson began his job at the start of this month. In that meeting, Wang stressed that common interests between China and the United States far outweigh their differences.  Trump angered Beijing in December by talking to the president of Taiwan and saying the United States did not have to stick to the one China policy, under which Washington acknowledges the Chinese position that there is only one China and Taiwan is part of it.  Trump also accused China of not doing enough to rein in its neighbor North Korea. However, in a phone call with Chinese leader Xi Jinping last week, Trump agreed to honor the one China policy, a major diplomatic boost for Beijing, which brooks no criticism of its claim to self-ruled Taiwan. China hopes the two countries, following through on the spirit of the phone conversation, could uphold the principles of non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation as well as enhance high-level exchanges, Yang told Tillerson, according to Chinas Xinhua news agency. Chinas readout of the call did not mention any specific issues, with Xinhua noting only that they also exchanged some views on a number of international issues. On Saturday, Chinas Commerce Ministry said it would ban all coal imports from North Korea until the end of this year after Pyongyang tested an intermediate-range ballistic missile in its first direct challenge to the international community since  Trump took office. China announced in April it would ban North Korean coal imports to comply with U.N. sanctions aimed at starving Pyongyang of funds for its nuclear and missile programs. However, it made exceptions for deliveries intended for the peoples wellbeing and not connected to the weapons programs.

(Reuters) - President Donald Trump will interview four candidates for the position of U.S. national security adviser on Sunday and expects to make a decision in the coming days, he told reporters on Saturday. Trump will interview acting adviser Keith Kellogg, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster and Lieutenant General Robert Caslen, White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters at Trumps Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Ill make a decision over the next couple of days, Trump told reporters later on Air Force One. He said he was leaning toward one of the candidates he was interviewing on Sunday. Trump, who has been searching for a new national security adviser after firing his first one, Michael Flynn, could add a couple more candidates to the list, Spicer said.  Retired general and former CIA chief David Petraeus is no longer a candidate.  The retired four-star general, who resigned as head of the CIA in 2012 after it was revealed he was having an affair with his biographer, had been on a short list for the job after Flynn was let go. Spicer said Trumps finalists include Kellogg, Bolton, Caslen, who is the superintendent of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, and McMaster, who holds a senior post with the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command. Former U.S. National Security Agency head Keith Alexander, and former Army chief of staff Ray Odierno were also thought to be in contention for the job. Flynn stepped down early this week after revelations that he had discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia with the Russian ambassador to the United States before Trump took office and misled Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations. Finding a replacement has been a challenge for Trump.      Retired Vice Admiral Robert Harward, the presidents first choice to take over for Flynn, turned down the offer, citing family and financial reasons. A source familiar with the matter said Petraeus, like Harward, wanted control over staffing decisions within the NSC, and Trump was reluctant to grant that authority. Trump is spending the weekend at his properties in Florida. Will be having many meetings this weekend at The Southern White House, he wrote in a tweet on Saturday morning. The president spent the morning at the Trump International Golf Club before returning to his Mar-a-Lago resort. He later held a political rally in Melbourne, Florida.  The tumult in Trumps security team stretched into other areas of the National Security Council, the presidents main forum for decision-making on security and foreign affairs.

I believe that we as an agency, and we as a nation, can be both pro-energy and jobs, and pro-environment, Scott Pruitt  said in his first address to staff. We dont have to choose between the two.   Critics of the agency have complained that regulations ushered in by former Democratic President Barack Obama have killed thousands of energy jobs by restricting carbon emissions and limiting areas open to coal mining and oil drilling. Democrats, environmental advocates and many of the EPAs current and former staff worry President Donald Trumps appointment of Pruitt signals a reversal in Americas progress toward cleaner air and water and fighting global climate change. Both Trump and Pruitt have expressed doubts about climate change, and Trump vowed during his 2016 presidential campaign to pull the United States out of a global pact to fight it. The Republican president has promised to slash environmental rules to help the drilling and mining industries, but without hurting air and water quality. Pruitt sued the agency he now leads more than a dozen times while attorney general of Oklahoma to stop federal rules. He did not mention climate change in his 12-minute speech at the EPAs headquarters in Washington.  He struck a conciliatory tone in the address,  saying he would listen, learn and lead and that he valued the contributions of career staff.  Trump is expected to sign executive orders aimed at reshaping environmental policy as early as this week. Those orders would lift a ban on coal mining leases on federal lands and ease greenhouse gas emissions curbs on electric utilities, according to a report by the Washington Post. They would also require changes to Obamas Waters of the United States rule that details which waterways fall under federal protection, the report said. The White House did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the Washington Post story. Pruitt was confirmed by the U.S. Senate last week after contentious hearings that focused on his record as the top prosecutor of the oil- and gas-producing state of Oklahoma.  Democrats had sought to delay Pruitts confirmation over questions about his ties to the oil industry. Some 800 former EPA staff also signed a letter urging senators to reject him, and about 30 current EPA staff joined a protest set up in Chicago by the Sierra Club environmental group. In Oklahoma, a state judge ruled last week that Pruitt would have to turn over emails between his office and energy companies by Tuesday after a watchdog group, the Center for Media and Democracy, sued for their release. The judge will review and perhaps hold back some of the emails before releasing them, a court clerk said.       Nicole Cantello, a representative of the union that represents EPA workers, said that despite Pruitts record, she was hoping for the best.  One would hope that the administrator would learn about what we do and would then not treat as lightly the EPAs mission and accomplishments, and what it is required to do under the statutes, she said.     The American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, said it looked forward to working with Pruitt, the administration and Congress on policies that will keep energy affordable, create jobs, and strengthen our economy.

Yiannopoulos thanked Breitbart for letting him transmit conservative and libertarian ideas to an audience that otherwise would never have heard them, but said he did not want his poor choice of words to detract from his colleagues important work. This is my decision alone, he told a news conference in New York city. When your friends have done right by you, you do right by them. For me, now, that means stepping aside.  Yiannopoulos was banned from Twitter last year after making remarks on race, religion and sex that incited racial attacks on an African-American actress. On Feb. 1, violent protesters forced the cancellation of a speech he was due to give at the University of California at Berkeley. The latest controversy stemmed from a video more than a year old in which Yiannopoulos said he thought that when it came to relations between men and boys, there are certainly people who are capable of giving consent at a younger age than the law allows. On Monday, after the video resurfaced, organizers of the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, rescinded an invite for him to speak at the annual event. The same day, publisher Simon & Schuster said it canceled the publication of Yiannopoulos book Dangerous, which was due out on June 13. At Tuesdays press conference, Yiannopoulos apologized for the remarks and called the firestorm over them a horrible, degrading, humiliating experience.  The 33-year-old Briton told reporters he was sexually abused between the ages of 13 and 16 by two men, but did not realize at the time it was abuse. I can look back now and see that it was, Yiannopoulos said. My experience as a victim led me to believe that I could say anything on the subject. ... I dont believe that sex with 13 year olds is OK. ...I am horrified by pedophelia. Yiannopoulos said some of the remarks were taken out of context and that he was at times speaking about his specific experience of being abused. Despite the most recent backlash, which he described as the worst of his career, Yiannopoulos said he planned to continue to try to grow an audience. In the months ahead, Yiannopoulos said he would launch a new media website. He said he would focus more on entertainment and campus tours in his professional future instead of Breitbart journalism.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - Conservative U.S. Supreme Court justices on Tuesday expressed skepticism about reviving a lawsuit filed by the family of a Mexican teenager against a U.S. Border Patrol agent who fatally shot the 15-year-old from across the border in Texas in 2010. Among the concerns raised by justices was whether non-U.S. citizens injured by drone attacks overseas that are directed from the United States could file similar claims if the lawsuit was allowed to move forward. In a closely watched case that could affect U.S. immigration actions under President Donald Trumps administration, the courts liberal justices expressed sympathy toward allowing the case to move forward, indicating the justices could be headed toward a 4-4 split. Such a ruling would leave in place a lower courts decision to throw out the civil rights claims against the agent, Jesus Mesa, filed by the family of Sergio Hernandez. The Supreme Court potentially could delay action on the case to see if Trumps nominee to fill a vacancy on the court, conservative appeals court judge Neil Gorsuch, is confirmed by the U.S. Senate. Gorsuch could then potentially cast the deciding vote. A ruling would normally be due by the end of June.  Justice Anthony Kennedy, a conservative who sometimes sides with the liberal justices in close cases and whose vote could be pivotal in this one, voiced doubt about the familys arguments during the courts hour-long argument. Kennedy indicated the question of how to compensate victims of cross-border shootings is one that the U.S. and Mexican governments should resolve. Youve indicated that theres a problem all along the border. Why doesnt that counsel us that this is one of the most sensitive areas of foreign affairs where the political branches should discuss with Mexico what the solution ought to be?, Kennedy asked the Hernandez familys lawyer, Robert Hilliard. Chief Justice John Roberts, another conservative, brought up the sensitive question of whether U.S. officials could be sued for drone attacks overseas. How do you analyze the case of a drone strike in Iraq where the plane is piloted from Nevada? Why wouldnt the same analysis apply in that case? he asked Hilliard. The justices heard the case at a time that the security of the lengthy U.S.-Mexico border is a hot topic, with President Donald Trump moving forward with plans for a border wall he said is needed to combat illegal immigration. The case is one of three the justices currently are considering that concern the extent to which the U.S. Constitution provides rights to non-U.S. citizens. That issue has become more pressing in light of Trumps January order, put on hold by the courts, to block entry into the United States by people from seven Muslim-majority countries and refugees. Trump is preparing a rewritten version of the ban. The case raises several legal questions, including whether or not the U.S. Constitutions ban on unjustified deadly force applied to Hernandez because he was a Mexican citizen on Mexican soil when the shooting occurred in June 2010. The court could resolve the case by simply deciding not to apply a 1971 Supreme Court ruling in a case involving federal drug enforcement agents that allowed such lawsuits in limited circumstances. The court has been reluctant in subsequent cases to extend that ruling to other types of conduct. Kennedy seemed unwilling to take that step, saying the Hernandez shooting would be an extraordinary case in which to allow a lawsuit against a federal official. Liberal justices appeared more willing to examine whether some U.S. rights extend to border areas where the U.S. government exercises a certain amount of authority even beyond the border line, as it does in the culvert where Hernandez was killed. Justice Elena Kagan said it could be described as a no-mans land that is neither one thing or another thing. Likewise, Justice Stephen Breyer said the border area could be viewed as a special kind of physical place where U.S. law could extend in certain instances. Hernandezs lawyers cited a report by the Washington Monthly magazine that said over a five year period, border agents were involved in 10 cross-border shootings, killing six Mexican nationals. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, another liberal, said that in order to deter such shootings, why should there not be a civil remedy to ensure that border police are complying with the Constitution? The incident took place at a border crossing between El Paso, Texas and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. The U.S. Border Patrol said at the time that Hernandez was pelting U.S. agents with rocks from the Mexican side of the Rio Grande before the shooting. U.S. authorities have asserted that Mesa shot Hernandez in self-defense. Lawyers for Hernandezs family disputed that account, saying he was playing a game with other teenagers in which they would run across a culvert from the Mexican side and touch the U.S. border fence before dashing back. The FBI also said Hernandez was a known immigrant smuggler who had been pressed into service by smuggling gangs that took advantage of his youth.  The family appealed a 2015 ruling by the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals throwing out the lawsuit.""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WEST PALM BEACH, Fla./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday named Lieutenant General Herbert Raymond McMaster as his new national security adviser, choosing a military officer known for speaking his mind and challenging his superiors.  McMaster is a highly regarded military tactician and strategic thinker, but his selection surprised some observers who wondered how the officer, whose Army career stalled at times for his questioning of authority, would deal with a White House that has not welcomed criticism. He is highly respected by everybody in the military and were very honored to have him, Trump told reporters in West Palm Beach where he spent the weekend. Hes a man of tremendous talent and tremendous experience. One subject on which Trump and McMaster could soon differ is Russia. McMaster shares the consensus view among the U.S. national security establishment that Russia is a threat and an antagonist to the United States, while the man whom McMaster is replacing, retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, appeared to view it more as a potential geopolitical partner.  Trump in the past has expressed a willingness to engage with Russia more than his predecessor, Barack Obama.  Flynn was fired as national security adviser on Feb. 13 after reports emerged that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about speaking to Russias ambassador to the United States about U.S. sanctions before Trumps inauguration. The ouster, coming so early in Trumps administration, was another upset for a White House that has been hit by miscues, including the controversial rollout of a travel ban on people from seven Muslim-majority countries, since the Republican president took office on Jan. 20. The national security adviser is an independent aide to the president and does not require confirmation by the U.S. Senate. He has broad influence over foreign policy and attends National Security Council meetings along with the heads of the State Department, the Department of Defense and key security agencies. Republican Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a frequent Trump critic, praised McMaster as an outstanding choice. I give President Trump great credit for this decision, McCain said in a statement.  A former U.S. ambassador to Russia under Obama, Michael McFaul, a Democrat, praised McMaster on Twitter as terrific and said McMaster will not be afraid to question his boss. McMaster, who flew back to the Washington area from Florida with Trump on Air Force One, will remain on active military duty, the White House said.  Trump also said Keith Kellogg, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant general who has been serving as the acting national security adviser, as chief of staff to the National Security Council. John Bolton, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, would be asked to serve the administration in another capacity, Trump said. He has a good number of ideas that I must tell you I agree very much with, Trump said of Bolton, who served in Republican President George W. Bushs administration.   Kellogg and Bolton were among those in contention as Trump spent the long Presidents Day weekend considering his options for replacing Flynn. His first choice, retired Vice Admiral Robert Harward, turned down the job last week. McMaster, 54, is a West Point graduate known as H.R., with a Ph.D. in U.S. history from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He was listed as one of Time magazines 100 most influential people in 2014, partly because of his willingness to buck the system. A combat veteran, he gained renown in the first Gulf War - and was awarded a Silver Star - after he commanded a small troop of the U.S. 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment that destroyed a much larger Iraqi Republican Guard force in 1991 in a place called 73 Easting, for its map coordinates, in what many consider the biggest tank battle since World War Two. As one fellow officer put it, referring to Trumps inner circle of aides and speaking on condition of anonymity, the Trump White House has its own Republican Guard, which may be harder for him to deal with than the Iraqis were. The Iraqi Republican Guard was the elite military force of ousted dictator Saddam Hussein. Trump relies on a tight, insular group of advisers, who at times appear to have competing political agendas. Senior adviser Steve Bannon has asserted his influence by taking a seat on the National Security Council.   McMasters fame grew after his 1997 book Dereliction of Duty criticized the countrys military and political leadership for poor leadership during the Vietnam War. Trumps pick was praised by one of the presidents strongest backers in the U.S. Congress, Republican Senator Tom Cotton, who called McMaster one of the finest combat leaders of our generation and also a great strategic mind.  In a July 14, 2014, interview with the Columbus Ledger-Enquirer in Columbus, Georgia, where Fort Benning is located, McMaster, then the base commander, said: Some people have a misunderstanding about the Army. Some people think, hey, youre in the military and everything is super-hierarchical and youre in an environment that is intolerable of criticism and people dont want frank assessments. I think the opposite is the case. ... And the commanders that Ive worked for, they want frank assessments, they want criticism and feedback. That attitude was not always shared by his superiors, and it led to his being passed over for promotion to brigadier general twice, in 2006 and 2007. On McMasters third and last try, General David Petraeus  who at one point was also on Trumps candidate list for national security adviser  returned from Iraq to head the promotion board that finally gave McMaster his first generals star. Then a colonel, McMaster was commander of the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment that in the spring of 2005 captured, held and began to stabilize Tal Afar on the Iraqi-Syrian border. The city was held by Sunni extremists, a crossing point between Syria and Iraq for jihadists who started as al-Qaeda in Mesopotamia under Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and morphed into Islamic State after he was killed. McMasters preparation of the regiment is legendary: He trained his soldiers in Iraqi culture, the differences among Sunnis, Shiites and Turkomen, and had them read books on the history of the region and counterinsurgency strategy. It was a sharp change from the kill and capture tactics the United States had used in Iraq since the invasion in March 2003, and to which the Obama administration returned in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. The strategy was largely a success, although McMasters use of it and especially his willingness to acknowledge that Iraqis had some legitimate grievances against one another and the occupying coalition forces, did not endear him to his superiors and helped delay his promotion to brigadier general. The strategy did not survive the departure of McMasters troops, with Tal Afar falling into the hands of Sunni militants. Along with the west part of Mosul, it is now a key objective in the battle to rid Iraq of Islamic State.

Bannon, these people said, signalled to Germanys ambassador to Washington that he viewed the EU as a flawed construct and favoured conducting relations with Europe on a bilateral basis. Three people who were briefed on the meeting spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. The German government and the ambassador, Peter Wittig, declined to comment, citing the confidentiality of the talks. A White House official who checked with Bannon in response to a Reuters query confirmed the meeting had taken place but said the account provided to Reuters was inaccurate. They only spoke for about three minutes and it was just a quick hello, the official said. The sources described a longer meeting in which Bannon took the time to spell out his world view. They said his message was similar to the one he delivered to a Vatican conference back in 2014 when he was running the right-wing website Breitbart News. In those remarks, delivered via Skype, Bannon spoke favourably about European populist movements and described a yearning for nationalism by people who dont believe in this kind of pan-European Union. Western Europe, he said at the time, was built on a foundation of strong nationalist movements, adding: I think its what can see us forward. The encounter unsettled people in the German government, in part because some officials had been holding out hope that Bannon might temper his views once in government and offer a more nuanced message on Europe in private. One source briefed on the meeting said it had confirmed the view that Germany and its European partners must prepare for a policy of hostility towards the EU.  A second source expressed concern, based on his contacts with the administration, that there was no appreciation for the EUs role in ensuring peace and prosperity in post-war Europe. There appears to be no understanding in the White House that an unravelling of the EU would have grave consequences, the source said. The White House said there was no transcript of the conversation. The sources who had been briefed on it described it as polite and stressed there was no evidence Trump was prepared to go beyond his rhetorical attacks on the EU - he has repeatedly praised Britains decision to leave - and take concrete steps to destabilise the bloc. But anxiety over the White House stance led French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault and Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman of the Munich Security Conference, to issue unusual calls last week for Pence to affirm during his visit to Europe that the U.S. was not aiming to break up the EU. Pence obliged on Monday in Brussels, pledging strong ties between the United States and the EU, and making clear his message was shared by the president. President Trump and I look forward to working together with you and the European Union to deepen our political and economic partnership, he said. But the message did not end the concerns in European capitals. We are worried and we should be worried, Thomas Matussek, senior adviser at Flint Global and a former German ambassador to the Britain and the United Nations, told Reuters. No one knows anything at the moment about what sort of decisions will be coming out of Washington. But it is clear that the man on top and the people closest to him feel that its the nation state that creates identity and not what they see as an amorphous group of countries like the EU. With elections looming in the Netherlands, France and Germany this year, European officials said they hoped Pence, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson could convince Trump to work constructively with the EU. The worst-case scenario from Europes point of view was described by Ischinger in an article published last week, entitled How Europe should deal with Trump. He said that if the U.S. administration actively supported right-wing populists in the looming election campaigns it would trigger a major transatlantic crisis.

We need a party thats open to progressive forces, and thats why we have to elect progressive leadership within the party, Green said, while attending the Michigan Democratic Partys spring convention in Detroit earlier this month.   Membership in the DSA, founded in 1982, has surged since Trumps election on Nov. 8, putting the movement in a position to make inroads on the Democratic Partys energized left. The membership gains are fueled by supporters of Bernie Sanders, the U.S. Senator from Vermont who sought the Democratic presidential nomination last year.  The DSA is not a political party, but it supports many of the same short-term policy positions as the Sanders wing of the Democratic Party: a $15 minimum wage, single-payer healthcare, free college, and opposition to free-trade deals.   But unlike most mainstream Democrats, the DSA also has a long-term vision of a democratic socialist society in the vein of countries like Sweden and Denmark, where workers have a more direct say in how their jobs and the economy are run, alongside a more robust public sector. Since November, national membership has almost tripled to about 17,000. Its leaders have said meetings are packed and new chapters are cropping up nationwide, including in Rust Belt states such as Michigan, Wisconsin and Ohio, where Trump scored upset wins over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton to take the White House.   The DSAs membership is tiny in the grand picture. In the 31 states plus the District of Columbia where party registrations are tallied, the Democratic Party alone has about 45 million members.   Hans Noel, a political scientist at Georgetown University,  said while the DSAs numbers remain small, its growth reflects a trend of the Democratic Partys left wing gaining clout after Clintons loss. Many analysts said her defeat was at least partly due to her inability to win over Sanders supporters.   Noel notes the election this coming weekend of a new chair for the Democratic National Committee, seen as a dead heat between Sanders supporter Keith Ellison, whom DSA supports, and Clinton supporter Tom Perez. Noel said it is not only a key inflection point but also a demonstration of the progressive blocs newfound power.   Theyre doing more mobilization and organization within the party ... all of the candidates now feel this is a wing of the party they feel they have to take seriously, Noel said in an interview. That kind of action is probably going to play out in internal party conflict over the next two to three years.   The surge has buoyed the spirits of DSA officials including national director Maria Svart, who says the surge in new members began immediately after Trumps victory.   The day after the election, our membership coordinator turned to me when she looked at her computer in the morning and said I can see the moment when Donald Trump announced that hed won, Svart said. People started joining online in massive numbers.   Trumps election has galvanized not only the DSA but other left-leaning political groups. Since the Jan. 20 inauguration, protests against his policies and pronouncements have drawn tens of thousands of people nearly every weekend, providing new opportunities for the DSA and other groups to attract supporters. Were not going to work within the Democratic Party, but were not going to work totally outside it either, Svart said in an interview, adding that the DSA would eventually like to run its own candidates for office.   At the Michigan Democratic Convention, Green and his DSA chapter were successful in getting several members elected to the Michigan Democratic Partys state central committee for the first time in over two decades. In January, Sanders supporters in California managed to elect a majority of delegates to that states party leadership.   State politics is where a lot of policy is done so it matters whos running for these offices, Georgetowns Noel said. Control over who gets to be candidates is huge and these people have control over that in these positions. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

France has a readiness to deploy that is hard to match. Spain was leading NATOs new spearhead force last year. Italy is in Afghanistan, said one senior European NATO diplomat. That isnt already reflected by spending targets.  While Germany says Trump has a point about Europes drop in defense spending since the fall of the Soviet Union, Berlin and the European Commission also say Washington should take note that the EU is the worlds biggest aid donor, spending some 56 billion euros ($58.99 billion) a year. The United States spends about 1 percent of its federal budget on foreign aid, or about $50 billion, but that also includes running diplomatic missions and giving academic grants, according to the U.S. State Department. The European Union says most of its aid goes to the worlds poorest countries. Germany deserves recognition for the 30 to 40 billion euros  ($32 to $42 billion) it is spending to integrate over a million refugees, many of whom were displaced as a result of failed Western policy, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said. At a NATO summit in Wales in 2014, months after Russias annexation of Ukraines Crimean peninsula, allies agreed to end years of defense cuts that left Europeans without vital capabilities, such as refueling airborne fighter bombers. They agreed all allies should reach the target of spending 2 percent of economic output on defense every year by 2024, although the goal is not legally binding. It aims to reverse a trend that saw defense research spending in the European Union fall by a third, or more than 20 billion euros, since 2006. Only the United States, Britain, Poland, Estonia and Greece met the target in 2016, although the cuts have stopped and Latvia, Lithuania and Romania are close, NATO officials say. NATOs 22 European allies and Canada will spend almost 4 percent more, or some 10 billion euros, on defense this year and Germanys increases account for some 20 percent of that. There is no European push to change the NATO target and NATO officials say the 2 percent target will remain politically useful, if not economically viable.  Reaching the 2 percent target could cost NATOs European members $96 billion per year, according to think tank Bruegel. U.S. governments have been pressing Europeans to increase spending on their armed forces for decades, but Trump signaled a much tougher approach, suggesting on the campaign trail to make U.S. support conditional on meeting NATO commitments.  He has since given his full support to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, but complained this month that Europeans have been very unfair to us, for not spending more on defense. Pence maintained the pressure at NATO on Monday, telling allies they had until the end of this year to show real progress on spending. Pence cited his spending message as one of the successes of his debut Europe trip, diplomats said. Europeans say the biggest issue is how money is spent.  Spurred on by Britains decision to leave the European Union, Germany and France are leading plans to build a so-called European Defense Union that would allow countries to develop and share military assets together, as well as deploying troops. Collectively the European Union is the worlds second-biggest military spender. But fears in Britain of an EU army  held back collaboration.  Governments spent in isolation and missed out on savings worth 25 billion euros a year, according to EU data. Trumps ultimatum is also still hypothetical, Pence said.   Asked what if Europeans did not spend more, he said: I dont know what the answer is to: or else. But I know that the patience of the American people will not endure forever.

Senator Thad Cochran is the only Republican among five U.S. senators and a U.S. representative on a three-day visit to the Communist-run Caribbean island to discuss relations and explore business opportunities. The agreements were signed during a business forum to explore future trade attended by Cochran. There is great potential for business between these ports and Cuba due to the geographical proximity and the excellent fluvial and maritime ways Mississippi has, state-run media quoted Maria de la Luz BHamel, director of commercial policy with the United States at the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Trade and Investment, as saying. The event was closed to foreign journalists. The congressional delegation arrived on Sunday and is being led by Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, who was instrumental in efforts to normalize relations under former Democratic President Barack Obama. Cuba watchers are looking closely for signs of how the fragile U.S. detente with Cuba will fare under the new Trump administration. The Republican president has threatened to scrap moves to normalize relations, one of Obamas signature foreign policy initiatives, if he does not get a better deal. Port authorities along the U.S. southern coast are strong proponents of increased trade and travel with Cuba, and some have expressed interest in using Mariel, located on the northwest coast of Cuba, as a transshipment hub. Similar agreements were signed last month with Virginia, Louisiana and Alabama.

Yiannopoulos, in a Facebook video post, denied he ever condoned pedophilia and said one video of him was edited to give a misleading impression. Yiannopoulos, a Briton who is celebrated by some arch conservatives, was banned from Twitter last year after making highly controversial statements. He has infuriated liberals with provocative comments on race, religion and sex and appears to delight in his ability to offend.   The chairman of the American Conservative Union, which sponsors the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, said on Sunday the group rescinded an invitation to this years Wednesday-Saturday event due to the revelation of an offensive video in the past 24 hours condoning pedophilia. We realize that Mr. Yiannopoulos has responded on Facebook, but it is insufficient, Matt Schlapp, chairman of the union, said in the Twitter post. CPAC is a high-profile annual gathering of conservative activists. President Donald Trump is among the scheduled speakers this year along with Vice President Mike Pence, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and senior Trump adviser Stephen Bannon. Yiannopoulos is also an editor for the right-wing Breitbart News, which Bannon once headed.  Earlier this month, the University of California canceled Yiannopoulos speaking engagement on the Berkeley campus when violent protests against his appearance broke out. Trump, in response, threatened on Twitter to cut off federal funding for the university. The latest controversy stems from a video in which Yiannopoulos seems to suggest the standard for pedophilia is whether the younger partner has gone through puberty. At another point in the video, however, Yiannopoulos says the established age of consent, which is 16 to 18 years old in the United States, is about right. In his Facebook statement on Monday, Yiannopoulos denied condoning pedophilia. I find those crimes to be absolutely disgusting. I find those people to be disgusting, he said, while expressing regret he used the word boys instead of young men while discussing the benefits of relationships between men with large age differences. Book publisher Simon & Schuster said it canceled the publication of Yiannopoulos book Dangerous, which was due out on June 13. After careful consideration @simonschuster and its @threshold_books have cancelled publication of Dangerous by Milo Yiannopoulos, spokesman Adam Rothberg said on Twitter.

A month after Donald Trump caused alarm by renewing his endorsement of Brexit and suggesting others may follow Britain out of the EU, Pence told reporters that he had come to the home of the European Union with a message from the president. Speaking of a strong commitment ... to continue cooperation and partnership with the European Union, Pence added: Whatever our differences, our two continents share the same heritage, the same values and above all, the same purpose to promote peace and prosperity through freedom, democracy and the rule of law. At a later meeting at NATO across town, he made clear that U.S. support for the Transatlantic defense alliance had a price, though; Trump, he said, expects real progress from European governments by the end of the year in increasing their spending on military budgets closer to a NATO target of 2 percent of GDP. Donald Tusk, who chairs the European Council of EU leaders, told reporters that Pence had given him affirmative answers to three questions on Trumps support for: the current system of international law, NATO and the idea of a united Europe. Reports of the death of the West have been greatly exaggerated, Tusk said, in a nod to American writer Mark Twain. EU officials said they were encouraged by what they called Pences clear assurances, including on U.S. backing for holding the European Union together after Brexit, though they will watch closely to see how far Trumps actions match his deputys words. We got everything we were looking for, one official said. Pence noted the building of common European institutions after World War Two and said: With this union and in cooperation with the United States, history will attest that when the United States and Europe are peaceful and prosperous, we do advance the peace and prosperity of all the world. Echoing comments he made over the weekend in Germany, Pence also addressed worries in Europe over Trumps suggestion that the NATO defense pact was obsolete; Washington, he said, was committed to defending the sovereignty and territory of European states and holding Russia to account for its actions in Ukraine. Pence also repeated Trumps belief that common ground could be established with Russia after years of confrontation. Tusk, a former Polish premier who was jailed in the 1980s for opposing Soviet control, seized on Pences personal memories of a youthful visit to divided Berlin to remind the new administration of the value that Europeans attach to Cold War support from an earlier Republican president, Ronald Reagan. Europeans are concerned that Trump may prefer bilateral ties with European powers rather than working with the Union. Pence spoke of cooperation, including against Islamist violence: The safety and security of your union and our people depends on that increased collaboration on the global fight against terrorism. EU officials said Pence, the former governor of Indiana, had seemed confident in his new role. One said he sought to assure them Trumps very American, direct style should not be taken as hostile or reflect a push to isolate the United States.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - One of Rex Tillersons first directives as U.S. secretary of state was an order to senior staff that his briefing materials not exceed two pages. It was a reflection of Tillersons management style honed at the helm of Exxon Mobil, an oil company known for its relentless focus on efficiency, and one reason his closest aides at the State Department refer to him as the CEO rather than the Secretary.  More than a dozen current and former U.S. officials familiar with briefing procedures said Tillersons predecessors would typically request far more detailed information. His aide R.C. Hammond said the directive reflected Tillersons focus on key facts rather than lack of interest in finer points of foreign policy.  He is asking people to be efficient with their information, Hammond said, adding that if Tillerson needed more information he would ask for it. He is a decision-maker and he needs the facts in front of him. As a first-time government official with no prior diplomatic experience, Tillerson faces close scrutiny over how successful he will be in managing both the State Department bureaucracy and its relations with Donald Trump and his administration. Senior State Department officials who have attended meetings with Tillerson say they find him sociable and a man of substance, whose direct manner and probing questions reflect his training as an engineer seeking to solve problems rather than play politics. The veteran oil executive also made a good impression on his first foreign trip to a Group of 20 summit in Bonn, Germany, last week. Four senior diplomats who met him told Reuters they were relieved to find that he was pragmatic and open to dialogue.  Yet a key concern for U.S. diplomats is how effective his team can be in shaping foreign policy in the new administration. Just two State Department positions of 116 key posts requiring executive branch nomination have been filled, according to the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service - Tillersons and that of U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.  For example, Tillerson still has no deputy after Trump rejected his top choice, Elliott Abrams. People want to back him, one veteran senior official said  about the former Exxon Mobil boss. But people are feeling that this building is being stripped, said the official, referring to a sense that with so many top positions vacant, the State Department is not fully equipped to help make policy in the new administration. There is also unease over possible deep staff cuts and the future of some departments. Two people said employees in the Bureau of Management and Resources were told to apply for other positions within the State Department. Hammond, Tillersons aide said no decision had been taken to close that division.       On one recent matter of longstanding U.S. foreign policy, Tillerson appeared to be sidelined. On Feb. 14, while Tillerson was at a dinner with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a State Department dining room, news headlines emerged suggesting the United States was backing away from supporting a two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians. The two-state solution is the bedrock of the international communitys policy for a settlement between Israel and the Palestinians, but Trump suggested last week he was open to abandoning it if both sides agree. No one had been informed of any changes in policy and the Secretary was about to leave on his first major trip, said one senior State Department official, referring to Tillersons visit to Bonn. Tillersons acting deputy Tom Shannon also did not take part in Trumps meeting with Netanyahu at the White House the following day when his boss was on his way to Europe, according to one U.S. official. It was unclear whether Tillerson had been left out of the loop deliberately or by accident, said two officials.  A White House official told Reuters he did not know whether Tillerson was briefed in advance. In response to broader concerns about communication between the State Department and the new administration, he said both coordinated very well. There are open lines of communications in both directions, the official, who declined to be named, said. The White House and the State Department coordinate closely across a full range of issues that concern both organizations.To be sure, on another important issue, Tillerson had his say in persuading Trump to back Washingtons stance on One China policy, which acknowledges Beijings position that Taiwan is part of it. Trump has in the past appeared to question whether the United States would continue to respect that. Hammond said Tillerson was on the phone with Trump several times a day.  This is the general style of the president to have quick check-ins with people, get peoples advice on things, he said. Information for CEOs flows up, and as a former CEO (Tillerson) understands that. Tillerson has said little publicly since he started and his aides are quick to draw a contrast between him and predecessor John Kerry, a former senator and presidential candidate who reveled in extensive foreign travel and deal making. Tillerson is not John Kerry, it is unfair to compare the two, said Hammond. He will quietly go about his job as a counselor and advisor to the president. For Tillersons State Department the concern is how to maintain a similar degree of communication with an administration grappling with a succession of crises, nine officials involved in foreign policy and security issues, said. Over the past month the White House has faced legal setbacks over its immigration orders, the resignation of Trumps national security adviser and an investigation into possible links between his campaign and Russian intelligence. Mondays resignation of Michael Flynn, who served as Trumps national security adviser for just 24 days, in particular created a vacuum at the National Security Council, which acts  as a key partner for the State Department in formulating Washingtons foreign policy.

Trump interviewed four finalists on Sunday and may meet with some of them again on Monday, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters. The president interviewed acting adviser Keith Kellogg, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster and Lieutenant General Robert Caslen at his Mar-a-Lago resort. We may have some additional meetings and names tomorrow, and may also meet with a couple of those people again, Sanders said in Florida. Trump returns to Washington on Monday. The national security adviser is one of the most senior jobs at the White House, holding broad influence over U.S. foreign policy across the globe and presiding over the National Security Council staff. White House officials made clear on Sunday that the new adviser would have autonomy over staffing decisions, an issue that has been reported to have thwarted some other candidates. Trumps first choice to fill the job after Flynns departure, Vice Admiral Robert Harward, turned it down, citing family and financial reasons. Another potential choice, David Petraeus, a retired general and former CIA chief who resigned in 2012 over an extramarital affair, was cut from the presidents short list. Sources familiar with the candidates thinking said they both wanted control over staffing of their team, and Trump was reluctant to grant that authority. White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus denied the reports that Harward and Petraeus wanted more control than Trump was prepared to give, and said in an interview on Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace that the new adviser can do whatever he or she wants to do with the staffing. He said the issue never came up in discussions with Harward and they hadnt really gone down the road with Petraeus. The White House confirmed that Craig Deare, the NSCs senior director for Western Hemisphere Affairs, had left that role. Politico reported that he was dismissed for criticizing the president and his top aides. He was just sent back to his original position, so he wasnt fired, Sanders said. Deare is on the faculty of the National Defense University. Asked if government employees should be concerned that they would lose their jobs if they criticized Trump, Sanders said: I dont think that any person that is there in order to carry out the presidents agenda should be against the presidents agenda. The national security adviser is an independent aide to the president and does not require confirmation by the U.S. Senate. The role has varied from administration to administration, but the adviser attends National Security Council meetings along with the heads of the State Department, the Department of Defense and key security agencies.  Trump has added Steve Bannon, his chief White House strategist, as a regular attendee of NSC meetings.

Security Council resolutions by testing ballistic missiles and acting to destabilise the Middle East, a U.S. senator said Sunday. I think it is now time for the Congress to take Iran on directly in terms of what theyve done outside the nuclear program, Senator Lindsey Graham, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told the Munich Security Conference. Graham said he and other Republicans would introduce measures to hold Iran accountable for its actions.     Tensions between Tehran and Washington have risen since an  Iranian ballistic missile test that prompted U.S. President Donald Trumps administration to impose sanctions on individuals and entities linked to the countrys Revolutionary Guards. Iran is a bad actor in the greatest sense of the word when it comes to the region. To Iran, I say, if you want us to treat you differently then stop building missiles, test-firing them in defiance of U.N. resolution and writing Death to Israel on the missile. Thats a mixed message, Graham said. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif told the conference earlier on Sunday that Iran did not respond well to sanctions or threats. James Jones, a former Supreme Allied Commander in Europe and President Barack Obamas first national security adviser, told a separate event in Munich that he remained convinced that sanctions had persuaded Iran to negotiate the 2015 landmark deal with six world powers to curb its nuclear program. The sanctions did work. Iran would never have come to the negotiating table without sanctions, Jones said. This is a new form of response that if properly utilized can change behavior and get people to do things that they otherwise wouldnt do. Senator Christopher Murphy, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told the same panel there was nothing preventing Congress from imposing sanctions beyond those that were lifted as a result of the 2016 nuclear agreement with Iran. Murphy, a Democrat, said had backed the nuclear deal in the explicit understanding that it would not prevent Congress from taking actions against Iran outside the nuclear issue. Theres going to be a conversation about what the proportional response is, Murphy said, referring to Irans missile test. But I dont necessarily think theres going to be partisan division over whether or not we have the ability as a Congress to speak on issues outside of the nuclear agreement. Murphy said the United States needed to decide whether it wanted to take a broader role in the regional conflict. We have to make a decision whether we are going to get involved in the emerging proxy war in a bigger way than we are today, between Iran and Saudi, he said.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Department of Homeland Security has prepared new guidance for immigration agents aimed at speeding up deportations by denying asylum claims earlier in the process.  The new guidelines, contained in a draft memo dated February 17 but not yet sent to field offices, directs agents to only pass applicants who have a good chance of ultimately getting asylum, but does not give specific criteria for establishing credible fear of persecution if sent home.   The guidance instructs asylum officers to \""elicit all relevant information\"" in determining whether an applicant has \""credible fear\"" of persecution if returned home, the first obstacle faced by migrants on the U.S.-Mexico border requesting asylum. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2m4aPAs) Three sources familiar with the drafting of the guidance said the goal of the new instructions is to raise the bar on initial screening in order to ease strain on the courts and reduce the number of immigrants allowed to stay in the United States, often for years, while they await a hearing. The administrations plan is to leave wide discretion to asylum officers by allowing them to determine which applications have a significant possibility of being approved by an immigration court, the sources said. The guidance was first reported and posted on the internet by McClatchy news organization. In 2015, just 18 percent of asylum applicants whose cases were ruled on by immigration judges were granted asylum, according to the Justice Department. Applicants from countries with a high rate of political persecution have a higher chance of winning their asylum cases.  A tougher approach to asylum seekers would be an element of President Donald Trumps promise to crack down on immigration and tighten border security, a cornerstone of his election campaign and a top priority of his first month in office. The guidelines are contained in two draft memos signed by Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and currently under review by the White House, according to two people familiar with them. The memos also outlined plans for greatly expanding the categories of people that immigration agents target for deportation, and gives them wide discretion in deciding who to deport. Previously, recent arrivals and convicted criminals were the prime targets. The new plan would include migrants who have been charged but not convicted of crimes, and would also apply to illegal immigrants who have been in the country for many years. The memos also call for quickly hiring 10,000 more Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents as well as 5,000 more border patrol agents. The DHS declined to comment for this story, referring questions to the White House, which did not respond to a request for comment. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, an applicant must generally demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.   Immigration lawyers say any applicants who appear to meet that criteria in their initial interviews should be allowed to make their cases in court. They oppose encouraging asylum officers to take a stricter stance on questioning claims and rejecting applications.  Interviews to assess credible fear are conducted almost immediately after an asylum request is made, often at the border or in detention facilities by immigration agents or asylum officers, and most applicants easily clear that hurdle. Between July and September of 2016, U.S. asylum officers accepted nearly 88 percent of the claims of credible fear, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services data. Asylum seekers who fail the credible fear test can be quickly deported unless they file an appeal. Currently, those who pass the test are eventually released and allowed to remain in the United States awaiting hearings, which are often scheduled years into the future because of a backlog of more than 500,000 cases in immigration courts. Between October 2015 and April 2016, nearly 50,000 migrants claimed credible fear, 78 percent of whom were from Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala or Mexico, according to statistics from USCIS.  The number of migrants from those three countries who passed credible fear and went to court to make their case for asylum rose sharply between 2011 and 2015, from 13,970 claims to 34,125, according to data from the Justice Department.  Former border patrol chief Mike Fisher credits that trend to advice from immigration lawyers who know asylum officers are going to err on the side of caution and refer most cases to a judge.  The new guidance on asylum seekers is for border personnel implementing Trumps Jan. 25 executive order on tightening U.S. border security.  Among other measures, the presidents directive calls for expediting eligibility claims of those attempting to stay in the United States and promptly deporting those whose claims are rejected. Some immigration officers familiar with the draft guidance say they are concerned that a rapid increase in deportations of asylum seekers could strain overcrowded detention facilities and create transportation problems.  Deportations take time and coordination, even when immigrants are quickly targeted for expulsion. U.S. officials must get approval from a deportees home country before repatriation can take place, and transportation can be complicated and expensive. Immigrants from non-contiguous countries are flown home by plane, while Mexicans are often bused across the border.   Homeland Security personnel who worked on the guidance say they hope to expand detention space by at least 8,000 beds. The money to pay for that would require congressional sign-off. The extra beds, they say, would further the presidents goal, expressed in his executive order on border security, of ending the practice known as catch and release in which migrants, including asylum seekers, are freed pending a court hearing. The new guidance calls for expanding detention, but acknowledges that ending the practice may not be immediately possible.  A congressional aide familiar with the administrations plans said DHS is considering expanding its contracts with private prison companies like GEO Group (GEO.N) and CoreCivic (CXW.N), which currently hold most immigrant detainees. Immigrants rights advocates say they fear that raising the bar on the credible fear test could screen out migrants with a rightful claim to asylum, because asylum officers may dismiss cases that could make it through court if the asylum seeker were given legal counsel, said Marielena Hincapie, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center.     Asylum applicants have the right to appeal denials of credible fear claims and may request to see a judge to assert their claim to be in the United States for other reasons, such as family ties. For that reason, raising the bar on credible fear might not deter asylum seekers as much as the Trump administration hopes, said former border patrol head Fisher.

Mattis, a retired Marine general seen as one of the most influential voices in Trumps cabinet, did not mention his boss by name. But asked about Trumps Tweet on Friday that branded the media as Americas enemy, Mattis took a different position entirely. Ive had some rather contentious times with the press. But no, the press, as far as Im concerned, are a constituency that we deal with, he told reporters traveling with him in the United Arab Emirates. And I dont have any issues with the press, myself, Mattis added. Since his Jan. 20 inauguration, Trump has fiercely criticized various news outlets that have reported unflattering revelations of dysfunction or other problems in the White House.  He has described them as lying, corrupt and failing, and late on Friday he said the news media was the enemy of the American people.  Asked about the latest salvo, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus told CBSs Face the Nation program, I think you should take (Trumps Twitter statement) seriously. Certainly we would never condone violence. But I do think that we condone critical thought, Priebus said, adding the media, in some cases, needed to get its act together. Mattis spoke after talks with European leaders at a security conference in Munich, Germany, where U.S. Senator John McCain warned that suppressing the free press was how dictators get started. If you want to preserve democracy as we know it, you have to have a free and many times adversarial press. And without it, I am afraid that we would lose so much of our individual liberties over time, McCain told NBCs Meet the Press program on Sunday. On Friday McCain told the Munich forum that the resignation of Trumps national security adviser, Michael Flynn, over his contacts with Russia reflected disarray in Washington. But Mattis played down any concerns about the reshuffling within the administration. Welcome to democracy. Its at times wildly contentious, its at times quite sporting. But the bottom line is this is the best form of government that we can come up with, he said. Mattis added that the military was very ready to hold the line as the political process played out. We dont have any disarray inside the military and thats where my responsibility lies, he said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Were putting our thoughts together now, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters in Abu Dhabi during his debut trip to the Middle East. U.S. General John Nicholson, the commander of U.S. and international troops in Afghanistan, said this month the NATO-led force in Afghanistan had enough troops to carry out counterterrorism missions but had a shortfall of a few thousand for its major role of advising Afghan security forces. Mattis said he spoke for several hours on Sunday via video-link with Nicholson, but did not disclose whether he was in favor of sending more U.S. forces there. Mattis also said he spoke with Ghani at length before leaving Munich, Germany, on Saturday. So far, Trump has offered little clarity about whether he will approve more forces for Afghanistan, where some 8,400 U.S. troops remain more than 15 years after the Islamist Taliban government was toppled.  Hes waiting for my assessment and the assessment from the intelligence community and hes open to my advice on it, Mattis said. But first of all Ive got to formulate where I stand. Afghan government forces control no more than two-thirds of national territory, and have struggled to contain the Taliban insurgency since the bulk of NATO soldiers withdrew at the end of 2014. The government is also struggling with other militants, particularly from Islamic States Afghanistan branch. Islamic State claimed responsibility for a suicide attack that killed at least 22 people on Feb. 7 outside Afghanistans Supreme Court. A number of provincial capitals have been under pressure from the Taliban and Afghan government forces have been suffering high casualty rates, with more than 5,500 killed in the first eight months of 2016. The Afghan security forces paid a very heavy price to keep the Taliban on their back foot. But they paid it, they held, Mattis said. And the Talibans in a worse position today, even though I do not equate that to success on our side. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

(Reuters) - President Donald Trump, after a rocky first month in office, returned to the campaign trail on Saturday to deliver another attack on the media and tout his White House accomplishments in the friendly and familiar atmosphere of a rally with supporters. Landing on Air Force One as the sun set near a hangar filled with thousands of people, Trump reveled in the crowd and listed promises he had kept, including starting the process of building a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico, deporting bad people, and pulling the country out of a trade agreement with Asian nations. Life is a campaign. Making our country great again is a campaign, he told reporters on Air Force One ahead of the rally, when asked about criticism that he was starting to campaign already. The rally marks an especially early start to the 2020 race for the White House. Trump filed re-election papers with the Federal Election Commission five hours after he was sworn in as president on Jan. 20. He does not have an opponent or even a field of Democrats yet vying to run for their partys presidential nomination. The businessman-turned-politican told the crowd he wanted to speak to them without the filter of fake news, his standard critique of journalists and media organizations that cover him. Im here because I want to be among my friends and among the people, he said. We are not going to let the fake news tell us what to do, how to live, or what to believe.     The White House has been unhappy with stories portraying Trumps first weeks as chaotic.  His short tenure has been marked by turmoil over a contentious executive order limiting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries and the resignation of his national security adviser. The abrupt departure of Michael Flynn followed revelations that he had discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia with the Russian ambassador to the United States before Trump took office and misled Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations. Members of the audience expressed delight in Trumps performance in office. I want him to know that we support him, said Carmela Rocheleau, 33, a registered nurse from Port St. Lucie, Florida, who attended Trumps rally. Everybody is going against him and I want him to know that we care about all the hard work that hes doing because it seems like everybody attacks him for anything and nobody shows him any good credit, she said. Gene Huber, 47, a car salesman from West Palm Beach, Florida, had been waiting in line to see Trump since 4 a.m. His excitement and the love that he shows us, the people, thats why each day brought me stronger and closer to him, Huber said.   In an unusual move, Trump allowed Huber to join him on stage and address the crowd during the rally. He acknowledged later that the move probably did not please the Secret Service. At one point, Trump also read aloud the federal statute at issue in the litigation challenging his immigration executive order, while again criticizing the appellate panel that blocked its enforcement.  He pledged a revised order would come in a matter of days. We dont give up, Trump said. We never give up.  Trump also heavily criticized Senate Democrats for holding up confirmation of his cabinet nominees. Theyre doing the wrong thing for the American people, he said.  But after a speech filled with attacks on the media and his opponents, the president tried to close on a unifying note.  Let us move past the differences of party and find a new loyalty rooted deeply in our country, Trump told the crowd. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Pence and Yildirim met on the sidelines of a security conference in Munich, Germany, and discussed improving ties, boosting cooperation in the fight against terrorism and the need to work together to find a permanent solution in Syria. Yildirim told Pence that moves by the United States to meet Turkeys demands over Fethullah Gulen, a U.S.-based cleric blamed by Ankara for masterminding and orchestrating a failed coup last July, would pave the way for a fresh start in relations. Ties between the United States and Turkey - which has the second largest army in the NATO alliance and is key to the U.S.-led fight against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq - have deteriorated sharply since the failed military coup. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and the government want Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since 1999, extradited. Gulen denies involvement in the coup attempt. Ankara has also been angered by U.S. support for a Kurdish militia group fighting Islamic State in Syria. Turkey sees the group as an extension of the outlawed PKK, which has waged a three-decade insurgency for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey and has been behind a spate of recent bombings.

The international order established after World War Two was built in part on a free press, McCain said in an excerpt of an interview with NBCs Meet the Press that was released in advance of the full Sunday morning broadcast.

A free press ... is very important to maintaining democracy, and efforts on the part of a president to undermine and manipulate the press are very dangerous. The comments from U.S. lawmakers followed Trumps tweet and came days after the president held a raucous news conference at which he repeatedly criticized news reports about disorder in the White House and leaks of his telephone conversations with the leaders of Mexico and Australia.

Two sources familiar with the plans told Reuters the documents have been approved by Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly, but are under final review by the White House. They are expected to be released to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) early next week.  Under the orders, hundreds of thousands of people would face expedited removal proceedings, including those that had not been prioritized for deportation under former President Barack Obama.  The memos are guidance to instruct agents in the field to implement two executive orders signed by Trump on Jan. 25 intended to deter future migration and drive out more illegal migrants from the United States.  One memo instructs ICE agents to ignore Obamas memos on immigration priorities that targeted only recent arrivals and convicted criminal migrants for deportation. Instead, migrants who have been charged with crimes but not convicted would be prioritized for deportation. The guidance also allows ICE agents wide discretion in deciding who to deport and considers anyone in the United States illegally to be subject to deportation.  The guidance does leave in place Obamas 2012 executive action that protected 750,000 people brought to the United States illegally by their parents. The fate of the policy, known as DACA, has been hotly debated within the White House, according to sources familiar with the discussions. Trump said in a news conference Friday that DACA was a very difficult subject for him. The ICE memo also states that immigrants will not be afforded rights under U.S. privacy laws.  The second memo instructs CBP officers to crack down on illegal migration at the border by holding migrants in detention until a determination in their case is made.  The Department of Homeland Security did not deny any information contained in the draft memos but did not provide further detail.  A source familiar with the guidance said the memos were scheduled to be distributed on Friday but the White House made a last-minute request to review them. It is not known whether the White House may alter the guidance.  Kelly said in one of the memos that illegal immigration across the U.S. border with Mexico had created a significant national security vulnerability to the United States.

In Pences first major foreign policy address for the Trump administration, he told European leaders that he spoke for Trump when he promised unwavering commitment to the NATO alliance.  Today, on behalf of President Trump, I bring you this assurance: the United States of America strongly supports NATO and will be unwavering in our commitment to this transatlantic alliance, Pence told the Munich Security Conference, offering greetings from the president. But he also repeated U.S. calls for more defense spending in return: As you keep faith with us, under President Trump we will always keep faith with you. While Polands defense minister praised Pence, many others, including Frances foreign minister and U.S. lawmakers in Munich, remained skeptical that he had convinced his allies that Trump would stand by Europe.   Trumps contradictory remarks on the value of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, scepticism over the 2015 deal to curb Irans nuclear ambitions and an apparent disregard for the future of the European Union have left Europe fearful for the seven-decade-old U.S. guardianship of the West. After Pence spoke, former NATO deputy secretary general Alexander Vershbow, who is American, summed up the mood, telling Reuters: Many in this hall are still asking if this is the real policy. Pence, whose meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel was described by German aides as very friendly, also marked out a divide on Iran, which the European Union sees as a business opportunity following the nuclear deal.  Pence called Tehran the leading state sponsor of terrorism, language never used by European officials. Pences strident vow to consign Islamist militants to the ash-heap of history also raised eyebrows, European officials said. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly defended Trumps directive suspending travel to the United States by citizens of seven mostly Muslim countries, since blocked by U.S judges, which was condemned by EU governments. Kelly said he would produce a tighter, more streamlined version soon, saying: We need to find ways to vet in a more reliable way to satisfy us that people coming to the United States are coming for the right reasons.  French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault expressed  disappointment that Pences speech did not mention the European Union, although the vice president will take his message to EU headquarters in Brussels on Monday. I hope that we will have a clear response (in Brussels) ... because Donald Trump has said he was overjoyed by the Brexit and that there would be others, Ayrault said, referring to Britains decision to leave the European Union. U.S. Senator Chris Murphy, a member of the opposition Democrats, said he welcomed Pences address but saw two rival governments emerging from the Trump administration.  Pence, Trumps Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and his foreign minister Rex Tillerson all delivered messages of reassurance on their debut trip to Europe. But events in Washington, including a news conference in which Trump branded accredited White House reporters dishonest people, sowed more confusion. I like a lot of what I heard from Vice President Pence, Murphy told Reuters. Its just hard to square that speech with everything Donald Trump is doing and saying, citing an assault on the free press. The resignation of Trumps security adviser Michael Flynn over his contacts with Russia on the eve of the U.S. charm offensive in Europe also tarnished the message Pence, Mattis and Tillerson were seeking to send, officials told Reuters. U.S. Republican Senator John McCain, a Trump critic, told the conference on Friday that the new presidents team was in disarray. The United States is Europes biggest trading partner, the biggest foreign investor in the continent and the European Unions partner in almost all foreign policy, as well as the main promoter of European unity for more than 60 years. Pence, citing a trip to Cold War-era West Berlin in his youth, said Trump would uphold the post-World War Two order. This is President Trumps promise: we will stand with Europe today and every day, because we are bound together by the same noble ideals  freedom, democracy, justice and the rule of law, Pence said. Pence received little applause beyond the warm reception he got when he declared his support for NATO. His warning that the time has come to do more on military spending was met with an awkward silence.  The United States provides around 70 percent of the NATO alliances funds. European governments sharply cut defense spending after the fall of the Soviet Union but Russias resurgence as a military power and its seizure of Ukraines Crimean peninsula has started to change that. Baltic states and Poland fear Russia might try a repeat of Crimea elsewhere. Europe believes Moscow is seeking to destabilize governments and influence elections with cyber attacks and fake news, an accusation denied at the conference by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.  Pences tough line on Russia, calling on Moscow to honor the international peace accords that seek to end the conflict in eastern Ukraine, were welcomed by Polish Defence Minister Antoni Macierewicz. Lavrov said after a meeting with his French, German and Ukrainian counterparts that there would be a new ceasefire from Feb. 20. Know this: the United States will continue to hold Russia accountable, even as we search for new common ground, which as you know, President Trump believes can be found, Pence said.

He promised a short phase-in period to make sure that people on the other end dont get on airplanes. But if theyre on an airplane and inbound, theyll be allowed to enter the country. A draft of the replacement executive order shows that the administration aims to put restrictions on citizens of the same seven Muslim-majority countries covered by the initial order, according to the Wall Street Journal, which cites an internal State Department memo. The replacement order could be issued as early as Tuesday, the Journal reported, citing a U.S. government official. The administration would seek to implement the new order a week to two weeks after it is signed, and covers citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, the Journal said. Trumps original order, which he said was meant to head off attacks by Islamist militants, barred people from those same countries from entering for 90 days and excluded all refugees for 120 days, except those from Syria, who were banned indefinitely. The abrupt implementation of the order last month plunged the immigration system into chaos, sparking a wave of criticism from the countries affected, and from Western allies and some of Americas leading corporations, especially technology firms.

When even one ally fails to do their part, it undermines all of our ability to come to each others aid, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence told the Munich Security Conference, even as he assured NATO allies of Washingtons unwavering support. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said Germany remained committed to reaching the NATO target, but that it would be hard to boost its defense budget quickly by the 25 billion euros  ($26.5 billion) that would be required. Germany now spends about 1.2 percent of gross domestic product on the military. He called for a broader approach that also addressed security risks such as climate change, and said Germany should get credit for the 30 to 40 billion euros it is spending to integrate over a million refugees, many of whom were displaced as a result of failed military interventions of the past. We are taking these people in and integrating them and preventing them going to other parts of the world as freedom fighters, Gabriel said. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told the conference that Europe needed to better integrate its fragmented defense industry, but that this remained a political challenge for countries seeking to protect their own industries and jobs.

EU militaries operate 19 types of armored infantry fighting vehicles, compared with one in the United States, while 25 billion euros of defense spending are wasted every year, according to European Commission data. Gabriel also questioned the wisdom of pegging the NATO military spending target to gross domestic product, noting that Greece met the goal, but was having trouble paying its pensions. French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault told the conference that it was important to focus increased spending on equipment needs, rather than military pensions.

McCain, a known Trump critic, told the Munich Security Conference that the resignation of the new presidents security adviser Michael Flynn over his contacts with Russia reflected deep problems in Washington. I think that the Flynn issue obviously is something that shows that in many respects this administration is in disarray and theyve got a lot of work to do, said McCain, even as he praised Trumps defense secretary. The president, I think, makes statements (and) on other occasions contradicts himself. So weve learned to watch what the president does as opposed to what he says, he said. European governments have been unsettled by the signals sent by Trump on a range of foreign policy issues ranging from NATO and Russia to Iran, Israel and European integration. The debut trip to Europe of Trumps Defence Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, to a meeting of G20 counterparts in Bonn, went some way to assuaging concerns as they both took a more traditional U.S. position. But Trump is wrestling with a growing controversy at home about potential ties between his aides and Russia, which he dismissed on Thursday as a ruse and scam perpetrated by a hostile news media. Mattis made clear to allies, both at NATO in Brussels and in Munich, that the United States would not retreat from leadership as the European continent grapples with an assertive Russia, wars in eastern and southern Mediterranean countries and attacks by Islamist militants. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence will address the Munich conference on Saturday with a similar message of reassurance.  Pence will say that Europe is an indispensable partner for the United States, a senior White House foreign policy adviser told reporters.  Mattis told a crowd that included heads of state and more than 70 defense ministers that Trump backed NATO. President Trump came into office and has thrown now his full support to NATO. He too espouses NATOs need to adapt to todays strategic situation for it to remain credible, capable and relevant, Mattis said. Mattis said the United States and its European allies had a shared understanding of the challenges ahead. Trump has alarmed allies by expressing admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin.  Mattis, however, has spoken out strongly against Russia while in Europe. After talks with NATO allies in Brussels on Thursday, he said that he did not believe it would be possible to collaborate militarily with Moscow, at least for now. The Europeans may need more convincing that Washington stands with it on a range of security issues. There is still a lot of uncertainty, Sebastian Kurz, Austrias foreign minister, told reporters. The big topic in Munich is looking to the USA to see which developments to expect next. European intelligence agencies have warned that Russia is also seeking to destabilize governments and influence elections across Europe with cyber attacks, fake news and propaganda and by funding far-right political parties. We should be under no illusions about the step-change in Russian behavior over the last couple of years, even after Crimea, British Defence Minister Michael Fallon said, referring to Moscows 2014 annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula. We have seen a step-change in Russian military aggression, but also in propaganda, in misinformation and a succession of persistent attacks on Western democracies, interference in a whole series of elections including ... the United States. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg held talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Munich, seeing progress on encouraging Moscow to be more open about its military exercises that the alliance says are unpredictable. Russia says it is the Western alliance, not Moscow, that is destabilizing Europe by sending troops to its western borders. We have different views, Stoltenberg said of the crisis in Ukraine, where the West accuses the Kremlin of arming separatist rebels in a conflict that has killed 10,000 people since April 2014. Russia says the conflict is a civil war. In the latest incident, Lithuanian prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation into a false report of rape by German soldiers stationed there on a NATO mission to deter Russia. Mattis, without explicitly citing the case, rallied to the defense of German forces as he spoke in the German city of Munich. I have great respect for Germanys leadership in Europe  and for the ethical performance of your troops on the battlefield, he said. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded last year that Russia hacked and leaked Democratic emails during the election campaign as part of an effort to tilt the vote in Trumps favor. McCain acknowledged concern in Europe and beyond that America was laying down the mantle of global leadership and cited global trends he found disturbing, including hardening resentment toward immigrants and an unwillingness to separate truth from lies.    McCain urged the forum not to give up on the United States.  Make no mistake, my friends: These are dangerous times, but you should not count America out, and we should not count each other out, McCain said.

Such views play well with Gulf Arabs, who hope Trumps administration will check what they see as a surge of Iranian support for paramilitary allies in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Lebanon and for fellow Shiite Muslims in Bahrain and Saudi Arabias oil-producing Eastern Province. The United Arab Emirates is also a key U.S. ally in the fight against al Qaeda in Yemen. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump, scrambling to find a new top security aide after firing his first one and being spurned by another candidate, said on Friday he has four people under consideration including acting national security adviser Keith Kellogg. Trump ousted Michael Flynn on Monday in a controversy over the retired lieutenant generals contacts with Russia. Retired Vice Admiral Robert Harward on Thursday turned down the Republican presidents offer to replace Flynn. General Keith Kellogg, who I have known for a long time, is very much in play for NSA - as are three others, Trump said on Twitter, without naming the other candidates. Former CIA chief David Petraeus was previously identified as a candidate by a White House official. Former U.S. National Security Agency head Keith Alexander and former supreme allied commander in Europe James Jones, who held the national security adviser post under former Democratic President Barack Obama from 2009 to 2010, were also thought to be under consideration. Both are retired generals. Two others also thought to be in contention were former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton and Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster, who holds a senior post with the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command. Kellogg, a retired lieutenant general who is currently chief of staff of the White House National Security Council, accompanied Trump on a trip to South Carolina on Friday before heading to Florida. He stepped into the national security adviser role on an acting basis after Flynns firing. Trump may meet with candidates for the post during his weekend visit to Florida, a White House official told reporters. Petraeus held command posts in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and served as CIA director under Obama. He quit as CIA chief in 2012 and pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of mishandling classified materials relating to documents he had given his biographer, with whom he had an affair. Harward, a senior executive at Lockheed Martin and former Navy SEAL, declined Trumps offer in part because he wanted to bring in his own team, according to two sources familiar with Harwards decision. The White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, told Fox News on Friday that Harwards family didnt sign off on him taking the job. Thats all it is, Priebus said. Richard Haass, who held senior White House and State Department posts under Republican presidents and now heads the Council on Foreign Relations, said on Twitter the new national security advisor should insist on the right to choose staff members and have unlimited access to the president. Haass, who Trump considered for a job in his administration, also called for rescinding a directive from the president that gave Trumps chief White House strategist, Steve Bannon, a seat on the National Security Council, a move condemned by Democrats. Trumps administration has been dealing with the fallout from Flynns departure for much of the week. Flynn, a close adviser to Trump during his presidential campaign last year, was seen by Moscow as a leading advocate of friendlier ties with Russia. Trump said on Thursday he fired Flynn because he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador to the United States, before Trump took office, about sanctions imposed by Obamas administration. Trump has defended Flynns actual contact with the ambassador, saying what he did wasnt wrong. The Washington Post reported on Thursday that Flynn told FBI agents last month that he had not discussed sanctions with the ambassador. Flynns Jan. 24 interview with the FBI could expose him to charges, since lying to the agency is a felony, but any decision to prosecute would lie with the Justice Department.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate confirmed President Donald Trumps pick to run the Environmental Protection Agency on Friday over the objections of Democrats and environmentalists worried he will gut the agency, as the administration readies executive orders to ease regulation on drillers and miners. The installation of Scott Pruitt, who sued the agency he intends to lead more than a dozen times as Oklahoma attorney general, reinforces expectations on both sides of the political divide that America will cede its position as a leader in the global fight on climate change. Senators voted 52-46 to approve Pruitt, who was to be sworn in later on Friday afternoon at the White House. Only one Republican, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, voted against him. Two Democrats from energy-producing states, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, voted for his confirmation. I have no doubt that Scott will return the EPA to its core objectives, said Republican Senator James Inhofe, also of Oklahoma, adding the agency had been guilty of federal overreach, unlawful rule making, and duplicative red tape, during President Barack Obamas presidency. The nomination of Pruitt, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times on behalf of his oil-producing state and has doubted the science of climate change, upset many former and current agency employees. Nearly 800 former EPA staff urged the Senate to reject Pruitt in a letter this week, saying he had shown no interest in enforcing environmental laws. Earlier this month, about 30 current employees at an EPA regional office in Chicago joined a protest against Pruitt held by green groups. Trump is likely to issue executive orders as soon as next week to reshape the EPA, sources said. The Republican president has promised to kill Obamas Clean Power Plan, currently held up in the courts, that aims to slash carbon emissions from coal and natural gas fired power plants.  Trump also wants to give states more authority over environmental issues by striking down federal regulations on drilling technologies and getting rid of an Obama rule that sought to clarify the EPAs jurisdiction over streams and rivers. Conservatives warmly welcomed Pruitts confirmation.  For far too long the EPA has acted in an overzealous manner, ignoring the separation of powers, the role of states and the rights of property owners, said Nick Loris, an economist at the Heritage Foundation.    Democratic Senator Ben Cardin, however, said he was concerned that if the administration does not enforce emissions cuts such as outlined in the Clean Power Plan, it would increase U.S. pollution and harm the countrys leadership in international efforts to curb climate change.  Opponents of Pruitt also protested his ties to the energy industry. Republicans have the majority in the Senate, but Democrats spoke through Thursday night and Friday morning on the Senate floor, trying to extend debate on Pruitt until later in February when 3,000 emails between him and energy companies will likely be revealed by a judge.  An Oklahoma judge ruled this week that Pruitt will have to turn over the emails between his office and energy companies by Tuesday after a watchdog group, the Center for Media and Democracy, sued for their release. The judge will review and perhaps hold back some of the emails before releasing them, a court clerk said. Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer told reporters that Majority Leader Senator Mitch McConnell had moved to strap blinders on his fellow Republicans by not waiting for the release of Pruitts emails. Environmentalists decried the approval. If you dont believe in climate science, you dont belong at the EPA, said May Boeve, the head of environmentalist group 350.org.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - After a tumultuous opening month in the White House, President Donald Trump is heading to a friendlier, familiar and potentially rejuvenating place: the campaign trail. Beset by vicious fights over his Cabinet, legal setbacks over his immigration orders, the resignation of his national security adviser and an investigation into possible links between his campaign and Russian intelligence, Trump is turning to the winning formula that vaulted him into the White House: big, adoring crowds and fiery, angry speeches. He has replaced Hillary Clinton, his former Democratic presidential rival, with a new foil: newspapers and TV news outlets that have reported unflattering revelations of dysfunction or other problems in the White House. He has described them as lying, corrupt, failing and, late on Friday, as the enemy of the American people. On Saturday, he holds a campaign rally in an airport hangar in Melbourne, Florida, just up the coast from his Mar-a-Lago resort where he will spend the weekend. The event gives Trump a chance to bypass what he says is an unfair media and take his message straight to his supporters. It will remind people that he still has a lot of support out there, and he probably needs the reminder, said Republican strategist John Feehery. When you are inside the bubble, its not a bad idea to reconnect with your supporters and get re-energized. Trumps race against Clinton was marked by big, boisterous rallies, and the event in Florida is likely to be the first of many as he tries to appeal directly to his most passionate supporters and reframe his image following growing questions over his temperament and ties between his campaign and Russian intelligence. Shortly after an unusually long and combative 77-minute presidential news conference on Thursday, Trumps campaign sent out a fundraising email featuring a media accountability survey asking supporters about coverage. Ive made it a point to cut through the medias noise and go straight to the American people. It worked during the campaign, and it will work again over these next four years, Trump said in the email. Democrats countered with their own fundraising email, seeking donations to ensure Trump is a one-term president. First he had Republican primary opponents, then he had Hillary Clinton, and now he has the evil media, said Republican strategist Rich Galen. Hes very comfortable in this kind of campaign mode. The Florida rally marks an extraordinarily early start to the 2020 White House campaign for Trump, who filed re-election papers with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) five hours after he was sworn in as president on Jan. 20. His predecessor, Barack Obama, filed the same form in April 2011, more than two years into his first term as president. The paperwork was not a formal declaration of Trumps candidacy, but allowed him to continue raising funds, including the money received from sales of his popular red Make America Great Again hats. The Trump campaign raised $9.6 million in December and had about $7.6 million on hand at the end of the year, the last time it was required to file a report with the FEC. Obama and other presidents have traditionally held campaign-style events to support their legislative initiatives, but they were organized and paid for by the White House. Saturdays rally will be organized and run by the campaign, the White House said. Obama hit the road frequently in early 2009 to rally voters behind his economic stimulus package. But he was also supported by an outside group called Organizing for America that filled some of the role of a campaign organization by building  grassroots backing for his policies. By keeping his campaign intact, including his campaign website, Trump has made the concept of a permanent campaign into reality. The website, which features a photo of the inauguration, stresses Trumps campaign cannot stop because we still have much work to do. Trumps first presidential event outside Washington was on Friday in North Charleston, South Carolina, where he visited an airplane plant operated by Boeing Co to celebrate the unveiling of its latest Dreamliner jet. On Air Force One after the Charleston event, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Trump is headed back on to the campaign trail because the media does not always deliver his message well, and he can do that very effectively by taking the stage and talking to the people of America. Trumps early re-election campaign start has created some confusion for federal workers worried about possibly violating a U.S. law prohibiting them from engaging in political activity in the workplace. The U.S. Office of Special Counsel, an independent government agency that protects federal bureaucrats from unfair personnel practices, issued guidance to federal workers last week after it said it received numerous questions about whether they can express their views on Trump given his intention to run for re-election. Federal workers would violate the law if they start calling for his re-election or defeat while on duty, the memo said, but since the election is still three years away workers can express approval or disapproval of his policies or actions but may not display signs in their office that read Reelect Trump in 2020 or express views on his candidacy while in the workplace. Once he formally announces his candidacy, the memo said, workers who are on duty or in the office cannot do anything directed at the success or failure of his candidacy.

McCain, a known Trump critic, told the Munich Security Conference that the resignation of the new presidents security adviser Michael Flynn over his contacts with Russia reflected deep problems in Washington. I think that the Flynn issue obviously is something that shows that in many respects this administration is in disarray and theyve got a lot of work to do, said McCain, even as he praised Trumps defense secretary. The president, I think, makes statements (and) on other occasions contradicts himself. So weve learned to watch what the president does as opposed to what he says, he said. European governments have been unsettled by the signals sent by Trump on a range of foreign policy issues ranging from NATO and Russia to Iran, Israel and European integration. The debut trip to Europe of Trumps Defence Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, to a meeting of G20 counterparts in Bonn, went some way to assuaging concerns as they both took a more traditional U.S. position. But Trump is wrestling with a growing controversy at home about potential ties between his aides and Russia, which he dismissed on Thursday as a ruse and scam perpetrated by a hostile news media. Mattis made clear to allies, both at NATO in Brussels and in Munich, that the United States would not retreat from leadership as the European continent grapples with an assertive Russia, wars in eastern and southern Mediterranean countries and attacks by Islamist militants. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence will address the Munich conference on Saturday with a similar message of reassurance.  Pence will say that Europe is an indispensable partner for the United States, a senior White House foreign policy adviser told reporters.  Mattis told a crowd that included heads of state and more than 70 defense ministers that Trump backed NATO. President Trump came into office and has thrown now his full support to NATO. He too espouses NATOs need to adapt to todays strategic situation for it to remain credible, capable and relevant, Mattis said. Mattis said the United States and its European allies had a shared understanding of the challenges ahead. Trump has alarmed allies by expressing admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin.  Mattis, however, has spoken out strongly against Russia while in Europe. After talks with NATO allies in Brussels on Thursday, he said that he did not believe it would be possible to collaborate militarily with Moscow, at least for now. The Europeans may need more convincing that Washington stands with it on a range of security issues. There is still a lot of uncertainty, Sebastian Kurz, Austrias foreign minister, told reporters. The big topic in Munich is looking to the USA to see which developments to expect next. European intelligence agencies have warned that Russia is also seeking to destabilize governments and influence elections across Europe with cyber attacks, fake news and propaganda and by funding far-right political parties. We should be under no illusions about the step-change in Russian behavior over the last couple of years, even after Crimea, British Defence Minister Michael Fallon said, referring to Moscows 2014 annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula. We have seen a step-change in Russian military aggression, but also in propaganda, in misinformation and a succession of persistent attacks on Western democracies, interference in a whole series of elections including ... the United States. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg held talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Munich, seeing progress on encouraging Moscow to be more open about its military exercises that the alliance says are unpredictable. Russia says it is the Western alliance, not Moscow, that is destabilizing Europe by sending troops to its western borders. We have different views, Stoltenberg said of the crisis in Ukraine, where the West accuses the Kremlin of arming separatist rebels in a conflict that has killed 10,000 people since April 2014. Russia says the conflict is a civil war. In the latest incident, Lithuanian prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation into a false report of rape by German soldiers stationed there on a NATO mission to deter Russia. Mattis, without explicitly citing the case, rallied to the defense of German forces as he spoke in the German city of Munich. I have great respect for Germanys leadership in Europe  and for the ethical performance of your troops on the battlefield, he said. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded last year that Russia hacked and leaked Democratic emails during the election campaign as part of an effort to tilt the vote in Trumps favor. McCain acknowledged concern in Europe and beyond that America was laying down the mantle of global leadership and cited global trends he found disturbing, including hardening resentment toward immigrants and an unwillingness to separate truth from lies.    McCain urged the forum not to give up on the United States.  Make no mistake, my friends: These are dangerous times, but you should not count America out, and we should not count each other out, McCain said.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, told reporters he expects to receive some kind of recommendation on an infrastructure bill, a subject that we frequently handle on a bipartisan basis, but gave no details or timing. He has previously voiced concern over adding to budget deficits with a new injection of federal funds for road, bridge and other construction projects like the ones President Barack Obama secured from Congress in 2009, especially after a major highway funding law was enacted about a year ago. Some Republicans and Democrats in Congress are increasingly criticizing Trumps administration for being slow to get behind his legislative initiatives during the first month of his presidency. Trumps plans to create an infrastructure council led by two New York billionaire friends, developers Richard LeFrak and Steven Roth, have yet to be launched, a spokesman for LeFrak said.  During his presidential campaign, Trump said he would push for a $1 trillion infrastructure program to rebuild roads, bridges, airports and other public works projects. He said he wanted action during the first 100 days of his administration, which now seems unlikely. The Republican president has talked about creating a tax credit to encourage private sector investment in many of these projects. But Democrats say that would fail to spur enough rebuilding and put taxpayers on the hook for a tax credit to wealthy developers, who they said would build toll roads that taxpayers would then have to pay to use. Democrats want a more direct federal role in sparking a construction boom. In an interview on Tuesday, Republican Representative Mario Diaz-Balart said he had no doubt that it (infrastructure investment) is a priority for the administration. Diaz-Balart chairs a House subcommittee that would control the flow of Washington money that might be needed to fund some of the public works projects. Several lawmakers and aides speculated the initiative could be attached to tax reform legislation that Republicans want to advance this year, but no decisions have been made. Writing an infrastructure bill involves seven or eight committees, there are complicated tax and spending questions at stake, and lawmakers are divided. There are also questions over what would qualify as an infrastructure project, with rural areas, for example, clamoring for more broadband internet service. Senator John Thune, a member of the Republican leadership who chairs the commerce and transportation panel which has a say on any bill, said he had little information on the content or status of legislation. Asked about McConnells comments, Thune said, Maybe he knows more about it since hes married to the secretary of transportation, Elaine Chao. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Strike4Democracy, one of the groups organizing Fridays strike, said more than 100 public protests were expected around the country. In New York, more than 16,000 people responded to a Facebook page set up for a rally at Washington Square Park in Manhattan, but fewer than 200 protesters were at the park an hour after the posted start time. Crystal Thornebrooke, one of the organizers, said the event was intended to spark discussions about how activists can make progress in fighting Trumps agenda. Introducing ourselves to people, hearing people, hearing their concerns with our administration and then build from there - this is the preliminary stages of organization, she said. In downtown Los Angeles, a rally at the Regent Theater drew about 60 demonstrators, waving signs and chanting, Fight ignorance, not immigrants. I have friends and family members who are undocumented immigrants, and Im scared for them to be deported, said Priscilla Alburquenque, a 20-year-old college student. Some protesters said Thursdays walkout may have sapped some of the energy for Fridays action. The immigration event yesterday was a big event, but not everyone can be at them all, said Joe Balkis, a retired United Parcel Service worker who was one of approximately 75 protesters at Daley Plaza in Chicago. Trump has vowed to crack down on illegal immigration and signed an executive order, which was put on hold by federal courts, restricting entry from seven Muslim-majority countries. Those policies, along with a series of federal raids last week, have alarmed immigrant rights groups. Strike4Democracy urged Americans to stay away from work, donate their lunch money to a worthy cause and contact congressional representatives about the strike.

Michel died at the Virginia Hospital Center in Arlington, Virginia, where he had been admitted in the last few weeks with pneumonia, said Michael Johnson, a former chief of staff to the congressman. Michel, a decorated World War Two veteran who was wounded in the Battle of the Bulge, was first elected in 1956 to the U.S. House of Representatives from Illinois and served for 38 years. His time in the House came during a four-decade era of Democratic control, but as minority leader starting in 1981 Michel helped shepherd the policies of Republican Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush through Congress. In a statement, Bush called Michel a great American for whom the words duty and honor and country werent just a campaign slogan, but a lifelong creed.  The courtly Michel (pronounced Michael), known as Bob, amassed a conservative voting record but believed in bipartisanship and maintained friendships with many Democratic colleagues, including House Speakers Tip ONeill and Tom Foley. It has always puzzled me that in Washington we have no public vocabulary to describe civility, which I believe is among the highest public virtues, Michel said in 1991.  Raising the level of your voice doesnt raise the level of discussion. Listening with care is better than talking in sound bites and thinking in slogans. ... Peaks of uncommon progress can be reached by paths of common courtesy. Michel served as House Republican leader for 14 years until deciding not to seek re-election to the House in the November 1994 elections. With the rise of conservative rabble-rousers like Georgias Newt Gingrich in the House Republican caucus in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Michels brand of leadership - consultation with Democrats instead of confrontation - was becoming obsolete. After Gingrich signaled he might try to depose him as Republican leader, Michel expressed confidence that he would have won but said such a fight would have been fratricidal. Gingrich and his allies sought to portray the Democratic leaders of the House as corrupt legislative dictators. In May 1993, Michel warned that the politics of anger was slowly destroying the United States civic environment. Michel announced in October 1993 he would retire from the House after the 1994 election. Michel lamented that Congress was becoming a place lacking camaraderie and deplored colleagues who resorted to trashing the institution for political gain. Gingrich helped engineer a Republican takeover of the House in the 1994 elections and rose to the job of speaker. His  ascendancy and Michels retirement ushered in a new combative style of leadership for House Republicans, who have remained largely uncompromising ever since. Michel served in the House under five Republican and four Democratic presidents. The last of them, Democrat Bill Clinton, honored him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest U.S. civilian award. In the best sense he is a gentleman legislator who, in spite of the great swings in public opinion from year to year, has remained always true to the Midwestern values he represents so faithfully in the House, Clinton said during the August 1994 ceremony. Michel was born in 1923 in Peoria, Illinois, long viewed as a symbol of small-town America, and grew up in the Great Depression. He served as an infantryman in Europe during World War Two and earned two Bronze Stars, the Purple Heart and four Battle Stars. After graduating from Bradley University in Peoria, Michel worked in a congressional office until winning his House seat in 1956. He married his wife Corinne in 1948 and the couple had four children.

Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan announced a legislative committee would explore a Rauner request to sell the states aging James R. Thompson Center high-rise in Chicagos famed Loop business district. Madigans offer follows a renewed call this week by the governor for the state to dump the aging office building in a move he said could yield as much as $220 million for Illinois depleted treasury. Crippled by feuding between Madigan and Rauner, Illinois is limping through a record-setting second consecutive fiscal year without a complete budget. Rauner and the Democratic-led legislature have allowed the state to veer deeper into budgetary no-mans land by permitting a six-month fiscal 2017 budget to expire on Dec. 31. While technical questions pertaining to the sale remain, it is my intention to work with the governor on developing a course of action for the Thompson Center that best serves the interests of the people of Illinois, Madigan said in a statement. The long-serving House speaker said his move was in keeping with my commitment to work cooperatively with the governor. A Rauner spokeswoman said the governor is encouraged by the speakers move and called a sale of the building a good deal for taxpayers. Opened in 1985, the 16-story Thompson Center houses about 2,000 government workers and was designed by award-winning architect Helmut Jahn. Named after a former Illinois Republican governor who served for 14 years, the building has faced recurring heating and cooling problems and has been neglected by the state for much of its three-decade lifespan.  In October 2015, Rauner said $100 million was needed for deferred maintenance and repairs. By contrast, ridding the state of the complex would return a new development to Chicagos property tax rolls, perhaps generating $45 million annually for the city, the governors office said on Friday. In his budget address on Wednesday, Rauner urged lawmakers to permit the buildings sale, saying it could help close an estimated $4.57 billion state budget deficit in fiscal 2018 and generate revenue elsewhere. Everyone benefits from the sale, he said. The city of Chicago stands to gain major new property tax revenue, along with the jobs that come with a massive development.

The Associated Press reported the proposal to mobilize up to 100,000 National Guard troops was part of a draft memo being circulated at the Department of Homeland Security. Spicer sharply criticized the report. There is no effort at all to ... utilize the National Guard to round up illegal immigrants, he said. This is 100 percent not true. David Lapan, a spokesman for DHS, said the department was not considering mobilizing the National Guard for immigration enforcement. The AP said the draft memo, dated Jan. 25, had been circulating among DHS staff for about two weeks and was addressed to the then-acting heads of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. It reported the 11-page document called for an unprecedented militarization of immigration enforcement on the states bordering Mexico - California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas - and also encompassed seven states contiguous to those four   Oregon, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana. The AP said the memo was meant to serve as guidance to implement the wide-ranging executive order on immigration and border security that President Donald Trump signed on Jan. 25. A DHS official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the memorandum obtained by the Associated Press was an early, early version of a document being prepared by staff for Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly.

I hear you, Chaffetz wrote in a post on his Instagram account announcing the withdrawal of the bill. I am a proud gun owner, hunter and love our public lands. Chaffetzs office did not respond to requests for comment on his reversal. Outdoor sporting groups - long associated with conservatism because of their support for guns rights and small government - are now collaborating with the environmental left to fight U.S. President Donald Trumps push to open more public lands to energy development. Such areas include national forests, parks and Native American tribal territories and account for about one fifth of the United States. Recent funding data from the Foundation Center database, which aggregates information from tax filings, shows groups such as the Backcountry Hunters and Anglers and the Outdoor Alliance have accepted grants from big environmental and liberal foundations, including the Turner Foundation and the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation. The Hewlett Foundation gave $100,000 in 2015 to Backcountry, a conservation group created in 2004. The money accounted for more than two-thirds of its foundation grants that year, and Backcountry told Reuters it is an annual gift with no conditions. Hewlett said it supports Backcountry because of its critical work to preserve Americas outdoor heritage of hunting and fishing and protect wild places. The Turner Foundation gave an unrestricted donation of $100,000 to the Outdoor Alliance in 2015, the groups only foundation grant that year. Conservation is a nonpartisan issue, and it is a shame it is being politicized, said Judy Adler, president of the Turner Foundation. The Environmental Policy Alliance, a pro-development organization, has said environmentalists finance sportsmens groups as a way to provide conservative cover for a liberal agenda - turning the outdoors groups into green decoys. The alliance, which says it aims to uncover the funding and hidden agendas of environmentalists, did not respond to requests for comment. Highlighting the odd-bedfellows nature of such collaborative lobbying, the Backcountry Hunters and Anglers counts the presidents son, Donald Trump Jr., as a lifetime member.  Officials at the Trump Organization, where Donald Trump Jr. is an executive, did not respond to requests for comment. A Trump administration official declined to comment. Trump has made previous statements opposing the transfer of federal land to states, but has strongly supported more energy development in such areas. The outdoor recreation industry is concentrated heavily in conservative western states and generates more than $640 billion annually, according to the Outdoor Industry Association, which represents hundreds of companies and organized the pressure campaign against Chaffetz. That figure would make the outdoors industry about 10 times bigger than the coal industry.  For a graphic comparing the outdoor industry's economic output to other sectors, see: tmsnrt.rs/2kHoU6U The cause of protecting public lands is among precious few issues that bind U.S. conservatives and liberals. Outdoors companies such as Patagonia and North Face are building lobbying strength quickly in response to rising threats to federal lands, said Jessica Wahl, government affairs manager for the Outdoor Industry Association. We are a bipartisan industry, Wahl said. We are stronger when talking with a unified voice. In one example of that clout, more than 30 companies this week - including Patagonia, REI, North Face, KUHL, and others  wrote an open letter to Utahs Republican Governor Gary Herbert saying they will try to force an annual outdoor retailers convention out of the state unless he protects public lands. Patagonia had earlier announced it would boycott the convention - which brings Utah about $45 million each year - because Herbert had opposed a move by former Democratic President Barack Obama to protect 1.3 million acres near the iconic Bears Ears buttes. Tawney, of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, said he supports partnerships with environmental groups to advocate for wilderness conservation. But he dismisses assertions that the outdoor enthusiast organizations have become pawns of the environmental left. Everything we do is about hunting and fishing, he said.   Some traditional environmental lobbying organizations such as the Sierra Club say theyare happy to let outdoor sports advocates be the public face of the conservation movement. The arguments of sportsmen tend to resonate better with business-friendly Republicans and their constituents in rural communities, he said. They speak from more of an economic voice, said Matt Kirby, who directs the Sierra Clubs public lands policy work for western states.  Elsewhere, local outdoor industry companies have had success engaging with the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to have more input on local oil and gas leasing decisions. Ashley Korenblat - owner of Utah-based mountain biking outfitter Western Spirit Cycling and a member of the Outdoor Industry Association - was instrumental in shaping the Moab Master Leasing Plan, which preserves bike trails near Moab, Utah while allowing some oil and gas drilling. Many hunters, fishermen and campers may not think of themselves as conservationists, Korenblat said, but when you can no longer get to the river where you fish - when the trail youve been riding has been replaced by a 30-foot gravel road to a well - suddenly you really care. Some of the most passionate conservation advocates are in Utah, where two-thirds of the state is federally protected. Im just disgusted, said Grant Bench, a fly-fishing guide who works with Sundance Mountain Resort. Do we see oil pumps in Yellowstone next? Last winter, Bench said, he took Donald Trump Jr. fishing on the Provo River. Bench told him he wants future generations of his family to enjoy the same pristine wilderness that currently sustains Benchs livelihood. Trump Jr. agreed that preserving public lands is important, said Bench, who hopes Trumps son will carry that message to his father.  Reuters could not reach Donald Trump Jr. for comment. Bench provided a photograph of himself with Trump Jr. standing outside in waders, waterproof pants used by fly fishermen to walk through streams. The conservation battles have made Bench start to question his traditionally conservative politics.  Im leaning further left every day that this stuff goes on, he said.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trumps defense secretary on Thursday said he did not see possible military collaboration with Russia now, in a blow to Moscows hopes to mend ties with Washington after Trumps election. The remarks are perhaps the strongest indication yet from the Trump administration that prospects for any significant cooperation between the U.S. and Russian militaries against  Islamic State in Syria is unlikely anytime soon. They came despite repeated suggestions by Trump during his election campaign of the possibility of joint action against Islamic State militants.     We are not in a position right now to collaborate on a military level. But our political leaders will engage and try to find common ground, Jim Mattis told reporters after talks at NATO headquarters in Brussels, also mentioning U.S. concerns about Russian interference in democratic elections. Just hours before Mattis spoke, Russian President Vladimir Putin said it was in the interests of both nations to restore communications between their intelligence agencies. Its absolutely clear that in the area of counter-terrorism all relevant governments and international groups should work together, he told Russias Federal Security Service (FSB). U.S. intelligence agencies, however, are among the most powerful voice of caution in Washington on Russia, concluding that Moscow hacked and leaked Democratic Party emails during the presidential campaign as part of efforts to tilt the vote in the Nov. 8 election in Trumps favor. Mondays resignation of national security adviser Michael Flynn, who was seen in Moscow as a leading advocate of warmer ties with Russia, has underscored for the Kremlin the difficulties of reaching a settlement. Flynn resigned after disclosures he had discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia with the Russian ambassador to the United States before Trump took office, and that he later misled Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations.  Asked whether he believed that Russia interfered in U.S. presidential elections, Mattis said: Right now, I would just say theres very little doubt that they have either interfered or they have attempted to interfere in a number of elections in the democracies. He did not explicitly cite the U.S. election. A Kremlin aide said there had been no progress on a potential meeting between Trump and Putin. There is no agreement on a meeting nor a clear understanding yet, Interfax news agency quoted Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov as saying. BACK-AND-FORTH Mattis, who has previously accused Russia of trying to break the NATO alliance, told a closed-door session of NATO on Wednesday that it needed to be realistic about the chances of restoring a cooperative relationship with Moscow.  He cited Moscows 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, which plunged U.S.-Russia relations to a post-Cold War low. Mattis said NATO needed negotiate from a position of strength as he called for stepped up military spending. That prompted a terse reply from Russias Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu. Attempts to build a dialogue with Russia from a position of strength would be futile, he was quoted as saying by TASS news agency. Mattis shot back: I have no need to respond to the Russian statement at all. NATO has always stood for military strength and protection of the democracies and the freedoms we intend to pass on to our children. The back-and-forth came even as U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov met in Germany, and U.S. Marine General Joseph Dunford, the top U.S. military officer, met Chief of the Russian General Staff Valery Gerasimov in Azerbaijan. Lavrov dismissed the uproar over the U.S. election. You should know we do not interfere in the domestic matters of other countries, he said.  Congressional inquiries into alleged Russian interference in the U.S. elections are gaining momentum as Capitol Hill investigators press intelligence and law enforcement agencies for access to classified documents. The FBI and several U.S. intelligence agencies are investigating Russian espionage operations in the United States. They are also looking at contacts in Russia between Russian intelligence officers or others with ties to Putins government and people connected to Trump or his campaign.

From there, the presidents criticism of the media went from barbed to personal in a cutting assessment of what he viewed as unfair coverage of his first few weeks in office - a period that has seen a succession of crises. On a day when he ceded a loss over a signature policy in a federal appeals court, had to replace his labor secretary pick and faced questions over the resignation of his national security adviser, Trump chose to make the media a central focus of an unusually long and combative presidential news conference. When asked by journalists of contacts between his presidential campaign and Russian operatives, he deflected the questions and put the focus instead on what he described as illegal government leaks and dishonest media coverage. The press is out of control, he said. The level of dishonesty is out of control,  After weeks of disclosures in newspapers over turmoil in his administration, he told one reporter to sit down for a rambling question. Tomorrow, they will say: Donald Trump rants and raves at the press, Trump said. Im not ranting and raving. Im just telling you. You know, youre dishonest people. But Im not ranting and raving. I love this. Im having a good time doing it. Trumps message in the 77-minute session appeared aimed at the same voters who elected him president last November, a large number of whom feel Washington has left them behind and who like his image as an outsider trying to shake up the establishment. He sought to cast problems buffeting the White House as the mess he inherited from former Democratic President Barack Obama, and boasted about the fine-tuned administration he is running.  In one unusual exchange near the end of the news conference, Trump called on a questioner, asking if he was a friendly reporter. When the journalist asked about recent threats to 48 Jewish centers across the country and signs of rising anti-Semitism, Trump appeared to take the question personally, replying: I am the least anti-Semitic person that youve ever seen in your entire life. He added he was also the least racist person, told the reporter to be quiet, accused him of lying and then dismissed the question as insulting. Most opinion polls show Trump struggling with low approval numbers less than a month into his presidency. A Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted Feb. 10 to 14 gave Trump a 46 percent approval rating. While many presidencies have started off on rocky ground, Trumps administration has been particularly marked by controversies, fights with the media and a legal battle over an executive order to ban people temporarily from seven Muslim-majority countries. I turn on the TV and open the newspapers and I see stories of chaos, chaos. And yet, it is the exact opposite, Trump said. Trump waved away questions about a New York Times report that members of his campaign team had frequent contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials last year. His main complaint was that the news media had uncovered leaks about intercepted communications between Michael Flynn, ousted this week as national security adviser and Russian Ambassador to the United States Sergei Kisylak, and leaks about his own conversations with the leaders of Mexico and Australia.

Opponents of the 1,170-mile (1.882-km) line met with officials from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, officials representing Republican Governor Doug Burgum and the state Department of Transportation on Thursday morning, asking to be given more time to remove their belongings and waste from the camps. In a statement on Thursday evening, Burgum and the Army Corps refused to extend next Wednesdays deadline. Army Corps spokesman Ryan Hignight said contractors working for the agency would enter the camp as soon as they could. Were not going to necessarily wait for the 22nd, Hignight said. Pipeline opponents say they fear fresh conflicts with law enforcement if Army Crops crews, including waste-removal personnel, are accompanied by police. Its completely impossible to remove everything down there in that short of a time frame, said Chase Iron Eyes, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. The people arent opposed to the help of the Army Corps, but its got to be without the presence of militarized law enforcement. The exchange came a day after Burgum ordered pipeline opponents to move off of land owned by the Army Corps, citing safety and environmental pollution concerns posed by spring snowmelt and rising water levels in the nearby Cannonball River. Hignight warned that anyone still occupying Army Corps land after the deadline could face fines as high as $5,000 and six-month jail terms. About 700 pipeline opponents have been arrested since August 2016. Environmentalists and Native Americans who have opposed the pipeline, saying it threatens water resources and sacred sites, have faced a series of setbacks since Republican President Donald Trump took office in January. A federal judge on Monday denied a request by Native American tribes seeking to halt construction of the final link of the $3.8 billion pipeline after the Corps of Engineers granted a final easement to Energy Transfer Partners LP last week.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court will decide three cases in coming months that could help or hinder President Donald Trumps efforts to ramp up border security and accelerate deportations of those in the country illegally. The three cases, which reached the court before Democratic President Barack Obama left office, all deal broadly with the degree to which non-citizens can assert rights under the U.S. Constitution. They come at a time when the court is one justice short and divided along ideological lines, with four conservatives and four liberals. The justices will issue rulings before the end of June against the backdrop of high-profile litigation challenging the lawfulness of Trumps controversial travel ban on people traveling from seven predominantly Muslim countries. The most pertinent of the three cases in terms of Republican Trump administration priorities involves whether immigrants in custody for deportation proceedings have the right to a hearing to request their release when their cases are not promptly adjudicated.  The long-running class action litigation, brought by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) on behalf of thousands of immigrants detained for more than six months, includes both immigrants apprehended at the border when seeking illegal entry into the United States and legal permanent residents in deportation proceedings because they were convicted of crimes. The case also could affect long-term U.S. residents who entered the country illegally and have subsequently been detained. The Trump administration has said it wants to end the release of immigrants facing deportation and speed up the process for ejecting them from the country. A decision in the case requiring additional court hearings could have verydirect implications for the administrationsplans, said ACLU lawyer Ahilan Arulanantham, especially since immigration courts currently have a backlog of more than 500,000cases. The ACLU estimates that up to 8,000 immigrants nationwide at any given time have been held for at least six months. A U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official was unable to immediately confirm data on length of detention but said that in fiscal year 2016, the average daily count of detainees was just under 35,000.  If Trump wants to put more people in deportation but does not increase the number of immigration judges, then people are going to have to wait longer and longer to get a hearing, said Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration law professor at Cornell Law School. The Trump administration has pledged to sharply curtail illegal immigration, with initiatives such as building a wall along the U.S-Mexican border and hiring thousands of federal agents to police the border and arrest and deport immigrants who live in the United States but entered the country illegally. Trump has also threatened to withhold federal funding from so-called sanctuary cities that offer protections to immigrants who could face deportation. CROSS-BORDER SHOOTING The other cases to be decided concern whether U.S. government officials can be sued over mistreatment of non-citizens in two separate contexts.  One will decide whether the family of 15-year-old Mexican teenager Sergio Hernandez, who was killed while on Mexican soil by a U.S. agent firing from across the border in Texas, can sue under the U.S. Constitution. It is a scenario that the lawyers for Hernandezs family say could become more frequent if the Trump administration acts on its proposal to increase the number of border guards by 5,000, raising the prospect of similar confrontations. The court hears arguments in that case on Feb. 21. The second is a civil lawsuit brought by immigrants, mainly Muslims, who were detained in New York after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks and claim they were mistreated.  The group of Muslim, Arab and South Asian non-U.S. citizens say they were held as terrorism suspects based on race, religion, ethnicity and immigration status and abused in detention before being deported. The long-running case focuses on whether senior officials in the administration of Republican President George W. Bush can be sued for their role in directing the action. The Obama administration argued that the court should be wary of extending liability to the actions of senior officials, especially when it implicates national security and immigration. Based on the skepticism of the justices during the Jan. 18 oral argument, the court seems likely to rule against the detainees. Chief Justice John Roberts expressed concern that permitting such lawsuits against senior U.S. officials would become a way of challenging national policy through litigation seeking monetary damages against the individuals who implemented the policy. The three cases are separate from litigation over the legality of Trumps travel ban, which could also ultimately be decided by the high court. The key case on that front is now pending before an appeals court in San Francisco after a three-judge panel upheld a lower court decision to put the ban on hold. Language in the upcoming rulings that address the rights of non-citizens and analyzes how courts should review govenrment action on immigration and national security could have relevance in that case, legal experts say. Anil Kalhan, an immigration law professor at Drexel Universitys Kline School of Law, said the furor over the treatment of non-U.S. citizens affected by the travel ban could bleed over into how the court approaches the cases. It might be the atmospherics of whats going on now might lead to a closer look from the justices, he said. (This story has been refiled to correct spelling of Ahilan Arulanantham in paragraph six.)

Activists called A Day Without Immigrants to highlight the importance of the foreign-born, who account for 13 percent of the U.S. population, or more than 40 million naturalized American citizens. Trump campaigned against the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants, playing on fears of violent crime while promising to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border and stop potential terrorists from entering the country.

Since taking office last month, the Republican president has signed an executive order temporarily banning entry to the United States by travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries and all refugees. That order was put on hold by federal courts. Immigrant rights groups have also expressed alarm after federal raids last week rounded up more than 680 people suspected of being in the country illegally.

Our community is frightened and cannot speak out, she said. Things are very bad for us with the new president. Advocates have called attention to cases such as one in El Paso, Texas, where federal agents arrested a transgender woman as she left a courthouse where she was seeking a protective order for domestic violence. Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe wrote Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly to express concern over immigration enforcement in his state, citing an NBC Washington report that agents arrested people outside a church that operates as a shelter from the cold.

We are the most secure and most prosperous when both the U.S. and Europe are strong and united, the adviser said, previewing Pences trip. President Donald Trump alarmed allies during his campaign for office by breaking with traditional Republican views on the transatlantic relationship. Trump has expressed admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, with whom he said he would like to work to fight Islamic State militants, and has questioned the value of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. In Munich, Pence will hold a series of meetings with leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, and leaders from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Pence will emphasize that Russia and Ukraine need to fully implement the Minsk ceasefire agreement, and will stand firm on economic sanctions on Russia related to its aggression in Ukraine, the adviser told reporters. He plans to discuss counterterrorism in a meeting with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, and the fight against Islamic State in meetings with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim, the adviser said. On Monday, Pence will hold several discussions with European officials in Brussels, including with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg. His trip comes amid turbulence at the White House. Trump fired his national security adviser on Monday for misleading Pence over his conversations with Russias ambassador to the United States.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A crisis over the relationship between President Donald Trumps aides and Russia deepened on Wednesday as a growing number of Trumps fellow Republicans demanded expanded congressional inquiries into the matter. Trump sought to focus attention on what he called criminal intelligence leaks about his ousted national security adviser, Michael Flynn. Trump forced Flynn out on Monday after disclosures he had discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia with the Russian ambassador to the United States before Trump took office, and that he later misled Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations. The drama of Flynns departure was the latest in a series of White House missteps and controversies since the Republican president was sworn in on Jan. 20. At a news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday, Trump said Flynn, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant general, was a wonderful man who had been mistreated by the news media. But Republican Trump critics including Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham voiced fresh consternation. Adding to the pressure were comments by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, who has been a Trump supporter. Corker said the Russia issue was threatening Trumps agenda on foreign affairs and domestic matters like healthcare and tax policy. He questioned whether the White House was able to stabilize itself and said Flynn should testify before Congress. Lets get everything out as quickly as possible on this Russia issue, Corker told MSNBCs Morning Joe program. Maybe theres a problem that obviously goes much deeper than what we now suspect. Democrats, doubting Trumps Justice Department or the Republican-led Congress will pursue the matter vigorously, have demanded an independent investigation of possible illegal communications between Flynn and the Russian government and any efforts by Flynn or other White House officials to conceal wrongdoing. The most powerful Democrat in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, said Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a close ally of Trump, must recuse himself from any investigation. The Republican and Democratic leaders of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee asked Sessions and FBI Director James Comey on Wednesday to send the committee documents and provide a briefing on Flynns resignation. Citing reports that both the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Justice Department were involved in events leading to Flynns departure, Senators Chuck Grassley and Dianne Feinstein said they raised substantial questions about Flynns discussion with Russian officials. Graham called for a broader bipartisan congressional investigation to be conducted by a newly formed special committee rather than existing committees, if it turns out  Trumps presidential campaign communicated with the Russians. But the top Republicans in the Senate and House of Representatives have insisted the matter be investigated by existing Republican-led committees. The Senate and House Intelligence Committees and a subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary committee have announced they launched investigations into alleged Russian efforts to influence the election through computer hacking. U.S. intelligence agencies previously concluded that Russia hacked and leaked Democratic emails during the presidential campaign as part of efforts to tilt the vote in the Nov. 8 election in Trumps favor. Congressional inquiries into alleged Russian interference in the U.S. elections are gaining momentum as Capitol Hill investigators press intelligence and law enforcement agencies for access to classified documents.  The FBI and several U.S. intelligence agencies are investigating Russian espionage operations in the United States. They are also looking at contacts in Russia between Russian intelligence officers or others with ties to President Vladimir Putins government and people connected to Trump or his campaign. The FBI recently questioned Flynn about his telephone contacts with the Russian ambassador in Washington. People familiar with the agencys multiple probes said there was no evidence so far of pre-election collusion between Russians and Trumps campaign, or any evidence of criminal activity by Flynn or anyone else connected to Trump. Some experts expressed concern the White House could curtail or divert probes into Flynn and Russian involvement in the election unless Congress becomes more aggressive by holding hearings and appointing an independent commission or special prosecutor into whether Trumps team violated federal laws in their contacts with Russia. Intelligence agencies now overseen by Trump may not be ideally suited to the job, they added. Its not, at the end of the day, the job of the intelligence community to regulate the White House - and it shouldnt be, said Stephen Vladeck, a University of Texas law professor who focuses on constitutional law and national security. VERY UN-AMERICAN In Twitter posts on Wednesday, Trump called the reported Russian connection with his campaign team nonsense and said the leaks were the real scandal. From early on in his White House bid, Trump said he would like improved relations with Putin, a stance criticized by Democrats and those Republicans concerned about Washington softening its stance after Russias annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and aggression in Syria. Only a few Republican lawmakers have supported even the idea of extending any investigation to cover actions by Trumps team in the weeks after the election, when Flynn made his calls. Some Republicans, including House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, are calling for investigations into leaks to the news media of conversations between Flynn and Russias ambassador in Washington. The Trump administration has offered Flynns former job to U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Robert Harward, said two U.S. officials familiar with the matter. It was not immediately clear if Harward, a former deputy commander of U.S. Central Command, had accepted the offer, according to sources. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, at NATO headquarters in Brussels, says he does not see the conditions for military collaboration with Russia - a blow to Moscows hopes for repairing ties with the United States following Trumps election. Trump says he will issue a new executive order to replace his controversial directive suspending travel to the United States by citizens of seven mostly Muslim countries.   Trump announces his new choice to lead the Department of Labor, former National Labor Relations Board member Alexander Acosta, after his original pick withdrew under congressional pressure. Trumps choice for national security adviser, retired Vice Admiral Robert Harward, has turned down the offer, a senior White House official says. The Senate moves closer to approving President Donald Trumps pick to head the Environmental Protection Agency even as nearly 800 former officials urge the chamber to reject the nominee. U.S.-ISRAEL The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations says the United States still supports a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a day after Trump suggested he was open to new ways to achieve peace. Trumps uttering the phrase one-state - rather than a two-state solution to the conflict, the bedrock of international diplomacy for two decades - took him to a place in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict where past presidents feared to tread. Trumps nominee to be ambassador to Israel faces repeated heckling at a Senate confirmation hearing before apologizing for his stinging criticism of liberal American Jews and promising to be less inflammatory in an official capacity. The confirmation hearing for Trumps U.S. Supreme Court nominee, conservative federal appeals court Judge Neil Gorsuch, will begin on March 20, the panels Republican chairman says.    Businesses shut their doors, students skip class and thousands of demonstrators take to the streets in cities across the United States on Thursday to Trumps immigration policies.

Alexander Acosta to serve as U.S. secretary of labor, one day after Trumps original choice withdrew. Acosta is dean of the Florida International University College of Law in Miami and is Trumps first Hispanic nominee.  Acosta has had a decades-long public service career, serving in three presidentially appointed and Senate-confirmed positions, and is expected to face a smooth confirmation process. Mr. Acostas nomination is off to a good start because hes already been confirmed by the Senate three times, said Senator Lamar Alexander, who chairs the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions that will be vetting the nomination. Acosta was appointed to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) by former Republican President George W. Bush, who also appointed him to be assistant attorney general in the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division.  He was then appointed to be U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida, where he went after high-profile defendants such as Jack Abramoff and UBS, resulting in the Swiss bank paying more than $750 million in fines for a tax-avoidance scheme. Acosta also previously served as a law clerk to Samuel Alito from 1994 to 1995, when the conservative Supreme Court justice was a judge at the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. I thank the President and his staff for their confidence in me and I am eager to work tirelessly on behalf of the American worker, Acosta said in a statement. While at the NLRB, Acosta signed hundreds of opinions. Those familiar with his work describe him as a careful and cautious public servant whose career trajectory suggested he may someday vie for a federal judgeship. Because he has already gone through multiple vettings by the U.S. Senate, it is unlikely there will be any surprises in his background that could derail his nomination. The choice of Acosta, a traditional Republican conservative, is seen by some as a sign that Trump was forced to give up a more aggressive policy on worker issues. Trumps first labor secretary pick, Andrew Puzder, the chief executive officer of CKE Restaurants Inc, was outspoken in opposition to issues such as overtime pay, minimum wage hikes and even discussed the superiority of robots over human workers. He removed his name from consideration on Wednesday amid concerns he could not garner enough Senate votes to be confirmed.  This is the humbling of Donald Trump, said Seth Harris, a former Acting Labor Secretary during the Obama administration, who said Puzder would have been a radical disruptor but Acosta wont be. Acosta has been a staunch defender of the civil rights of Muslims who faced a backlash after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. In a 2011 congressional hearing, Acosta applauded how the Justice Department responded to civil rights violations, saying they helped assure Muslim Americans that their government would protect their rights. Some progressive groups were already responding negatively to the Acosta appointment, with Allied Progress alleging he had mismanaged the Department of Justices Civil Rights Division when he ran it.  In 2008, an internal Justice Department report faulted Acosta for failing to rein in a staffer who engaged in improper politicized hiring. However, the response to Acostas nomination from union groups who had staunchly opposed Puzder was much more measured on Thursday. Unlike Andy Puzder, Alexander Acostas nomination deserves serious consideration, said AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka.  In one day, weve gone from a fast-food CEO who routinely violates labor law to a public servant with experience enforcing it. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The 773 former officials signed a letter sent to the Senate  that said Pruitts record and public statements suggest he does not agree with the underlying principles of U.S. environmental laws. Pruitt has also cast doubts on the science of climate change. Mr. Pruitt has shown no interest in enforcing those laws, a critically important function for EPA, the letter said.  A spokesman for Pruitt did not immediate respond to a request for comment. The Senate advanced Pruitts nomination on Thursday, clearing the way for a final vote, expected on Friday.   Republican Senator Susan Collins came out against Pruitt on Wednesday, saying she had doubts about whether he would fully support the EPAs mission to protect human health and the environment. But Pruitt only needs a simple majority for approval, so unless Collins is joined by more Republicans, who control the Senate 52 to 48, his nomination is likely to succeed. Making Pruitts chances even likelier, Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat, said she would cast her for vote for him, even though she had concerns about his commitment to renewable power and to cut emissions blamed for climate change.    Joseph Santarella, an EPA enforcement lawyer under former Republican and Democratic administrations, who signed the letter protesting Pruitt, said his lawsuits against the agency demonstrated he had a fundamental lack of understanding and respect for the vital role that EPA plays in ensuring clean air and water for every American.  Senator John Barrasso, a Republican from coal-producing Wyoming and head of the Senate energy committee, said Pruitt had led the charge to rein in big government and Washington overreach. The public could soon learn more about Pruitts communications with energy companies while he was suing the EPA. Oklahoma County District Court Judge Aletia Timmons ruled that Pruitt will have to turn over 3,000 emails between his office and energy companies to her by Tuesday. Timmons will review the emails before deciding which of them to release. A watchdog group, the Center for Media and Democracy, has sought the release of the documents since January 2015.

The leaks are absolutely real. The news is fake, Trump told a news conference, referring to media reports that his presidential campaign team had contacts with Russian intelligence officials.  Trump, who frequently assailed the news media, also said he had not directed his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, to talk to Russias ambassador about U.S. sanctions before taking office. Trump said he had asked the Justice Department to look into the leaks of classified information that was given illegally to journalists regarding the relationship between his aides and Russia.  He also said he did not think that Russian President Vladimir Putin was taking actions that would test him early in his term in office. Trump, who took office on Jan. 20 and has voiced support for improved ties with Russia, added he personally had no business deals in that country. The New York Times reported on Tuesday that phone call records and intercepted calls showed members of Trumps presidential campaign and other Trump associates had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the Nov. 8 election in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.     Pressed by reporters about whether he was aware if any member of his presidential campaign team had contacts with Russia before the election, the Republican president said: Nobody that I know of. Wary Democratic lawmakers challenged Republicans, who control Congress, on Thursday to conduct a credible investigation into contacts between Trumps associates and Russia. The process could take months and might never be made public. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded last year that Russia hacked and leaked Democratic emails during the election campaign as part of an effort to tilt the vote in Trumps favor. Trump has spoken admiringly of Putin, who had a tense relationship with former President Barack Obama over Moscows 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, Russian military actions in Syria and other matters. Even fellow Republicans have expressed unease about Trumps comments about Putin. Flynn, a close adviser to Trump during his campaign, was seen by Moscow as a leading advocate of warmer ties with Russia. Trump fired Flynn on Monday after the retired lieutenant general misled Vice President Mike Pence about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador to the United States, before Trump took office, regarding U.S. sanctions on Moscow. Flynn told FBI agents last month he had not discussed sanctions against Russia with the ambassador before Trump took office, the Washington Post reported on Thursday. Flynns Jan. 24 interview with the FBI could expose him to charges, since lying to the agency is a felony, but any decision to prosecute would lie with the Justice Department. U.S. intelligence agencies intercepted Flynns call with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak after Trumps election, in which the two discussed sanctions, the Post reported previously. Obama imposed the new sanctions on Russia on Dec. 29 after the U.S. intelligence communitys conclusion about Moscows interference in the election campaign. A U.S. official familiar with the transcripts of the calls with the ambassador said Flynn indicated that if Russia did not retaliate, that could smooth the way toward a broader discussion of improving U.S.-Russian relations once Trump took power. That was potentially illegal under a law barring unauthorized private citizens from interfering in disputes the United States has with other countries. Trump forcefully defended Flynns discussion with the Russian ambassador. What he did wasnt wrong, Trump told the news conference.  Mike was doing his job. He was calling countries and his counterparts. So, it certainly would have been OK with me if he did it. ... I didnt direct him, but I would have directed him because thats his job, Trump said. No, I didnt direct him, but I would have directed him if he didnt do it. OK? said Trump, who added the problem was Flynns having misled Pence. A wealthy new York real estate developer with global business interests, Trump also portrayed himself as having no ties to Russia. I can tell you, speaking for myself, I own nothing in Russia. I have no loans in Russia. I dont have any deals in Russia, Trump said. Critics of the president have called on him since the election campaign to release his tax returns, saying that would shed more light on his business dealings. Trump has said he will not do so while his tax affairs are under audit by the Internal Revenue Service.

Puzder admitted on Feb. 7 he had once employed an illegal immigrant as a house cleaner. He had already faced strong opposition from Senate Democrats and progressive groups because of his views on labor issues. On Thursday, Trump nominated former National Labor Relations Board member R. Alexander Acosta as secretary of labor. NATIONAL SECURITY AT MAR-A-LAGO Private guests at Trumps Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida snapped photos of the president and visiting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe conferring and looking at documents while surrounded by aides following a weekend missile launch by North Korea. One guest posted to his Facebook page a picture with a man described to be the holder of the nuclear football, or weapons codes. The incidents prompted concerns about national security, and a Republican representative asked the White House for details. Trump issued an executive order on Jan. 27 temporarily banning U.S. entry by travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries and all refugees, citing the need to protect Americans. The ban triggered protests across the United States, confusion at U.S. and overseas airports and multiple legal challenges. A federal judge in Seattle on Feb. 3 suspended the ban in an order upheld by a federal appeals court in San Francisco. On Thursday, Trump said he would issue a new version of the order next week. The Seattle judges order drew fire from Trump on Twitter, who criticized the jurist and the court system. The Republican presidents Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, said last week that the Twitter attacks were demoralizing and disheartening, according to a spokesman. Trump said Gorsuchs comments had been misrepresented. Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway urged Americans last week to buy his daughter Ivanka Trumps clothing and jewelry products during an appearance on a national television program after department store chain Nordstrom Inc said it was dropping them due to a decline in sales. Conways endorsement, which followed a Twitter attack by Trump on Nordstrom, prompted criticism from Democrats and Republicans. On Tuesday, the Office of Government Ethics said the White House should investigate whether Conway violated ethics rules. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto scrapped plans to meet his counterpart in Washington during the second week of Trumps presidency after Trump tweeted that Mexico should cancel the meeting if it was not prepared to pay for his proposed border wall. Trump abruptly ended a phone call in late January with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, telling the leader of one of the United States closest allies that it was the worst call by far he had had with a foreign leader, according to the Washington Post. Trump said a deal between the United States and Australia on refugee resettlement was dumb and accused Turnbulls country of trying to export the next Boston bombers under the agreement, the Post said.

But announcements from Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan claimed progress. Were doing Obamacare, were in the final stages, Trump told a news conference. So we will be submitting sometime in early March, mid-March. Earlier Thursday, Ryan told reporters on Capitol Hill that House Republicans would introduce legislation to repeal and replace Obamas program after a 10-day recess that begins on Friday. After the House returns following thePresidents Day break, we intend to introduce legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare, Ryan said at a press conference. Presidents Day is on Monday and the House returns on Feb. 27. Ryan spoke shortly after many House Republicans huddled in a closed session with newly-installed U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price to discuss their options to change the 2010 law. The session was part pep talk and part laying out of talking points that can be delivered to constituents during the recess. A 19-page policy brief was distributed to lawmakers, and it included some details of the emerging House Republican healthcare strategy. In the weeks ahead, Republicans intend to repeal the penalties for Obamacares mandate requiring individuals to get coverage and employers to provide it, the policy brief said.  The House Republican replacement plan for Obamacare will include an age-based monthly tax credit that Americans who do not get health insurance through their employer can use to buy health insurance and take from job to job, the brief said. House Republicans plan to unwind the expansion of the Medicaid healthcare program for the poor that happened under Obamacare, and eventually cap federal Medicaid payments to states, the document said. And they plan to repeal cuts that Obamacare made in payments to hospitals treating large numbers of uninsured. Lawmakers left the meeting saying there was plenty more work ahead on thorny issues. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady said there is a range of options for giving states more say over Medicaid. He also said there were options to offset the cost of a Republican plan, such as capping the tax exclusion for employer-based healthcare plans.

As Trump and Republicans ricochet from crisis to crisis, lawmakers have lowered expectations for legislative action in 2017 on tax reform, health care, financial regulation, jobs and infrastructure, with some urging more White House guidance. Trump has spelled out few specifics on such issues in his more than two dozen executive orders, proclamations and memoranda. A temporary ban on U.S. entry by refugees and people from seven Muslim-majority countries was blocked in court. Ambitious campaign promises by Trump helped the Republicans make a clean sweep of the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives in Novembers national elections.  Movement on legislation could come soon now that the Senate has confirmed nine of Trumps Cabinet nominees and is poised to approve others soon, despite delays by Democrats.  But concern is mounting among some Republicans and moderate Democrats who had hoped for more at this stage. On taxes, for instance, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told Reuters, What Id like to see the administration do is lead on this issue. The White House needs to either come out with their own tax cut plan or weigh in pretty quickly, he said, Im getting unnerved that theres lack of coordination. Last week, Trump promised a phenomenal tax plan within weeks but offered no details. Nor has he firmly endorsed or opposed tax reform proposals being debated in Congress.  At a party retreat last month, lawmakers warmed to remarks by Trump that seemed to show support for a House Republican border adjustment tax to encourage exports and discourage imports. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan issued a statement saying Congress and Trump were on the same page. But the enthusiasm was short-lived. The White House later said border adjustment was only one option. After a week, Ryan said tax reform legislation would not appear until mid-2017. Democratic Representative Jim Himes, who has talked about working with Republicans, said in an interview that promises of day one action have rung hollow. Instead, we are torn apart by poorly drafted executive orders, tweets, Russian ties to the White House, he said.  At a press conference on Thursday, Trump said he would submit an initial plan on health care in March and tackle tax reform after that. He said, Tax reforms going to happen fairly quickly. Were doing Obamacare. Were in the final stages. Trumps legislative record lags some, but not all, recent presidents. Democrat Barack Obama laid out an economic stimulus plan days after his January 2009 swearing in and signed it into law less than a month later. Republican George W. Bush sent a tax cut proposal to Congress less than three weeks after taking office in January 2001. It was enacted four months later. Democrat Bill Clinton fulfilled a central campaign promise in his first weeks in office when he enacted a family-leave bill on Feb. 5, 1993. Republican George H.W. Bush accomplished little of note in his first 100 days, while his predecessor Republican Ronald Reagan sent dozens of detailed budget cut plans to Congress less than a month after his 1981 swearing in.  In an Oct. 22 campaign speech, Trump vowed to work with Congress to introduce broader legislative measures in the first 100 days of his administration to reform the tax code, repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, boost job creation, curb job offshoring, spend $1 trillion on infrastructure and build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.  In his first 27 days, Trump has not yet offered any legislation to advance these goals. Investors have not been deterred. The Dow Jones industrial average has surged roughly 12 percent since he was elected. Right now there is a lot of hope in the market, but so far I havent seen Trump show that he knows how to manage policy or have much of a plan, said Thyra Zerhusen, co-chief investment officer of Fairpointe Capital in Chicago. PROCEEDING WELL - HENSARLING Trump signed a bill into law on Tuesday repealing an Obama administration anti-corruption rule that required oil and mining companies to disclose payments to foreign officials. Republican Representative Jeb Hensarling, who attended the signing ceremony, said, Things are proceeding well. Legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, and replace parts of it will be unveiled after a 10-day House recess that begins on Friday, Ryan said on Thursday. Republicans have been struggling to come up with a detailed plan for replacing Obamas signature domestic policy that they have vowed to repeal. At the outset of Trumps term, Republican lawmakers, lobbyists and tax experts were planning to repeal Obamacare in February, then begin revamping the tax code in March. Now, House Republicans say they may pass a tax-reform bill by August. That would force the Senate to take up the issue at the start of the 2018 midterm election season, a bad time for lawmakers to be making hard decisions. From the start of the new administration, some Republicans had jitters about Trumps moves, such as his battle with the media over the size of the crowd at his swearing-in ceremony. He should be talking about how were going to be reforming healthcare, Republican Representative Charlie Dent told reporters on Jan. 24. I hope he gets more focused on policy.

The issue was the margin of victory in the U.S. Electoral College, which Trump asserted early in the news conference was the biggest since fellow Republican Ronald Reagan, who was elected in 1980 and 1984.  Trump defeated Hillary Clinton by a 304-227 tally of state-by-state electors, who represent votes cast in the election. Seven electors voted for someone else. We got 306 because people came out and voted like theyve never seen before so thats the way it goes, the president said.   Twitter exploded with fact-checking of Trumps statement. Although proportionally he had 306 electoral votes on the night of the Nov. 8 election, two of those electors defected when they cast official ballots on Dec. 19.   A quick check by a reporter at the news conference showed President Barack Obama, a Democrat, amassed more electoral votes in 2008 (365) and 2012 (332). In 1988, President George H.W. Bush, a Republican, drew 426 electoral votes.  Few observers, however, were expecting a White House reporter to confront Trump about it in real time, while sitting in the East Room. Within minutes the reporter, Peter Alexander of NBC News, stood and corrected Trump, noting Obamas and Bushs tallies and asking whether Americans could trust the president to state the facts.  Why should Americans trust you when you accuse the information theyve received of being fake when youre providing information thats not accurate? the TV correspondent asked. Trump seemed to blame his staff. I was given that information, he replied. Actually, Ive seen that information around. Trump then called on another reporter. On the 2016 campaign trail and since taking office on Jan. 20, Trump has made criticizing the media a centerpiece of his communications strategy.

David Friedman, a bankruptcy lawyer Trump has called a longtime friend and trusted adviser, has supported Jewish settlement building and advocated the annexation of the West Bank, which Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 war. His nomination has been fiercely opposed by some American Jewish groups. Friedman repeatedly expressed regret for likening liberal American Jews to Jewish prisoners who worked for the Nazis during the Holocaust, telling the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in his opening statement, I regret the use of such language. Trump is following through on a promised shift in U.S. policy toward Israel after years of friction between former President Barack Obama and Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu. Flanked by Netanyahu at a White House news conference, Trump on Wednesday dropped a U.S. commitment to a two-state solution, long a bedrock of its Middle East policy, even as he urged Netanyahu to curb settlement construction. The heated opposition to Friedmans nomination erupted in the hearing room as Friedman began his opening statement, with several hecklers including a man who held up the Palestinian flag and shouted about Palestinian claims to the land of Israel. My grandfather was exiled, the man said before being escorted out of the room. Palestinians will always be in Palestine! Democratic senators pressed Friedman on incendiary comments he made including calling Obama an anti-Semite and Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer, who is Jewish, an appeaser. Frankly the language you have regularly used against those who disagree with your views has me concerned about your preparedness to enter the world of diplomacy, Ben Cardin, the senior Democrat on the committee, told the nominee. Friedman acknowledged using overheated rhetoric as part of his passionate support for the Jewish state, which has included financial support of Jewish settlements built on land claimed by Palestinians. He promised to avoid inflammatory comments as a U.S. diplomat. He told Cardin, There is no excuse. If you want me to rationalize it or justify it, I cannot. These were hurtful words and I deeply regret them. Cardin, citing Friedmans criticism of Schumer as having done the worst appeasement of terrorists since Munich, retorted that those words were beyond hurtful.  We need a steady hand in the Middle East, not a bomb thrower, admonished Tom Udall, another Democrat. Under questioning, Friedman tried to soften his positions on a number of hot-button regional issues.  While expressing skepticism of a two-state solution calling for the creation of Palestinian state next to Israel, he acknowledged it was the best option for peace. He said he did not personally support Israeli annexation of the West Bank and agreed with Trumps view that settlement activity may not be helpful to achieving peace. Youre here today having to recant every single strongly held belief that youve expressed, almost, the committees Republican chairman, Bob Corker, noted. Friedman is likely to be confirmed by the Senate, which is controlled by Republicans. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham acknowledged that Friedman has said things he did not agree with but backed the nominee as qualified, experienced and passionate. I believe he is the right guy at the right time. Hell be Trumps voice. Trump won the election, Graham said.  Five former U.S. ambassadors to Israel from both Republican and Democratic administrations urged the Senate in a letter to reject Friedman, saying that he holds extreme, radical positions on issues such as Jewish settlements and the two-state solution. We believe him to be unqualified for the position, wrote the former ambassadors including Thomas Pickering, Edward Walker, Daniel Kurtzer, James Cunningham and William Harrop. While campaigning for the presidency, Trump pledged to switch the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv, where it has been located for 68 years, to Jerusalem, all but enshrining the city as Israels capital regardless of international objections.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Wary Democrats on Thursday challenged Republicans who control the U.S. Congress to conduct a credible investigation into contacts between President Donald Trumps associates and Russia, a process that will likely take months and may never become public. We will be watching very carefully. If the Intelligence Committee investigation is not proceeding to unearth the entire truth, we will seek alternative tools and structures to get to the truth, because get to the trust we must, said Charles Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate. A growing number of Republicans showed their willingness to buck the White House and accept expanded congressional inquiries after the resignation of Trumps national security adviser Michael Flynn over disclosures that he discussed U.S. sanctions with the Russian ambassador before taking office. Trump has reacted angrily in the aftermath of Flynns resignation, blaming journalists and blasting leaks. On Thursday, he dismissed a growing controversy about ties between his aides and Russia as a scam and a ruse, perpetrated by a hostile news media. But without the authority to hire a Watergate-style special prosecutor or convene a special committee, Democrats will have to rely on the Republican-led Senate and House of Representatives Intelligence Committees to demand classified documents and get to the bottom of any ties between Trumps associates and Moscow. After eight years with a Democrat in the White House, Republicans want to work with Trump and his administration to advance their partys legislative priorities, from repealing Obamacare to rolling back regulations and cutting taxes. But some congressional Republicans said they would support independent investigations only if committee-level probes proved inadequate. The jurisdiction for counterintelligence programs falls on the Intelligence Committee, which is undertaking a bipartisan investigation, which I have full confidence will ... do a very good job and conduct a serious inquiry, said Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican member of the intelligence panel. If it doesnt, which would surprise me, then Ill be one of the first ones out there to say that it didnt do so, Rubio told reporters. A probe could take a year or more, in part because U.S. intelligence agencies have just begun to gather and analyze material. There will likely also be deep partisan divisions over which of its findings could ultimately be released. Democrats and Republicans have not agreed on the scope of an investigation. Democrats want Flynn to testify in a public hearing, but Richard Burr, the Senate Intelligence Committee chairman, has said only that public hearings would take place when they are appropriate. Some Democrats had questioned Burrs commitment to a thorough investigation, but Schumer said on Thursday that Burr is now working well with Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee. Senator Ron Wyden, another Democrat on the intelligence panel, said there would be tough battles ahead. Partisan divides are deeper in the House, where many Republicans - like Trump - have focused on the dangers posed by leaks from his White House, rather than aides potential ties to Russia. Rep. Devin Nunes, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, questioned whether the recordings of Flynns conversations were even legal under federal surveillance rules. But critics say Republican calls for leak investigations may just be aimed at deflecting attention from possible misconduct by Trump aides. Paul Ryan, the Republican House Speaker, took a different view, telling his weekly news conference on Thursday: If its classified information, that is criminal and there should be a criminal investigation of these leaks. That does compromise our national security. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Seema Verma, Trumps nominee to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), did not answer questions about whether the U.S. government should negotiate with pharmaceutical companies over drug prices. I think what happened with ... the EpiPen issue is very disturbing, Verma said at her confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee. The idea that perhaps Medicaid programs, which are struggling to pay for those programs, that they could have potentially received rebates is disturbing to me.  Mylanhas been criticized for listing EpiPenwith Medicaid as a generic product even though it listed it with the Food and Drug Administration as a branded product. The classification led to Mylans paying significantly smaller rebates to the Medicaid healthcare program for the poor than if EpiPen were classified as branded. I would like to review the processes in place there, in terms of the classifications, in terms of brand and generic, to ensure that type of thing doesnt happen again, Verma said. CMS said last year that it had expressly advised Mylan that the drugmaker had improperly classified EpiPen. Mylan said last month that U.S. antitrust authorities had launched an investigation into EpiPen. The company said suggestions it took any inappropriate or unlawful actions to prevent generic competition was without merit. Mylan has also come under fire for raising the price of a two-pack of EpiPens to $600 last summer from $100 in 2008. Mylan began selling a generic version of EpiPen for $300 per two-pack in December. Verma also said she would produce records of communication between the agency and Mylan, when questioned by Republican Senator Chuck Grassley. A statement from Grassleys office said Mylan had overcharged states and taxpayers by potentially hundreds of millions of dollars.  Democrats were not pleased with Vermas sidestepping a question from Senator Debbie Stabenow about whether she agreed with Trump that the government should negotiate with drug companies over prices of drugs covered by the Medicare healthcare program for the elderly and disabled. I dont think thats a simple yes or no answer, Verma said. The goal is to make sure that were getting affordable prices for our seniors.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": "" NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Trump administrations combative view of traditional news media as the opposition party and fake news is turning out to be the best hope in 2017 for newspapers struggling to attract more digital readers and advertisers.  The New York Times (NYT.N), the Financial Times, The Wall Street Journal and Gannett Co are building on the online readership they gained during the 2016 presidential election by marketing unbiased reporting as a sales strategy.  The risk, however, is whether those new readers will attract advertising dollars to the newspapers, some of which have been criticized for having political leanings. An Edelman survey of more than 33,000 people in 28 countries shows trust in the media is at an all-time low at just 35 percent.  So far, there is reason for optimism among newspaper executives and investors. The New York Times, which President Donald Trump has referred to as failing in his Twitter messages, added a record 276,000 digital news subscribers in the last quarter and sees digital ad revenue up 10 to 15 percent in the current quarter. The company said it expects to add 200,000 digital subscriptions to its news products in the first quarter.  The Wall Street Journal added 113,000 digital subscriptions in its latest quarter, an almost 12 percent jump. The company said that Januarys numbers were even higher, but it declined to provide figures.  Financial Times digital subscriptions jumped 6 percent in the fourth quarter to 646,000, while digital subscriptions at the 109 local newspapers across the country that make up the Gannetts USA Today Network, grew 26 percent to 182,000 in the fourth quarter.  Meanwhile USA Today, which is part of the USA Today Network, and not subscription based, saw revenue grow 1.4 percent, the company said. It said 68 percent of USA Todays advertising revenue in the fourth quarter came from digital.  In addition to the proliferation of \""fake news\"" websites that publish false stories for propaganda purposes, another challenge for traditional media is hostility from Trump who has on occasion described their reporting as \""fake news.\"" Republican Trump's close adviser, Stephen Bannon, told The New York Times in an interview in January: \""The media's the opposition party\"" and not the Democratic Party.  To win over advertisers and readers trust, The Wall Street Journal ran ads online and in print during the election. One featured a pin ball machine with the tagline, No Tilt. Campaign coverage thats on the level.  The paper has run ads after the election to highlight its content as created, curated and checked in a real newsroom.  The New York Times, which is focused on increasing its subscriber revenue, in January launched its Truth campaign consisting of online ads urging readers to sign up because, Truth. It needs your support.  The newspaper sees an opportunity in making sure readers understand that it is fair and accurate and plans to launch another marketing campaign in coming weeks, Chief Executive Officer Mark Thompson said on the companys last earnings call.  The Financial Times is running its Facts. Truths. campaign promoting its coverage of the election and now the Trump administration.  Gannett, which rebranded its publications under the USA Today Network, has used the election to highlight it has journalists at local newspapers across the United States, said Andy Yost, chief marketing officer at Gannett.  Divisiveness stirred by the election campaign has made brands avoid publications that appear to be politically aligned, saidNatalie Prout, a strategist at Phenomenon, a Los Angeles-based branding agency.  For example, there is a heightened understanding in the wake of Novembers election that if a brand buys an ad in The Huffington Post, for example, it could be perceived as supporting a liberal agenda, Prout said.  Brands are also worried about their ads showing up in what is perceived as fake news, so they are exercising more caution when using programmatic advertising, where they automatically buy digital ad spots through a third party.  Instead of listing which sites they do not want their ads showing up on, more advertisers are choosing which sites they do want to see their ads, said Barry Lowenthal, president of The Media Kitchen, a New York-based media buyer.  Despite the recent bump in subscribers, newspapers still are facing major headwinds, said newspaper analyst Ken Doctor.  Print advertising is in free fall, Doctor said. The fundamentals havent changed.  But growing digital subscribers can help attract advertisers to other areas, such as conferences, said Suzi Watford, chief marketing officer of Dow Jones, which includes The Wall Street Journal.  The more we are able to bring in people, the more we are able to build and maintain a healthy ad business, Watford said.

The hearing is likely to last three to four days, with Gorsuch and committee members making opening statements on the first day, the nominee facing questions on the second day and outside experts also testifying, Senator Chuck Grassley said. Grassley said in a statement that Gorsuch, nominated by Trump on Jan. 31, has so far met every demand posed by Democrats, who are the minority party in the Senate but can still delay action if they can muster enough votes. Hes a mainstream judge.Hes displayed independence. Hes met with dozens of senators who have nothing but positive things to say. He is well-qualified and respected, Grassley said. Supreme Court nominees require Senate confirmation for the lifetime job on the nine-justice court. With four liberals and four conservatives now on the court, Gorsuchs confirmation would restore the conservative majority that had existed for decades until the February 2016 death of Justice Antonin Scalia. Democrats, still furious over the Republican-led Senates refusal last year to consider Democratic President Barack Obamas nominee Merrick Garland to replace Scalia, have raised questions about whether Gorsuch would be willing to demonstrate independence from Trump if confirmed to the job. In light of Trumps pointed criticism of judges who ruled against him in the past, Democrats are likely to question Gorsuch about the importance of an independent judiciary. After courts put on hold Trumps ban on people entering the United States from seven Muslim-majority countries, the president criticized the proceedings as disgraceful, called one of the jurists a so-called judge and labeled the judiciary so political.  Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal said last week Gorsuch told him during a private meeting that Trumps comments about the judiciary were disheartening and demoralizing, an account that Gorsuchs spokesman, Ron Bonjean, confirmed but Trump disputed. The Senates top Democrat, Chuck Schumer, last week accused Gorsuch of avoiding answering questions like the plague during their private meeting and dodging efforts to gauge his judicial independence. Trumps fellow Republicans control the Senate 52-48 but Schumer has insisted Gorsuch would need to win 60 votes, rather than a simple majority, to move toward confirmation. Democrats can seek to use a procedural maneuver to block a confirmation vote if Gorsuchs supporters cannot muster 60 votes, although Republicans could change the Senate rules. If the hearing goes smoothly and the full Senate votes to confirm him soon afterward, Gorsuch could be on the court before the end of the courts current term in June.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""NOGALES, Arizona (Reuters) - For up to 16 hours a day, tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers and mangoes grown in Mexico flow north through a border checkpoint into Nogales, Arizona, helping to ensure a year-round supply of fresh produce across the United States. This is a city built on cross-border trade.    Each year, some 330,000 trucks and 75,000 train cars carrying $17 billion worth of goods move through Nogales, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Economists estimate trade supports nearly one in three jobs here, ranging from workers who inspect the goods to forklift operators who unload them in distribution centers.    In many ways, Nogales represents the flip side of free trade deals that have battered industrial cities in the Midwest, where jobs have been outsourced and manufacturing plants shut down. The cities where Donald Trumps promise to throttle what he calls unfair competition resonated most profoundly during the presidential campaign. It also represents potential risks that new trade barriers could pose for businesses and residents along the border. Only a tall, rusted fence separates Nogales, Arizona, from Nogales, Mexico; the cities are so intertwined that locals call them by a single name, Ambos Nogales or Both Nogales.  Now in office, Trump is considering a 20 percent tax on imports from Mexico, one of several ideas under review in Washington, and is promising to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. More than a dozen city officials, employers and workers interviewed here said a border tax, if enacted, could choke the flow of imports from Mexico. They described a chain of events that would harm the economy, threaten local jobs and lead to higher prices for U.S. consumers. President Trump should take a good look at the effects of whatever he does, because hes going to end up with a real problem, said Nogales Mayor John Doyle, who joined other lawmakers from Arizona, New Mexico and Texas in denouncing the  import tax plan in letters to U.S. lawmakers.      Food, autos and electronics go both ways across the border checkpoint, sometimes more than once. Mexican mangoes and melons come north while California almonds and apples from Washington state go south. U.S. car parts sent to Mexican factories are imported back as finished vehicles. There are hundreds of products that come back and forth through the port of entry in Nogales, Doyle said.        The Trump administration told Reuters that any tax deal would protect U.S. interests.      The American people can rest assured that any policy President Trump pursues will be designed to increase wages for American workers, reduce the U.S. trade deficit, and strengthen the economy so that it works for all, a White House official said in an email. Since the 1994 implementation of NAFTA, trade between Mexico and the United States has risen more than six fold. Each country exported about $40 billion to the other in 1993. Last year the United States imported $294 billion in goods from Mexico and exported $231 billion back, U.S. Census data show.     Nationwide, nearly 5 million jobs are now tied to trade with Mexico, from importers to jobs dependent on low-cost goods, according to a study by the non-partisan Wilson Centers Mexico Institute.     In Santa Cruz County, surrounding Nogales, the produce import industry and supporting businesses account for more than 22 percent of jobs, according to a 2013 report by economists at the University of Arizona. Trade and support for factories across the border account for another 10 percent of the workforce.      The reports lead author, Vera Pavlakovich-Kochi, said a 20 percent border tax would create the strictest barriers to trade in five decades. In addition to Trumps proposal of a 20 percent tax on imports from Mexico, Republican lawmakers have put forth a plan that would cut corporate income tax to 20 percent from 35 percent, exclude export revenue from taxable income and impose a 20 percent tax on imports. The proposals have split Corporate America.  A group of major exporters including Boeing Co, General Electric Co and Pfizer Inc have formed a coalition to support the import tax. At the same time, large retailers, including Target Corp and Best Buy Co Inc, have countered that such a tax would raise consumer prices and hurt their businesses. Seated in his second-floor office in a warehouse nestled in the rolling hills on the outskirts of town, produce trader Jaime Chamberlain said business with Mexico is the lifeblood of Nogales, which brings in more pounds of Mexican produce than any other U.S. border town. Its one of the largest industries here with the most employment and the most to lose, said Chamberlain, a board member of the Fresh Produce Association of the Americas. He voted for Trump and his pro-business, socially conservative agendas, but is lobbying state leaders to oppose the tax. Chamberlains parents began the family business with a $1,000 loan in 1971. He and his sister now own J-C Distributing Inc, which employs about 25 people who handle 120,000 pounds of Mexican tomatoes each week for Taco Bell in addition to orders for major companies such as Kroger Co and Sysco Corp.     The company warehouse is among more than six dozen such facilities on Interstate 19, just a few miles north of Nogales town square. In all, they bring in fruits and vegetables worth $3.3 billion a year, according to the Fresh Produce Association.      Local officials, residents and economists warn that a tax could reverberate across the local economy. For example, a 20 percent border tax could put some of the $17 million in produce trade-related fees on custom brokerage, freight forwarding and truck permits at risk.  There are a lot of unintended consequences with this, said Santa Cruz Board of Supervisors Chairman Manuel Ruiz. There are domino effects all over.      Many local business people expect Mexico to fight back.     A 20 percent tax could start a trade war with Mexico. I dont see how we can impose that unilaterally, said Ricardo Crisantes, vice president of marketing and sales at Wholesum Harvest, which is part of a Mexico-based company that has offices in Nogales and organic farms on both sides of the border.     Company representatives said a border tax could drive the company to shift more farming to the United States, but it also could send import demand to other parts of Latin America that would bypass Nogales.      Restaurant and store owners say the tax would make already tough times even worse.        It would be huge, said Karla Galindo, 35, who owns Rancho Grande restaurant in Nogales with her husband.       She and other local business owners said sales have already been hurt by the war of words between officials in Mexico and the United States. People are afraid to spend their money, Galindo said.

A senior EPA official who had been briefed by members of the Trump administration mentioned the executive orders at a meeting of staffers in the EPAs Office of General Counsel on Tuesday, but did not provide details about what the orders would say, said the sources, who asked not to be named. It was just a heads-up to expect some executive orders, thats it, one of the sources said.  The second source said attendees at the meeting were told Trump would sign between two and five executive orders. Trump administration officials did not respond to requests for comment. Trump has promised to cut U.S. environmental rules - including those ushered in by former President Barack Obama targeting carbon dioxide emissions - as a way to bolster the drilling and coal mining industries, but has vowed to do so without compromising air and water quality.  Trump has also expressed doubts about the science behind climate change and promised during his campaign to pull the United States out of a global pact to combat it. Since his election in November, he has softened that stance, saying he would keep an open mind to the climate accord. Trumps pick to run the EPA, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, is scheduled to face a Senate confirmation vote on Friday, according to a Senate aide, after a contentious hearing last month in which lawmakers pressed Pruitt on his ties to the oil industry. Pruitt sued the EPA more than a dozen times to block its regulations while he was the top prosecutor for the oil and gas producing state.  Trump and Pruitts positions have worried EPA staff, who are concerned the new administration will cut the EPAs budget, critical programs and scientific research. [nL1N1FR1JK] Some Republican lawmakers, emboldened by Trumps election, have raised pressure on the EPA in recent days.  On Tuesday, Rep. Lamar Smith, chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Science, Space and Technology, asked the EPAs inspector general to investigate whether EPA staff were using encrypted messages to coordinate efforts to derail the new administrations agenda, in possible violation of federal records laws.

In the first face-to-face meeting between the two leaders since Trumps victory in the 2016 election, the Republican president backed away from a U.S. embrace of the eventual creation of a Palestinian state, upending a position taken by successive administrations and the international community. Im looking at two states and one state, and I like the one both parties like, Trump told a joint news conference with Netanyahu. I can live with either one. Trump vowed to work toward a peace deal between Israel and Palestinians but said it would require compromise on both sides, leaving it up to the parties themselves ultimately to decide on the terms of any agreement. But he offered no new prescription for achieving an accord that has eluded so many of his predecessors, and Palestinian anger over his abandonment of their goal of statehood could scrap any chance of coaxing them back to the negotiating table.  Dropping a bombshell on Netanyahu as they faced reporters just before sitting down for talks, Trump told him: Id like to see you hold back on settlements for a little bit. The right-wing Israeli leader appeared momentarily startled. It was a rare concession sought by Trump as the two leaders tried to set a new positive tone after eight years of friction  under Trumps Democratic predecessor, President Barack Obama. Netanyahu insisted that Jewish settlements were not the core of the conflict and made no public commitment to reduce settlement building in the occupied West Bank. He later told reporters traveling with him that he hoped to reach an understanding with Trump on settlements. Trump echoed Netanyahus calls for Palestinians to recognize Israel as a Jewish state  something they have refused to do  and to halt incitement against Israelis. But even as Trump promised to pursue peace, saying it might be a bigger and better deal than people in this room even understand, he made no effort to address the deep distrust and other obstacles that have prevented any substantive negotiations since 2014. Setting an initially chummy tone, Trump greeted Netanyahu on a red carpet rolled out to the White House driveway. The two leaders smiled, shook hands and chatted amiably before heading inside, accompanied by first lady Melania Trump and Netanyahus wife, Sara. Among the questions that figured prominently on the agenda was the future of the two-state solution  the idea of creating a Palestine living peacefully alongside Israel. Foreshadowing Trumps policy shift, a senior White House official said on Tuesday that peace did not necessarily have to entail Palestinian statehood. Palestinians responded by warning Trump that such a move would seriously damage U.S. credibility. Giving a meandering response to a question on the issue, Trump suggested that he could abide by whatever path the two sides decided. Im happy with the one they like the best, he said. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas seized on Trumps settlements comment to demand a complete halt to such building - which Palestinians see as meant to deny them a viable state - and said he remained committed to the two-state solution and to international law. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned   against abandoning the idea of a sovereign Palestinian state alongside Israel, saying there was no alternative. Netanyahu committed, with conditions, to the two-state goal in a speech in 2009 and has broadly reiterated the aim since. But he has also spoken of a state minus option, suggesting he could offer the Palestinians deep-seated autonomy and the trappings of statehood without full sovereignty. At the news conference, he never ruled out a two-state solution, but also made it sound like an almost impossible ideal. He said it would require preconditions, including the Palestinians recognition of Israel as a Jewish state and Israels retaining security control in the area west of the Jordan River - which would encompass all of the West Bank. Netanyahu and Trump shared several warm handshakes during the news conference, especially after Trumps opening remarks, when he said the United States was Israels greatest friend. But Trump also managed to catch Netanyahu off guard, at one point saying that if a solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict was going to be reached both sides will have to make compromises. The president then turned to Netanyahu and said: You know that, right? Netanyahu replied with a chuckle, Both sides. The two leaders agreed that there was an opening for enlisting Israels Arab neighbors - which share its concerns about Iran - into any future peace efforts. But a retreat from the principle of Palestinian statehood would cast doubt on the chances for cooperation from the broader Arab world. Martin Indyk, a former Middle East negotiator under Obama and now at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, said of the possibility that Washington might ditch its support for an independent Palestinian nation, Its another nail in the coffin of the peace process, which already had a lot of nails in it. The one-state idea would be deeply problematic for both sides. One concept would be two systems for two peoples, which Palestinians would see as apartheid. Another version would mean equal rights for all, including for Palestinians in an annexed West Bank, but that would compromise Israels Jewish character. Palestinians have expressed fear that their leadership will be frozen out by Netanyahus close bond with Trump. But CIA director Mike Pompeo met Abbas in Ramallah on Tuesday, U.S. and Palestinian officials said. For Netanyahu, the talks with Trump are an opportunity to reset ties after a frequently combative relationship with Obama. The prime minister, under investigation at home over allegations of abuse of office, wanted no visible gaps between U.S. and Israeli thinking during his visit. Trump, who has been in office less than four weeks and whose foreign policy apparatus is in disarray following the forced resignation of his national security adviser Michael Flynn,  brings with him an unpredictability that Netanyahus staff hoped would not impinge on the discussions. The two leaders, who seemed to strike up an emerging bromance in social media exchanges since the U.S. election, sought to demonstrate good personal chemistry face-to-face as well. Meetings with Obama were at best cordial and businesslike, at worst tense and awkward. In one Oval Office encounter in 2011, Obama grimaced as Netanyahu lectured him in front of the cameras on the suffering of the Jewish people through the ages.

Pruitt is scheduled to face a Senate confirmation vote on Friday. Unless more Republicans join Collins in opposing Pruitt, his nomination is likely to be approved. Republicans hold 52 of the 100 seats in the chamber and Vice President Mike Pence could cast the deciding vote in case of a tie. Due to my concerns about Mr. Pruitts commitment to the mission of the EPA, I will cast my vote in opposition to his confirmation, Collins said in a statement. President Donald Trump has vowed to cut regulation to revive the oil, gas and coal industries, and has said he can do so without compromising air and water quality.  The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee approved Pruitts nomination two weeks ago after Democrats boycotted the vote over concerns about Pruitts environmental record. As Oklahoma attorney general, Pruitt sued the EPA more than a dozen times on behalf of the oil-drilling state and he has cast doubts on the science of climate change. His actions leave me with considerable doubts about whether his vision for the EPA is consistent with the agencys critical mission to protect human health and the environment, Collins said. She said Pruitt had sued the EPA on issues of importance to Maine, including mercury controls for coal-fired power plants and efforts to reduce cross-state air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Senator Tom Carper, the top Democrat on the energy committee, and several other Democrats have asked Senate Leader Mitch McConnell to delay a procedural vote on Pruitt scheduled for Thursday. They want the vote delayed until after the conclusion of an emergency hearing in Oklahoma to be held at 4 p.m. ET that will consider whether emails between Pruitts office and officials at oil and gas companies should be released.  Access to those records was requested by the Center for Media and Democracy, a watchdog group, more than two years ago. Conservative group FreedomWorks blasted Collins, who also voted against the nomination last week of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. Pences vote was needed to break a tie before DeVos was confirmed. FreedomWorks Chief Executive Adam Brandon said in a statement it was a shame that Collins was again aligning herself with far-left Democrats and special interests.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON/BERLIN (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence heads to Europe this week to meet with allies seeking clarity on the Trump administrations foreign policy strategy and its stance toward Russia after the resignation of the top White House national security aide.  Pence, who has hewn more closely to Republican orthodoxy than his boss President Donald Trump, will attend the Munich Security Conference this weekend and will visit Brussels. The trip comes as turmoil swirls within the administration following the resignation of Trumps national security adviser, Michael Flynn, on Monday. Flynn, who championed closer ties to Russia, stepped down after reports he had discussed U.S. sanctions on Moscow with Russias ambassador. Even before Flynns departure, Trumps calls for warmer ties with Moscow and his praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin had unnerved both U.S. lawmakers at home and NATO allies. Trump has called NATO obsolete and said member nations were not paying their fair share for U.S. protection.  Some European capitals greeted Flynns departure with relief. Flynn was seen by some officials in Europe as one of the Trump administrations leading advocates of closer ties to Russia and a hardline opponent of the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and western powers. One fear, ahead of a series of important elections in Europe, is that a Trump White House could actively promote the disintegration of the European Union, Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman of the Munich Security Conference told reporters in Berlin. Ischinger said he hopes Pence states clearly that the breakup of the EU is not the goal of the U.S. government. Pence may be unable to lay out many details about Trumps policies given the turbulence on the foreign policy team, but  he could provide insight into White House views ahead of a NATO summit in May that Trump will attend. I think from the administrations point of view, this is an opportunity to make a very major pronouncement on its foreign policy and its European policy, said Alexander Vershbow, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia and a former deputy secretary general of NATO. The White House has not yet previewed Pences remarks. Pences comments on Russias incursions into Ukraine will be closely parsed to see whether Trump will be willing to trade off U.S. economic sanctions to achieve other security goals, said Vershbow, now with the Atlantic Council. Trumps mixed messages on NATO have perplexed European allies. One minute NATO is obsolete - the next minute he loves NATO. One minute NATO is an impediment and doesnt do anything for terrorism - the next minute NATO is the centerpiece of the global fight, said retired U.S. Navy Admiral James Stavridis, a former supreme allied commander of NATO. Pence is the right person to set a more reassuring tone, said Stavridis, now dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. Because of his personality: hes calm, hes centered, hes thoughtful, hes widely regarded with respect on both sides of the aisle in the United States, Stavridis said in an interview. With Flynns departure, European officials said they hope Pence, Defense Secretary James Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson become the dominant players in Trumps foreign policy. But this remains an open question. Tillerson is also in Europe this week, meeting with G20 nations in Bonn, and Mattis traveled to NATO, warning allies that they must honor military spending pledges. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly will also attend the Munich Security Conference, and while in Germany will participate in bilateral meetings with international counterparts, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement on Wednesday.

Puzders decision to withdraw is yet another setback this week for a White House still grappling with fallout from Monday nights abrupt resignation of national security adviser Michael Flynn, after less than a month in the job. Puzder, the chief executive officer of CKE Restaurants Inc, which franchises fast-food chains including Hardees and Carls Jr, has been at the center of a swirl of controversies, complaints and potential conflicts. He admitted earlier this month that he and his wife had employed an undocumented person as a housekeeper. He faced a flurry of complaints and legal cases brought in recent weeks and months by workers against his business and its franchises.  Most recently, a decades-old Oprah Winfrey tape raising allegations of domestic abuse by his ex-wife resurfaced, though those allegations had been withdrawn. After careful consideration and discussions with my family, I am withdrawing my nomination for Secretary of Labor, Puzder said in a statement.  Puzders withdrawal came one day before his scheduled confirmation hearing. At least seven Republican senators, including Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, declined to publicly back Puzder in advance of the confirmation hearing. For weeks now, Republican senators have been telling Senator John Cornyn, the second-highest ranking Republican, that they believed some of their colleagues would join Collins and Murkowski in opposing Puzder, according to a senior Senate Republican aide. The Labor Department oversees compliance with federal laws that mandate safe working conditions, a minimum hourly wage, overtime wages and prohibit employment discrimination.  As labor secretary, Puzder would have shaped the departments approach to these issues, including whether to defend an Obama administration rule expanding overtime pay to millions of workers that has been challenged in the courts.  Earlier this month, Puzder admitted he and his wife had employed an undocumented person as a housekeeper and had to pay back taxes as a result. Workers at some of CKEs restaurants have filed claims in recent weeks alleging they were victims of wage theft or victims of sexual harassment in the workplace. Another possible problem were allegations dating back to 1986 that Puzder had physically abused his now ex-wife, Lisa Henning, now known as Lisa Fierstein. Fierstein filed for divorce in 1987 and later retracted her allegations, but not before appearing anonymously as a victim of domestic abuse on The Oprah Winfrey Show. Last week, the OWN Network released a copy of that tape to the Senate committee so both Democratic and Republican members could view it, according to an aide. Democrats on Wednesday cheered over the news of Puzders withdrawal.  From the start, its been clear that Puzder is uniquely unqualified to serve as secretary of labor, said Patty Murray, the ranking member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.

Three Republican and four Democratic members of the House  introduced the Russian Sanctions Review Act, a companion bill to a measure introduced in the Senate by a separate group of Republicans and Democrats last week. Prospects for both bills are uncertain for now, although that could change if the Trump administration were to move to ease sanctions imposed on Moscow. Trumps national security adviser, Michael Flynn, was forced out on Monday after revelations he had discussed the issue of sanctions with the Russian ambassador to Washington before Trump took office last month, and had then misrepresented to Vice President Mike Pence what he talked about. The affair has thrown a spotlight on U.S. relations with Moscow, which Trump has long said he would like to improve. One sponsor of the House bill, Representative Steny Hoyer, the number two Democrat in the House, said the bills backers would discuss with House leaders whether they would allow the legislation to come up for a vote. Trumps fellow Republicans control majorities in both the Senate and House. To date, congressional leaders have not moved to advance any new legislation related to sanctions on Russia. Both bills are modeled on a 2015 law that let Congress review the Iran nuclear agreement between the United States and other major powers negotiated by former President Barack Obamas administration. Among other things, the measures would require the Trump administration to submit to Congress a description of any proposed easing of sanctions on Russia, and to certify that Moscow had stopped supporting actions to undermine the government of Ukraine or cyber attacks on the United States or its people. The loudest protests about contacts between Trump aides and Russia have come from Democrats, despite their insistence that investigating Russian influence on the U.S. election should not be a partisan issue. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia sought to tilt the 2016 election in Trumps favor by hacking and leaking Democratic emails. The Republicans who co-sponsored the House bill did not attend a news conference about it on Wednesday.

Bibi and I have known each other a long time  a smart man, great negotiator, said Trump, referring to the 67-year-old Israeli leader by his nickname. Netanyahu was equally effusive in response: There is no greater supporter of the Jewish people and the Jewish state than President Donald Trump, he said, referring to the 70-year-old U.S. president who took office on Jan. 20. Trump went some distance to embrace Netanyahus views, upending decades of U.S. Middle East policy by dropping insistence on a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Netanyahu sought to demonstrate personal chemistry with the American property-mogul-turned-politician, an acquaintance since the 1980s, especially after eight years of awkwardness and tensions with his predecessor, President Barack Obama.  But Trump caught Netanyahu off-guard, at one point saying that if a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was going to be reached, Both sides will have to make compromises. Turning to Netanyahu, he said, You know that, right?  Netanyahu looked momentarily startled and replied, chuckling, Both sides. Later, while responding to a question about settlements, a particular point of tension during the Obama years, Trump said, Id like to see you hold back on settlements for a little bit. Again, Netanyahus face registered surprise before he offered an ironic smile. Well work something out, said Trump, who has appointed his son-in-law Jared Kushner as his special adviser on the Middle East.  I think were going to make a deal. It might be a bigger and better deal than people in this room even understand. Thats a possibility. So lets see what we do. Lets try it, Netanyahu said. Studying his reaction, Trump quickly interjected: That doesnt sound too optimistic, but hes a good negotiator. In a play on the title of Trumps 1987 best-selling book, Netanyahu responded, Thats the art of the deal, drawing laughter from the audience. Near the end of his comments, Netanyahu sought to show how well he knows Kushner, whose father, Charles Kushner, has donated generously to Israeli causes. Can I reveal, Jared, how long weve known you? said Netanyahu, looking to Jared Kushner, 36, who was sitting in the front row, next to his wife, Ivanka Trump.

Most of the world considers the Golan, a high plateau  between northeastern Israel and southwestern Syria, to be occupied by Israel, which annexed the territory in 1981 in a move not recognized internationally. During a briefing with Israeli and foreign media after meeting Trump at the White House, Netanyahu was asked whether he had raised the Golan issue. Yes, he replied.  Asked how the U.S. president had responded, he said: I wouldnt say that he was surprised by my request. Netanyahu did not elaborate. Israel made a similar request to the Obama administration in 2015, but it was rejected, diplomats said at the time. While Israel has long coveted sovereignty in the Golan, it is unclear whether the White House would take such a step now, given that it could further complicate the Syrian conflict. If the United States were to recognize Israels claim, it would likely anger Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who is backed by Russia and Iran in his war with Islamist militants and rebel groups. The Trump administration has talked about working more closely with Russia to end the Syrian conflict. Recognizing Israels sovereignty in the Golan could undermine those efforts. It could also spur Iran and its proxies in Syria, particularly the Lebanese Shiite militia Hezbollah, to turn more of their focus against Israel, targeting its forces stationed across the Golan Heights. Israel has warned Hezbollah, with which it fought a six-week war in 2006, against attacking its territory. It has carried out occasional air strikes in the Syrian portion of the Golan to target Hezbollah fighters, including units smuggling arms.  Israels argument for sovereignty over the territory is based partly on the fact that Syria has splintered over the past five years of fighting, to the extent that Israel says there is no one to whom it could hand back the Golan. But with the United States and Israel looking to forge an ever-tighter relationship, it is also possible that Trump, who has shown himself to be unpredictable at times, could decide to recognize Israels sovereignty. As well as around 25,000 Israeli settlers in the territory, many of them working in agriculture, there are about 20,000 Druze of Syrian citizenship, many of whom have relatives living in just across the valley in Syria.

If our (guy) says, well, I am just here to listen, thats going to be dispiriting. U.S. allies worry about Trumps unpredictability. They wonder how far he will go in warning China and Iran about their behavior, whether he will back out of long-standing treaties and trade deals, tear up the nuclear agreement with Iran, build a border wall with Mexico, or cozy up to Moscow. Tillerson, the former Exxon Mobil CEO, has international business experience but none in government. State Department officials said he would meet with counterparts from Britain, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Italy and Oman while in Bonn, and participate in larger meetings on Yemen and Syria. He also will hold his first meeting as secretary of state with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov at a time when Trump administration contacts with Moscow are under the spotlight with the resignation of national security adviser Michael Flynn. Flynn had been the new administrations main contact for many foreign ambassadors to the United States.

That chemistry with counterparts begins on the first trip, he said. Secretary Tillerson and his counterparts will be working on some of the toughest issues around the world and thats going to require trust.  While Tillerson has been on the job for just two weeks and may not be immersed in all subjects yet, Wilkinson said: Foreign ministers will be understanding that in the early days he may not have all the answers, but they will want to know they have a conduit to someone who can speak for the U.S. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

In his third budget address to the legislature, the Republican governor said a bipartisan Senate bill package aimed at breaking the states nearly 20-month budget impasse could win his support. First and foremost: the final result must be a good deal for taxpayers and job creators: a grand bargain that truly balances the budgetonce and for all, and really moves the needle when it comes to job creation, Rauner said in a speech punctuated with Democratic snickering and laughter. He conditioned his support for an income tax hike proposed by Senate leaders to a permanent freeze on local property taxes rather than for two years as the Senate package dictates. He also was open to broadening Illinois sales tax base but rejected taxing food and medicine. Illinois is limping through a record-setting second consecutive fiscal year without a complete budget due to an ongoing feud between Rauner and Democrats who control the legislature. A six-month fiscal 2017 budget expired on Dec. 31. Rauners fiscal 2018 general fund budget calls for $37.3 billion in spending but projects $32.7 billion in revenue, leaving $4.57 billion in unspecified cuts and revenue increases to be negotiated with the legislature. The budget also depends on changes to state worker pay and health care benefits that unions have fiercely opposed. Analysts at S&P Global Ratings, which released a highly critical report on Illinois budget stalemate this month, said it was unclear how Rauners plan provides a spending framework supported by sufficient revenue. Im not sure how far it moves the ball down the field, said S&P analyst Gabe Petek. Illinois credit ratings, the lowest among the 50 states, have been downgraded six times since Rauner took office in January 2015 and now are just two notches above junk level. Before Rauners speech, some Democrats taped sheets of paper to their desks saying Rauner Budget = Fake News and Rauner Budget = Alternative Facts. Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan, who rejected a Republican call to remove the signs, condemned Rauner for having failed to introduce a balanced budget for a third straight year. The Senates so-called grand bargain consists of 12 bills to raise income taxes by a third, borrow $7 billion to winnow down a $12 billion record-setting pile of unpaid bills and expand casino gambling. It would also change how workers are compensated for on-the-job injuries and impose term limits on legislative leaders. A key bill to ease Illinois $130 billion unfunded pension crisis  was rejected by the Senate this month. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Republican Senator Thad Cochran, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, informed his staff that he intends to support Mulvaneys confirmation, according to an aide. Earlier in the day an aide said Cochran had not yet decided whether to vote for Mulvaney. With Republican Senator John McCain announcing on the Senate floor that he would oppose Mulvaney, Cochran was seen as the potential 51st vote needed in the 100-member chamber for confirmation. McCain, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee that oversees defense programs, blasted Mulvaney in a Senate floor speech, saying the nominee had pursued reckless budget strategies that led to a partial government shutdown in 2013. McCain also lashed out at Mulvaneys efforts on military affairs, including a vote in 2011 that the Arizona senator said would have brought the immediate withdrawal of all U.S. troops from Afghanistan, ending a mission to prevent it from becoming a safe haven for terrorists. Without Cochran, Vice President Mike Pence would have been thrust into the spotlight and likely called upon to break a likely 50-50 tie that threatened to doom Mulvaneys nomination. Pence was needed to break such a tie over Betsy DeVos to be education secretary. Some Senate Republicans have been worried Mulvaney might not go along with beefing up spending on military programs. A Senate vote on Mulvaney, a leading member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus who represents a region of South Carolina, was expected on Thursday at 7 a.m. (1200 GMT). Any one of the 100 senators could still change their position on Mulvaney before the vote, but there were no fresh signs of that happening following Cochrans decision. A Senate panel only narrowly backed the nominee this month in a party-line vote. Republicans have 52 of the 100 Senate seats and are able to approve Trumps nominees if they can hold together a majority. Democrats have criticized Mulvaney for taking a hard line on popular social programs and for not paying more than $15,000 in taxes in relation to a household employee until after he was nominated. He has said he favors raising the Social Security retirement age to 70 and means-testing beneficiaries of the Medicare health care program. These positions have drawn the ire of Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats and sought the partys presidential nomination in 2016.

Bruce Rauners proposed budget would add a projected 170 troopers through two cadet classes, one this year and another during the 2019 fiscal year. Seventy of these troopers would be sent to the Chicago area.      Those officers will allow us to send more patrols to the Chicago area, to the expressways to counter the violence that has spilled over onto the highways there, the Republican governor told lawmakers in his Springfield budget address.  The number of Illinois State Police troopers has declined significantly since 2008 when there were 2,105 sworn officers, according to state police data. That number dropped by more than 400 troopers to 1,671 as of last year. Rauner took office in 2015.  Feuding between Rauner and Democrats who control the legislature has kept Illinois without a full operating budget since July 2015, which has meant no cadet hires for the state police in 2015 and 2016. A six-month fiscal 2017 budget expired on Dec. 31. At the same time, the number of shootings on Chicago-area expressways has consistently increased, with law enforcement placing the blame on increased gang activity.  There were just nine Chicago-area expressway shootings in 2011 and 2012. Shooting incidents jumped to 19 in 2014 from 16 in 2013. The number nearly doubled to 37 in 2015 and rose again to 47 in 2016.  Three of last years shootings were fatal.   There have been two confirmed shootings on the expressways so far this year and six others that are unconfirmed, Illinois State Police spokesman Jason Bradley said by email.  The violence in 2016 came as part of a broader surge in violence across Chicago, the nations third most populous city.   With the additions to police numbers, there will be an increase in overall state police headcount of about 140 to an estimated 2,651 for the 2018 fiscal year from an estimated 2,511 for fiscal 2017.  The cost of the two classes for the 2018 fiscal year will be $10.5 million, the proposed budget said. The annualized cost of the new officers, including salaries and benefits, will be $20 million.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Wednesday proposed changes to the Obamacare individual insurance market that insurers welcomed as a good start but that raised the possibility of higher out-of-pocket cost for consumers. President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans have promised to scrap the 2010 healthcare law that is a key legacy of Democrat Barack Obamas presidency. But they are struggling to agree on a replacement for the law, which extended health insurance to 20 million Americans. The proposed new rule, issued by a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, sets out changes that are meant to shore up the system developed by Obama, and comes after Humana Inc (HUM.N) on Tuesday said it would pull out of this market in 2018. It is unclear which elements of Obamacare could survive in the Republicans replacement. The rule does not address changes that must be made by law, such as for Obamacares income-based subsidies. The changes would tighten enrollment processes and allow insurers to collect unpaid premium payments, making it tougher for people to move in and out of insurance plans. Insurers say gaming the system has created an unprofitable mix of healthy and sick customers. The Affordable Care Act aimed to chip away at soaring healthcare spending, but data shows costs are still rising. The U.S. government reported separately on Wednesday that total U.S. medical spending in 2017 is estimated to rise 5.4 percent to $3.36 trillion after a 4.8 percent spending uptick in 2016. The administration on Wednesday also backed off implementing tougher oversight of the individual mandate, the requirement for all Americans to have health insurance or pay a fine, that was due to go into effect for 2016 taxes. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service said as a result of Trumps executive order to reduce regulatory burden, it will not reject tax filings for the year 2016 that fail to indicate whether they had health coverage or paid the penalty set under Obamacare. This is a return to the policy for 2015 taxes, the IRS said. The mandate was supposed to bring in healthy customers but Republicans have vowed to overturn it and insurers say it has not worked.  Aetna (AET.N) CEO Mark Bertolini on Wednesday said during a Wall Street Journal forum that the Obamacare exchanges had entered a death spiral in which rising premiums pushed out the healthiest customers, which in turn raises rates. Aetna cut back offering new plans for 2017 and it and Anthem Inc. (ANTM.N) have said that without changes, they might not take part after this year.  Bertolini said in a statement that new Health Secretary Tom Price and the Trump administration have taken some good initial steps with the proposed regulation. The top two industry groups, Americas Health Insurance Plans and Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, echoed that view. Shares of insurers were mixed in the early afternoon on Wednesday with Aetna gaining 1 percent to $127.01, Cigna off less than 1 percent at $146.07 and Humana off 0.3 percent to $205.34. Anthem fell less than 1 percent to $162.90. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which are part of the Department of Health and Human Services, on Wednesday proposed the new rule that includes verifying the status of enrollees outside of the usual enrollment period. It also proposes insurers can collect unpaid premiums from members when they sign up with the same issuer again, an incentive for people to always have insurance.  In addition, it proposed lowering the amount of guaranteed coverage for some silver level plans in the program, which it said could raise out-of-pocket spending and cut premiums. It would give the states oversight of doctor and hospital networks included in the plans, reflecting a Republican theme that healthcare oversight be reduced at the federal level. The rule proposes shortening the open enrollment period for the individual market to Nov. 1 through Dec. 15, similar to employer-sponsored insurance market and Medicare. The weakening of the mandate and the new CMS rule making it tougher for people to sign up would have contradictory effects on premium pricing, according to Jonathan Gruber, professor of economics at MIT and one of the architects of the Affordable Care Act. Youre basically saying on the one hand, we have to weaken the mandate for political reasons but we have to lower prices, so we have to kick people out of the exchanges, Gruber said. Patient advocate Families USA said the new rules would discourage younger, healthier people from enrolling, reduce financial assistance for families and make it harder for them to find networks that include their doctors. Republican lawmakers, who are working on an Obamacare replacement, said the rule was a start. If we dont take more steps like that, having an Obamacare subsidy will be like having a bus ticket in a town where no buses run, because there will be zero choices to buy, Senator Lamar Alexander, chairman of the Senate health committee, told reporters outside the Senate.  Wall Street said the proposed changes could help insurer profitability but it was not clear by how much. As one would expect tightening special enrollment periods, shortening the open enrollment period to six weeks and mandating payment of premiums before coverage should lead to an improvement in the risk pool, Leerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte said.

U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meet later in the day for the first time since the U.S. election in November that brought the Republican to office. On the eve of the meeting, a senior White House official said it was up to the Israelis and Palestinians themselves to decide on the shape of any future peace. Whether that comes in the form of a twostate solution if thats what the parties want, or something else, the official said, adding that Trump, while giving peace high priority would not try to dictate an agreement. For Palestinians, who seek a state in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and in the Gaza Strip, even the notion of a U.S. retreat from the internationally backed goal of a future Palestine existing alongside Israel was alarming. If the Trump Administration rejects this policy it would be destroying the chances for peace and undermining American interests, standing and credibility abroad, Hanan Ashrawi, a senior member of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said in response to the U.S. officials remarks. Accommodating the most extreme and irresponsible elements in Israel and in the White House is no way to make responsible foreign policy, she said in a statement. Netanyahu committed, with conditions, to the two-state goal in a speech in 2009 and has broadly reiterated the aim since. But given regional instability and long-running divisions in Palestinian politics, many in his cabinet argue the time is not ripe for a Palestinian state to emerge. Far-right cabinet ministers in Israel have called for the annexation of parts of the West Bank, which was among the territory Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war. Netanyahu has not endorsed that demand.  Commenting on the White House officials remarks, Husam Zomlot, strategic affairs adviser to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, noted that Palestinian statehood has long been at the heart of international peace efforts. The two-state solution is not something we just came up with. It is an international consensus and decision after decades of Israels rejection of the one-state democratic formula, Zomlot told Reuters in Jerusalem by telephone from the West Bank city of Ramallah. On his departure for Washington on Monday, Netanyahu sidestepped a question on whether he still backed a two-state solution, saying he would make his position clear in the U.S. capital. But he has spoken of a state minus, suggesting he could offer the Palestinians deep-seated autonomy - they already exercise limited self-rule in the West Bank under interim deals - and the trappings of statehood without full sovereignty.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As a teenager in the early 1970s retired U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Robert S. Harward played football and basketball, was popular with classmates and, like many American high school students, was known for partying. But Harward, to whom President Donald Trump has offered the post of U.S. national security adviser, to succeed Michael Flynn, spent his teenage years not in his native Rhode Island, but in pre-revolutionary Iran, where his father, a Navy captain, advised the Iranian military. During his teenage years, Harward lived in an Iranian neighborhood, attended school with Iranian-American students and played sports against Iranian teams. Those experiences gave him an unusual familiarity with Irans culture and people in the years before the 1979 Islamic revolution that ousted the pro-American Shah. During very formative years of his life, he was exposed to everything that was Iran, said Joseph Condrill, who knew Harward, known by his classmates as Bobby, when they were students at the Tehran American School. Iran was one of our homes, and we got to know the Iranian people very well, in a very intimate way. The Trump administration has offered Harward the job of national security adviser, two U.S. officials familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. It was not immediately clear if Harward had accepted, the sources said. A White House spokesperson had no immediate comment. Harward would carry his experience into the Trump White House, charged with coordinating national security policy and responding to threats including Irans ballistic missile program and support for militant groups in the Middle East. While Flynn put Iran on notice, and Trump has tweeted that Iran is playing with fire, Harwards experience with Iran is more personal. The revolution that brought Irans theocratic government to power forced the closure of the Tehran American School and cut short the tours of American families living in Iran. Rather than being isolated on a military base, Harward and other Americans at that time lived among Iranians, rode local buses, and were exposed to Irans attractions through field trips, his classmates said. It was not a completely isolated culture for us, said John Martin, 61, of Reston, Virginia, who was in Harwards high school class and attended the U.S. Naval Academy with him. Harward even picked up fluent Persian while he was in Iran, Martin said. For those of us that had once lived in Iran, theres an after-effect, the effect of the Islamic Revolution, Condrill said. There is definitely a sense of suspicion, if you will ... based upon that experience of the Iran that we once knew. It is not clear, however, how Harwards memories might influence U.S. policy, because the national security advisers job is to coordinate, not make, policy. In addition, administration officials said, Trump advisers Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller have closer ties to the president than Harward would have and would present a rival power center. In 2012, as deputy head of the U.S. Central Command, he told a conference that Irans well-established past pattern of deceit and reckless behavior have progressively increased the potential for miscalculation that could spark a regional, if not a global conflict. At the same event, he recalled with some wistfulness his own experience living in the region. I think back to the days when I graduated from the Tehran American School in 1974, where as a Westerner I could freely travel through Afghanistan, Pakistan, India and other countries in the region and be greeted, and welcomed, because of the policies and strategy the West employed in the region, he said. Yet I look today, we are in a much different world. Harward did not respond to a request for comment and officials at Lockheed Martin, where he is a top executive, declined to comment.        After graduating from high school in 1974, Harward returned to the United States, joined the Navy, became an elite SEAL and rose through the ranks, eventually serving as deputy commander of U.S. Central Command, which oversees American forces in the Middle East. He served there under General Jim Mattis, now the U.S. defense secretary. Earlier in his career, Harward worked on counterterrorism as a military officer on the National Security Council, an assignment seen as a marker of a rising star. Several former U.S. officials who worked with Harward described him as experienced and smart, but not known for his personal experience with Iran. He is well-liked and respected and seen as unpretentious despite his distinguished military service, according to people who have worked with him.  He was a very good and effective bureaucratic player, said Derek Chollet, an assistant secretary of defense under the Obama administration. He understands the role the military plays within the broader tool set of American policy. When Harward was a commanding officer in Afghanistan, he was known for making his rounds without full body armor to send a message that Afghanistan was safe, said a U.S. official who worked under Harward there. He had no ego, the official said, on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Paxton, a Republican, attached a brief in asking the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in California for permission to argue in support of Trumps temporary ban on travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Texas is the first state to back Trump in the closely watched litigation. A group of 15 states and the District of Columbia have filed papers with the appeals court in support of Washington states challenge to Trumps Jan. 27 order, saying it harms their educational institutions and economies. Paxton said the full court should reconsider whether a lower court judge was justified in halting the ban.  U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle suspended Trumps order across the country on Feb. 3. Washington state argued that it violated constitutional protections against religious discrimination. That ruling was upheld by a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit in San Francisco last week, raising questions about Trumps next step. The appeals court will soon vote on whether to reconsider the case with an 11-judge panel. Trumps directive, which he said was necessary to protect the United States from attacks by Islamist militants, barred people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the country for 90 days. Refugees were banned for 120 days, except those from Syria, who were banned indefinitely. The rulings put the order on hold until the courts can rule on the underlying merits. Ultimately, they will have to address questions about the extent of the presidents power on matters of immigration and national security.   Traditionally, judges have been extremely cautious about stepping on the executive branchs authority in such matters, legal experts said. In the brief, Paxton said the order had a clear national security goal, to ensure proper vetting of foreigners seeking entry into the United States. It reflects national-security interests implicated by the ongoing War on Terror against radical Islamic terrorists. Paxton rejected any claim that the order discriminates against Muslims while favoring Christian minorities. If that argument is accepted, he said, it would jeopardize the governments ability to help persecuted religious minorities abroad by granting them refugee status.  Texas led the legal fight against President Barack Obamas plan to protect up to four million immigrants from deportation, joined by 25 other Republican-led states. The challengers won a February 2015 nationwide injunction blocking the program before it was due to go into effect.  In June 2016, the Supreme Court split 4-4 in the case, leaving in place an appeals court ruling in favor of the states.. A major question in that litigation was whether Texas had legal standing to sue, an issue that the Supreme Court did not resolve. In Wednesdays brief, Texas did not address whether Washington and other states had standing to sue over Trumps ban. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The idea of a Palestinian state living side-by-side with Israel has underpinned Middle East peace efforts for decades, though the last U.S.-brokered negotiations broke down in 2014. But a senior White House official said on Tuesday peace did not necessarily have to entail Palestinian statehood, and U.S. President Donald Trump would not try to dictate a solution. Trump, at a Washington news conference held after Guterres spoke, left the question open, saying he would work to bring about peace between Israel and Palestinians, but it would be up to the parties themselves ultimately to reach an agreement.  Before the two leaders met, Palestinians warned the White House not to abandon their goal of an independent state. For Palestinians, who seek a state in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and in the Gaza Strip, even the notion of a U.S. retreat from the internationally backed goal of a future Palestine existing alongside Israel was alarming.

Guterres earlier this month condemned the Israeli parliaments move to legalize thousands of settler homes in the occupied West Bank, saying it goes against international law and will have legal consequences for Israel. Under Israeli law, the move retroactively legalizes about 4,000 settler homes built on privately owned Palestinian land.

U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies intercepted the communications around the same time they were discovering evidence that Russia was trying to disrupt the presidential election by hacking into the Democratic National Committee, three of the officials said, according to the Times. The intelligence agencies then sought to learn whether the Trump campaign was colluding with the Russians on the hacking or other efforts to influence the election, the newspaper said. The officials interviewed in recent weeks said they had seen no evidence of such cooperation so far, it said. However, the intercepts alarmed U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies, in part because of the amount of contact that was occurring while Trump was speaking glowingly about Russian President Vladimir Putin. The intercepted calls are different from the wiretapped conversations last year between Michael Flynn, Trumps former national security adviser, and Sergei I. Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States, the Times said. During those calls, the two men discussed sanctions that the Obama administration imposed on Russia in December. Flynn misled the White House about those calls and was asked to resign on Monday night.  The White House did not immediately respond to a request from Reuters for comment on the Times story. The Times reported that the officials said the intercepted communications were not limited to Trump campaign officials, and included other Trump associates. On the Russian side, the contacts also included members of the Russian government outside the intelligence services, the officials told the Times. All of the current and former officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because the continuing investigation is classified, the newspaper reported.

Were not surprised by anything anymore. This information once again proves that a very deep political game is playing out within the United States, said Zakharova.  The prospect of a swift rapprochement between Russia and the United has lessened since Trumps inauguration due to scandals including the resignation on Monday of national security adviser Michael Flynn, who was seen in Moscow as a leading advocate of softer U.S. policy towards Russia.

Trump was informed in late January that Flynn had not told Vice President Mike Pence the whole truth about conversations he had before Trump took office with Russias ambassador to the United States, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said. Pence learned of the incomplete information that he received from Flynn when news reports surfaced late last week, spokesman Mark Lotter said on Tuesday. Flynn quit on Monday after Trump asked for his resignation, and the president hopes to pick a new national security adviser by the end of the week, Spicer said. The departure was another disruption for an administration already repeatedly distracted by miscues and internal dramas since the Republican businessman assumed the presidency on Jan. 20. The New York Times reported late on Tuesday that members of Trumps campaign and other associates had contact with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the Nov. 8 presidential election, although U.S. officials told the newspaper they had not uncovered any evidence that Trumps associates colluded to disrupt the election. U.S. lawmakers, including some leading Republicans, called for a deeper inquiry into not just Flynns actions but broader White House ties to Russia. Trump has long said that he would like improved relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin.  Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, said Trump only moved against Flynn because of news media attention, not concern about any wrongdoing.  The reason they lost faith or trust in General Flynn only last night when they knew for weeks that he had been lying was that it became public, Schiff told MSNBC. A timeline of events outlined by Spicer and a U.S. official showed that Trump had known for weeks about Flynn misleading the vice president.  Trump, a former reality TV star whose catchphrase was Youre fired! has often boasted of his eagerness to get rid of subordinates. He was not quick to fire Flynn, a strong advocate of a better relations with Russia and a hard line against Islamist militants. The Justice Department warned the White House in late January that Flynn had misled Pence by denying to him that he had discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia with Ambassador Sergei Kislyak, a potentially illegal act, a U.S. official said.  Flynn did talk about sanctions with the diplomat, whose calls were recorded by U.S. intelligence officials, the official said. But Pence went on television in mid-January and denied that Flynn had discussed sanctions. The Federal Bureau of Investigation interviewed Flynn in his early days as Trumps national security adviser regarding his conversations with the Russian ambassador, a White House official confirmed. Spicer stressed that the administration believed there was no legal problem with Flynns conversations with Kislyak, but rather an issue over the presidents trust in his adviser. The turning point, Spicer said, was a Washington Post story published on Thursday in which Flynn, through a spokesman, said for the first time he could not say with 100 percent certainty that he had not discussed sanctions with Kislyak. Spicer said the Justice Department sought to notify the White House counsel on Jan. 26 about the discrepancies in Flynns accounts.  The White House counsel informed the president immediately. The president asked them to commit a review of whether there was a legal situation there, Spicer told reporters, saying it was a trust issue. Flynns conversations with the ambassador took place around the time that then-President Barack Obama imposed sanctions on Russia, charging that Moscow had used cyber attacks to try to influence the 2016 presidential election in Trumps favor. A U.S. official familiar with the transcripts of the calls with the ambassador said Flynn indicated that if Russia did not retaliate in kind for Obamas Dec. 29 order expelling 35 Russian suspected spies and sanctioning Russian spy agencies, that  could smooth the way toward a broader discussion of improving U.S.-Russian relations once Trump took power.     Flynns discussions with the Russian diplomat could potentially have been in violation of a law known as the Logan Act, which bans private citizens from negotiating with foreign governments about disputes or controversies with the United States. There have been no modern prosecutions using the 1799 law. The Logan Act is a red herring. The better question is whether he made any false statements to the FBI at any point, which would be a much bigger deal, said University of Texas law professor Stephen Vladeck, adding the fallout would likely be political in nature. Flynn could also face legal trouble if it emerges that he violated other federal laws in his communications with the Russians, said Andrew Kent, a professor at Fordham University School of Law in New York. The Espionage Act criminalizes sharing information with foreign governments.        Democrats, who do not have control of Congress, clamored for probes into Flynn, and asked how much Trump knew about his connections to Russia. U.S. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called for an investigation of potential criminal violations surrounding the resignation of Flynn. What I am calling for is an independent investigation with executive authority to pursue potential criminal actions, Schumer told reporters, saying such a probe could not be led by newly installed U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions or White House lawyers. Two leading Senate Republicans, Bob Corker and John Cornyn, said the Intelligence Committee should investigate Flynns contacts with Russia.  But the highest-ranking Republican in Congress, House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, sidestepped questions about whether lawmakers should look into Flynns Russia ties, saying he would leave it to the Trump administration to explain the circumstances behind Flynns departure. A broader investigation of the White House and its ties to Russia is not possible without the cooperation either of the Justice Department or the Republican-led Congress.  Russias aggression in Ukraine and Syria and Republican congressional opposition to removing sanctions on Russia make any White House attempt to embrace Putin problematic. Senator John McCain, a leading Republican voice on foreign relations, said Flynns resignation raised questions about the administrations intentions toward Putins Russia.

Speaking a day before Trump holds a White House meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the official said peace was the ultimate goal.  Whether that comes in the form of a twostate solution if thats what the parties want, or something else, the official said, adding that Trump would not try to dictate a solution. Failure by a U.S. president to explicitly back a two-state solution would upend decades of U.S. policy embraced by Republican and Democratic administrations. It has long been the bedrock U.S. position for resolving the long-running Israeli-Palestinian conflict and has been at the core of international peace efforts. Any sign of a softening of U.S. support for eventual Palestinian statehood could also anger the Muslim world, including Sunni Arab allies, which the Trump administration needs in the fight against Islamic State and to back efforts against Shiite Iran. Trump considers Middle East peace a high priority, the White House official said. The president has given his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, the job of negotiating a peace deal. We would want to work on it very quickly, the official said. Trumps choice for U.S. ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, who has not yet been confirmed by the Senate, will not be involved in the presidents discussions with Netanyahu on Wednesday, the official said. Friedman advocates settlement building and has questioned the two-state solution.  The White House said earlier this month that Israels building of new settlements or expansion of existing ones in occupied territories may not be helpful in achieving peace.

Here are several of the tempests that have swirled around the new White House: Flynn quit on Monday after misleading the White House about his contacts with Russia before taking office and President Donald Trump lost trust in him, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said. U.S. lawmakers, including some leading Republicans, called for an investigation. NATIONAL SECURITY AT MAR-A-LAGO Private guests at Trumps Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida snapped photos of the president and visiting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe conferring and looking at documents while surrounded by aides following a weekend missile launch by North Korea. One guest posted to his Facebook page a picture with a man described to be the holder of the nuclear football, or weapons codes. The incidents prompted concerns about national security, and a Republican representative asked the White House for details. Trump issued an executive order on Jan. 27 temporarily banning U.S. entry by travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries and all refugees, citing the need to protect Americans. The ban triggered protests across the United States, confusion at U.S. and overseas airports and multiple legal challenges. A federal judge in Seattle on Feb. 3 suspended the ban in an order upheld by a federal appeals court in San Francisco. The Seattle judges order drew fire from Trump on Twitter, who criticized the jurist and the court system. The Republican presidents Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, said last week that the Twitter attacks were demoralizing and disheartening, according to a spokesman. Trump said Gorsuchs comments had been misrepresented. Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway urged Americans last week to buy his daughter Ivanka Trumps clothing and jewelry products during an appearance on a national television program after department store chain Nordstrom Inc said it was dropping them due to a decline in sales. Conways endorsement, which followed a Twitter attack by Trump on Nordstrom, prompted criticism from Democrats and Republicans. On Tuesday, the Office of Government Ethics said the White House should investigate whether Conway violated ethics rules. Trumps nominee to head the Labor Department, fast-food executive Andrew Puzder, admitted on Feb. 7 he employed an illegal immigrant as a house cleaner. Puzder, who already faced strong opposition from Senate Democrats and progressive groups because of his views on labor issues, said he and his wife had employed the housekeeper for a few years without knowing she was not legally permitted to work in the country. He said that when he learned of her status, he and his wife ended her employment and offered her help in getting legal status. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto scrapped plans to meet his counterpart in Washington during the second week of Trumps presidency after Trump tweeted that Mexico should cancel the meeting if it was not prepared to pay for his proposed border wall. Trump abruptly ended a phone call in late January with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, telling the leader of one of the United States closest allies that it was the worst call by far he had had with a foreign leader, according to the Washington Post. Trump said a deal between the United States and Australia on refugee resettlement was dumb and accused Turnbulls country of trying to export the next Boston bombers under the agreement, the Post said.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans lawmakers are starting to put in motion plans to destroy or defang the U.S. agency intended to protect individuals from financial fraud. On Tuesday, two Texas Republicans, Senator Ted Cruz and Representative John Ratcliffe, introduced a one-page bill to kill the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau entirely.  Their move comes a few days after Representative Jed Hensarling, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, outlined a plan to limit the independent agencys power and to crimp its funding via Congress budget process. The agency focuses on financial products such as mortgages and student loans. Next up: David Perdue, a Republican from Georgia on the Senate Banking Committee, will introduce a bill to make the CFPB more accountable to Congress by changing its funding mechanism, according to an aide. Unlike a complete elimination of the agency, which would require 60 votes, Perdues bill could be affixed to budget legislation that could become law with a 51-vote majority vote in the Senate. Senate Democrats, including Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts and Sherrod Brown, the senior Democrat on the Banking Committee, have vowed to block changes they say would weaken the CFPBs independence.  Killing the agency altogether would be a hard sell, and even some banking lobbyists have said they would be comfortable with a more restricted CFPB. The agency, which is also facing a court test, was created in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law. Its sole director, currently Richard Cordray, serves a fixed term and its budget flows through the Federal Reserve without being subject to congressional review. Republicans criticizing the CFPB say it overreaches its authority, pushes unnecessary regulation on small banks and uses large fines to direct lenders behavior without going through proper rule-making processes. Perdue has also struck at the agency more specifically, introducing a resolution to repeal a new CFPB regulation requiring prepaid cards to disclose their terms prominently. Hensarlings plan, which anti-CFPB lobbyists and congressional staffers are positing as a compromise, would push some CFPB powers to other agencies while making its budget subject to congressional review and its director a political appointee. Others want to see the agency become a five-member bipartisan commission. President Donald Trump, also a Republican, was elected partly on promises to lighten regulation and is expected to sign any CFPB-related legislation that reaches his desk.

The letter, dated Monday and addressed to a White House ethics official, asked President Donald Trumps administration to investigate the incident and gave it two weeks to provide its findings and detail any disciplinary steps taken. Conway, Trumps presidential campaign manager and now a senior counselor, said on Fox News last week that Americans should go buy Ivankas stuff. She spoke after retailer Nordstrom announced it was dropping the branded line of Ivanka Trump, the presidents older daughter. Federal ethics rules prohibit executive branch employees from using their positions to endorse products.     There is strong reason to believe that Ms. Conway has violated the Standards of Conduct and that disciplinary action is warranted, Office of Government Ethics Director Walter Shaub wrote in the letter.  Stefan Passantino, the White House ethics official named in the letter, declined to comment. A White House spokesman did not reply to a request for comment.  The ethics office has little enforcement power. It can formally recommend disciplinary action if the White House does not act, Shaub said in a separate letter to two U.S. lawmakers who sought a review of Conways remarks. That recommendation would not be binding, and the process would take until late April or early May, Shaub said. If the ethics office does formally recommend discipline, it would be up to the White House to decide any steps against Conway.  Norman Eisen, who was ethics chief under President Barack Obama, said Congress also could call hearings or subpoena documents if the White House did not act. Trump himself earlier attacked Nordstrom for dropping his daughters brand. The ethics rules that bar endorsements do not apply to the president, though critics said his comments were inappropriate. Nordstrom said it made the decision because sales had steadily declined, especially in the last half of 2016, to where carrying the line didnt make good business sense. In his letter to the White House, Shaub wrote that his offices regulatory guidelines include an example violation in which a hypothetical presidential appointee promotes a product in a television commercial. He said Conways remarks closely mirrored that example of what not to do. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said on Thursday that Conway had been counseled, but Shaub wrote that the Office of Government Ethics had not been informed of any corrective steps.

In the District of Columbia, where just 4 percent of the population voted for President Donald Trump, city leaders worry that Republicans will overturn progressive laws on issues like gun control and abortion, to the outrage of locals who have long complained of curtailed rights. One of the most liberal U.S. cities, Washington is unique in that the U.S. Constitution gives Congress the option to block its legislative moves. Its 680,000 residents pay federal income taxes but have no voting representative in Congress. This is yet another attempt by this House committee to trample the autonomy of the D.C. Government and undermine our local control, Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser, who signed the assisted suicide law in December, said in a statement after the signing. Mondays vote by the House Oversight Committee, headed by Utah Representative Jason Chaffetz, took the first step in overturning the measure letting doctors help terminally ill patients end their lives. The full House and Senate would now have to vote and Trump would have to sign a repeal by Friday, the 30-day deadline for Congress to act. Congressman Jason Chaffetz has sent a signal to D.C. residents that Congress has zero respect or concern for their will or the will of their elected officials, Bowser said.  Bowser called the vote a power grab by legislators who espouse states right to make their own laws but differ when the heavily Democratic city is involved. The vote was the first in a series of Republican-sponsored measures taking on city laws. U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida last month introduced legislation that would bar city lawmakers from passing gun control laws and repeal local firearm registration requirements. Rubio said the measure, aimed at Washington, was needed to protect residents constitutional right to bear arms. The House also has approved a bill that would permanently ban the District from using local tax funds for abortions for poor women. Congress granted the 68-square-mile (117-square-km) enclave a mayor and council in the 1970s and has voided only a handful of District laws since then. But Chaffetz has pledged to intensify scrutiny, saying at Mondays hearing that the assisted suicide law could create a marketplace for death. Washingtons city council has passed laws in recent years on issues dear to liberal Democrats nationally. These include a $15-an-hour minimum wage, legalized recreational marijuana and one of the countrys most generous family leave laws. The District is a progressive jurisdiction in the midst of a conservative Congress, Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, the Districts congressional representative, said in a phone interview. Washington leaders have relied on the Senate, which has long had less appetite than the House to interfere with District laws. The city also had an ally in Democratic President Barack Obama. That protection is gone, Norton said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The most consequential legal challenge to U.S. President Donald Trumps travel ban will proceed on two tracks in the next few days: in a U.S. appeals court vote in San Francisco and the Seattle courtroom of a federal judge. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will vote on whether to reconsider an appeal in the case that was decided in the Seattle court last week. That vote could reveal which judges disagree with their colleagues on the bench and support the arguments behind the new presidents most controversial executive order. In Seattle, the state of Washington will attempt to probe Trumps motive in drafting the Jan. 27 order. In another case, in Virginia, a federal judge on late Monday halted enforcement of portions of the order against Virginia visa holders or permanent residents, concluding that the travel ban likely violates the U.S. Constitutions protections for freedom of religion.  The rulings put the order on hold until the courts can rule on the underlying merits. Ultimately, they will have to address questions about the extent of the presidents power on matters of immigration and national security. Traditionally, judges have been extremely cautious about stepping on the executive branchs authority in such matters, legal experts say. Trumps directive, which he said was necessary to protect the United States from attacks by Islamist militants, barred people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the country for 90 days. Refugees were banned for 120 days, except those from Syria, who were banned indefinitely. The ban was backed by around half of Americans, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll, but triggered protests across the country and caused chaos at some U.S. and overseas airports.  U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle suspended the order nationwide after Washington state challenged its legality, eliciting a barrage of angry Twitter messages from Trump against the judge and the court system. A three-judge panel at the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco upheld the ruling last week, raising questions about Trumps next step. In the Virginia case, U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema said there was a lack of evidence showing a national security purpose for the executive order and issued a preliminary injunction against parts of it.  While the ruling is not on the underlying merits of the case, Brinkema noted, The Muslim ban was a centerpiece of the presidents campaign for months.  Legal experts said no other judge has so fully considered the question of whether the order amounted to a discriminatory ban on Muslims. According to Brinkema, the evidence indicates the governments purpose was based on religion, said Nelson Tebbe, a professor at Brooklyn Law School, adding that the ruling could influence other judges views on the matter. At a Seattle court hearing on Monday, Robart said he would move forward with discovery in the case, meaning the request and exchange of information pertinent to the case between the opposing parties.  Meanwhile, an unidentified judge on the 9th Circuit last week requested that the courts 25 full-time judges vote on whether the temporary restraining order Robart imposed on Trumps travel ban should be reconsidered by an 11-judge panel, known as en banc review. The 9th Circuit asked both sides to file briefs by Thursday. Since judges appointed by Democrats hold an 18-7 edge on the 9th Circuit, legal experts say it is unlikely a majority will disagree with the courts earlier ruling and want it reconsidered.  Arthur Hellman, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law who has studied the 9th Circuit, noted that one of the three judges who issued the original ruling was appointed by President George W. Bush.  Even if the en banc vote fails, however, judges on the 9th Circuit who disagree with last weeks ruling will be able to publicly express their disagreement in court filings, which could help create a record bolstering Trumps position. Meanwhile, the government has signaled that it is considering issuing a new executive order to replace the original one. In that case, it could tell the 9th Circuit later this week that it does not want en banc review, because the case would be moot. You would think Jeff Sessions would do whatever he had to do to get this case ended as soon as possible, Hellman said, referring to the recently appointed U.S. attorney general.

Theres a lot of mending of fences that has to happen between the Netanyahu government and a lot of Democrats who feel like he unnecessarily politicized the U.S.-Israeli relationship, Democratic Senator Chris Murphy, a Senate Foreign Relations Committee member, said in a telephone interview.     The low point came in March 2015 when Netanyahu sidestepped the White House and State Department to arrange a speech to the Republican-led Congress opposing the international nuclear deal with Iran then being negotiated by President Barack Obama. Led by the Congressional Black Caucus, more than 55 Democratic members of the Senate and House of Representatives skipped the speech to protest what they viewed as an attack on Obama, the first African-American U.S. president. Tensions between Netanyahu and congressional Democrats have remained despite nearly seven decades of bipartisan support for Israel in Congress, which has used its spending authority to make Israel the largest recipient of annual U.S. military aid. After Trump took office last month, Netanyahu tweeted his applause for Trumps plan to build a wall to keep out people from Mexico, which Democrats consider an expensive and racially tinged insult to a U.S. neighbor and ally. Many Democrats also are wary of Netanyahus support for building new settlements on land claimed by the Palestinians, and worry about statements from some in his government opposing the possibility of a Palestinian state. Democrats faulted congressional Republicans for using Israel as a wedge issue, despite strong Democratic support for initiatives such as a $38 billion military aid package the Obama administration signed in September. It doesnt look good or feel right when one party says, Well, were better on Israel than the other party, or if one party is trying to work in lock-step with Israeli officials, Representative Eliot Engel, the top House Foreign Affairs Committee Democrat, told Reuters. Israeli officials said Netanyahus aides have been aware of the need to re-establish a semblance of bipartisan even-handedness, even as the prime minister works to create a personal bond with Trump. Aides traveling with Netanyahu did not respond to requests for comment on Tuesday. But as he left for Washington, Netanyahu made a point of saying he would meet with congressional leaders from both parties, signaling something of a rebalancing.

Speaking to reporters in the U.S. Capitol, Schumer said law enforcement officers should question officials from President Donald Trumps campaign, transition team and administration staff, including Trump himself, about events leading up to Flynns departure on Monday. He said Flynn, and potentially other Trump officials, could have violated federal prohibitions against citizens negotiating with foreign governments or receiving gifts and other benefits without authorization. What I am calling for is an independent investigation with executive authority to pursue potential criminal actions, Schumer said. There are potential violations of law here by General Flynn and potentially others. Flynn quit after only three weeks in the job, following disclosures that he discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia with Moscows ambassador to the United States before Trump took office and later misled Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations. Schumer appeared unlikely to win support for such a probe from his Senate Republican colleagues, who expect the scandal to be investigated by the Senate Intelligence Committee.  The Intelligence Committee is already looking at Russian involvement in our election ... its highly likely theyd want to take a look at this episode. They have the jurisdiction to do it, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell told reporters separately. Schumer welcomed any involvement by the Senate committee but said the panel lacked the prosecutorial powers needed to hold potential wrongdoers fully accountable.  He also said that U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions should recuse himself from any probe of Flynns resignation because of his political ties to Trump. Schumer said career Justice Department investigators or an independent counsel could look into whether other Trump team members had contact with Russia and why the White House did not seek Flynns resignation sooner.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russias parliament applauded on learning that Donald Trump had won the U.S. election. But prospects for better relations with Washington have suffered setbacks since then and the resignation of Trumps national security adviser is the biggest blow yet. The Kremlin still believes a rapprochement is feasible, even if it might take longer than initially thought. But the clock is ticking: Vladimir Putin is expected to run for another presidential term next year, and an easing in Western sanctions could speed Russias recovery from a recession and safeguard his national popularity. For now, Russia plans to keep working with the Trump administration towards a rapprochement, looking to improve the atmosphere. With relations having sunk to a post-Cold War nadir under Trumps predecessor Barack Obama as a result of Moscows 2014 annexation of Crimea, they could hardly get worse. A first meeting between Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, expected in Germany later this week, will give the Kremlin a chance to grasp what Washington is now thinking and where this may lead. The resignation of national security adviser Michael Flynn, who was seen in Moscow as a leading advocate of warmer ties with Russia, has underscored for the Kremlin the difficulties of reaching a settlement with Washington and drove home the urgent need to find new areas of common interest.  Flynn, who shared dinner with Putin in 2015 and favoured Washington uniting with Russia against Islamic State militants, quit on Monday after revelations he had improperly discussed the issue of U.S. sanctions on Russia with the Russian ambassador to Washington before Trump took office. A U.S. official said Flynn indicated to the envoy that the sanctions would not necessarily carry over to an administration seeking to improve relations between the U.S. and Russia.  Flynn, unlike many other high-ranking Americans, was at least open to dialogue, said Konstantin Kosachev, head of the upper house of parliaments foreign affairs committee. Either Trump has not gained the requisite independence and  is being gradually (and not unsuccessfully) backed into a corner, or Russophobia has already infected the new administration. Other Russian politicians suggested Flynn had been forced to resign to harm relations with Moscow. But the Kremlin, anxious not to feed fears of Russian media manipulation to influence U.S. politics, said only that it was an internal U.S. matter.  Trump came to power talking of wanting cooperative U.S.-Russian relations, for example to take joint action against Islamic State militants. So far, theres been scant improvement.  Trump spoke by phone to Putin on Jan. 28, but Reuters learnt that the call had not gone smoothly: Trump used it to denounce a treaty that caps U.S. and Russian deployment of nuclear warheads as a bad deal for the United States. The Kremlin is also struggling to set up a meeting. Dmitry Peskov, Putins spokesman, said on Tuesday he could not say when or where the Russian leader would meet Trump and that it was premature to even talk about what direction U.S.-Russian relations might take. A series of U.S. Senate confirmation hearings for Trumps cabinet nominees did not go the Kremlins way either, with the incoming defense secretary and secretary of state both raising concerns about the dangers of Russia as an unpredictable military player.  Russian officials are frustrated too that Trump has not yet filled key senior staff positions at the State Department, leaving Russian diplomats feeling they have nobody to work with.    To have cooperation, you need someone to promote it from the other end, Maria Zakharova, spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, testily told a news briefing last week. Moscow seems to have been taken aback by the strength of Congressional opposition to Trump overseeing a rapprochement with Russia, a factor that would make it hard for him to ease sanctions even if he wanted to. In a further reverse for the Kremlin, senior U.S. senators have introduced legislation that would give Congress the right to review any move to relax sanctions on Russia. Sergei Kislyak, Russias ambassador to the United States, told state television last week Moscow was aware of how difficult the domestic U.S. scene was becoming for Russia.    Does the lack of political consensus inside the U.S. create problems for our bilateral relations? Kislyak asked rhetorically. That is an objective reality. There were muted expectations in Moscow that Trump might move fast to reverse Obamas expulsion in December of 35 suspected Russian spies over allegations of Russian-backed cyber attacks on U.S. election campaign groups to help Trump win. Obama shut down two Russian compounds at the same time that he said were used by Russian personnel for intelligence-related purposes. Back then, Trump praised Putin for refraining from retaliation, calling him very smart. But Trump has given no indication since that he will roll back any of the measures. One of the biggest setbacks for Moscow followed a flare-up in fighting in eastern Ukraine where government forces are facing off against pro-Russian separatist forces.  Before the escalation in January, which both sides blame on each other, the Trump administration gave the impression it was open to looking at reviewing sanctions on Russia. Afterwards, Nikki Haley, the new U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, blamed Russia for the fighting and said Ukraine-related sanctions would not be lifted until Moscow returned Crimea to Ukraine, something Russia says it will never do. Flynns resignation may hurt more, though. Flynn was the main lobbyist for the big deal with Putin project, said Russian opposition activist Ilya Yashin.   There was nobody in Trumps entourage who so persistently lobbied to cancel the sanctions as Flynn. Today is a black day for Kremlin diplomacy and for Putin personally.

A day after the Republican chairman of the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee dismissed the idea, the panels Democrats proposed an amendment demanding that the committee ask the Treasury Department for copies of Trumps returns by March 1. Unless this amendment is adopted, we will never see the presidents tax returns while hes in office, Representative Sander Levin, a Michigan Democrat, told committee Chairman Kevin Brady at a public hearing.  Before you stonewall this, I urge you to think twice, Levin added. Youll only keep the issue... alive. Brady strongly rejected the request as an abuse of the committees authority. Minutes later, committee rejected the amendment along party lines in a 23-15 vote. The vote represents only the latest skirmish between Republicans and Democrats in Congress over whether lawmakers should review Trumps tax returns, which critics say would help determine whether the presidents sprawling business empire poses any conflicts of interest. House Democratic aides say the political battle will continue. The resignation of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn on Monday intensified Democratic interest in the documents, with one lawmaker warning about the potential danger of blackmail.   Representative Bill Pascrell, a New Jersey Democrat, issued the first request for Trumps returns in a Feb. 1 letter that Brady rejected on Monday. Experts say federal law authorizes the House Ways and Means Committee, the Senate Finance Committee and the Joint Committee on Taxation to examine individual tax returns. The two other panels are headed by Senator Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican who dismissed the idea of seeking Trumps returns last week. House Republicans contend that the authority to examine tax returns was meant to ensure the proper administration of the tax code.

Flynns departure was a sobering development in Trumps young presidency, a 24-day period during which his White House has been repeatedly distracted by miscues and internal dramas. The departure could slow Trumps bid to warm up relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Flynn submitted his resignation hours after Trump, through a spokesman, pointedly declined to publicly back Flynn, saying he was reviewing the situation and talking to Pence. Flynn had promised Pence he had not discussed U.S. sanctions with the Russians, but transcripts of intercepted communications, described by U.S. officials, showed that the subject had come up in conversations between him and the Russian ambassador. Such contacts could potentially be in violation of a law banning private citizens from engaging in foreign policy, known as the Logan Act. Pence had defended Flynn in television interviews and was described by administration officials as upset about being misled. Unfortunately, because of the fast pace of events, I inadvertently briefed the vice president-elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian ambassador. I have sincerely apologized to the president and the vice president, and they have accepted my apology, Flynn said in his resignation letter. Retired General Keith Kellogg, who has been chief of staff of the White House National Security Council, was named the acting national security adviser while Trump determines who should fill the position. Kellogg, retired General David Petraeus, a former CIA director, and Robert Harward, a former deputy commander of U.S. Central Command, are under consideration for the position, a White House official said. Harward was described by officials as the leading candidate. A U.S. official confirmed a Washington Post report that Sally Yates, the then-acting U.S. attorney general, told the White House late last month that she believed Flynn had misled them about the nature of his communications with the Russian ambassador. She said Flynn might have put himself in a compromising position, possibly leaving himself vulnerable to blackmail, the official said. Yates was later fired for opposing Trumps temporary entry ban for people from seven mostly Muslim nations. A U.S. official, describing the intercepted communications, said Flynn did not make any promises about lifting the sanctions. But he did indicate that sanctions imposed by President Barack Obama on Russia for its Ukraine incursion would not necessarily carry over to an administration seeking to improve relations between the U.S. and Russia, the official said. Flynn, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant general, was an early supporter of Trump and shares his interest in shaking up the establishment in Washington. He frequently raised eyebrows among Washingtons foreign policy establishment for trying to persuade Trump to warm up U.S. relations with Russia.   A U.S. official said Flynns departure, coupled with Russias aggression in Ukraine and Syria and Republican congressional opposition to removing sanctions on Russia, removes Trumps most ardent advocate of taking a softer line toward Putin. Flynns leaving may make a significant course change less likely, at least any time soon, the official said. Another official said Flynns departure may strengthen the hands of some cabinet secretaries, including Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. However, the second official said, Flynns exit could also reinforce the power of presidential aides Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller, whom he described as already having the presidents ear. Congressional Democrats expressed alarm at the developments  surrounding Flynn and called for a classified briefing by administration officials to explain what had happened. We are communicating this request to the Department of Justice and FBI this evening, said Democratic representatives John Conyers of Michigan and Elijah Cummings of Maryland. U.S. Representative Adam Schiff of California, ranking Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said Flynns departure does not end the questions over his contacts with the Russians. The Trump administration has yet to be forthcoming about who was aware of Flynns conversations with the ambassador and whether he was acting on the instructions of the president or any other officials, or with their knowledge, Schiff said. The committees chairman, Republican Devin Nunes, thanked Flynn for his service. Washington D.C. can be a rough town for honorable people, and Flynn  who has always been a soldier, not a politician deserves Americas gratitude and respect, he said.

The U.S. Senate voted to confirm Mnuchin 53-47, with all but one Democrat opposing him over his handling of thousands of foreclosures as head of OneWest Bank after the 2007-2009 housing collapse. At a White House swearing-in ceremony, Trump said Mnuchin would be a great champion for U.S. citizens. He will fight for middle-class tax reductions, financial reforms that open up lending and create millions of new jobs, and fiercely defend the American tax dollar and your financial security, Trump said. And he will also defend our manufacturing jobs from those who cheat and steal and rob us blind. Lawmakers, lobbyists and business groups have been nervously waiting for Mnuchin to take office and fill in the many blanks on how he will pursue tax reform and handle delicate economic cooperation efforts with China, Mexico and other trading partners worried that Trumps America First strategy will upend decades-old trade rules and currency practices. Mnuchin, 54, provided no details of his plans as he was sworn in. I am committed to using the full powers of this office to create more jobs, to combat terrorist activities and financing, and to make America great again, Mnuchin said.     Trump has pledged to roll back the stricter financial regulation under the Dodd-Frank reform law enacted after the financial crisis, pursue tougher trade policies on China and Mexico to reduce U.S. trade deficits, and reduce business tax rates. Mnuchin faces immediate challenges with the March 15 expiration of a U.S. debt ceiling suspension, ushering in the threat of a new default showdown, and a March 17 meeting of finance ministers from the Group of 20 major economies, where he will face tough questions about Trumps plans to increase trade protections. In April, Mnuchin will have to determine whether to declare China a currency manipulator as part of Treasurys semi-annual currency report. There is a real open question as to whether this administration is going to cut itself off from international monetary cooperation, whether its exchange rate policies or attitudes towards multilateral institutions or international regulatory policy, said Edwin Truman, a former Treasury and Federal Reserve official now with the Peterson Institute for International Economics Among Mnuchins biggest jobs is managing a sprawling congressional tax reform effort that seeks to slash business tax rates and enact a new border tax adjustment system aimed at boosting U.S. exports. Mnuchin will quickly need to build a core management team to handle such challenges. Treasury and White House representatives did not respond to requests for comment on Monday on reports that Trump would soon nominate David Malpass, a former economist at failed Wall Street bank Bear Stearns, as Treasury undersecretary for international affairs, the agencys top economic diplomacy job. Malpass, a Trump campaign adviser who had been leading Treasury transition efforts, was seen as a leading candidate for the job, with experience from international economic posts in the Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations. Other names that have been floated for senior posts include Goldman Sachs banker Jim Donovan for deputy Treasury secretary and Justin Muzinich, a former Morgan Stanley banker, for undersecretary of domestic finance. Mnuchin, a second-generation Goldman Sachs banker who led the firms mortgage bond trading but left the bank in 2002, came under fire from Democrats over his investor groups 2009 acquisition of another failed lender, IndyMac Bank, from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. The bank, rebranded as OneWest, subsequently foreclosed on more than 36,000 homeowners, drawing charges from housing advocates that it was a foreclosure machine. Mnuchin grew OneWest into Southern Californias largest lender and sold it for $3.4 billion in 2015. He has also helped finance Hollywood blockbusters such as Avatar, American Sniper and this past weekends box office champion, The Lego Batman Movie, which took in $55.6 million. The Senate on Monday also unanimously confirmed David Shulkin as secretary of veterans affairs, putting the only holdover from the Obama administration in charge of the second largest federal agency.

The details of President Donald Trumps economic policies remain largely unknown. He has announced a rollback of financial regulation with few details and there is no clarity on the size, scope and timing of the tax cuts he has promised.   Possible new taxes on imports and increased infrastructure spending could boost inflation and send the dollar soaring, uncertainties that make it unusually difficult for the Fed to chart a course for interest rate policy. There is quite significant uncertainty about whats actually going to happen, I dont think anyone quite knows, Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer said on Saturday. Even at the best of times, the Feds ability to see shifts in the economy is limited. In 2012 it said that interest rates would start to rise in 2014 but policymakers waited until December 2015 for their first rate hike. A forecast of four interest rate rises in 2016 turned out to be one. Yellen is due to give semi-annual testimony before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday at 10 a.m. EST. She will address the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday.  The American economy is now, by many estimates, around what the Fed considers to be full employment, inflation has ticked up to 1.6 percent and the economy grew 1.6 percent last year.  Based on the Feds economic projections for this year, it could raise interest rates three times in 25 basis-point steps. Little was changed in the central banks Feb. 1 policy statement, a reflection of how little insight Fed officials have into Trumps policies. There are just a lot of ways this could go wrong, like spinning off toward a trade war, said Jon Faust, a Johns Hopkins University economics professor and former special adviser to the Feds Board of Governors.  Some Trump advisers, including National Trade Council Director Peter Navarro, have criticized the trade policies of China and Germany, fueling concerns Washington might disrupt global commerce. At the same time, the new presidents Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, has stressed Washington will continue to participate in global economic forums. On Tuesday, Yellen will likely face renewed pressure from lawmakers to set rate policy with a publicly disclosed mathematical formula. The head of the financial services committee in the House of Representatives has said he will resubmit a proposal to make the Fed adopt a policy rule. Yellen has publicly opposed the proposal, saying it would damage the Feds ability to respond to crises, but it could win traction in the central bank as Trump has a raft of appointments to make. Trump can name members to the central banks Washington-based Board of Governors. There are currently two empty seats on the seven-member body, and Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo said on Friday he would resign around early April.  The president may also appoint a new chair as Yellens 4-year term as chair comes up in January 2018, while Fischers term as vice chairman ends in June of that year.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""NEW YORK (Reuters) - As century-old Wall Street brokerages have agonized over the fate of a major U.S. regulation on retirement advice, younger Silicon Valley counterparts have coolly shrugged their shoulders.     At issue is when and how the federal government will implement the so-called fiduciary rule handed down by the U.S. Labor Department last year. The rule, which aims to protect retirees by eliminating conflicts of interest for the brokers paid to advise them, was set to go into effect in April, but is being challenged by the Trump administration.   The rule is now on track to be delayed by 180 days  creating a great deal of uncertainty about its future.    Big wealth managers and insurers most affected by the rule have welcomed signs that the new White House may roll it back. They have fought hard against the rule in court and on Capitol Hill, arguing that it would raise compliance and technology costs, while restricting brokers ability to charge commissions and sell certain high-fee products.  Critics have said the additional costs would force brokerages to dump less well-heeled clients in favor of wealthier ones. Startups offering digital wealth management services have taken the opposite tack, saying the rule would benefit retirees and their own businesses. Investors abandoned by big firms might move to digital providers, which offer transparent, lower-cost alternatives, the thinking goes.     In interviews since Trump instructed the Labor Department to review the rule earlier this month, executives at robo-advisers, which manage investor money with algorithms, brushed off the impact of the rule on their business.  Although the rule might have sped up a broader shift of investor money to robo-advisers, the trend had been gathering momentum anyway, they said.     An expansion of the fiduciary rule would be nice for our business, but in no way affects our ultimate success, said Andy Rachleff, chief executive officer of Wealthfront, one of the largest robo-advisers that deals directly with investors.     Wealthfront competitor Betterment has encouraged Democrats in recent weeks to fight efforts to delay or gut the rule. Nonetheless, Betterments Associate General Counsel Seth Rosenbloom said any regulatory changes would have little impact on the companys growth.     We are sad that it looks like ... the rule might go away, be delayed or watered down, Rosenbloom said. But we are optimistic that the attention around the issue will make for better informed investors in the long run. Among robo-advisers that provide services to brokerages, Mike Sha, co-founder and chief executive of robo-adviser SigFig, said he did not expect the rules delay to impact its business or partnerships at all. Wealth units of Wells Fargo & Co and UBS Group AG use SigFigs technology and offer its online investing tools to their clients.     Robo-advisers represent a small piece of the wealth management industry, overseeing roughly $200 billion of client assets in 2016, according to consulting firm A.T. Kearney. It expects the total to surge to $2.2 trillion by 2020.     Interrupting the fiduciary rule could slow that growth for some companies. Last week, for instance, LPL Financial Holdings, said if the rule was delayed, it might move more slowly in rolling out some compliance plans, which include its robo-adviser and other new technology.     But the shift to less expensive digital options began before the rule was formalized, driven primarily by customer demand for more digital options. That trend is unlikely to be stopped with or without the rule, analysts said.     By all projections, there is unbelievable demand for digital advice and solutions, said Kendra Thompson, a managing director in the financial services group at the consultancy Accenture. The rule is an accelerator for digital, not an originator, she said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Defying decades of precedent, Trump has refused to release his tax documents, which Democrats say could show whether his business empire poses any conflicts of interest as he moves forward on issues ranging from tax reform to foreign relations.  If Congress begins to use its powers to rummage around in the tax returns of the president, what prevents Congress from doing the same to average Americans? House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady told reporters. Privacy and civil liberties are still important rights in this country, and (the) Ways and Means Committee is not going to start to weaken them. The Texas Republican was responding to questions about a Feb. 1 letter from Representative Bill Pascrell, a Ways and Means Democrat who asked Brady to obtain Republican Trumps returns from the U.S. Treasury so the committee could review them in closed session and vote on whether to make them public. Pascrell later said he continued to hope for action, saying: Our committee must respond by using its legal authority as Congress has in the past to provide proper oversight. This is Checks and Balances 101. Experts say federal law authorizes the House Ways and Means Committee, the Senate Finance Committee and the Joint Committee on Taxation to examine individual tax returns. The two other panels are headed by Senator Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican who dismissed the idea of seeking Trumps returns last week. House Republicans contend that the authority to examine tax returns was meant to ensure the proper administration of the tax code. Brady said his panel was doing just that in 2014, when it released confidential tax data during a probe of IRS treatment of conservative group applications for nonprofit status. Pascrells letter said Trumps business empire involves state-owned enterprises in China and the United Arab Emirates, Russia and Saudi Arabia. It is imperative for the public to know and understand his...financial positions in domestic and foreign companies, Pascrell wrote.  Brady said the letter misrepresented the laws intent to promote confidentiality and privacy. Ive read his letter and I disagree with all of it, he said.

After hearing arguments from more than a dozen lawmakers, the committee voted 22 to 14 against the law. Overturning a D.C. law requires passage by both the House and Senate and signature by the president. It has happened only a handful of times since the city gained self-governance.  Chaffetz said the current law has serious flaws and voiced concerns over doctors inaccurately diagnosing patients with terminal illnesses. Other Republican committee members said they opposed physician-assisted suicide for religious reasons.  Gerry Connolly, a Virginia Democrat who voted in support of the districts so-called Death with Dignity Act, told opponents: Do the right thing and mind your own business.

We are asking you to agree with American doctrine that local laws are for local residents, Norton said. The city council has passed a range of laws in recent years on issues important to many liberal Democrats nationally. Among them are a $15-an-hour minimum wage, legalized recreational marijuana and one of the countrys most generous family leave laws.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Four U.S. Republican senators have not yet said whether they will support labor secretary nominee Andrew Puzder, raising suspense about whether he will survive an initial confirmation hearing this week. The four senators - Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Tim Scott of South Carolina and Johnny Isakson of Georgia - all sit on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, which will on Thursday hold the first confirmation hearing for Puzder, President Donald Trumps pick to head the Labor Department. Puzder, the CEO of CKE Restaurants, which franchises restaurants, including Carls Jr. and Hardees, has faced staunch opposition from Democrats and protests from union-backed groups about policies at CKEs food chains. Along with now-confirmed Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, he has been one of Trumps most controversial Cabinet picks. Through statements and spokespeople on Monday, the four Republican senators indicated they have some outstanding questions for Puzder but stressed they had not made a final decision. They would not say whether they had specific concerns.      If a committee majority backs Puzders nomination, he will come up for a vote before the full, Republican-controlled Senate, where his confirmation could only be derailed if at least three Republicans break with their party. Puzders committee hearing has been postponed several times amid delays with his ethics paperwork.  Fast food worker advocates say they are concerned about his prior criticism of an overtime rule proposed by the Obama administration and his opposition to raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour from the current $7.25 rate. Puzders nomination has sparked protests by workers who allege CKE has stolen their wages and violated other labor laws at Hardees and Carls Jr. locations around the country. Puzder has also come under fire for racy restaurant ads featuring bikini-clad women eating burgers, and for his admission to previously hiring an undocumented worker. In addition, a non-profit group plans to ask a Missouri court on Tuesday to unseal Puzders divorce records, after the news media reported on old court records in which Puzders ex-wife accused him of physical abuse. Puzder has denied those allegations, and his ex-wife has since retracted them. Senate Democrats, led by Minority Leader Charles Schumer, are expected to vigorously oppose Puzders nomination, and Schumer has repeatedly called on Puzder to withdraw his name from consideration. But the 48 senators who caucus with the Democrats can only defeat him if they are able to convince three Republicans. Last week, both Collins and Murkowski joined with Democrats to oppose DeVos nomination, but Vice President Mike Pence was called in to break the tie and she was confirmed. Ive had two conversations with Mr. Puzder. I think there are outstanding questions that Im sure will be delved into at his hearing, Collins said in a statement. A spokeswoman for Murkowski said the senator wants to know more about Puzder, while a spokesman for Isakson said he is taking all the facts under consideration before making his decision.  A spokeswoman for Scott said he has consistently declined to comment on all nominees in advance of their hearing. Puzder, meanwhile, has no plans to withdraw his name from consideration, according to his spokesman George Thompson. Andy is so looking forward to his hearing. He will finally have an opportunity to express his commitment to workers and to businesses and to ensure that folks know his true record for protecting workers and creating jobs, Thompson said.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""NEW YORK (Reuters) - Washington states attorney general has promised to uncover what truly motivated President Donald Trumps executive order on immigration, an approach that could prompt a rare public examination of how a U.S. president makes national security decisions.  The presidential order imposed a temporary ban on travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries, but a federal judge has barred enforcement of the order while the court considers a challenge brought by Washington state.  On Thursday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit left the judges ruling in place without deciding the ultimate merits of either sides arguments. In its decision, the 9th Circuit cited a previous case establishing that circumstantial evidence of intent, including  statements by decisionmakers, may be considered in evaluating whether a governmental action was motivated by a discriminatory purpose.  The Trump administration has argued that the ban is necessary to prevent potential terrorists from entering the country and is not discriminatory because the text of the order does not mention any particular religion.  Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson signaled on Sunday that he will move aggressively to obtain written documents and emails authored by administration officials that might contain evidence the order was unconstitutionally biased against Muslims or Islam. He also said he would also move to depose administration officials. Legal scholars say this could move the court into uncharted waters.  The idea of looking at motive has never really been applied to the president, said John Yoo, a former Justice Department lawyer in the George W. Bush administration.  It would represent a serious expansion of judicial oversight of what the president and the entire executive branch does, said Yoo, now a professor at the University of California at Berkeley School of Law.  Trump has harshly criticized the federal judge in Washington for his decision and a top White House aide on Sunday accused the 9th Circuit of a judicial usurpation of power.  The presidents powers here are beyond question, senior policy adviser Stephen Miller told Fox News Sunday. U.S. courts have historically been careful about probing the motives behind laws, in part out of respect for the separation of powers between branches of government. But on questions of racial or religious discrimination, they have sometimes allowed intent to be examined.  In 1993, for instance, the Supreme Court found that an ordinance banning animal sacrifice in Hialeah, Florida, though neutral on its face, was actually intended to discriminate against a Santeria church, which holds sacrifice as a sacred rite. Stephen Griffin, a professor of constitutional law at Tulane University, said cases like this make it clear that the court can look beyond the words of Trumps executive order. Motive is relevant, he said.  One question in the current case is likely to be which, if any, of Trumps statements should be admissible in examining the administrations motives in issuing the order.  If youre allowed to use evidence from the campaign, the states case is very strong, said  Griffin. In December, 2015, days after a mass attackby an Islamic State sympathizers in San Bernardino, California,Trump called for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our representatives can figure out what is going on. He later said he supported only suspending immigration from areas with a history of terrorism. Stanford University Law School professor Michael McConnell, a former federal appeals judge, said the court should not consider campaign statements, because Trump only swore an oath to uphold the Constitution after he became president.  In its complaint, Washington cited an interview the president did on the day the order was signed with the Christian Broadcasting Network, saying he would prioritize Christians in the Middle East for admission as refugees.  Legal experts are divided on whether the states lawyers should be allowed to question the presidents advisers  and possibly even the president  in depositions. The White House could potentially claim executive privilege, which protects the president and other officials from subpoena, said Thomas Lee, an expert in constitutional law at Fordham University.  Anna-Rose Mathieson a partner with the California Appellate Law Group said that one person who might be more easily deposed would be presidential adviser and former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who told Fox News the president had asked him to put a commission together to figure out how to make a Muslim ban legal. David Pressman, a partner at Boies Schiller Flexner and former assistant secretary of Homeland Security in the Obama administration, said there are important protections in place so that the executive branch can receive national security advice. You dont want a situation in which courts are adjudicating intelligence that is coming to the executive when trying to formulate policy, said Pressman.Though in this case, Pressman said he did not believe the national security argument for the order was clear, opening the door to further questioning. The next steps in the case are not certain.  The Trump administration has said it is considering appealing the 9th Circuit ruling to the Supreme Court, and the 9th Circuit itself might decide to rehear the case with a larger panel of judges. The president has also said he might replace the order with a brand new one, which could end the current legal action. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Trump has pledged to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement(NAFTA) linking the economies of the United States, Mexico and Canada to make the terms more favorable to Americans. At a joint news conference with Trudeau after White House talks, Trump said his biggest concern with NAFTA was the U.S. trade relationship with Mexico, which he has frequently accused of stealing American jobs. We have a very outstanding trade relationship with Canada. Well be tweaking it, Trump said. Its a much less severe situation than whats taking place on the southern border. On the southern border, for many, many years the transaction was not fair to the United States, he said. Trump said the United States and Canada were stronger when they joined forces in matters of international commerce, and both countries benefited from having more jobs and trade in North America. We should coordinate closely - and we will coordinate closely - to protect jobs in our hemisphere and keep wealth on our continent, and to keep everyone safe, Trump said. Trudeau carefully steered around questions about the Canadian trade relationship with the United States in what was his first meeting with the new president. He said he expected each country to always remain each others most essential partner. There have been times where we have differed in our approaches and thats always been done firmly and respectfully. The last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves, Trudeau said. Trumps vow to renegotiate NAFTA has unnerved Canadian officials, even though he has singled out Mexico in his criticism of the free trade deal. Canada sends 75 percent of its exports to the United States. Canadians have become more supportive of NAFTA since Trumps election victory on Nov. 8, a poll from the Angus Reid Institute showed on Monday. Forty-four percent of the 1,508 surveyed said NAFTA had benefited Canada, up from 25 percent from a poll last June. Trudeau, when asked about Canadian firms concerns about possible changes to NAFTA, said: It is a real concern for many Canadians because we know our economy is very dependent on our relationship with the United States. Goods and services do cross the border each day...we have to allow this free flow of goods and services and we have to be aware of the integration of our economies. Trudeau had a strong rapport with former Democratic President Barack Obama, prompting pundits to describe their relationship as a bromance. Soon after Trump put a hold on allowing refugees into the United States and temporarily banned travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries in an executive order on Jan. 27, citing the need to head off attacks by Islamist militants, the Canadian prime minister took to Twitter to say refugees were welcome in Canada. Analysts said Trudeau, who has strong incentives to build a relationship with Trump given rising anti-trade sentiment, is bound to be happy with the first meeting. I thought it was a huge, huge win. The worst case scenario is we wound up with an Australia moment, when a relationship that should be on solid ground takes a bad turn, said Carlo Dade, director of the Center for Trade and Investment Policy at the Canada West Foundation. Instead, we actually got an endorsement of North American jobs, of Canada-U.S. jobs, working together, no America First - just the opposite, he added. Details about a tense telephone call late last month between Trump and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull had created wariness. The Washington Post, citing unidentified senior U.S. officials, said Trump abruptly ended a phone call with Turnbull, even though Australia has long been a staunch U.S. ally.  David Wilkins, former U.S. ambassador to Canada, said the priority of the meeting was to set a positive tone, and that was accomplished. The presidents comment on the economy and creating jobs together was a very positive sign for Canadians, especially those that had been concerned about the trading relationship, said Wilkins.

Conways comments prompted criticism from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers, as well as some legal experts who said she may have violated ethics rules that prohibit using a public office to endorse products or advance personal business gains.

Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the same committee, said on Sunday that Millers characterization of Conways remarks was incorrect.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Despite his campaign vows to take a tougher line with North Korea, President Donald Trumps restrained public reaction to Pyongyangs first ballistic missile launch on his watch underscores that he has few good options to curb its missile and nuclear programs. The responses under consideration - which range from additional sanctions to U.S. shows of force to beefed-up missile defense, according to one administration official - do not seem to differ significantly so far from the North Korea playbook followed by Trumps predecessor, Barack Obama. Even the idea of stepping up pressure on China to rein in a defiant North Korea has been tried - to little avail - by successive administrations. But Beijing is showing no signs of softening its resistance under a new U.S. president who has bashed them on trade, currency and the contested South China Sea. More dramatic responses to North Koreas missile tests would be direct military action or negotiations. But neither appears to be on the table - the first because it would risk regional war, the latter because it would be seen as rewarding Pyongyang for bad behavior. And neither would offer certain success. Trumps options are limited, said Bonnie Glaser, an Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington. Trumps initial public comments on Saturday on the test launch of what was believed to be an intermediate-range Musudan-class missile were unexpectedly measured - and brief - compared to earlier bluster about another U.S. adversary, Iran, since he took office on January 20. I just want everybody to understand, and fully know, that the United States of America is behind Japan, our great ally, 100 percent, Trump told reporters in Palm Beach, Florida, speaking in a solemn tone alongside visiting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The U.S. president did not mention North Korea or signal any retaliatory plans for what was widely seen as an early effort to test the new administration. By contrast, Trump tweeted It wont happen! in January after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said the North was close to testing an intercontinental ballistic missile. White House adviser Stephen Miller insisted on ABCs This Week that Trumps one-sentence statement was an important show of solidarity with Japan. He told Fox News Sunday the administration was going to bolster its allies in the region against the increasing hostility of North Korea. While no one can rule out that Trump might still take to Twitter with harsh rhetoric as he often does, some analysts said his relatively subdued initial statement could show that aides have convinced him not to be baited by Pyongyang into issuing threats that would be hard to carry out, especially while his North Korea strategy is still being formulated. Trumps aides have said that they will take a more assertive approach than the Obama policy dubbed strategic patience, which involved gradually scaling up sanctions and diplomatic pressure and essentially waiting out the North Korean leadership. But the new administration has been vague about how it would do this. The Trump administration had been expecting a North Korean provocation and will consider a full range of options in response, but they would be calibrated to show U.S. resolve while avoiding escalation, the U.S. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The stakes would be higher, however, if nuclear-capable North Korea makes good on its threat to test an ICBM of a kind that could someday hit the United States, analysts said. Trump and his aides are likely to weigh new U.S. sanctions to tighten financial controls, an increase in naval and air assets and joint military exercises in and around the Korean peninsula and accelerated installation of new missile defense  systems in South Korea, the official said. Trump has also made clear that he believes China has not done enough to use its influence to help rein in Pyongyangs nuclear and ballistic programs. The U.S. official told Reuters that Trump would now step up pressure on Beijing, but acknowledged that there were limits to how far China would go, especially in enforcing sanctions, because of its own interests in avoiding destabilization of North Korea. It remains to be seen, however, whether the new administration might go a step beyond Obamas approach and focus on imposing secondary sanctions on firms and entities that help North Koreas weapons programs, many of which are in China. Also unclear is whether Trumps phone call last week with Chinese President Xi Jinping, in which the U.S. president backed  away from his threat to break from Americas long-standing one China policy, would engender greater cooperation from Beijing on North Korea. Beijing has enormous leverage over Pyongyang thanks to being one of its only trading partners and in fact could not survive without Chinese economic assistance, said Harry Kazianis, director of defense studies at the conservative   Center for the National Interest. Riki Ellison, who heads the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, an industry group, said Trump should also move quickly to beef up missile defense in both South Korea and Japan - for which the Obama administration has already laid much of the groundwork. He cannot ignore this, he said. It has to be swift. North Koreas repeated missile launches prompted Washington and Seoul to agree to deploy a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile battery in South Korea later this year, a system strongly opposed by Beijing, which worries that its powerful radar undermines its own security.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A White House official on Sunday attacked a U.S. court ruling that blocked President Donald Trumps executive order on immigration as a judicial usurpation of power and said the administration was considering a range of options, including a new order. Sustained criticism of the judiciary from the White House comes amid concern among Democrats and legal scholars over Trumps view of the constitutional principle of judicial independence as the administration seeks to overcome legal setbacks to its travel ban issued on Jan. 27. It has also become the backdrop against which U.S. senators consider Trumps Supreme Court nominee, Judge Neil Gorsuch, for a lifetime appointment to the nations highest court.  The Republican president said on Friday that he may issue a new executive order rather than go through lengthy court challenges to the original one, which temporarily barred entry to the United States of people from seven Muslim-majority countries. We have multiple options and we are considering all of them, White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller said on ABCs This Week.  Miller sharply criticized the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling on Thursday that upheld a Seattle federal judges suspension of Trumps executive order. He accused the San Francisco-based court of having a history of overreaching and of being overturned. This is a judicial usurpation of power, he said on Fox News Sunday. The presidents powers here are beyond question. The Trump administration has defended the travel ban on grounds it will prevent potential terrorists from entering the country, although no acts of terrorism have been perpetrated on U.S. soil by citizens of the targeted countries. The bans announcement, late on a Friday, sparked a weekend of confusion at airports around the globe and within the federal agencies charged with enforcing it. It also triggered widespread protests and legal challenges. Aware that a new executive order would allow critics to declare victory against the travel ban, the White House has deflected blame and intensified its criticism of the judiciary. I think its been an important reminder to all Americans that we have a judiciary that has taken far too much power and become in many cases a supreme branch of government, Miller said on CBS Face the Nation. One unelected judge in Seattle cannot make laws for the entire country. I mean this is just crazy, he said. Millers performance on several Sunday news shows won a plaudit on Twitter from Trump, who has himself attacked individual judges and called the courts so political. Great job! Trump tweeted. Gorsuch condemned the attacks on the judiciary as disheartening in private meetings last week with a number of U.S. senators, who pressed the judge to go public. Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist, confirmed the conversations. Legal experts said the Trump administration statements could undermine respect for the constitutional division of powers. Cornell University law professor Jens David Ohlin said that accusing the judiciary of usurping the presidents powers demonstrated an absurd lack of appreciation for the separation of powers. Miller is coming dangerously close to reviving a discredited and dangerous theory that each branch of government, including the president, has independent authority to decide what the law and Constitution mean, Ohlin said in an interview on Sunday.  In our system of government, the commander in chief executes the laws, but it is the judiciary which interprets both the laws and statutes passed by Congress and the Constitution. Thats their solemn duty, he added. Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said Trumps remarks could diminish popular respect for institutions of law and order by making Americans think the governments a joke, that you dont have to follow what judges say. Immigration laws give the U.S. president broad powers to restrict who enters the country on national security grounds. But the same laws forbid discrimination based on race, sex, nationality or place of birth or residence. The case also could involve First Amendment protections involving religion. Trumps executive order banned entry into the United States to refugees and citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days and all refugees for 120 days, except refugees from Syria, who were banned indefinitely. Options for the administration include formulating a new executive action, appealing the 9th Circuit panels decision to the full appeals court and appealing the emergency stay to the U.S. Supreme Court, Miller said.

Netanyahu leaves for Washington on Monday and will see Trump at the White House on Wednesday for their first meeting since the Republicans inauguration last month, with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and policy toward Iran on the agenda. During his 2016 election campaign, Trump indicated his presidency would be a boon for Israel and tough on Palestinians, after an acrimonious relationship between his predecessor Barack Obama and Netanyahu that included clashes over settlement building and Irans nuclear program. Trump talked of moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, naming an ambassador who backs Israeli settlement on occupied land which Palestinians seek for a state and exerting no pressure on Israel for peace negotiations, which collapsed in 2014. But he has since toned down his pro-Israel bravado ahead of Netanyahus visit, a change that could help the prime minister keep in check ultra-nationalist coalition partners calling on him to push a more militant agenda. To believe there are no restrictions now would be a mistake, Israel Radio quoted Netanyahu as telling members of his Likud party with respect to settlement expansion now that Trump is in office. On the eve of Netanyahus departure for Washington, Education Minister Naftali Bennett, leader of the ultra-nationalist Jewish Home party, publicly cautioned him not to mention the words two-state solution in talks with Trump. Bennetts party is also promoting the annexation of parts of the West Bank. Netanyahu has stopped short of endorsing those positions - steps that would put Israel at odds with long-standing U.S. and European policies - while speaking of building in major settlement blocs Israel intends to keep in any future peace deal. In public remarks to his cabinet on Sunday, he seemed to urge the far-right to tone down its expectations. I understand theres great excitement about this meeting (with Trump), he said. But ... my primary concern is Israels security (and) strengthening our solid alliance with the United States. That, Netanyahu said, requires responsible policies, policies that are given careful consideration - and thats how I intend to act. He did not elaborate. His comments appeared to echo remarks Trump made in an interview published on Friday in the pro-Netanyahu Israeli daily Israel Hayom. Calling on Israel to be reasonable with respect to peace, he said settlements dont help the process. In recent weeks, Netanyahu approved the construction of some 6,000 settler homes in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, drawing Palestinian and international condemnation which the Trump administration did not join. However, Trumps remarks in the Israeli newspaper interview appeared to take a tougher line toward Israeli settlement policy.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

South African four-time majors champion Ernie Els joined Trump and Abe for a round at Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter, Florida, Trump said in a tweet Saturday evening. Reporters were not allowed on the course to watch the president and prime minister while they golfed. After four hours at the club, Trump tweeted a picture of himself and Abe on the golf course. Having a great time hosting Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in the United States, Trump said in the tweet. The 47-year-old Els, whose primary residence is in south Florida, followed in the footsteps of American former world number one Tiger Woods, who played golf with Trump in December. Shortly after the golf round, Trump and Abe left the club to head to a private lunch. Between tweets about his visit with the Japanese prime minister and golfing with Abe and Els, Trump sent out a tweet again castigating the media over their treatment of his daughter Ivanka Trump.  I am so proud of my daughter Ivanka. To be abused and treated so badly by the media, and to still hold her head so high, is truly wonderful! he wrote. Trump earlier this week blasted department store operator Nordstrom for dropping his daughter Ivankas clothing line, because of what the company said were poor sales. Abe traveled to Florida on Air Force One with the new U.S. president after a more formal meeting at the White House on Friday. The weekend excursion is Trumps first use of his Mar-a-Lago resort to entertain an international leader. Washington and Tokyo have said the weekend trip is a sign of the importance that both leaders place on the U.S.-Japan relationship.  Abe, in particular, sought to ease concerns in Japan about the fate of the decades-long alliance under Trump, who had raised concerns about U.S. military spending in Japan during the rancorous 2016 presidential election campaign. At a news conference on Friday, Trump and Abe focused on areas of common ground, with Trump setting aside campaign pledges to force Tokyo to pay more for U.S. defense aid and Abe promising to help the United States to create jobs. On Friday night, Trump and Abe ate dinner with their wives on an outdoor patio at Mar-a-Lago. The couples were joined by Robert Kraft, owner of the National Football Leagues New England Patriots, which won the Super Bowl last Sunday. Trump and Abe are set to meet again for dinner Saturday evening, along with some members of the Japanese delegation. The two leaders are scheduled to depart Florida on Sunday.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON/MARIETTA, Ga. (Reuters) - Anti-abortion protesters rallied at scores of Planned Parenthood clinics on Saturday to urge Congress and President Donald Trump to strip the health services provider of federal funding, while supporters of the organization staged counter-demonstrations around the United States. With anti-abortion groups expecting protests at up to 225 clinics, Planned Parenthood supporters organized 150 protests of their own at parks, government buildings and other sites, including clinics. At some of those clinics, the counter-demonstrators outnumbered those demanding an end to federal funding for Planned Parenthood. All told, rallies and marches were called in 45 states in cities large and small, from Washington and Philadelphia to St. Paul, Minnesota, and Orange, California  As many as 6,000 people turned up for competing demonstrations in St. Paul, Minnesota, police said, but at other  places, only a few dozen demonstrators turned out. We expected that tens of thousands of pro-lifers will be out today sending a message that we want Planned Parenthood to be defunded, Monica Miller, director of Citizens for a Pro-Life Society and one of the national organizers of the anti-abortion rallies, said in a telephone interview. As long as they are going stay in the abortion business, that is an organization that shouldnt be getting one red cent of federal tax money, Miller said. The 100-year-old organization of about 650 health centers provides birth control and other womens health services in addition to abortion, according to its website. The U.S. Supreme Court legalized abortion in the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling but U.S. law prohibits the use of federal funds for abortions. Anti-abortion activists say funding for other purposes acts to subsidize abortions. In some cities, the two sides in the long-simmering issue  positioned themselves along the same street. Initial reports indicate the rallies were vocal and peaceful. In the Atlanta suburb of Marietta, anti-abortion and abortion-rights groups took opposite sides of a four-lane highway, waving signs at traffic and shouting slogans. Trump is going to hear our trumpet call, said anti-abortion activist Sandy Prescott, 61, a homemaker from Roswell, Georgia, who was part of a group of about 100 people demanding an end to federal funding for Planned Parenthood. At the competing abortion-rights demonstration, about 50 people gathered and held signs that included: Womens rights are human rights. Many wore the pink pussy hats that have became an anti-Trump symbol since the Republicans inauguration on Jan. 20. David Daleiden, an anti-abortion activist who in 2015 targeted Planned Parenthood with surreptitiously filmed videos to try and show it was profiting from the sale of aborted fetal tissue, addressed a rally of nearly 500 people in rain-soaked Orange, a Los Angeles suburb. Im confident that together, if we keep the faith, take the next right step, at the end of the day we will soon see a day when there will no longer be a price tag put on human life, said Daleiden, founder of the Center of Medical Progress. Daleiden and fellow activist Sandra Merritt were indicted in January 2016 for using illegal government identifications to secretly film a Planned Parenthood facility in Texas, but the charges were later dropped. A grand jury cleared Planned Parenthood of wrongdoing. Anti-abortion activists have said they are energized by the election of Trump, who has promised to restrict abortions. He selected their long-time ally, Mike Pence, as vice president, and nominated conservative jurist Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court. Two weeks ago, tens of thousands converged on Washington for the 44th March for Life, where Pence became the most senior government official to speak in person at the annual anti-abortion rally, organizers said. We finally have someone in the White House who has the power and authority to save and defend lives, said Margie Sznajder, one of 300 anti-abortion protesters at a rally in her hometown of Aurora, Illinois, outside Chicago. Planned Parenthood leaders say abortions rights supporters also have been energized by Trumps election, as exemplified by the hundreds of thousands who flooded Washington a day after Trumps inauguration in favor of womens rights, including abortion rights. In Denver, hundreds gathered outside the office of U.S. Senator Cory Gardner, urging the Republican not to pursue funding cuts. Some in the energetic but peaceful crowd carried signs with slogans like I refuse to go back to the 1950s, and If its not your body, its not your decision. The pro-Planned Parenthood events on Saturday were organized spontaneously, without the groups initiative, a spokeswoman said. Saturday, and every day, Planned Parenthood advocates and activists show that they refuse to be intimidated and they wont back down, Kelley Robinson, a leader of Planned Parenthood Action Fund Support, said in a statement. Planned Parenthood receives federal funds from Medicaid reimbursements and Title X, a federal program that supports family planning and preventive health services. Planned Parenthood says cutting off those funds would make it more difficult for women to obtain birth control, Pap smears or testing for sexually transmitted diseases. At some points in Washington, Planned Parenthood supporters formed lines to block about 50 people marching from the Supreme Court to a Planned Parenthood clinic but police officers moved them aside. Abortion, to me, is the greatest evil of our time, said Delia Tyagi, 36, an accountant who lives in Arlington, Virginia. Planned Parenthood has wronged women in a lot of ways. I feel like we have the momentum to finally defund them. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Trump made his comments in two Twitter posts but did not say how he would bring down the cost of the wall. Reuters on Thursday published details of an internal report by the Department of Homeland Security that estimated the price of a wall along the entire border at $21.6 billion. During his presidential campaign Trump had cited a $12 billion figure. I am reading that the great border WALL will cost more than the government originally thought, but I have not gotten involved in the ... design or negotiations yet, Trump tweeted from his Florida resort, where he is hosting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. When I do, just like with the F-35 FighterJet or the Air Force One Program, price will come WAY DOWN! Trump, who took office on Jan. 20, said in late January that his administration had been able to cut some $600 million from a deal to buy about 90 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters from Lockheed Martin. Defense analysts and sources downplayed news of those cuts, saying the discount hailed by Trump was in line with what had been flagged by Lockheed for months and would apply to other countries committed to the program. A border wall to stem illegal immigration was one of Trumps main campaign promises. He has vowed to make Mexico reimburse the United States for its cost but Mexico has repeatedly said it will not do so. Trump also tweeted on Saturday about another aspect of his immigration policy - the legal battle over the presidential order banning entry to the United States by refugees and citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries. Our legal system is broken! 77% of refugees allowed into U.S. since travel reprieve hail from seven suspect countries. (WT) SO DANGEROUS! he said. The tweet was in apparent reaction to a Washington Times story saying 77 percent of the 1,100 refugees who have entered the United States since Feb. 3 are from the countries covered by Trumps ban. A federal judge in Seattle blocked Trumps executive order on Feb. 3, lifting the ban while litigation proceeds.

The two leaders appeared to have established a quick friendship during a day of talks at the White House and a flight together aboard Air Force One to Florida for a weekend of golf. At a joint news conference with Abe, Trump avoided repeating harsh campaign rhetoric that accused Japan of taking advantage of U.S. security aid and stealing American jobs. It was a welcome affirmation for Japan in the face of challenges such as Chinas maritime expansion and North Koreas nuclear and missile development. We are committed to the security of Japan and all areas under its administrative control and to further strengthening our very crucial alliance, Trump said. The bond between our two nations and the friendship between our two peoples runs very, very deep. This administration is committed to bringing those ties even closer, he added. A joint U.S.-Japanese statement said the U.S. commitment to defend Japan through nuclear and conventional military capabilities is unwavering. The statement amounted to a victory for Abe, who came to Washington wanting to develop a sense of trust and friendship with the new U.S. president and send a message that the decades-old alliance is unshakeable. Japan got continued U.S. backing for its dispute with Beijing over islands in the East China Sea that China also claims. The statement said the two leaders affirmed that Article 5 of the U.S.-Japan security treaty covered the islands, known as the Senkaku in Japan and the Diaoyu in China. Abe invited Trump for a visit to Japan this year and Trump accepted. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence will make an early stop in Tokyo. But uncertainty remained in another area, that of trade, after Trump abruptly pulled the United States out of the planned Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. Abe said he was fully aware of Trumps decision to withdraw from the multilateral trade accord. But he said Japan and the United States had agreed on a new framework for economic dialogue. I am quite optimistic that ... good results will be seen from the dialogue, he said, adding that Japan was looking for a fair, common set of rules for trade in the region.  A senior Japanese government spokesman said Abe and Trump did not discuss currency issues and that Trump did not request a bilateral trade deal.  The official told reporters that a U.S.-Japan economic dialogue will be led by Japanese Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso and Vice President Mike Pence to address fiscal and monetary policies as well as infrastructure projects and trade. Trump, who spoke by phone on Thursday night with Chinese President Xi Jinping, also said he considered dealing with North Koreas nuclear program a very very high priority but gave no hint as to how his approach would differ from that of his predecessor, Barack Obama. He predicted a level playing field on trade with China soon. The Mar-a-Lago visit will be Trumps first use of his Florida getaway for diplomatic purposes. It will also be the most time Trump will have spent with a foreign leader since taking power last month and his second face-to-face meeting with a key ally after talks with British Prime Minister Theresa May two weeks ago. Trump hosted Abe at Trump Tower last year in his first talks with a foreign leader after his surprise win in the November presidential election. Abe played down his chances in scoring better than Trump in golf. My scores in golf are not up to the level of Donald at all, but my policy is never up, never in, always aiming for the cup, he said.  Japan has had lingering concerns about what Trumps self-styled America First strategy means for U.S. foreign policy in Asia as well as what his decision to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact means for bilateral economic ties.     Abe pledged Japan would help create U.S. jobs, hoping to persuade Trump to turn down the heat on economic matters and stand by the alliance. To avoid questions about whether Japan is paying Trump for Abe to stay at the beachfront Mar-a-Lago retreat, the White House declared that the entire visit there, including golf, is the official gift for Abe from Trump.

Rather than Melania Trump, it was the wife of the Japanese ambassador to the United States who accompanied Akie Abe on a visit to a local university, a Japanese embassy official said. That was a departure from Akie Abes previous visits to Washington. In 2007, she was treated to a tour with Laura Bush to George Washingtons home, Mount Vernon, and in 2015, she and Michelle Obama stopped by a northern Virginia elementary school with a Japanese immersion program. The break with convention, three weeks into husband Donald Trumps presidency, is another sign that Melania Trump may have different designs on the first ladys role than her predecessors.    Melania Trump has elected to stay in New York for now while her son finishes his school year. It is not yet clear if she will take a prominent role in White House social events, including accompanying fellow first ladies on their visits to the capital.  Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife are scheduled to spend the weekend at the Trumps Florida Mar-a-Lago retreat, where the two leaders will golf and the task of hosting Mrs. Abe will fall to Melania. While their husbands strive to appear in lock-step on U.S.-Japan relations this weekend, Melania Trump may find in her Japanese counterpart someone who is in many ways her opposite - a political spouse who does not shun the limelight and disagrees publicly with her powerful husband. Melania Trump, a former model from Slovenia, rarely airs differences of opinion with her husband. Akie Abe, in contrast, has used news interviews to make policy recommendations for his administration, leading some to dub her the household opposition.  She told Reuters in 2014 that Japan should consider cutting spending and boosting the economy before further raising the sales tax, to 10 percent. She said she had urged her husband not to go forward with the first stage of the rise, to 8 percent, to no avail.  Critiquing Japans male-dominated professional culture, Akie Abe told Bloomberg last year that Japanese women are held back by pressure from men to be cute rather than capable and hardworking. Her public profile makes her a rarity in Japan as well as a stark contrast with Melania Trump, who largely avoided the campaign trail, has not shown deep interest in public policy, and has rarely disagreed with Trump in public despite some damaging revelations. When a videotape of Trump emerged during the 2016 presidential campaign in which he boasted about grabbing women by their genitals, Melania said in a brief statement that his words were unacceptable and offensive but that she had accepted his apology.     The differing styles could keep the weekend conversations on the light side. I would certainly expect no discussion of global politics between Melania and Akie, said Jean Harris, a University of Scranton professor who has studied the role of first ladies. I dont see Melania as wanting to be part of those conversations. Akie Abes openness in stating points of disagreement with her husband has few parallels even in American politics, where first ladies tend not to diverge from their husbands in public, though they may be crucial advisors behind the scenes, Harris said. Just after the election, Melania Trump said in a CBS interview that she chides her husband all the time for his Twitter attacks. Sometimes he listens, sometimes he doesnt, she said. I give him my opinion. And he could do whatever he likes with it. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

A political commentator close to Abadi, Ihsan al-Shammari, said Abadis comment addressed the U.S.-Iranian tensions.   Iran has close ties with the Shiite political elite ruling Iraq while Washington is providing critical military support to Iraqi forces battling Islamic State.   Iraq is very keen to preserve its national interests (..)and does not wish to be part of any regional or international conflict which would lead to disasters for the region and for Iraq, Abadi said, according to state TV. Trump said on Friday that Iranian President Hassan Rouhani better be careful after the latter was quoted as saying that anyone who speaks to Iranians with threats would regret it. The White House on Friday said Trump and Abadi spoke to the threat Iran presents across the entire region, in their first phone call since the inauguration of the U.S. president. Abadis office on Friday also gave a readout of the phone call that took place overnight Thursday, without specifically mentioning Iran.  Both readouts stressed the importance of their continued cooperation against Islamic State, as the militants are being pushed back in Iraq and losing control over Mosul, the last major city stronghold under their control in the country. The United States has more than 5,000 troops deployed in Iraq and is providing air and ground support in the battle of Mosul. Iran has also played a major role in the fight against Islamic State by arming and training Iraqi Shiite groups collectively known as Popular Mobilization.    The Iraqi prime minister Dr Abadi is stressing once again the policy of neutrality and to steer clear from conflicts, political commentator Shammari told state TV. The Iraqi readout said Abadi asked Trump to lift the ban on people from his country traveling to the United States.  U.S. courts suspended the restrictions announced end January on entries from Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Trump has said he will keep trying to reinstate them. Abadi resisted calls from influential pro-Iranian Shiite politicians to retaliate against the ban, at a meeting held on Jan. 29, citing Iraqs need for U.S. military support. Washington last week ratcheted up pressure on Iran, putting sanctions on 13 individuals and 12 entities days after the White House put Tehran on notice over a ballistic missile test. Irans dominant influence in Iraqi politics was eroded after Islamic State routed the Iraqi army commanded then by Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, a close ally of Tehran, in 2014.

Several areas of disagreement between the superpowers, including currency, trade, the South China Sea and North Korea, were not mentioned in public statements on Thursdays telephone conversation between Presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump. In getting Trump to change course on the one China policy, Beijing may have overplayed its hand. Trump had upset Beijing before he took office by taking a call from Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, then casting doubt on the one China policy, under which Washington acknowledges the Chinese position that there is only one China and Taiwan is part of it. Trump changed tack and agreed to honor the one China policy during the call, prompting jubilation in China. Beijing  had been working on diplomatic ways to engage Trumps team and largely blaming Taiwan for stirring things up. [nL4N1FV21K] Laying the foundation for that call had been the low-key engagement of Chinas former ambassador to Washington and top diplomat, the urbane and fluent English-speaking Yang Jiechi, with Trumps national security adviser Michael Flynn. China was pragmatic and patient. It made every effort to smooth out the relationship, and it paid off, said Jia Qingguo, dean of the School of International Studies at Peking University, who has advised the government on foreign policy. But China also made very clear Taiwan was not up for negotiation, unleashing state media to threaten war and punishment for U.S. firms if that bottom line was breached. China has long described self-ruled Taiwan, claimed by Beijing as its sacred territory, as the most sensitive issue in Sino-U.S. relations.  Its military had become alarmed after the Trump-Tsai call and was considering strong measures to prevent the island from moving toward independence, sources with ties to senior military officers told Reuters in December. [nL4N1ES0VR] A source familiar with Chinas thinking on relations with the United States, speaking to Reuters last month, said China had actually not been too bothered with Trumps Taiwan comments before he took office as he was not president then and was only expressing his personal view. If he continues with this once he becomes president then theres no saying what well do, the source said. Despite the U.S. concession, military tensions remain. On Saturday, the overseas edition of the ruling Communist Partys Peoples Daily placed a picture on its front page of Chinese warships about to embark on a new round of drills in the South China Sea, right next to an upbeat commentary about the Xi-Trump call. The papers WeChat account took a harsher line, saying that with Trump getting back with the program on one China, Taiwan had better watch out. The heart of that Madame Tsai on the other side of the Taiwan Strait must at this moment be chilled to the core, it said. One senior Western diplomat said China had been redoubling its efforts to win over the Vatican, one of a handful of countries to retain official ties with Taiwan. Taiwan says it hopes for continued U.S. support, and one ruling Democratic Progressive Party official told Reuters that the one China policy had not affected previous U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, even as U.S. presidents commitment to the island have waxed and waned. Xi has put great personal political capital into seeking a solution over Taiwan, an issue that has festered since 1949 when defeated Nationalist forces fled to the island after losing the civil war to the Communists. China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. But in its relations with Washington, the risk for Beijing remains that its diplomatic win over one China will be short lived, as Trump will not want to be seen as having caved in. What hes shown the Chinese is hes willing to touch the third rail of U.S.-China relations, said Dean Cheng, China expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington. Beijing cant predict what hell do next  and hes only been in office three weeks. What is he going to do on trade and other economic issues? U.S. officials said the affirmation of the one China policy was an effort to get the relationship back on track and moving forward. [nL1N1FV1RU] But Trumps change of tack may be seen by Beijing as a climbdown, said Tom Rafferty, the China Regional Manager for the Economist Intelligence Unit.

Gere also told a news conference at the Berlin Film Festival just before the world premiere of his new film The Dinner that he found it discouraging to see term refugee go through such a dispiriting change of meaning in the United States.  The most horrible thing that Trump has done is conflated two words  refugee and terrorist, Gere, 67, told more than 100 journalists. It means the same thing in the U.S. now. Thats what hes accomplished to a large segment of our population. Trump ordered a travel ban on refugees and citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries on Jan. 27. A U.S. appeal court in San Francisco refused to reinstate a temporary ban on the order. Trump criticized the court decision. A refugee used to be someone that we had empathy for ...someone we wanted to help who we wanted to give refuge to, Gere said.  ...Now were afraid of them and this ...is the biggest crime in itself: conflating these two ideas. Gere met Chancellor Angela Merkel this week while in Berlin for the festival. She told Trump in a phone call two weeks ago the global fight against terrorism was no excuse for banning people from Muslim-majority countries. In the film The Dinner, Gere plays a famous politician who meets his wife and his brother at a hip restaurant to discuss a horrible crime committed by their sons.  In an interview with Reuters before the news conference, Gere said he was encouraged by protests in the United States against Trumps policies. I am essentially an optimist so I am seeing this as an opportunity for people to show up the day after he was inaugurated, Gere said. There were millions of people in the streets in New York. It wasnt angry demonstrations. It was positive demonstrations that were kind of a unity of purpose. More than a million migrants, many of them fleeing conflict and persecution, have arrived in Germany over the last two years.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""BEIJING/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump changed tack and agreed to honor the one China policy during a phone call with Chinas leader Xi Jinping, a major diplomatic boost for Beijing which brooks no criticism of its claim to self-ruled Taiwan. Trump angered Beijing in December by talking to the president of Taiwan and saying the United States did not have to stick to the policy, under which Washington acknowledges the Chinese position that there is only one China and Taiwan is part of it.  A White House statement said Trump and Chinese President Xi had a lengthy phone conversation on Thursday night, Washington time.  President Trump agreed, at the request of President Xi, to honor our one China policy, the statement said.  A spokesman for Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said in a statement it was in Taiwans interest to maintain good relations with the United States and China. The U.S. and Chinese leaders had not spoken by telephone since Trump took office on Jan. 20. Diplomatic sources in Beijing say China had been nervous about Xi being left humiliated in the event a call with Trump went wrong and the details were leaked to the media. Last week, U.S. ties with staunch ally Australia became strained after the Washington Post published details about an acrimonious phone call between Trump and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.     No issue is more sensitive to Beijing than Taiwan. China and the United States also signaled that with the one China issue resolved, they could have more normal relations. Representatives of the United States and China will engage in discussions and negotiations on various issues of mutual interest, the statement said. In a separate statement carried by Chinas Foreign Ministry, Xi said China appreciated Trumps upholding of the one China policy. I believe that the United States and China are cooperative partners, and through joint efforts we can push bilateral relations to a historic new high, the statement quoted Xi as saying. The development of China and the United States absolutely can complement each other and advance together. Both sides absolutely can become very good cooperative partners, Xi said. Taiwans top China policymaker, the Mainland Affairs Council, said it hoped for continued support from the United States and called on Beijing to adopt a positive attitude and pragmatic communication in resolving differences with Taiwan.  China is deeply suspicious of Tsai, whose ruling Democratic Progressive Party espouses the islands formal independence, a red line for Beijing, and has cut off a formal dialogue mechanism with the island. Tsai says she wants peace with China. In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said the one China principle was the political basis of Sino-U.S. ties. Ensuring this political basis does not waver is vital for the healthy, stable development of China-U.S. relations, Lu said. Lawyer James Zimmerman, the former head of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said Trump should have never raised the one China policy in the first place. There is certainly a way of negotiating with the Chinese, but threats concerning fundamental, core interests are counterproductive from the get-go, he said in an email. The end result is that Trump just confirmed to the world that he is a paper tiger, a zhilaohu  someone that seems threatening but is wholly ineffectual and unable to stomach a challenge. Jia Qingguo, dean of the School of International Studies at Peking University and who has advised the government on foreign policy, said Trump had created a lot of uncertainty but was now back on track. Trump has reassured people that he will be a responsible president, he told Reuters. ...This is good news for China, because stable U.S.-China relations are good for China. Now we can do business. The United States switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 1979, but is also Taiwans biggest ally and arms supplier and is bound by legislation to provide the means to help the island defend itself. Defeated Nationalist forces fled from China to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with the Communists. Beijing has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. China wants cooperation with the United States on trade, investment, technology, energy and infrastructure, as well as strengthening coordination on international matters to jointly protect global peace and stability, Xi said in the statement. The White House described the call, which came hours before Trump plays host to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, as extremely cordial, with both leaders expressing best wishes to their peoples. There was little or no mention in either the Chinese or U.S.  statement of other contentious issues - trade and the disputed South China Sea - and neither matter has gone away. A U.S. official told Reuters on Thursday that a U.S. Navy P-3 plane and a Chinese military aircraft came close to each other over the South China Sea, though the Navy believes the incident was inadvertent. China on Friday reported an initial trade surplus of $51.35 billion for January, more than $21 billion of which was with the   United States. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trumps acceptance of Beijings demand that he re-commit to a one China policy was heavily influenced by his new top diplomat, who argued behind the scenes that relations would remain on hold until Trump cleared up doubts about a longtime bedrock of U.S.-China ties, officials said. The abrupt course adjustment, made public in a White House statement on Thursday after a phone call between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, followed White House meetings this week involving Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the U.S. officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Tillerson joined Trumps national security adviser Michael Flynn and others in what one administration official described as a concerted effort to persuade the president that this is the right way to go, this is right for the relationships and regional stability - and they won the day. The successful intervention by Tillerson, a former Exxon Mobil chief executive with no previous diplomatic experience who was confirmed just nine days ago, suggests that in a White House-dominated administration, the new secretary of state could help drive decisions on some geopolitical issues.  Tillersons sway on other Trump priorities, such as fighting Islamic State, countering Iran and improving ties with Russia, remains to be seen. Chinese anger toward Trump has simmered since December when he spoke to the president of Taiwan and said the United States did not have to stick to the one China policy, under which Washington acknowledges the Chinese position that there is only one China and Taiwan is part of it. Beijing considers self-ruled Taiwan a renegade province. China had signaled to Washington that there would be no phone call between Trump and Xi and the relationship could not move forward until Trump reaffirmed the one China policy, one of the U.S. officials said. U.S.-based China experts said Trumps change of tack should help ease tensions and open the way for discussions across the board. But they cautioned that this does not suggest  a softening of Trumps stance over other issues, including the contested South China Sea, his threat of high tariffs on Chinese goods and his pressure on Beijing to rein in North Korea. But Trumps acquiescence on an issue of extreme Chinese nationalist sensitivity also creates the risk that the Chinese will conclude that Trump is tough in his rhetoric but can be rolled if they apply sufficient pressure, said Bonnie Glaser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The White House and State Department had no immediate comment. Speaking at a joint news conference with visiting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump signaled on Friday that he was pleased to have broken the ice with Xi, describing the call as a very, very warm conversation. But he also noted that he had long complained that Chinas currency was undervalued and predicted that a level playing field in terms of trade would be reached between the two countries sooner than many people think. Tillersons emerging role suggests that he could be a moderating influence with both friends and adversaries who have been unnerved at times by Trumps rhetoric and unpredictability. The secretary of state played a role in crafting the one China statement but it was not immediately clear whether he or others met directly with Trump to make the case for issuing it. Another major player on the issue was Flynn, who spoke by phone to Chinas top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, on Feb. 3, the sources said. As an oil executive, Tillerson had a complicated history with China. He had regular dealings with Chinas state-run oil companies over Exxon Mobils longtime business interests there, but also developed oil exploration ties with Vietnam, which has territorial disputes with Beijing in the South China Sea. During his Senate confirmation hearings last month, Tillerson raised Chinese ire when he said China should be denied access to islands it is building in the South China Sea. But in written responses to follow-up questions from lawmakers that surfaced this week after his confirmation, Tillerson softened his language, saying that in the event of an unspecified contingency the United States and its allies must be capable of limiting Chinas access to and use of those islands to pose a threat.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""PALM BEACH, Fla./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is considering issuing a new executive order banning citizens of certain countries traveling to the United States after his initial attempt to clamp down on immigration and refugees snarled to a halt amid political and judicial chaos. Trump announced the possibility of a brand new order that could be issued as soon as Monday or Tuesday, in a surprise talk with reporters aboard Air Force One late on Friday, as he and the Japanese premier headed to his estate in Florida for the weekend.  His signaling of a possible new tack came a day after an appeals court in San Francisco upheld a court ruling last week that temporarily suspended Trumps original Jan. 27 executive order banning travel from seven majority-Muslim countries.  Trump gave no details of any new ban he is considering. He might rewrite the original order to explicitly exclude green card holders, or permanent residents, said a congressional aide familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified. Doing that could alleviate some concerns expressed by the courts. A new order, however, could allow Trumps critics to declare victory by arguing he was forced to change course in his first major policy as president. Whether or not Trump issues a new order, his administration may still  pursue its case in the courts over the original order, which is still being reviewed by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus told reporters late on Friday that taking the case to the Supreme Court remained a possibility, after another White House official said earlier in the day the administration was not planning to escalate the dispute. Every single court option is on the table, including an appeal of the Ninth Circuit decision on the TRO (temporary restraining order) to the Supreme Court, including fighting out this case on the merits, Priebus said. And, in addition to that, were pursuing executive orders right now that we expect to be enacted soon that will further protect Americans from terrorism. Trumps original order, which he called a national security measure meant to head off attacks by Islamist militants, barred people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering for 90 days and all refugees for 120 days, except refugees from Syria, who were banned indefinitely. The abrupt implementation of the order plunged the immigration system into chaos, sparking a wave of criticism from targeted countries, Western allies and some of Americas leading corporations, especially technology firms. A federal judge in Seattle suspended the order last Friday after its legality was challenged by Washington state, eliciting a barrage of angry Twitter messages from Trump against the judge and the court system. That ruling was upheld by an appeals court in San Francisco on Thursday, raising questions about Trumps next step. An official familiar with Trumps plans said if the order is rewritten, among those involved would likely be White House aide Stephen Miller, who was involved in drafting the original order, as well as officials of the National Security Council, Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security. It is not clear if a new order from Trump would immediately put a travel ban back in place, or if those who have filed lawsuits, including the state of Washington, would succeed in asking the same judge for another hold. Should Trump issue a new order, he is still likely to face legal challenges, as opponents could ask the court to let them amend their complaints, said Alexander Reinert, a professor at Yeshiva Universitys Cardozo School of Law in New York.  On Air Force One, Trump addressed the San Francisco court fight, saying: We will win that battle. The unfortunate part is that it takes time statutorily... We need speed for reasons of security. The matter could move forward next week. An unidentified judge on the 9th Circuit on Friday requested that the courts 25 full-time judges vote on whether the temporary block of Trumps travel ban should be reheard before an 11-judge panel, known as en banc review, according to a court order. The 9th Circuit asked both sides to file briefs by Thursday.      In a separate case on Friday, Justice Department lawyers argued in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia against a preliminary injunction that would put a longer hold on Trumps executive order than the Seattle court ruling, but focused solely on visa holders. Judge Leonie Brinkema asked the administration for more evidence of the threat posed by citizens of the seven countries. Aboard the flight with Trump were his wife Melania, daughter Ivanka, son-in-law Jared Kushner and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife Akie. The Trumps landed in the evening and went to their Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

(bit.ly/2lAnk7t) Trump blamed voter fraud for his and Ayottes losses in New Hampshire in Novembers election while speaking on Thursday with a bipartisan group of U.S. senators, saying that Ayottes re-election bid was spoiled by thousands of people from neighboring Massachusetts voting in New Hampshire, according to media reports. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton narrowly won New Hampshires four electoral votes by nearly 3,000 votes, while Ayotte, a Republican like Trump, lost by only 743 votes. Weintraub, who was appointed by former Republican President George W. Bush, asked Trump to immediately share his evidence with the public and with the appropriate law-enforcement authorities so that his allegations may be investigated promptly and thoroughly. Trump said on Sunday he would put Vice President Mike Pence in charge of a special commission to investigate voter fraud, despite numerous studies showing that such fraud is rare in the United States.

This is a no-brainer, for crying out loud, said Democratic Representative Bill Pascrell, a House Ways and Means Committee Democrat who asked the panel this month to request Trumps federal tax returns from the U.S. Treasury. The Ways and Means Committee is one of three panels with the authority to subpoena tax returns. Defying decades of precedent, Trump has refused to release his tax returns. This has made it harder for watchdogs to determine how his actions as president may affect his sprawling business empire, including his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, where Trump is hosting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe this weekend. Critics say disclosing tax returns would help settle concerns about possible conflicts of interest. While Democrats say tax committees in Congress should exercise their authority to request Trumps federal tax returns from the Internal Revenue Service, Republicans who control Congress have shown little interest in doing so. I dont think we can roll all over people just because theyre in a position of government, said Senator Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican who chairs both the Senate Finance Committee and the Joint Committee on Taxation, the two other panels with the authority to request tax records. The three committees do not need permission from Congress as a whole to review tax records behind closed doors, according to tax experts and congressional aides. However, they face a higher barrier if they want to make that information public. There has to be a legitimate purpose for that disclosure. It has to be in the public interest, said George Yin, a former Joint Committee on Taxation chief of staff who now teaches at the University of Virginia.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Congressman Will Hurd - whose district spans 800 miles (1,290 km) of the Texas-Mexico border - on Friday criticized plans under consideration by the Trump administration to build walls and fences costing an estimated $21.6 billion to deter illegal immigration.  Reuters on Thursday revealed details of an internal report by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that estimated the cost of covering the entire border. It called for the first phase of construction to begin in San Diego, California; El Paso, Texas and the Rio Grande Valley. Building a wall is the most expensive and least effective way to secure the border, Hurd, whose district includes El Paso, said in an email. He said his district includes rough terrain where it is impossible to build a physical wall. The estimated price tag in the report is much higher than a $12 billion figure cited by Republican President Donald Trump in his campaign and estimates as high as $15 billion from Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan and Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The border wall was one of Trumps main campaign promises. Trump, who took office on Jan. 20, has vowed to make Mexico pay for it, but the United States southern neighbor has repeatedly said it will not fund its construction. Many congressional Democrats reacted strongly to the news of plans for the wall and its estimated price.  Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the senior Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said in a telephone interview that he welcomed the debate in his committee over funding the wall.  Instead of funding this costly and ineffective proxy for real action on immigration reform, we should be directing our resources toward finding cures for cancer, building schools for our children, feeding the hungry and rebuilding our bridges and our roads, Leahy said. Five Democratic senators on Friday wrote a letter to Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly claiming that the money would be misspent.  The letter was signed by Senators Kamala Harris of California, Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, Tom Udall of New Mexico, Brian Schatz of Hawaii and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Warren, a star of the political left, was silenced in the Republican-controlled Senate on Tuesday evening for speaking out against Trumps  attorney general nominee, Republican Senator Jeff Sessions. Sessions was confirmed on Wednesday.  The senators wrote, We are extraordinarily concerned that President Trumps executive order appears to require that you divert DHS funds meant for critical security priorities to instead fund the border wall. They asked that Kelly respond to a series of questions, including how much funding will be diverted to cover costs for building the wall. Hurd said he had seen estimates as high as $40 billion for the barriers construction, citing a Massachusetts Institute of Technology study released in October.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Justice Anthony Kennedys legal reasoning in a 2015 immigration case suggests the U.S. Supreme Courts frequent swing vote would be skeptical of President Donald Trumps travel ban on people from seven Muslim-majority countries. The little-noticed case involved an Afghan-born naturalized U.S. citizen named Fauzia Din who argued she had the right for a full explanation from the U.S. government as to why her Afghan husband was denied entry. The justices ruled 5-4 against her.  Kennedy wrote in a concurring opinion that in some circumstances the U.S. governments motives in denying someone entry could be subject to legal review.  In their lawsuit challenging Trumps Jan. 27 ban, the states of Washington and Minnesota cited Kennedys opinion. Lower courts have temporarily blocked the ban, but the administration may ask the Supreme Court to revive it. Trumps executive order barred entry for citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days and imposed a 120-day halt on all refugees, except refugees from Syria who are barred indefinitely. Curbing entry to the United States as a national security measure was a central premise of Trumps 2016 presidential campaign, originally proposed as a temporary ban on all Muslims. He has voiced frustration at the legal challenge to his order. Washington and Minnesota argued that Trumps order violated the U.S. Constitution by discriminating against Muslims. Trump during the presidential campaign called for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. In the 2015 case, Din, who lives in Fremont, California, sued the U.S. government after her husband, Afghan citizen Kanishka Berashk, was denied a visa in 2009. She objected to the governments visa denial under a law giving consular officials wide discretion to bar people linked to terrorist activities. The high courts ruling overturned a 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision that said Din was right to insist the government give her more information about the visa denial. Kennedys opinion suggested he could be willing to dig into the Trump administrations rationale for the order, said Mark Haddad, the Los Angeles-based lawyer who represented Din in the 2015 case.  The ostensible reason for the travel ban is security but thats not a good faith concern if the underlying reason is religious animus, Haddad said.  Kennedys opinion showed he is not prepared to give complete and total deference to the executive branch in the enforcement of immigration laws, Haddad added. Samuel Alito, one of the courts most conservative justices, signed onto Kennedys opinion. In total, six of the current eight justices suggested in that 2015 case that the government was not immune from scrutiny over immigration-related decisions if there was evidence of a questionable motive. The case brought by Washington and Minnesota, or one of several similar disputes around the country, could reach the high court quickly in the wake of Thursdays decision by a three-judge panel of the San Francisco-based 9th Circuit upholdinga Seattle district judges decision to block Trumps order. The Trump administration would need to win the support of five of the current eight justices to reinstate the order while litigation over the legality of the directive continues. It could also seek to end the litigation by issuing a new order.  Neil Gorsuch, Trumps nominee to fill a lingering vacancy, is awaiting Senate confirmation hearings and is unlikely to be seated on the court for at least two months. The 2015 case, called Kerry v. Din, was cited both by the challenging states and the Trump administration in their court fight. Washington states lawyers argued Kennedys opinion showed that courts must look at what motivated the governments decision beyond the words that appear in the order itself. They cited the previous comments by Trump and others expressing a desire to keep Muslims from entering the United States. The administration noted in court papers Kennedy also made it clear that the government is entitled to deference, especially on national security. Anil Kalhan, an immigration law professor at Drexel Universitys Kline School of Law in Philadelphia, said there are multiple ways of interpreting Kennedys opinion, which could muddy the waters.  Kennedys opinion doesnt necessarily mean he would reach the same conclusion on Trumps ban, Kalhan said. In Tuesdays 9th Circuit oral argument, administration lawyer August Flentje called the executive order facially legitimate, meaning there is no need for courts to inquire further into motive.

In a letter to CEO Lloyd Blankfein dated Feb. 9 and made public on Friday, Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren and Tammy Baldwin asked for details on lobbying activities in the bank related to review of the Dodd-Frank Act and the Obama-era fiduciary rule on financial advice.  Blankfein was also asked to detail the profits Goldman would make if these reforms came into effect. Weve had no involvement in the drafting of any executive orders, a Goldman spokesman said on Friday.  In December, Trump appointed Gary Cohn, former Goldman president and chief operating officer, to head the White House National Economic Council, a group that coordinates economic policy across agencies. Trump last week ordered reviews of major banking rules that were put in place after the 2008 financial crisis, drawing fire from Democrats who said his order lacked substance and squarely aligned him with Wall Street bankers. The executive orders released by President Trump on Friday last week raise our concerns about the degree to which Cohns advice to Trump is good for Wall Street, but bad for Americans, the senators wrote on Thursday. Goldman Sachs would be a major beneficiary of these efforts to deregulate the financial industry, they added in the letter. Trump also named former Goldman partner Steven Mnuchin as his pick for Treasury secretary in December. The senators have asked for any communication between the banks employees and Cohn, Mnuchin, nominee for the SEC chair Jay Clayton and chief strategist Steve Bannon.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": "" TOKYO/DETROIT (Reuters) - When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe meets on Friday with U.S. President Donald Trump, Japans bulging automotive trade surplus will be a sore spot, but the path to balancing auto exports and imports will be no easier than it was in the 1980s.  Trump may press Abe to do more to level the trade imbalance with Japan during a White House visit or a round of golf, but the two leaders are unlikely to change the fact that the big cars and trucks that America makes do not sell in Japan.  Many Japanese consumers, faced with congested cities, favor tiny domestically-made vehicles, called kei cars, which make up more than a third of the market. Priced from around 1.1 million yen, or about $9,800, these carshave engines most Americans would consider inadequate for a motorcycle.  Even Japans Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co cannot convince Japanese consumers to buy models that are popular in the United States. Small sport utility vehicles such as the Toyota RAV4 and Hondas CR-V are seen by Japanese consumers as too big.  Only about 13,000 vehicles from U.S. automakers sold in Japan in both 2016 and 2015, and of that about three-fourths were Jeep SUVs made by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. Ford Motor Co announced last month that it is pulling out of the Japanese market entirely, after selling just 2,400 vehicles there in 2016.  The Japanese auto market has shrunk not only in terms of vehicle size, but in sales volume. As a result, global automakers, including Japans, are focused on boosting sales in China, the United States and growing emerging markets.  It would take a painstaking fine-tuning of vehicle specs to suit American cars to those driving and other conditions and develop a strong distribution network to be able to gain traction in Japan. It is nothing short of a 20-year effort, said a Toyota executive who spoke on condition he not be named.  Jaguar Land Rover Japan Ltd Chief Executive Magnus Hansson said the low sales of U.S. cars in Japan did not mean it was a closed market, but rather reflected a total and absolute lack of effort over 50 years by Detroit.  Still, Japan remains an export hub for the big Japanese automakers. The U.S. Commerce Department this week reported that the U.S. trade deficit with Japan in 2016 was $68.9 billion, and of that total surplus, some $52.6 billion was in vehicles and automotive parts.  Japans automakers have more than 90 percent of the Japanese market. Last year U.S. automakers controlled only 45 percent of their home market, the worlds second-biggest after China.  A bigger factor than imports in the Detroit automakers loss of U.S. market share since 1980 is the surge in investment by Japans automakers in U.S. factories. Last year, 56 percent of the vehicles Toyota sold in the United States were made in America, the company said. Toyota said it employs more than 34,000 in the United States.  For years the growth of Japanese-owned auto factories in the U.S. heartland has helped cool trade tensions.  But Trump, a Republican, has turned up the heat by complaining about the trade surplus and accusing Japan of manipulating the value of the yen to disadvantage American-made goods.  On Thursday, a bipartisan group of senators from auto manufacturing states called on the new president to address currency manipulation and auto-related non-tariff barriers.  They are not alone in urging changes to help bolster U.S. business.  (Trump) must bring Abe up short on any cheery notion that business will continue as usual, said Kevin L. Kearns, head of the U.S. Business and Industry Council.  The group represents smaller U.S. manufacturers, many of which feed the U.S. auto industry.

In her first visit to Washington since Trump took power, Mogherini came to present the European Union as a valuable friend to the United States with common priorities. In a nod to Trumps preferred style of diplomacy, she said that the European Union could adopt a more formal transactional approach on some issues to appeal to the new administration. Mogherini, who met this week with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, Trumps advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner and members of Congress, said her main intention in Washington was to discuss the nuclear accord, which granted Iran sanctions relief in return for curbs on its nuclear program. Her visit suggests concern among European and other countries, including Russia and China, that the Trump administration may withdraw from the 2015 nuclear deal. There have been increasing concerns since the White House put Iran on notice for test-firing a ballistic missile. Days later, Washington tightened sanctions against Iran by imposing measures against 25 individuals and entities for the missile test.  I was reassured by what I heard in the meetings on the intention to stick to the full implementation of the agreement, Mogherini told reporters. Mogherini said she won assurances from members of the Trump administration that they believe Russia should abide by the terms of the 2015 Minsk agreement to end fighting in eastern Ukraine. Mogherini said she and Tillerson discussed how the Minsk agreement might be fully implemented. But Mogherini also signaled doubt about Trumps commitment to U.S. policy towards Russia. Republicans and Democrats in Congress have expressed concern that Trump will be too conciliatory towards Moscow, perhaps by granting Russia relief from sanctions on its energy, defense and finance industries. We agreed that as long as the Minsk agreements are not fully implemented, sanctions would remain in place, Mogherini said later on Friday at a Washington think tank. But I dont know if this is going to be the consolidated policy ... I was not in the Oval Office when President Trump called President (Vladimir) Putin. Mogherini avoided directly criticizing Trump, but said European history showed that blocking the movement of people is doomed to fail.  Trump has vowed to build a wall along the U.S. southern border to block illegal immigration from Mexico. He has also issued an executive order barring people from Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the United States for 90 days and all refugees for 120 days, except refugees from Syria, who are banned indefinitely.   We tend to celebrate when walls come down, Mogherini said. America has always been great because it has been made up of many people coming from different places.

As head of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Price has the authority to rewrite rules implementing the 2010 Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. He could move quickly to rework the regulations while waiting for Republicans in Congress to keep their pledge to scrap the law entirely. The Republican president signed an order on Jan. 20, his first day in office, to freeze regulations and take other steps to weaken the law enacted by former Democratic President Barack Obama, a directive that will fall largely on Price. But Trump  said in a recent Fox News interview that a replacement for the law may not come until next year.    Trump said on Friday the effort was a difficult process but could now get going with Price in place. Now we get down to the final strokes, he told reporters at a separate news conference at the White House alongside visiting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. He did not offer more details but said the country would end up with tremendous healthcare at a lower price.         Republicans, who have long viewed Obamacare as federal overreach and who have the majority in Congress, are trying to craft a replacement but have not agreed on one. Twenty million Americans gained health insurance under the law. Having Dr. Tom Price at the helm of HHS gives us a committed ally in our work to repeal and replace Obamacare, said U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, who has vowed to pass a new plan this year.  Price, a member of the House since 2005 who chaired the budget committee, offered legislation in 2015 to repeal Obamacare and replace it with age-adjusted tax credits for the purchase of health insurance. While Prices fellow Republicans have controlled the House since 2011, they did not advance his bill and it was not considered by the full chamber. The Senate voted 52-47 earlier on Friday to approve Price, a former orthopedic surgeon, to oversee the HHS, which has an annual budget of more than $1 trillion.     Prices nomination was dogged by questions about his trading in hundreds of thousands of dollars in health company stocks while working on healthcare legislation. Democrats accused him of making misleading statements. Price defended his actions. Democrats also criticized Price for his opposition to Obamacare, his ideas about restructuring the Medicare program for the elderly and disabled, and his opposition to Planned Parenthood, an organization that provides abortions and other affordable healthcare and education services. With Price confirmed, the Senate is expected to vote on Monday on Trumps U.S. Treasury secretary designate, Steven Mnuchin. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

LaBeouf and two artists had set up a live-streaming camera outside the Museum of the Moving Image in Queens on Jan. 20, the day that Trump was inaugurated, and encouraged members of the public to repeat he will not divide us into the camera. The exhibit was intended to continue through Trumps four-year term. LaBeouf was arrested on Jan. 26 after getting into an altercation with a 25-year-old man at the museum, according to police. The actor allegedly pulled the mans scarf, scratched his face and shoved him, police said. In a statement on Friday, the museum said the camera had created a serious and ongoing public safety hazard. While the installation began constructively, it deteriorated markedly after one of the artists was arrested on the site of the installation and ultimately necessitated this action, the museum said. Over the course of the installation, there have been dozens of threats of violence and numerous arrests, such that police felt compelled to be stationed outside the installation 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

A congressional committee said on Thursday it was seeking a review into whether senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway had violated ethics rules by using her position to promote product lines of President Donald Trumps daughter Ivanka, a day after he attacked a retailer for dropping them. Federal ethics rules prohibit executive branch employees from using their positions to endorse products or for the private gain of friends. The law does not apply to the president.    Go buy Ivankas stuff ... Im going to go get some myself today, Conway told Fox News in an interview from the White House. Im going to give a free commercial here: Go buy it today, everybody. Republican Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House of Representatives Oversight committee, said late on Thursday in a statement he had agreed to a request by a member of the panel to ask the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) to review Conways comments and recommend disciplinary action against her if warranted. Chaffetz and Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the committee, said in their letter to the ethics office: Conways statements appear to violate federal ethics regulations, which prohibit actions that imply a government endorsement of the personal activities of another person.  In this case, there is an additional challenge, which is that the president, as the ultimate disciplinary authority for White House employees, has an inherent conflict of interest since Conways statements relate to his daughters private business, they said. The OGE did not respond to requests for comment.        Asked at a press briefing on Thursday if Conway had crossed an ethical line, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said, She has been counseled on that subject, and thats it. Conway, asked in an interview on Fox News on Thursday evening how she had been counseled, replied: Im not going to comment on that.       She said she was aware of the letter from Chaffetz and Cummings and that it was being reviewed internally. Im just really happy that I spent an awful lot of time with the president of the United States this afternoon and that he supports me 100 percent, she added. The non-profit Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and Public Citizen have both filed complaints with the OGE and the White House Counsels Office. Its a violation of the rule, Norman Eisen, who served as an ethics adviser to Democratic President Barack Obama, told MSNBC. Its a serious matter. On Wednesday, President Trump attacked department store chain Nordstrom Inc for dropping his daughters products, drawing intense criticism for using a White House twitter platform to intervene in a commercial matter involving his familys business ties.  Nordstrom said it dropped the brand for its poor performance. Online sales of Ivanka Trump branded products fell 26 percent in January 2017 compared with the same period a year earlier, according to retail analytics firm Slice Intelligence which shared its findings with Reuters. The company analyzed data from email receipts of over 4 million U.S. online shoppers. The data also showed sales of the Ivanka Trump brand declined in the second half of 2016 at all online retailers including Amazon.com Inc, which sells most of the brands merchandise. In-store sales of the Ivanka Trump brand was not available.  Ivanka Trump had said she would step away from her company when her father took office in the White House.  Retailers that have dropped Ivanka Trump products include Neiman Marcus [NMRCUS.UL]. HSN Inc has stopped selling Trump Home products, but still sells Trump presidential memorabilia. An ongoing campaign called #GrabYourWallet encourages shoppers to boycott products with ties to President Trump and his family. Supporters have launched an alternative social media campaign called #BuyIvanka. President Trump has pledged to ensure that products sold in America are actually manufactured on U.S. soil, but a New York Times report in December found that many of Ivanka Trump branded products were made in China, Indonesia and Vietnam.

President Donald Trump blasted department store chain Nordstrom Inc on Wednesday for dropping his daughter Ivankas clothing line, prompting critics to accuse him of misusing  public office to benefit his familys sprawling business empire. After Trumps highly unusual move to use a White House platform to intervene in a commercial matter involving his daughter, Nordstrom reiterated that its action last week was based on declining sales of the Ivanka Trump products. But White House spokesman Sean Spicer characterized the move as a direct attack on the presidents policies. My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person - always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible! Trump wrote on Wednesday on both his personal and official presidential Twitter accounts. Ethics officials who served past Republican and Democratic administrations said Trumps tweet was both unprecedented for a president and troublesome. This is misuse of public office for private gains, Richard Painter, who served as Republican President George W. Bushs chief ethics lawyer, said in an email to Reuters. And it is abuse of power because the official message is clear - Nordstrom is persona non grata with the administration. Norman Eisen, an ethics adviser to Democratic President Barack Obama, noted that several states have unfair competition laws, including California where Nordstrom operates many stores. The tweet, he said, could spark lawsuits if the companys brand was being injured by an unfair attack. The wealthy New York real estate developer who became president on Jan. 20 has declined to sell off his businesses despite demands from critics that he do so to avoid thorny conflicts of interest. Trump on Jan. 11 said he would maintain ownership of his global business empire but hand off control to his two oldest sons during his presidency. Trumps web of international companies remains a bit opaque since he has refused to release his tax returns, which experts have said would provide a clearer view of his business interests. Ethics experts have said Trumps arrangement does little to address potential conflicts because he would still know what assets he owned, such as Trump-branded golf courses and hotels, and his family would continue to profit from them. Ivanka Trump ran a clothing and jewelry business bearing her name, in addition to other work for the Trump Organization,  before saying she would resign when her father was sworn in as president. Her fathers various contentious actions and comments have prompted boycott efforts by critics and have driven some consumers away from Trump family businesses. During a White House press briefing, Spicer painted Nordstroms action as an attack on the presidents daughter. For someone to take out their concern with his policies on a family member of his is just not acceptable. And the president has every right as a father to stand up to them, Spicer said. A spokeswoman for the Ivanka Trump brand declined to comment. On Tuesday, First lady Melania Trump filed a $150 million defamation lawsuit accusing the Daily Mail British tabloid of damaging her brand by falsely reporting she had worked as an escort. The lawsuit said the article ruined a unique, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the first lady but her lawyer said she has no intention of using her position for profit. Democrats pounced on Trump for the tweet. I think its inappropriate, but hes a totally inappropriate president, said Nancy Pelosi, the top U.S. House of Representatives Democrat. Senator Bob Casey, a Democrat, in a tweet indicated the matter should be referred to the federal Office of Government Ethics. Nordstrom said it informed Ivanka Trump about its decision in early January. Over the past year, and particularly in the last half of 2016, sales of the brand have steadily declined to the point where it didnt make good business sense for us to continue with the line for now, the retailer told Reuters. Nordstrom shares initially fell after the presidents criticism, but closed up 4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange. Retailers still selling Ivanka Trump products include Macys Inc, TJX Cos, Hudsons Bay Co, which runs high-end chains like Lord & Taylor, and Dillards Inc. Retailers that have dropped Ivanka Trump include Neiman Marcus [NMRCUS.UL]. HSN Inc has stopped selling Trump Home products, but still sells Trump presidential memorabilia. The move by some retailers to drop her products comes amid an ongoing campaign called #GrabYourWallet, which encourages shoppers to boycott products with ties to President Trump, his family and his donors. Usage of the hashtag on Twitter rose dramatically on Wednesday.  President Trump said he is going to have nothing to do with his family businesses, said Robert Weissman, president of liberal watchdog group Public Citizen. His reaction to developments with his daughters business line suggests that claim is untrue. Trumps tweet left fellow Republicans in an uncomfortable position. Republican Senator David Perdue of Georgia told Reuters of Trumps tweet, That sounds like a personal matter to me. Perdue added, He is a citizen and he is a citizen who is now president of the United States. Republican Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, asked whether the president should be criticizing a publicly traded company over its business dealings with Trumps daughter, said, I dont know the answer to that question. Let me think about what the answer is. Since winning the presidential election on Nov. 8, Trump has castigated specific companies on Twitter but this was his first tweet involving a business tied to his family since the victory.

Williams, a Democrat, had already been expected to face several challengers in the May primary election for the top law enforcement position in the fifth-most-populous U.S. city. Last month, Williams agreed to pay $62,000 in civil penalties to end an investigation by the Philadelphia ethics board into his failure to disclose gifts including NBA basketball tickets, cash and lodging. The ethics board said it was the largest amount in penalties it had imposed in its 10-year history.

As regards Ljubljana, Slovenia in general, it is of course a brilliant place to have a dialogue of such a sort. But it doesnt depend only on us, it depends on a whole series of circumstances, Putin told reporters after meeting Pahor in Moscow. If these meetings ever happen, we dont have anything against Ljubljana, Putin said. European Union member state Slovenia was the venue for the first meeting between George W. Bush and Putin in 2001 where the then American leader made what became a famous comment about looking Putin in the eye and getting a sense of his soul.  It is also where Melania Trump, the U.S. presidents wife, grew up. The Kremlin sees Slovenia as an ally in its quest to end Western sanctions over the Ukraine conflict.  Russia was a big export market for Slovenian food products before the Ukraine crisis, and Slovenia remains keen to be a transit country for Russian gas supplies to southern Europe.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - With golf long regarded as a stern measure of character and a natural setting for deal-making, U.S. President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abes weekend outing in Florida could be viewed as more than a leisurely bonding exercise between two world leaders. U.S. President Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Abe will form a twosome for their round of golf on Saturday, presumably at the Trump International Golf Club near his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach. Details are still under wraps.  Trump told a local sports radio station last weekend golf was a better way to get to know someone than lunch and saw his match-up with Abe as a fun meeting between partners rather than adversaries.  Abe might feel the occasion carries more weight. His prime minister grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, and U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower played near Washington in 1957, a round newspapers described as a triumph of diplomacy between former World War Two enemies. Abe teed off the latest round of golf diplomacy in November, giving Trump an expensive, gold-colored driver during their meeting at Trump Tower in Manhattan, where he sought assurances about the future strength of the decades-old alliance between the two nations. With anxiety over Trumps tough talk on currency, security and trade with Japan, some in Tokyo have expressed concern Abe might be too generous in any haggling on the fairways when pitted against the real estate mogul and author of The Art of the Deal. In purely a golfing sense, Abe is likely to find Trump a formidable opponent. He is pretty remarkable for a 70-year-old guy, Jaime Diaz, editor-in-chief of Golf World and a senior writer for Golf Digest, told Reuters. As I understand it, his handicap is 2.8. That seems a little low but I think he is very capable of playing to a five or six handicap. He is a legitimate good player. Its not a trumped-up claim that he is somebody who shoots in the 70s. Trump says he has won 18 club trophies and said such a winning pedigree made him the ideal man to run the country during the election race. See how beautiful my hands are, look at those hands. Those are powerful hands, Trump said at a Detroit rally last year during the Republican primaries. (They can) hit a golf ball 285 yards. Retired boxer Oscar De La Hoya questioned Trumps trustworthiness on the golf course while speaking to reporters in Las Vegas in May 2016 during the build-up to the WBC middleweight title clash between Canelo Alvarez and Amir Khan, according to the AP. Hollywood actor Samuel L. Jackson did the same in an interview he did with United Airlines Rhapsody magazine in January 2016. Reuters could not independently confirm these accounts. After the Jackson interview, Trump issued a tweet that said in part: I dont cheat at golf. The White House did not return a request for comment on the cheating allegations.  Diaz who has twice played with Trump, at Trump National Golf Club Charlotte in North Carolina in 2013 and more recently at the Doral resort in Florida, described the President as someone who would not need to resort to cheating to beat most players. I know he has won all these club championships at golf courses that he owns and a lot of people are suspect about that. But he would be a tough guy to beat with a five handicap, the golf writer said. He addresses the ball with good body language ... confident and flowing and fluid. He just looks like he is going to hit a good shot. It is far harder to find allegations of cheating or boastfulness directed at the more circumspect Abe, who is a member of the ultra-exclusive Three Hundred Club in Kanagawa Prefecture, south-west of Tokyo. The club, confined to only 300 members, charges some 70-80 million yen ($625,000-$715,000) for membership fees and 50,000 yen for green fees. The 62-year-old Abe takes the game very seriously and local media have reported that rounds with his wife can get tense if he is playing poorly. When he is playing golf, he concentrates. So everyone else becomes intense as well, a company president who plays Abe once or twice a year, told Reuters on condition of anonymity. He was unsure of Abes handicap but confirmed reports that the Prime Minister usually shoots between 90 and 100 over 18 holes, which would place him squarely in the field of average weekend hackers. A straight driver with a stable game all round, Abe is generally smartly turned out, sometimes in short pants and knee socks and always with a baseball cap on his head. I was impressed that Abe holds the flag on the green, while other players are putting, the source said. People in a high position like him do not have to do that for others. He is very polite. The conservative politician is not so reserved as to shun refreshments at the 19th hole back at the clubhouse, however, where he might indulge in a couple of glasses of beer or red wine after a bath to freshen up, added the source.

Trump and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani also spoke about opportunities to strengthen ties, counterterrorism cooperation and economic development, the White House said in a statement. It said Trump also emphasized the continuing importance of the U.S.-Afghanistan Strategic Partnership and his support for Ghanis government, which is faced with an emboldened Taliban-led insurgency that is still gaining ground after more than 15 years of war. The Afghan Embassy in Washington said Trump and Ghani had spoken on Dec. 3, but Thursdays call was their first since Trumps inauguration on Jan. 20. Hours before the call, General John Nicholson, the commander of U.S. and international troops in Afghanistan, told the Senate Armed Services Committee in Washington he did not have enough troops to adequately advise Afghan forces on the ground. Nicholson said he had enough U.S. troops to carry out counterterrorism operations against the Taliban, al Qaeda and other insurgents but also acknowledged gains made by the Taliban over the past year. We have a shortfall of a few thousand, Nicholson said. Trump has so far offered little clarity about whether he might approve more forces for Afghanistan. About 8,400 U.S. troops remain in Afghanistan, well down from their peak of about 100,000 in 2011. Nicholson said extra forces need not all come from the United States and could also be drawn from other allies. The focus of the NATO-led mission in Afghanistan has narrowed considerably to training Afghan forces and conducting counterterrorism missions since a significant drawdown began under Democratic former U.S. President Barack Obama. Obama was often criticized by Republicans in Congress for focusing too much on driving down U.S. troop numbers in an attempt to force Afghan soldiers to become more self-sufficient. Nicholson said U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis would speak with allies soon and suggested Mattis might also visit Afghanistan, which might help him prepare his own recommendations for Republican Trump. He also spoke of security in Afghanistan in terms of the often-difficult U.S. relationship with Pakistan, long seen as a haven for insurgents from the Taliban, the Haqqani network and other militant Islamist groups. Our complex relationship with Pakistan is best assessed through a holistic review, Nicholson said. Addressing U.S. concerns about Pakistan was at the top of his list of priorities with the Trump administration, he said. The Afghan Embassy in Washington said Trump and Ghani had also discussed regional security issues, as well as the joint fight against terrorism and countries that sponsor it. It also said Trump said he planned to meet Ghani soon. (This story has been refiled to say Afghan embassy, not U.S., in paragraph 4) ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The reports estimated price-tag is much higher than a $12-billion figure cited by Trump in his campaign and estimates as high as $15 billion from Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.  MORE TOP NEWS: Twitter numbers paint grim profitability picture Trump changes tack, backs 'one China' policy in call with Xi The report is expected to be presented to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary John Kelly in coming days, although the administration will not necessarily take actions it recommends.  The plan lays out what it would take to seal the border in three phases of construction of fences and walls covering just over 1,250 miles (2,000 km) by the end of 2020.  With 654 miles (1,046 km) of the border already fortified, the new construction would extend almost the length of the entire border.  Many cost estimates and timelines have been floated since Trump campaigned on the promise of building a wall. The report seen by Reuters is the work of a group commissioned by Kelly as a final step before moving forward with requesting U.S. taxpayer funds from Congress and getting started on construction.  A DHS spokeswoman said the department does not comment on or confirm the potential existence of pre-decisional, deliberative documents.  A White House spokeswoman said it would be premature to comment on a report that has not officially been presented to the president.  DONT MISS: Japan's love of tiny cars sore spot as for Trump Exclusive: In call with Putin, Trump denounced Obama-era nuclear arms treaty The report said the first phase would be the smallest, targeting sections covering 26 miles (42 km) near San Diego, California; El Paso, Texas; and in Texass Rio Grande Valley.  The report assumes DHS would get funding from Congress by April or May, giving the department sufficient time to secure contractors and begin construction by September. Trump has said Congress should fund the wall upfront, but that Mexico will reimburse U.S. taxpayers. Mexico has said it will not pay.  Several U.S. congressional delegations are visiting the border this month to assess funding needs, according to several people familiar with the travel plans.  The report shows the U.S. government has begun seeking waivers to address environmental laws on building in some areas. It also shows the government has begun working with existing contractors and planning steel purchases for the project.  Trump told law enforcement officials on Wednesday, The wall is getting designed right now.  The report accounted for the time and cost of acquiring private land, one reason for its steep price increase compared to estimates from Trump and members of Congress.  Bernstein Research, an investment research group that tracks material costs, has said that uncertainties around the project could drive its cost up to as much as $25 billion.  The second phase of construction proposed in the report would cover 151 miles (242 km) of border in and around the Rio Grande Valley; Laredo, Texas; Tucson, Arizona; El Paso, Texas and Big Bend, Texas. The third phase would cover an unspecified 1,080 miles (1,728 km), essentially sealing off the entire U.S.-Mexico border.  The report lays out costs to cover the border with barriers, but funding constraints and legal battles are likely to place limits on those plans.  It also does not account for major physical barriers, like mountains, in areas where it would not be feasible to build.  A source familiar with the plans said DHS may have to go to court to seek eminent domain in order to acquire some of the private land needed to cover the final and most ambitious phase.  The first phase, estimated to cost only $360 million, could be a relatively easy way for Trump to satisfy supporters eager to see him make good on his campaign promises to limit illegal migration. But the rest of the construction will be markedly more expensive, covering a much larger stretch of land, much of it privately owned or inaccessible by road.  In addition to seeking eminent domain and environmental waivers, the U.S. government would also have to meet the requirements of the International Boundary and Water Commission, a U.S.-Mexico pact over shared waters. The report estimated that agreement alone could bring the cost from $11 million per mile to $15 million per mile in one area.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump castigated a Democratic senator on Thursday for saying U.S. Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch had voiced dismay in a private meeting over Trumps attacks on the judiciary, while Republicans came forward to back up the lawmakers portrayal. The Republican president has publicly vented his frustration with a court order last week that temporarily halted his travel ban on people from seven Muslim-majority countries, criticizing the judge who issued the order, the appeals process and the wider judiciary. That has morphed into a dispute over comments made by his pick for the Supreme Court. Senator Richard Blumenthal said on Wednesday that Gorsuch had told him that Trumps comments about the judiciary, which have included calling the judge who blocked his travel ban a so-called judge, were disheartening and demoralizing. On Thursday, Blumenthal urged Gorsuch to condemn Trumps attacks publicly, unequivocally and clearly. Trump, in a Twitter post and in a later meeting with a bipartisan group of senators, accused Blumenthal of misrepresenting Gorsuchs comments. White House spokesman Sean Spicer, at a briefing with reporters, defended Trump and said Gorsuch had not been commenting specifically about the presidents attacks on the judiciary. Blumenthals account of Gorsuchs comments was backed up by Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist and spokesman for the nominee, and by Kelly Ayotte, a Republican former senator who has accompanied the judge during meetings with lawmakers to build support for his Senate confirmation. Other senators, including Republican Ben Sasse and Democrat Chuck Schumer, also said Gorsuch made similar comments to them. In blasting Blumenthal, Trump sought to revive a years-old controversy over the senators military service during the Vietnam War era. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who never fought in Vietnam when he said for years he had (major lie), now misrepresents what Judge Gorsuch told him? Trump wrote in a Twitter post. Trump nominated Gorsuch, a conservative federal appeals court judge, on Jan. 31 as his nominee to fill the Supreme Court vacancy left when Justice Antonin Scalia died a year ago. Democrats have said they will push to establish that Gorsuch can exercise independence if he is confirmed to the lifetime position on the countrys highest court. Blumenthal said there were numerous White House staffers in the room when Gorsuch made the comments. Ayotte said in a statement that Gorsuch, speaking in discussions with senators including Blumenthal, had said he finds any criticism of a judges integrity and independence disheartening and demoralizing, while making clear he was not referring to any specific case. Gorsuch has not made any public comment on the matter. Sasse, who has been critical of Trumps attacks on the judiciary, described his meeting with Gorsuch.  I asked him about the so-called judges comment because we dont have so-called judges or so-called presidents or so-called senators, Sasse said on MSNBC. He added that Gorsuch welled up with some energy and said any attack on his brothers or sisters of the robe is an attack on all judges. Spicer said the president had no regrets about his comments on the judiciary and that his behavior would not change.  The president is going to speak his mind, he said.     A federal judge in Seattle, James Robart, last Friday put on hold Trumps Jan. 27 executive order that temporarily barred entry to the United States by people from seven Muslim-majority countries and by all refugees. An appeals court is considering Robarts order and is expected to rule in the coming days. On Saturday, Trump called Robart a so-called judge whose ridiculous ruling essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country. On Wednesday, he stepped up his criticism of the judiciary, calling courts so political and describing the  proceedings in the appeals court as disgraceful. Democrats have called Trumps comments an attack on a core principle of American democracy by which the judiciary is independent and upholds the rule of law. Republican senators, who have the majority in the Senate,  painted Gorsuchs comments as evidence of his independence from the president. But Schumer, leader of the Senate Democrats, said the judges comments were mild at best and insufficient in terms of showing independence.  I think President Trump is going to harm both Judge Gorsuchs chances at confirmation and his standing as president if he continues to undermine the independence of the judiciary,  Democratic Senator Chris Coons told CNN on Thursday. Trumps spat with Blumenthal overshadowed a meeting with senators that was aimed at trying to build support for Gorsuch. If confirmed, the judge would restore a conservative majority on the Supreme Court. Ask Senator Blumenthal about his Vietnam record, Trump told reporters at the meeting. In 2010, while running for the Senate, Blumenthal said he had misspoken about my service by earlier stating he had served in Vietnam when he in fact got military deferments before joining the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve in 1970, allowing him to avoid combat overseas. Blumenthal expressed regret over his previous comments but said he would proud of his service as a reservist. Trump himself received five deferments during the Vietnam War, including one for bone spurs in his heel, the New York Times reported last August, and never served in the military.

I hear were spending billions and billions of dollars, its a system thats totally out of whack, Trump said during a picture-taking session at the White House ahead of his sitdown with airline and airport executives. His comments heartened advocates of privatization who have long sought to move away from the system they see as outdated.  We want to get the government out of the role of managing the air traffic control system, Gary Kelly, Southwest Airlines Cos chief executive officer, told Trump during the picture-taking session.  The Federal Aviation Administration spends nearly $10 billion a year on air traffic control funded largely through passenger user fees, and has about 28,000 air traffic control personnel. Trump said he had been informed that ongoing modernization efforts to the air traffic control system were already obsolete by the pilot of his private jet.

The FAA has spent nearly $3 billion since 2007 to implement an updated system, NextGen, which would utilize satellites to monitor aircraft instead of radar and make other changes.     NextGen is one of the most ambitious infrastructure and modernization projects in U.S. history, the agency said in a statement. The FAA invited airline stakeholders to help develop the blueprint for NextGen and they continue to have a seat at the table in setting NextGen priorities and investments through the NextGen Advisory Committee. The Government Accountability Office said in a 2016 report that the United States is generally considered to have the busiest, most complex and safest ATC system in the world. (bit.ly/1Q9oiOF) The chief executives of United Airlines Inc, Delta Air Lines Inc, Southwest and JetBlue Airways Corp were among those who attended the meeting. After the meeting, Airports Council International-North America President and CEO Kevin Burke told reporters on a conference call that airport officials had urged Trump to lift the cap on airport passenger fees to address airport infrastructure needs.  Trump proposed during his campaign to spend $1 trillion over a decade to upgrade the countrys infrastructure. Trump also told the executives he recognized that U.S. airlines were facing pressure from foreign carriers. Heads of the three largest U.S. passenger carriers - American Airlines Group Inc, United and Delta - have urged the Trump administration to denounce the U.S. Open Skies agreements with the three major Middle Eastern carriers, which they accuse of having been unfairly subsidized by their governments.     The three airlines, Qatar, Etihad and Emirates [EMIRA.UL], have denied that their governments unfairly subsidize them. The Gulf airlines operate around 200 flights per week to 12 U.S. cities. I know youre under pressure from a lot of foreign elements and foreign carriers, Trump said, adding that he wants foreign carriers also to do well. They come with big investments, in many cases those investments come from their governments, but they are still big investments, he said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

While cautioning that the appointment was not final, the U.S. officials said Feinberg, if named to the role, would look for ways to streamline 17 separate agencies, a roughly $70 billion annual budget and tens of thousands of employees. Trumps advisers have expressed particular interest in reforming the role of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which was created after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to coordinate the work of U.S. spy agencies. The White House declined comment on Feinbergs potential role. Cerberus declined to comment. Cerberus said last week that Feinberg was in talks to join Trumps administration in a senior role, without specifying what that role could be. The firm told its investors that it had a succession plan in place that would result in  minimal changes to management and operations.  Potential conflicts of interest would also have to be resolved before Feinberg could join the administration. In a letter to investors last week, Cerberus said clearing that hurdle would require Feinberg to provide voluminous information and disclosures to the Office of Government Ethics. Feinberg, 56, who donated to Trumps 2016 election campaign and served as an economic adviser to him, has no prior experience in government. A Princeton graduate, Feinberg was one of the co-founders of Cerberus in 1992. He previously worked at bond trader Drexel Burnham Lambert. Forbes Magazine currently pegs 56-year-old Feinbergs net worth at $1.25 billion. Feinberg rarely gives interviews and has shunned public appearances.  Cerberus has investments in a wide range of brands and industries from guns and waste management to cosmetics and amusement parks. The firm became well known for a $7.4-billion deal it struck in 2007, along with co-investors, to buy an 80 percent stake in car maker Chrysler and its financing arm Chrysler Financial. Chrysler was pushed to the brink of liquidation in 2009 before a bailout that was the subject of intense debate within the administration of former U.S. President Barack Obama. Cerberus lost control of the automaker during its restructuring. In 2010, Cerberus bought DynCorp, a defense contractor, for $1 billion. The company has had contracts to train Iraqi police and support U.S. troops in Afghanistan. It has business relationships with the U.S. military and other government agencies. Two other Wall Street figures who had been expected to work for Trump have had to bow out because of conflicts with their business activities. They are Anthony Scaramucci, who had been tapped as White House liaison to businesses, and Vincent Viola, Trumps nominee for Army secretary. Several former U.S. intelligence officials acknowledged the potential for a review of spy agencies role, structure and inefficiencies. But they expressed concern that the study would  be run out of the White House, rather than under the aegis of the Director of National Intelligence, which was established with that oversight mandate. Trump has nominated former Senator Dan Coats to be director of national intelligence and said the post would be part of the Cabinet. Coats is awaiting Senate confirmation. Trump has had a fraught relationship with U.S. intelligence agencies. For weeks, he rejected their conclusion that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered cyber operatives to interfere in the election to help Trumps chances against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, before appearing to accept it.

When Putin raised the possibility of extending the 2010 treaty, known as New START, Trump paused to ask his aides in an aside what the treaty was, these sources said.  MORE TOP STORIES Japan's love of tiny cars a sore spot for Trump Trump changes tack, backs 'one China' policy Trump then told Putin the treaty was one of several bad deals negotiated by the Obama administration, saying that New START favored Russia. Trump also talked about his own popularity, the sources said.  The White House declined to comment on the details of the call. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Trump knew what the New START treaty is but had turned to his aides for an opinion during the call with Putin. He said the notes from the call would not have conveyed that.  I would say they had a very productive call, Spicer told reporters. He added, It wasnt like he didnt know what was being said. He wanted an opinion on something.  It has not been previously reported that Trump had conveyed his doubt about New START to Putin in the hour-long call.  New START gives both countries until February 2018 to reduce their deployed strategic nuclear warheads to no more than 1,550, the lowest level in decades. It also limits deployed land- and submarine-based missiles and nuclear-capable bombers.  During a debate in the 2016 presidential election, Trump said Russia had outsmarted the United States with the treaty, which he called START-Up. He asserted incorrectly then that it had allowed Russia to continue to produce nuclear warheads while the United States could not.  DONT MISS UAW confirms workers at Tesla have approached the union Trump's Mexican wall just got $9.6 billion more expensive Two Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, senators Jeanne Shaheen and Edward J. Markey, criticized Trump for deriding what they called a key nuclear arms control accord.  Its impossible to overstate the negligence of the president of the United States not knowing basic facts about nuclear policy and arms control, Shaheen said in a statement. New START has unquestionably made our country safer, an opinion widely shared by national security experts on both sides of the aisle.  Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association, a Washington-based advocacy group, said: Unfortunately, Mr. Trump appears to be clueless about the value of this key nuclear risk reduction treaty and the unique dangers of nuclear weapons.  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said he supported the treaty during his Senate confirmation hearings.  During the hearings Tillerson said it was important for the United States to stay engaged with Russia, hold them accountable to commitments made under the New START and also ensure our accountability as well.  Two of the people who described the conversation were briefed by current administration officials who read detailed notes taken during the call. One of the two was shown portions of the notes. A third source was also briefed on the call.  Reuters has not reviewed the notes taken of the call, which are classified.  The Kremlin did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  The phone call with Putin has added to concerns that Trump is not adequately prepared for discussions with foreign leaders.  Typically, before a telephone call with a foreign leader, a president receives a written in-depth briefing paper drafted by National Security Council staff after consultations with the relevant agencies, including the State Department, Pentagon and intelligence agencies, two former senior officials said.  Just before the call, the president also usually receives an oral pre-briefing from his national security adviser and top subject-matter aide, they said.  Trump did not receive a briefing from Russia experts with the NSC and intelligence agencies before the Putin call, two of the sources said. Reuters was unable to determine if Trump received a briefing from his national security adviser Michael Flynn.  In the phone call, the Russian leader raised the possibility of reviving talks on a range of disputes and suggested extending New START, the sources said.  New START can be extended for another five years, beyond 2021, by mutual agreement. Unless they agree to do that or negotiate new cuts, the worlds two biggest nuclear powers would be freed from the treatys limits, potentially setting the stage for a new arms race.  New START was ratified by the U.S. Senate in December 2010 by a vote of 71 to 26. Thirteen Republican senators joined all of the Senates Democrats in voting for the treaty, although Republican opponents derided it as naive.  The call with Putin was one of several with foreign leaders where Trump has turned to denounce deals negotiated by previous administrations on trade, acceptance of refugees and arms control.  In a phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, Trump questioned an agreement reached by the Obama administration to accept 1,250 refugees now being held by Australia in offshore detention centers.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON/JERUSALEM (Reuters) - During his 2016 election campaign, Donald Trump signaled his presidency would be a boon for Israel and tough on Palestinians. The U.S. Embassy would move to Jerusalem, he would name an ambassador who backs Israeli settlements on land Palestinians seek for a state and there would be no pressure for peace talks. But as Trump prepares for his first White House meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his administration has not only toned down its pro-Israel bravado but also taken the first tentative steps toward a more cautious Middle East diplomacy, including consultations with Sunni Arab allies and U.S. lawmakers, according to people familiar with the matter. While any strategy is still far from complete, there is growing consensus in the White House that tackling the Israeli-Palestinian conflict could require gentle nudging of Israel together with assurances to the Arab world that Trump will be more even-handed than his campaign rhetoric suggested. This is a case where campaign promises run head-on into geopolitical reality and they have to be adjusted accordingly, said a U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity. As a result, relocating the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem  a step world leaders including Jordans King Abdullah warned against and which would probably inflame the Muslim world - has been put on hold for now.  At the same time, the White House has adopted a more measured stance on Israeli settlement-building in occupied territory than candidate Trump appeared to advocate. Even so, there is little doubt that when Netanyahu meets Trump on Wednesday, he will find a Republican president determined to show more warmth to Israel than his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, with whom he had an acrimonious relationship. Social media exchanges have suggested a budding bromance between Netanyahu and Trump, who has pledged to be the best friend Israel has ever had in the White House. As a result, Palestinians fear their leaders will be frozen out and their statehood aspirations pushed aside. One White House aide cautioned that the administration is still in listening mode on the issue. Since taking office on Jan. 20, Trump has spoken by phone to Egyptian, Saudi and United Arab Emirates leaders and heard Abdullahs concerns in person. All of these countries have growing contacts with Israel, mostly behind the scenes and centered on a shared desire to counter Iran, a point that Netanyahu has often cited as among the grounds for his countrys eventual thaw with the Arab world. Signaling an emerging view that U.S. Arab allies could be helpful on the Israeli-Palestinian issue, Trumps son-in-law, Jared Kushner, assigned to a senior role in Middle East diplomacy, has met Arab officials, including the UAEs ambassador to Washington, the New York Times reported. In his talks with Trump, Netanyahu is expected to try to keep the focus on forging a common front against Iran, Israels regional enemy and a target of Trumps ire. The Israeli-Palestinian dispute will nonetheless be on the agenda, especially after Israels parliament drew international condemnation for approving a law retroactively legalizing 4,000 settler homes built on privately owned Palestinian land. Barring a curve ball from the sometimes unpredictable U.S. president, Trump is unlikely to use the talks to press Netanyahu for concessions toward the Palestinians in the way Obama did. But neither can Trump afford to be seen to abandon the U.S. commitment to a two-state solution, the bedrock of Washingtons Middle East policy since the 1993 interim peace accords and a principle embraced internationally. A White House statement on Feb. 2 set forth a more nuanced position, backing away from a longstanding U.S. view of settlements as an impediment to peace but instead saying new settlements or the expansion of existing ones beyond current boundaries may not be helpful to that goal. That shift transpired just hours after Trump met briefly with King Abdullah on the sidelines of an event in Washington. Even so, the emerging shape of Trump policy remains more accommodating toward Israel than at any time since Republican George W. Bush occupied the White House. It seems we are headed for a new policy with this administration that is different from its predecessor in how it deals with the Palestinian leadership and the Palestinian cause, said Wasel Abu Youssef, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organizations executive committee.  There has been no contact between the Palestinian leadership and the Trump administration so far, Palestinian officials said. Moderate, Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas was among the first world leaders Obama called on his first full day in office in 2009. A White House official insisted, however, that the administration intends to develop a relationship with the Palestinian Authority. All the same, many Israeli officials do not read the White Houses settlements statement as a warning to Israel or a reining-in of Netanyahu. Not only does it conclude that settlements do not block peace prospects, it also says construction within established settlements is acceptable to Washington. Bibi will be happy, said an Israeli diplomat, using Netanyahus nickname. He can put new settlements on hold and hold off the right wing by pointing to Trump. At the same time, he can build as much as he wants within existing settlements. In that regard, the lines drawn by the White House help Netanyahu fend off demands from the far right in his coalition for sweeping steps, like annexing portions of the West Bank. Palestinians would be especially alarmed if Trump decided to proceed with moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, essentially recognizing the city as Israels capital despite international insistence that its status must be decided in negotiations. The Palestinians want East Jerusalem, captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed in a move not recognized internationally, as the capital of their future state. Trump and his aides have played down the prospects for a quick embassy move since he took office. Some experts see a moderating influence in Trumps national security team. It has members such as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, a former Exxon Mobil chief executive with extensive contacts among Gulf Arab governments, and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a retired Marine general. They will have to deal with other, sometimes ideologically drivenadvisers with close personal ties to Trump. David Friedman, Trumps former bankruptcy lawyer and now nominee as ambassador to Israel, has raised funds for a West Bank settlement and voiced doubt about Palestinian statehood. Kushners family has donated tens of thousands of dollars to the same settlement. Aides may be moving circumspectly also in hope of keeping the door open if Trump  who has touted his skills as a master dealmaker  decides to seek what he has called the ultimate deal: Israeli-Palestinian peace.  To pursue such an initiative, the United States needs to be seen as an even-handed mediator, while also overcoming the rigid disputes that have scuppered so many peace efforts over the years: settlements, borders, the status of Jerusalem, what to do with Palestinian refugees, and Palestinian political divisions. The last, U.S.-brokered round of peace talks collapsed in 2014. It remains to be seen whether the Trump administration will be inclined to devote much attention to the Israeli-Palestinian issue at a time when it is distracted by other priorities. In the Middle East alone, the fight against Islamic State and countering Iran are higher on the agenda. However, if Trump at some point does opt to wade in where so many of his predecessors have failed, for Netanyahu  who is looking for a reset of U.S.-Israeli relations  it might be a case of be careful what you wish for.

In a White House meeting with airline executives, Trump promised a phenomenal tax plan, but offered no specifics other than citing the need to a lower tax burden on businesses. Thats coming along very well. Were way ahead of schedule, the president said. Were going to be announcing something I would say over the next two or three weeks that will be phenomenal in terms of tax and developing our aviation infrastructure. White House spokesman Sean Spicer later told reporters that Trump would unveil a comprehensive tax plan including tax cuts for individuals as well as businesses. Despite the likelihood of disagreements in Congress before tax reform can be enacted, the U.S. dollar rose along with bond yields and stocks in response to the news. Under U.S. law, only Congress can substantively change the tax code, which has not been overhauled thoroughly since 1986. Tax legislation must begin in the House of Representatives. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, a Texas Republican who has been talking to the White House about a tax reform bill, said he was pretty positive about Trumps remarks. Were going in the same direction in a good way, Brady told Fox News.  Both U.S. political parties generally agree on the need for tax reform, but action has been stymied by the complexity of the code which is riddled with loopholes. Spicer said to expect a comprehensive plan, something we havent seen since 1986 ... Its going to recognize the need to give so many working Americans the relief that they need. What he wants to do is create a tax climate that not only keeps jobs here but incentivizes companies to want to come here, to grow here, to create jobs here, to bring their profits back here. During last years election campaign, the president pledged to cut the U.S. business tax rate from to 15 percent from 35 percent. Investors have been waiting for details on Trumps election campaign pledge to stimulate U.S. economic growth through spending on infrastructure projects and tax cuts. That was really the crux of the dollar rally shortly after his election, and I think investors are getting really excited about that again, BK Asset Management managing director Kathy Lien said as Trumps comments sent the U.S. dollar to its best one-day gain against the yen in three weeks.     Before Trumps comments on Thursday, tax reform appeared to be losing momentum in Congress. The White House and House Republicans have been in discussions about a House tax reform plan that includes a controversial border adjustment proposal. The measure has come under fire from retailers, oil refiners and automakers who fear its 20 percent import tax could raise consumer prices.  In a sign of the bumpy road ahead, Republican Senator David Perdue of Georgia called border adjustment a bad idea and urged his colleagues in a letter not to support it.  Lawmakers have also been considering ways to upgrade U.S. infrastructure such as roads, bridges, airports and rail systems. At Thursdays meeting, Trump discussed what he called an obsolete U.S. air traffic control system, as well as out-of-date airport infrastructure, train systems and roads. He told the executives he was determined to change all of that and said they would be very happy with his proposals. You people are regulated probably as much as almost anybody, although I can think of a couple of industries that are even worse, Trump said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A dozen Democratic U.S. senators on Thursday denounced a Trump administration plan to revamp a government program on countering violent extremism, saying narrowing its focus solely to Islamic threats could jeopardize security and may be illegal. Restructuring the program to omit white supremacists and other non-Islamist groups would severely damage our credibility with foreign allies and partners as an honest broker in the fight against violent extremism, and prove divisive in communities across our country, Senators Cory Booker, Brian Schatz and 10 others wrote in a letter addressed to cabinet secretaries. Reuters reported last week that Republican President Donald Trumps administration wants to rename the Countering Violent Extremism, or CVE, program introduced by the previous Democratic administration of Barack Obama to Countering Islamic Extremism or Countering Radical Islamic Extremism. The potential name change reflects a broader goal of Trumps to exclude groups in the programs purview such as white supremacist, whose followers have also carried out bombings and shootings in the United States, five sources familiar with the matter said. CVE aimed to address the causes of why some people are drawn to violence or extremism by providing grants and other resources to community groups to develop prevention efforts, including using social media. Earlier this month, Trump signed an executive order temporarily blocking travel to the United States by people from seven predominantly Muslim countries, prompting a global outcry and charges from his critics that he was advancing a white nationalist agenda. Trump has rejected characterizations of the order as a Muslim ban and said it is necessary to protect national security. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials who work on CVE met on Tuesday to continue discussions about the proposed changes, according to two sources who have worked closely with DHS on the program. Refocusing CVE efforts largely on Islam would alienate Muslim organizations and individuals in the United States, the senators wrote to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Defense James Mattis, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and Wade Warren, acting administrator for the U.S. Agency for International Development. It will also put U.S. service members, diplomats, development practitioners, and citizens traveling the world at significant risk, and will increase the likelihood of more attacks, the letter said, and could violate constitutional protections and the rights of American citizens. At least three community organizations have already declined funding collectively totaling nearly $1.4 million awarded under the auspices of the CVE task force, citing concerns about the Trump administrations posture toward Muslims and the possible changes to the program.  White House press secretary Sean Spicer declined to comment on the reported changes last week, but said during a briefing that the program was initially intended to focus on rooting out radical Islamic terrorism. Several former DHS officials told Reuters the CVE program was not conceived with that goal, although it has been criticized by even some supporters as tacitly too focused on Muslims or largely ineffective.

We received the letter from the Senators and are in communication with them to ensure all questions are addressed, Williamson told Reuters in an e-mailed statement. Democrat Senator Amy Klobuchar sent Kaleo a letter earlier this month, voicing similar concerns. Williamson said that Americans with commercial insurance and a prescription could get Evzio, which was approved in 2014, for no out-of-pocket cost, or for $360 if they paid cash. He added that people without insurance and with household income under $100,000 could get Evzio for no out-of-pocket cost. Kaleos other product is Auvi-Q, an emergency allergy auto-injector that is a rival to Mylan NVs EpiPen, which came under intense criticism last year for its high price. Kaleo said last month that it would offer Auvi-Q at no cost to many consumers, but set a list price  to be used as the benchmark cost to insurance companies  at a whopping $4,500.

The two leaders also have differing views about immigration from predominantly Muslim nations and Trump is likely to press his Canadian counterpart to ramp up defense spending and thereby help shore up NATO. Although the progressive 45-year-old Trudeau has little in common with the 70-year-old Republican businessman president, he needs to make a good impression on Trump, who wants to  renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Canada sends 75 percent of its exports to the United States and is keen to avoid becoming the target of extra tariffs or other damaging measures. Trump says NAFTA, which also includes Mexico, has been disastrous for American workers. Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland sounded a note of caution on Wednesday, saying Canada opposed the idea of the United States imposing new border tariffs and would respond appropriately to any such move. Although neither administration released details of Mondays meeting at the White House, two people familiar with the talks said it would be wide-ranging. They will discuss everything - trade, the border, security and defense, said one person, who asked to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter. Defense, particularly NATO, is a likely sticking point. Although Alliance nations have committed to spending 2 percent of gross domestic product on their militaries, Canada contributes barely half that.     Trudeaus office, asked about the agenda, said more details would become known later. President Trump and Prime Minister Trudeau look forward to a constructive conversation on strengthening the relationship between our two nations, the White House said in a statement. Several senior Canadian government ministers visited Washington this week to meet their U.S. counterparts as part of a charm offensive designed to persuade the Trump team not to single out Canada during the NAFTA talks.

Sessions, 70, who has served two decades in the Senate from Alabama, was confirmed by a 52-47 vote largely along party lines after Democrats raised public opposition to his confirmation.  In a rare move for a senator recently confirmed to a Cabinet position, Sessions took to the floor of the chamber after the vote and called for members of Congress to have some latitude in their relationships with members of the other party.     I want to thank those who after it all found sufficient confidence to confirm me as the next attorney general, Sessions said.  Denigrating people who disagree with us, I think, is not a healthy trend for our body, he said, referring to the Senate. On Tuesday, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, a darling of the political left, was silenced in the Senate for reading a 1986 letter from Coretta Scott King, the widow of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., that criticized Sessions for his civil rights record. Democrats, civil rights and immigration groups have voiced alarm about Sessions record of controversial positions on race, immigration and criminal justice reform.  With Sessions as attorney general, eight of President Donald Trumps 22 Cabinet nominees have been confirmed. The Republican-led Senate also voted on Wednesday to advance Representative Tom Prices nomination to head the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The Senate is likely to vote to confirm Price on Friday. Sessions, a known immigration hardliner, will take the lead of the Justice Department as its lawyers are defending Trumps temporary entry ban on people from seven predominantly Muslim countries and all refugees, the most controversial executive order of the young administration.  The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is due to rule this week on whether to overrule a district court judge in Seattle who suspended the ban last week.  Civil rights groups worry that the Justice Departments civil rights division will not be aggressive in prosecuting abuses under Sessions. They cite his failure to win Senate confirmation to become a federal judge in 1986 because of allegations he made racist remarks, including testimony that he had called an African-American prosecutor boy, an allegation Sessions denied. Sessions said at his hearing in 1986 that groups such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the American Civil Liberties Union could be considered un-American. He also acknowledged he had called the Voting Rights Act of 1965 a piece of intrusive legislation.  The left-leaning Center for American Progress think tank  questioned whether Sessions would be an independent legal voice to challenge Trumps agenda.  Trump has shown little respect for the courts or the constitutional limits on his power, and there is no reason to think that Attorney General Sessions will act as an independent check on the president, said Michele Jawando, vice president for legal progress at the think tank. Sessions has pushed to curb immigration into the United States, including by those who enter legally on work permits.  He has also voted against many measures to reduce sentences for prisoners. The Republican National Committee pushed back against what it called obstructing by Democrats.    That Democrats would try to skew Sessions strong civil rights record and consistent adherence to rule of law in a partisan effort to block their colleagues nomination shows their only commitment is to blindly obstructing this administration, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said on Sessions confirmation.

Abe heads to Washington later on Thursday hoping promises to help create U.S. jobs and bolster Japans military will persuade Trump to turn down the heat on trade and currency and stand by the decades-old alliance. In a situation in which security relations in the Asia-Pacific region are increasingly severe, it is very important to demonstrate the unshakeable U.S.-Japan alliance at home and abroad, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference. This is the most important theme of the U.S.-Japan leaders summit, he said, adding it was also vital to have constructive discussions on how to create a win-win relationship by further strengthening U.S.-Japan economic ties. Trump has lumped Japan with China and Mexico as big contributors to the U.S. trade deficit, targeted its auto trade as unfair and accused Tokyo of using monetary policy to devalue its currency to boost exports. We use monetary easing, fiscal policy and structural reform in order to escape from deflation. We dont engage in competitive currency devaluation or target specific levels,    Masahiko Shibayama, an adviser to the premier, told Reuters. Well explain based on the fact that Japanese automakers are contributing to U.S. jobs through their local subsidiaries. During his election campaign, Trump complained Tokyo was not sharing enough of the cost of the U.S. security umbrella although his defense secretary, Jim Mattis, assured Japan the alliance was firm when he visited the country last week.  Abe, who will be accompanied by Finance Minister Taro Aso and Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida, will bring a package of steps Tokyo says could create 700,000 U.S. jobs through private-public investment in infrastructure such as high-speed trains, government sources say. Trump, who abandoned the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact championed by his predecessor Barack Obama and Abe as a counterweight to a rising China, has made clear he wants a bilateral free trade agreement (FTA) with Tokyo instead. Abe has left the door open to FTA talks but Japanese officials worry such negotiations would boost pressure on politically sensitive sectors such as agriculture while yielding few economic benefits for Japan. The new cabinet level talks, the government official told Reuters, would be a way of buying time rather than opening FTA talks at an early stage.  Tokyo and Washington already have a cabinet-level mechanism for security talks, the so-called 2-plus-2 meetings of defense and foreign ministers. The new economic framework will be headed by Aso, who is also deputy prime minister, and U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, and would address a range of issues, with a focus on crafting trade policies and measures to bolster U.S. employment, said a report in the Nikkei business daily. Abe is likely to propose crafting highly liberal rules for trade and investment in areas such as intellectual property protection, rules of origin, regulations on state-owned companies and e-commerce, the Nikkei said. Japan hopes such bilateral rules would be similar to those agreed upon in the TPP and could be extended to cover the Asia-Pacific region to counter Chinas growing clout, it added. The two nations are also preparing statements regarding economic cooperation and security to be issued after the summit meeting, the Nikkei said.  Abe and Trump will also play a round of gold in Florida this weekend after the meeting at the White House on Friday and Trump said he will make sure the Japanese leader is his partner in the game, rather than a competitor.

However, while we should seek common ground with Russia in the areas of mutual interest, we must never pursue cooperation with Russia at the expense of our fundamental interests of defending our allies and promoting our values, they wrote.

A state court in Orange County, California, has granted CKE Restaurants Inc a delay from Feb. 27 - when the full Senate might still be considering Puzders nomination - to early June for an age and disability discrimination lawsuit after the company cited negative publicity generated by his nomination. Puzder, CKE Restaurants chief executive, has been under fire by Democrats and labor groups for opposing increases in the minimum wage and aiming to curb worker protections. But his expected confirmation by a Republican majority in the Senate has not been knocked off track. By the June 5 trial, he may be labor secretary and well along the way to divesting himself from the company. Puzder agreed to divest his stakes in CKE, worth anywhere between $11 million and $55 million, if confirmed, according to an ethics submission reviewed by Reuters. Puzders confirmation hearing has been repeatedly delayed as a government ethics office reviewed his plan to divest from CKE, which owns franchised restaurants, including Carls Jr. and Hardees. Puzder also promised to divest his holdings in more than 200 assets, including Berkshire Hathaway Inc, Altria Group Inc, Bank of America Corp and Cisco Systems Inc, within 90 days of his confirmation. He will divest from more illiquid funds within 180 days, but he declined to provide details for some of the funds underlying assets, citing a confidentiality agreement. The California case was brought by James Dombrowski, whose employment was terminated as he recovered from a brain biopsy, according to court filings.  CKEs franchised restaurants have faced wage-and-hour and labor condition complaints from workers, but the Dombrowski case is against the holding company largely controlled by Puzder.  CKE was also named in an antitrust lawsuit filed by current and former Carls Jr. workers in a California court on Wednesday that alleges a scheme to suppress wages across its franchises by using no hire agreements. Dombrowski claims that he was fired by CKE when he tried to return to work in 2015, at the age of 68, after taking a disability leave following a brain biopsy which temporarily paralyzed him.  CKEs attorney in the Dombrowski case, Scott Ferrell,  argued that the negative publicity surrounding CKEs business practices due to Puzders fame as a Cabinet nominee would hurt the companys ability to have a fair jury trial, not that the case would in any way hurt Puzders ability to be confirmed. Ferrell declined to comment on the case. Dombrowskis attorney did not respond to requests for comment. A representative of Puzder also declined to comment. CKE Restaurants has said it is up to its franchises to set wages and working conditions and they are protected from liability as a franchisor. Senator Susan Collins, who is on the panel that will hold Puzders initial confirmation hearing next week, said she has not made a decision regarding Puzder. Collins was one of two Republicans to vote against Betsy DeVos, who was confirmed on Tuesday to head President Donald Trumps Department of Education. I have not reached a decision. I almost always wait until theres a hearing, unless I know the individual well, Collins said on Thursday.  Ive had two conversations with Mr. Puzder and I think there are questions outstanding that will be, Im sure, delved into at his hearing, she added. Puzder, an enthusiastic early supporter of Trump, has lobbied against efforts to raise the minimum wage and is expected to roll back rules aimed at curbing unpaid overtime and improving worker safety if confirmed to head the Labor Department.

Luther Strange, also a Republican, will hold the Senate seat until a special election in 2018, the governors office said in a statement.  Sessions, 70, served two decades as a senator for Alabama before being confirmed on Wednesday as President Donald Trumps attorney general. A Senate divided by concerns over his record on civil rights voted 52-47, largely along party lines. Strange, a 63-year-old former basketball player at Tulane University nicknamed Big Luther for his size, had announced his plans to run for the seat after Trump nominated Sessions. I pledge to the people of Alabama to continue the same level of leadership as Jeff Sessions in consistently fighting to protect and advance the conservative values we all care about, Strange said in a statement following his appointment. Alabama voters first elected Strange as attorney general in 2010. Bentley on Thursday highlighted Stranges role in negotiating the landmark settlement agreement with BP for the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. According to local media, Alabama lawmakers said Strange asked them last year to suspend their impeachment investigation of Bentley over allegations he had an affair with a former political adviser and used state resources to pursue it. The Republican governor has denied the affair and any wrongdoing. Lawmakers said Strange was conducting a related probe, but the attorney generals office has not said whether it was investigating the governor, according to the Montgomery Advertiser newspaper. A spokeswoman for the attorney generals office did not have an immediate comment on the reports. The governors office said Bentley conducted more than 20 hours of interviews with candidates before tapping Strange for the Senate seat. Bentley said Strange would be sworn in on Thursday.

Senior U.S. senators called on Wednesday for the right to review any move the White House might make to ease sanctions on Russia, amid mounting concern in Congress - and among U.S. allies - that President Donald Trump will be too conciliatory toward Moscow. The lawmakers, led by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and Democrat Ben Cardin, introduced The Russia Sanctions Review Act of 2017, modeled on a 2015 bill that let Congress review the Iran nuclear agreement signed by then-President Barack Obama. Trumps open admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin and promises to rebuild frayed U.S. ties with Moscow have raised questions over his commitment to maintaining sanctions against Russia for its involvement in fighting in Ukraine and annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. The bill announced on Wednesday would require the administration to submit to Congress a description of any proposed sanctions relief, as well as certification that Moscow had stopped supporting actions to undermine the government of Ukraine and ceased cyber attacks against the U.S. government and its people. The legislation would give the Republican-led Senate and House of Representatives 120 days to act, or decline to act, on any sanctions relief. During that period, Trump would be barred from action to ease sanctions. After 120 days, sanctions relief would be granted only if the Senate and House had not voted for a Joint Resolution of Disapproval. The measure is also backed by Republican Senators Marco Rubio and John McCain and Democrats Sherrod Brown and Claire McCaskill. It was not immediately clear whether Republican congressional leaders would back the measure or how it would fare in the House, but the bill has the support of some of the leading foreign policy voices in the Senate. White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters he did not want to specifically address the legislation. He pointed to support within the Trump administration for keeping sanctions in place, noting that U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley had addressed the issue of keeping Russian sanctions related to Crimea very forcefully. A review of the bill by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has not been scheduled, said a spokeswoman for Senator Bob Corker, the committees chairman and author of the 2015 Iran review act.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Three of the 19 Democratic state attorneys general who joined Washington states legal challenge to U.S. President Donald Trumps travel ban are making a politically tricky maneuver: they are from states that went for Trump in the November election. The attorneys general of Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Iowa - key states for Trump in his presidential election victory - say they signed on to the legal action seeking to overturn the travel restrictions because of the potential impact of the presidential order on their states.  When someone says to me youre doing this in a state that Trump won, Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro told Reuters, his response is: Trump is doing this in a state that I won. Pennsylvania was a crucial swing state in the 2016 election between Trump, a Republican, and Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. Trump ended up winning the state with nearly 3 million votes. On the same night Shapiro, a Democrat, won 86,000 more votes than Trump to become the states attorney general.  Shapiro said political considerations played no role in his decision to help coordinate a Democratic legal response on the Trump travel ban, which he believes is unconstitutional. If Trump enacts policies that enhance the rights of Pennsylvanians, Shapiro said he would stand shoulder to shoulder with him. Charlie Gerow, a Republican political strategist in Pennsylvania, said he doubts Shapiro took much of a risk in opposing Trumps order, in part because he was just elected and voters likely will not care in four years when he runs again. My guess is he believes that it is important to his base that he be perceived as a leader in this fight, Gerow said. Trumps Jan. 27 executive order barred entry to the United States to citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries for 90 days and imposed a 120-day halt on all refugees, except refugees from Syria, who are barred indefinitely.  Washington state challenged the legality of the order, claiming it discriminated against Muslims, and a Seattle federal judge suspended the order on Friday. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is now reviewing that ruling. Just two of the nations Democratic attorneys general did not sign on to the fight, and both were from deeply Republican states where the political risk was potentially greater.  Jim Hood, Mississippis attorney general since 2004, told Reuters budget concerns kept him from joining with his colleagues in other states on the legal action.  But he said he was grateful to these attorneys general for carrying the fight on this important issue. Kentucky Attorney General Andy Beshear, who won his election by just 2,000 votes in 2015, said in a statement that he declined to join his colleagues because when you join in other large groups that make statements, you lose your own particular voice. As for his own views, Beshear said as a Christian he believes we have a duty to help families facing terrorism and oppression, but he did not say whether he thought Trumps order was illegal. North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein, a Democrat, was elected by a slim margin of 20,000 votes on the same night that Trump took the state with nearly 200,000 votes more than Clinton.  Stein, previously a state senator, said he decided to sign on because Trumps order is hurting his state.  I ran for the position of attorney general to protect the people of North Carolina, he told Reuters. I did not run to engage in battle with the federal government.  Tom Miller, Iowas attorney general since 1995, told Reuters he supported Washington state in the fight but did not expect to take a lead. He said he hoped to identify areas to work with Republican attorneys general, none of whom have so far made any court filings over the Trump travel ban. One of the areas I will be looking at in particular is consumer protection, Miller said. Dave Mudcat Saunders, a Democratic political strategist in rural Virginia, said attorneys general in swing states are unlikely to pay a high price for opposing Trump on immigration. They arent going to gain any votes. Theyre going to satisfy their base, he said. The people who are going to get pissed off about it werent going to vote for them anyway.

The letter thanked Xi for his congratulatory note on Trumps inauguration and wished the Chinese people a prosperous Lunar New Year of the Rooster, the White House said in a statement on Wednesday. President Trump stated that he looks forward to working with President Xi to develop a constructive relationship that benefits both the United States and China, it said. China said on Thursday it attached great importance to China-U.S. ties.  We highly appreciate President Trumps holiday greetings to President Xi Jinping and the Chinese people, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said at a daily press briefing.  Asked whether it was a snub that Trump had held calls with many other world leaders as president, but not Xi, Lu said: This kind of remark is meaningless. He reiterated that China and the U.S. had maintained close communication since Trump took office and that cooperation was the only correct choice. China is willing to work with the United States in adhering to the principles of non-confrontation, mutual respect and mutual benefit to promote cooperation, control disputes, and on a healthy and stable foundation, promote greater development in China-U.S. ties, Lu said.  Trump and Xi have yet to speak directly since Trump took office on Jan. 20, although they did talk soon after Trump won the U.S. presidential election in November. Diplomatic sources in Beijing say China has been nervous about Xi being left humiliated in the event a call with Trump goes wrong and the details are leaked to the U.S. media. Last week, U.S. ties with staunch ally Australia became strained after the Washington Post published details about an acrimonious phone call between Trump and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. [nL4N1FN0JR] That is the last thing China wants, a source familiar with Chinas thinking on relations with the United States told Reuters. It would be incredibly embarrassing for President Xi and for Chinese people, who value the concept of face. A senior non-U.S. Western diplomat said China was unlikely to be in a rush to set up such a call. These things need to happen in a very controlled environment for China, and China cant guarantee that with the unpredictable Trump, the diplomat said. Trump also seems too distracted with other issues at the moment to give too much attention to China. There are a number of contentious areas where China fears Trump could go off script, the diplomat said, pointing in particular to the issue of self-ruled Taiwan, as well as trade. Trump upset China in December by taking a phone call from Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen. China considers Taiwan a wayward province with no right to formal diplomatic relations with any other country. Trump has also threatened to slap tariffs on Chinese imports, accusing Beijing of devaluing its yuan currency and stealing U.S. jobs. In his Senate confirmation hearing, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said China should not be allowed access to islands it has built in the disputed South China Sea. The White House also vowed to defend international territories in the strategic waterway. China has repeatedly said it has smooth contacts with the Trump team. The Foreign Ministry in Beijing said last week the two countries were remaining in close touch. That contact has been led by Chinas top diplomat, State Councillor Yang Jiechi, who outranks the foreign minister. Yang told Michael Flynn, Trumps National Security Advisor, last week that China hopes it can work with the United States to manage and control disputes and sensitive problems. [nL4N1FO364] The source familiar with Chinas thinking said Trumps administration was very clear about Chinas position on Taiwan. Trump has yet to mention Taiwan since he took office. Chinese state media has wondered whether Trump has a China policy at all. On Thursday, the widely read Global Times tabloid, published by the ruling Communist Partys official Peoples Daily, noted that Trump had not immediately confronted China as had been expected because he had realized upsetting Beijing would backfire badly. He has probably realized that real tough action against China would result in a complex chain reaction, even beyond his control, the paper said in an editorial. Wang Yiwei, a professor of international relations at Beijings elite Renmin University, said the letter suggested the new U.S. administration wanted to signal the importance it attached to the U.S.-China relationship without risking being confronted on specific issues. Trump has sent many messages that makes the world confused, like on the South China Sea and One China policy, so if he makes a phone call President Xi will ask what do you mean?, Wang said. He wants to avoid this so he just sends a letter for the first step. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Gorsuchs comments came as a federal appeals court in San Francisco was expected to decide in coming days on the narrow question of whether U.S. District Judge James Robart acted properly in temporarily halting enforcement of Trumps ban. A Republican strategist hired by the White House to help guide Gorsuchs nomination through the U.S. Senate said that Gorsuch, himself an appeals court judge, used those words when he met with Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal. Trump, who took office on Jan. 20, took to Twitter over the weekend to condemn the Friday night order by Robart that placed on hold the presidents Jan. 27 temporary travel ban on people from the seven countries and all refugees.  Trump called Robart a so-called judge whose ridiculous opinion essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country. Trumps administration appealed Robarts ruling to a three-judge federal appeals panel, which heard oral arguments  on Tuesday.  Presidents are usually hesitant to weigh in on judicial matters out of respect for the U.S. Constitution, which ensures a separation of powers among the presidents executive branch, Congress and the judiciary.  The Republican-led Senate on Wednesday confirmed immigration hardliner Republican Senator Jeff Sessions to be the next attorney general despite strong Democratic opposition. Trump says his executive order aims to head off attacks by Islamist militants. The order, the most divisive act of Trumps young presidency, sparked protests and chaos at U.S. and overseas airports. Critics said the ban unfairly targeted people for their religion. I dont ever want to call a court biased, Trump told hundreds of police chiefs and sheriffs from major cities at a meeting in a Washington hotel on Wednesday. So I wont call it biased. And we havent had a decision yet. But courts seem to be so political.  Trump nominated Gorsuch on Jan. 31 to succeed conservative Justice Antonin Scalia on the nine-member Supreme Court. Scalia died a year ago this month.  Blumenthal, a member of the Judiciary Committee that will hold a confirmation hearing on Gorsuch, said the nominee had a responsibility to reassure Americans that he would be an open-minded and independent jurist by going public with his concerns about Trump. The appeals court decision on whether to reinstate the ban, will be just a first step in a fast-moving case. The courts will ultimately have to address questions about the extent of the presidents power on matters of immigration and national security. Traditionally, judges have been extremely cautious about stepping on the executive branchs authority in such matters, legal experts say, although some note that the implementation of Trumps order presents unique issues. Trumps order barred travelers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering for 90 days and all refugees for 120 days, except those from civil war-torn Syria, who are subject to an indefinite ban. Also at issue is whether the order violates a provision of the U.S. Constitution that prohibits laws favoring one religion over another, along with relevant discrimination laws.  Trump, a Republican, has made extensive use of presidential directives that bypass Congress and has appeared to be taken aback by legal challenges to his travel order. He praised a federal judge in Boston who earlier ruled in his favor on the travel ban as a highly respected jurist whose findings were perfect.  Last year, Trump accused Indiana-born U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel of bias in overseeing a lawsuit against one of Trumps businesses, Trump University, because of his Mexican heritage. Democrats and other critics have called Trumps comments toward the judiciary an attack on a core principle of American democracy: that the courts are independent and uphold the rule of law.  At the meeting with law enforcement officials, Trump read from the law he cited to justify the travel ban, quoting it in fragments and sprinkling in bits of interpretation. He said the law clearly allowed a president to suspend entry of any class of people if he determined them to be a detriment to national security. The matter is likely to go to the U.S. Supreme Court, which is ideologically split with four liberal justices and four conservatives pending Senate action on Trumps nomination of Gorsuch, a conservative jurist. U.S. State Department figures showed that 480 refugees had been admitted to the United States since Robarts order went into effect, including 168 on Wednesday. Of those admitted, 198 were from war-torn Syria. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The White House meeting comes at a time of heightened tension within the industry after U.S. carriers raised concerns about ongoing trade agreements with foreign carriers. Trump has vowed to renegotiate or scrap trade deals he sees as unfair between the United States and other countries. A source told Reuters the airlines expect last months executive order barring travel from seven Muslim-majority countries may come up and if so, the carriers in attendance would stress the need for better coordination and planning ahead of announcing such an order instead of having it sprung on them, the source said. The session will include reforming the air traffic control system, Transportation Security Administration issues, user fees and regulatory burdens, a White House official told Reuters. The expected participants include the chief executives of Delta Air Lines Inc, JetBlue Airways Corp, United Continental Holdings Inc, Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc, Alaska Airlines and trade group Airlines for America, along with top officials from FedEx Corp and United Parcel Service Inc, the official said. Also expected to attend are airport directors from Los Angeles, Chicago, Tampa, Washington, Buffalo, Nashville and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. American Airlines Chief Executive Officer Doug Parker, who called Trumps executive order on travel divisive, is unable to attend due to a scheduling conflict with a conference he is hosting, company spokesman Matt Miller said.  Other industry executives have spoken out against the temporary travel ban saying it could hurt the industry and their employees. During the 2016 election race Trump campaigned on improving U.S. infrastructure, talking about a $1 trillion infrastructure plan over a decade.  Our airports are like from a third world country, Trump said at a presidential debate in September. You land at LaGuardia, you land at Kennedy, you land at LAX, you land at Newark, and you come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these incredible  you come in from China, you see these incredible airports, and you land  weve become a third world country. Heads of the three largest U.S. passenger carriers - American Airlines Group Inc, United and Delta - have sought to pressure the new administration into denouncing U.S. Open Skies agreements with the three major Middle Eastern carriers, which they accuse of having been unfairly subsidized by their governments.     The three airlines, Qatar, Etihad and Emirates, have denied these claims. The Trump administration has not yet addressed the U.S. carriers competition concerns. Whether the issue is discussed on Thursday will be decided when the executives meet with Trump, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said. The president wants to talk about economic growth, job creation, Spicer said at the daily White House press briefing on Wednesday. He did not say which executives would attend the meeting. Smaller U.S. carriers JetBlue, Atlas Air Wand Hawaiian Holdings Inc, as well as the air cargo unit of FedEx have formally banded together behind the Gulf carriers, against their larger competitors. Also a point of contention is an order signed under departing former President Barack Obama granting flying rights to Norwegian Air International, which U.S. airlines and unions have said will undermine wages and working standards. Spicer, during the Wednesday press briefing, said there is a huge economic interest that America has in that deal right now, citing Norwegians use of U.S. workers and Boeing Co jets. I dont want to get ahead of the president on that; but just to be clear were talking about U.S. jobs both in terms of the people who are serving those planes, and the persons building them, Spicer said.

(Reuters) - The prospect of Senator Jeff Sessions as U.S. attorney general has cast uncertainty over the countrys nascent legalized marijuana industry, souring deals and disrupting share prices since the longtime critic of the drug was nominated. The U.S. Senate on Wednesday confirmed President Donald Trumps nomination of Sessions by a vote of 52-47 after strong opposition from Democrats.. The Republican senator from Alabama has opposed attempts to legalize marijuana and reduce drug sentences and once urged the death penalty for drug traffickers. Trump named Sessions as his choice to lead the Justice Department on Nov. 18, shaking the exuberance of an industry that last year reached $7 billion in legal sales and generated half a billion dollars in sales taxes. The choice of Sessions drove some businesses back underground and scared away investors, industry experts said.    Growers are seeking advice on how to protect themselves from a crackdown, while other cannabis companies are seeking ways to shield their records from investigators. Everyones back into wait-and-see mode, said Sasha Kadey, chief marketing officer for Greenlane, which distributes cannabis accessories such as vapor smoking devices. Because one doesnt want to paint a target on ones back. More than two dozen U.S. states have legalized some form of marijuana for medical or recreational use, but the drug remains illegal at the federal level.  The administration of former Democratic President Barack Obama mostly tolerated the state legalizations, focusing on big cases or transactions that involved other crimes, such as selling pot to children. Trump has said in the past he would defer to states on marijuana legalization, and has not addressed the issue since he was elected last November. But Sessions, asked about marijuana policy at a Senate confirmation hearing last month, said that if Congress no longer wanted to criminalize marijuana, it should pass a law that changes the rules.  Its not so much the attorney generals job to decide what laws to enforce. We should do our job and enforce laws effectively as we are able, Sessions said. Neither the administration nor Sessions responded to requests for comment. Massroots, which makes a mobile app that allows people to review and discuss cannabis strains, lost 14 percent of its share price in the three trading days after Sessions nomination, and it was promptly removed from the Google Play app store, said Chief Executive Isaac Dietrich.   The share price has since recovered and is up 24 percent since Nov. 18. At Greenlane, Kadey changed the companys plans for a new line of premium, child-resistant packaging, deciding to market it without using the words marijuana or cannabis. There was a sharp drop in the stocks post-election, said analyst Tom Adams, editor-in-chief of Arcview Market Research. There were deals lost and second thoughts had by many people. An index of 33 publicly traded legal cannabis companies followed by Arcview dropped to a low of 284 points after the election from a high of 418 in October, analyst Michael Arrington said. The index has since regained much but not all of that value, hitting 379 on Jan. 6, the most recent date for which the company has data. An effort to ramp up prosecution of federal marijuana offenses would reinvigorate the black market in cannabis and limit the states ability to regulate both legal and illegal sales, said Andrew Freedman, who last month left a job as Colorados top marijuana regulator to become a consultant in the industry. Tighter enforcement could also threaten $140 million in taxes from marijuana sales that Colorado has used for education and other purposes, Freedman said. Since the election, volatile valuations have complicated potential deals for companies that are up for sale, said Steve Gormley, CEO of the cannabis private equity firm Seventh Point, LLC. Khurshid Khoja, a San Francisco Bay-area attorney who specializes in cannabis issues, said the climate was stalling deals as companies grow nervous about opening their books.Its that they just dont know, Khoja said ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Tillersons meeting with Freeland, and a separate meeting with Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray, at the State Department touched on the trilateral North American Free Trade Agreement, which President Donald Trump wants to renegotiate. Speaking to reporters afterwards, Freeland said she made clear in the meeting with Tillerson that Canada would oppose the idea of border tariffs on Canadian goods in upcoming NAFTA talks. If such an idea were ever to come into being, Canada would respond appropriately, she told reporters on a conference call, stressing that Ottawa did not yet know what the U.S. opening position would be. Both Canada and Mexico send the bulk of their exports to the United States and could be crippled by major changes to NAFTA, which Trump has called a disaster. Mexicos Foreign Ministry said that Videgaray discussed migration and security issues in his meetings with Tillerson and U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly. Both Tillerson and Videgaray said they would keep working on solutions to their public differences, it added. Videgaray also told Kelly that the human rights of Mexicans in the United States was important, the statement said. After their hour-long meeting, Videgaray told reporters that Tillerson had said he would visit Mexico in the coming weeks, according to a Mexican Foreign Ministry official. The State Department did not provide a readout of either of the meetings, which occurred in Tillersons first full week in his new post.   Trump made free trade deals a major target during his campaign for the presidency. He says NAFTA, formally signed in 1994, has harmed American workers. The pact was aimed at removing tariff barriers between Canada, Mexico and the United States. Canada is trying to persuade the new administration and senior politicians that its especially close ties with the United States mean the country should be spared protectionist measures.

The White House says the directors of national intelligence and the Central Intelligence Agency will both be members of Trumps Cabinet.  Trump fumes over what he calls too much politics in the U.S. judiciary, while a federal appeals court keeps him and the rest of the country waiting for its ruling on a suspension of his temporary travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries. Trumps nominee for the U.S. Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch, describes the presidents Twitter attacks on the judiciary as demoralizing and disheartening, a spokesman for Gorsuch says. Trump blasts department store chain Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) for dropping his daughter Ivankas clothing line, prompting critics to accuse him of misusing public office to benefit his familys sprawling business empire. Intel Corp (INTC.O) chooses the Oval Office to announce a $7 billion investment in a new Arizona semiconductor factory, a move it says would create 3,000 new jobs when the plant is up and running. U.S. aviation executives will discuss the industrys aging airports and air traffic control reform when they meet with Trump on Thursday, sources familiar with the matter say. Trump and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan agree in an overnight phone call to act jointly against Islamic State in the Syrian towns of al-Bab and Raqqa, Turkish sources say.

Gorsuch spokesman Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist hired by the White House to help guide the judges nomination through the U.S. Senate, confirmed that Gorsuch used those words when he met Blumenthal. Trump took to Twitter over the weekend to condemn the Friday order by Judge James Robart that placed on hold the presidents Jan. 27 temporary travel ban on people from seven Muslim-majority countries and on all refugees.  The administration appealed that ruling to a three-judge federal appeals panel, which is due to decide the issue this week. [nL5N1FP0A9] Trump, who took office on Jan. 20, referred to Robart as a so-called judge and said his ridiculous opinion essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country. In an interview with CNN, Blumenthal said he told Gorsuch that he found Trumps attacks on the judiciary unacceptable and asked the judge to condemn them. After some back and forth, he did say that he found them to be disheartening and demoralizing, said Blumenthal, who is a member of the Judiciary Committee, which will hold a confirmation hearing on Gorsuchs nomination. He said Gorsuch was non-committal about publicly criticizing the attacks, and thats one reason why I remain deeply concerned about this nomination. U.S. presidents are usually hesitant to weigh in on judicial matters out of respect for a U.S. Constitution clause ensuring a separation of powers between the executive branch, Congress and the judiciary.  Trump nominated Gorsuch on Jan. 31 to succeed Justice Antonin Scalia on the nine-member court. Scalia died a year ago this month. As the nominee of a President who has viciously attacked the independence of the judiciary and declared multiple litmus tests for justices, Judge Gorsuch has a special responsibility to reassure the American people that he will be an open-minded and independent jurist, Blumenthal said in a statement earlier.  If he wants the American people to believe that he is truly independent, Judge Gorsuch must tell them in no uncertain terms that President Trumps attacks are not just disappointing  they are abhorrent and destructive to our Constitutional system  and he must condemn them publicly, Blumenthal said.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is planning to issue a directive targeting a controversial Dodd-Frank rule that requires companies to disclose whether their products contain conflict minerals from a war-torn part of Africa, according to sources familiar with the administrations thinking. Reuters could not learn precisely when the directive would be issued or what the final version would say. However, a leaked draft that has been floating around Washington and was seen by Reuters on Wednesday calls for the rule to be temporarily suspended for two years.  Reuters could not independently verify the authenticity of the document. The sources spoke on Tuesday on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record about the plan. The 2010 Dodd-Frank law explicitly gives the president authority to order the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to temporarily suspend or revise the rule for two years if it is in the national security interest of the United States. The conflict minerals rule was endorsed by human rights groups that want companies to tell investors if their products contain tantalum, tin, gold or tungsten mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo in the hope that such disclosures would curb funding to armed groups.    Business groups opposed to the measure have contended that it forces companies to furnish politically charged information that is irrelevant to making investment decisions and that it costs too much for companies to trace the source of minerals through the supply chain. In the leaked draft memo seen by Reuters, the Secretary of State and Secretary of the Treasury were asked to propose a plan for addressing human rights violations and the funding of armed groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo and report back within 180 days. The memo also lays out a justification for suspending the rule, saying that while it has helped discourage some American companies from purchasing materials in the region, it has also led to some job loss.  It also cited 2014 SEC estimates about the costs imposed on companies, which entailed upfront costs of $3 billion to $4 billion, and $200 million per year thereafter. Carly Oboth, a policy adviser at human rights group Global Witness, said in a statement on Wednesday that she was deeply concerned about Trumps planned executive action. This law helps stop U.S. companies funding conflict and human rights abuses in the Democratic Republic of Congo and surrounding countries, she said. Suspending it will benefit secretive and corrupt business practices. Responsible business practices are starting to spread in eastern Congo. This action could reverse that progress. A White House executive order last week took aim more broadly at the Dodd-Frank rules that were put into place after the 2007-2009 financial crisis. That order did not single out a  particular rule, but called on the Treasury Secretary to consult with other regulators, including the SEC, and come back with a report outlining possible regulatory changes and legislation.  The conflict minerals rule is one of several disclosure regulations in Dodd-Frank that are unrelated to the financial crisis. Another Dodd-Frank SEC disclosure rule that required oil, gas and mining companies to disclose payments to foreign governments was repealed by the Republican-controlled Congress last week. In 2014, a U.S. appeals court struck down part of the conflict minerals law after the Business Roundtable, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers sued the SEC over it. The court found part of it violated free speech rights of companies by forcing them to publicly state that their products were not conflict free. The rest of the rule was left intact and companies are  required to conduct due diligence and report the details of those inquiries in public reports filed with the SEC. The SEC cannot repeal the rule without a law passed by Congress. It can, however, use its broad exemptive powers to scale back some of the requirements or stop enforcing the rule entirely. Last week, acting SEC Chair Michael Piwowar took steps toward doing that by announcing that he had asked SEC staff to reconsider how companies should comply with it and whether additional relief was warranted. House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling, meanwhile, is planning to reintroduce his Financial CHOICE Act bill, which contains a provision to repeal the conflict minerals rule.

Sessions, 70, who has served two decades in the Senate from Alabama, was confirmed by a 52-47 vote largely along party lines after Democrats raised public opposition to his confirmation.  In a rare move for a senator recently confirmed to a Cabinet position, Sessions took to the floor of the chamber after the vote and called for members of Congress to have some latitude in their relationships with members of the other party.     I want to thank those who after it all found sufficient confidence to confirm me as the next attorney general, Sessions said.  Denigrating people who disagree with us, I think, is not a healthy trend for our body, he said, referring to the Senate. On Tuesday, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, a darling of the political left, was silenced in the Senate for reading a 1986 letter from Coretta Scott King, the widow of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., that criticized Sessions for his civil rights record. Democrats, civil rights and immigration groups have voiced alarm about Sessions record of controversial positions on race, immigration and criminal justice reform.  With Sessions as attorney general, eight of President Donald Trumps 22 Cabinet nominees have been confirmed. The Republican-led Senate also voted on Wednesday to advance Representative Tom Prices nomination to head the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The Senate is likely to vote to confirm Price on Friday. Sessions, a known immigration hardliner, will take the lead of the Justice Department as its lawyers are defending Trumps temporary entry ban on people from seven predominantly Muslim countries and all refugees, the most controversial executive order of the young administration.  The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is due to rule this week on whether to overrule a district court judge in Seattle who suspended the ban last week.  Civil rights groups worry that the Justice Departments civil rights division will not be aggressive in prosecuting abuses under Sessions. They cite his failure to win Senate confirmation to become a federal judge in 1986 because of allegations he made racist remarks, including testimony that he had called an African-American prosecutor boy, an allegation Sessions denied. Sessions said at his hearing in 1986 that groups such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the American Civil Liberties Union could be considered un-American. He also acknowledged he had called the Voting Rights Act of 1965 a piece of intrusive legislation.  The left-leaning Center for American Progress think tank  questioned whether Sessions would be an independent legal voice to challenge Trumps agenda.  Trump has shown little respect for the courts or the constitutional limits on his power, and there is no reason to think that Attorney General Sessions will act as an independent check on the president, said Michele Jawando, vice president for legal progress at the think tank. Sessions has pushed to curb immigration into the United States, including by those who enter legally on work permits.  He has also voted against many measures to reduce sentences for prisoners. The Republican National Committee pushed back against what it called obstructing by Democrats.    That Democrats would try to skew Sessions strong civil rights record and consistent adherence to rule of law in a partisan effort to block their colleagues nomination shows their only commitment is to blindly obstructing this administration, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said on Sessions confirmation.

The proposal echoes past attempts by parts of the Republican Party to address climate change but could be a non-starter. Republican President Donald Trump has cast doubt on the existence of climate change and vowed during his campaign for the presidency to pull the United States out of a global pact to fight it. Mounting evidence of climate change is growing too strong to ignore, the group said in an opinion piece published by the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal late on Tuesday. Now that the Republican Party controls the White House, both chambers of Congress and a majority of state legislatures, it has the opportunity and responsibility to promote a climate plan that showcases the full power of enduring conservative convictions, they said. An overwhelming majority of scientists believe that burning fossil fuels is driving global climate change, triggering sea level rise and more frequent powerful storms. The carbon tax proposal was co-authored by James Baker, secretary of state during the administration of George H. W. Bush; Henry Paulson, Treasury secretary under George W.

For more than an hour, people around the United States listened to arguments from attorneys for the U.S. government and Washington state, which sued to challenge Trumps executive order imposing the ban. For those using their TVs to hear the coverage, there were also simple graphics and photos. Others listened to streaming online audio. The three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco pressed the governments attorney on the lawfulness of Trumps Jan. 27 order, which triggered chaos and protests at U.S. airports and oversea. The order barred travelers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the country for 90 days and all refugees for 120 days. It banned refugees from Syria indefinitely.  The Republican president, who took office on Jan. 20, has defended the measure as necessary to protect Americans. Critics said it discriminated against Muslims and violated the U.S. Constitution. Last Friday, a federal judge in Seattle suspended the executive order. Many travelers who had been waylaid by the ban quickly moved to travel to the United States while it was in limbo.  The government appealed the decision, and the San Francisco judges heard arguments in the case on Tuesday night.  All three major U.S. cable news networks aired either parts of or the entire hearing, which ran from 6 p.m. to 7:15 p.m. EST. Only the audio was available because the hearing was conducted via conference call.  More than 2.5 million people combined tuned in on CNN or MSNBC, while another 3 million listened to segments of the hearing on Fox News, according to Nielsen data provided by Fox News. As many as 137,000 people listened to the courts live feed of the session, said David Madden, assistant circuit executive for the 9th Circuit.

As lawyers grappled with questions from the judges, law experts and academics, including Harvard Law School Professor Laurence Tribe, provided the kind of play-by-play commentary generally reserved for major sporting events.  The ability of the public to listen to the hearings was particularly important given Trumps questioning of the judges as so political and the hearing as disgraceful, Tribe said.

But their plans to fly out last week were derailed after U.S. President Donald Trump froze refugee arrivals.  We were so surprised and unsettled. It was chaos, Amira, 45, said. I didnt even unpack our clothes.  Amira had taken her two youngest children out of school, the others had quit their jobs, and their suitcases had remained packed for weeks before a U.S. judge temporarily suspended the travel ban.  As the family left for Michigan on Wednesday lugging 10  suitcases, they hoped to end a long road  still fraught with fear  to resettling as refugees in the United States. Everythings been ready, we had just been waiting for a phone call. They told us to go to the airport at midnight, Amira said.  A federal judge last week blocked Trumps order temporarily barring refugees and nationals from seven mainly Muslim countries, including Iraq and Syria. The ruling opened a brief window for travelers who had been waylaid to rush to the United States while the legal limbo continues.      Were quite afraid President Trump will halt travels again, Amira said as she prepared to board a flight with four of her children, aged 7 to 22.             The Trump administration has said the ban would help prevent terrorism but opponents assailed it as unconstitutional.  A U.S. federal appeals court heard arguments on Tuesday over whether to restore Trumps order. The case may ultimately reach the U.S. Supreme Court.  The ban led to protests across U.S. cities and chaos at airports overseas after visa holders were kept from boarding flights, detained at American airports or denied entry. We were really happy we would travel but it was bittersweet, said Amira, whose husband Nizar was denied resettlement to the United States twice. This marked the first time they have been apart since they married nearly 30 years ago and they did not know when or where they would meet again.  I dont know what my fate will be, said Nizar, 52, whose two brothers resettled in Michigan about four years ago.  In Beirut, the family lived in a small, dingy apartment in a suburb. Nizar was not able to find a job, he said. Their son, 22, worked at a factory to make rent while their daughter, 18, worked to cover food and living expenses. We had waited a long time, and our situation here is really bad, he said. My children dont have a future here. So I was forced to let them go.

Trumps order also sought to prioritize refugees fleeing religious persecution, a move he said separately was aimed at helping Christians fleeing the war in Syria. The Qassab family, Iraqi Christians from Mosul, first left their home when unidentified men tried to kidnap Amira at the school where she worked as a janitor.  Daesh came and kicked us out, so we fled further to the north, said Nizar, using an Arabic acronym for Islamic State. They trekked through Iraq, staying in Erbil and Dohuk, and ended up in Beirut in 2014.  I feared for my wife and children. We sold everything we had and came here, he said.  The family had barely gotten some respite from the instability of the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq before the threat of Islamic State militants emerged, Nizar said.  They no longer cared where they ended up, his wife added, they just wanted to find some peace.  My children are drained. They worked just to pay the rent. We barely made a living, Nizar added.  I cant go to America anymore. I dont know why...Im parting with my family, said Nizar , bursting into tears. How am I going to live alone? The Qassabs eldest son Rami, 26, had already resettled to Michigan two months earlier to find them all an apartment.  He told us America is beautiful, Amira said. But it takes some time to settle in.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Senates top Democrat on Tuesday accused President Donald Trumps Supreme Court pick of avoiding answering questions like the plague and dodging efforts to gauge his judicial independence during a meeting that deepened his concerns about the nominee. Neil Gorsuch, the federal appeals court judge from Colorado who the Republican president nominated last week to a lifetime job on the high court, met privately with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York as he continues to try to build support for his confirmation by the Senate. I thought there was a deliberate strategy to duck the hard questions. And he has an obligation to answer them, not simply to the Senate but to the American people, Schumer told reporters afterward, referring to Gorsuch. Schumer said Gorsuch declined to answer questions such as whether a ban on Muslim immigration would be constitutional or comment on what is known as the Emoluments Clause in the U.S. Constitution that bars officeholders from accepting money from foreign powers. Supreme Court nominees routinely avoid weighing in on pending legal disputes they could end up casting a vote on if confirmed to the job. But Schumer said he was seeking Gorsuchs views on broader principles, rather than specific cases, that he believed a nominee should be able to answer. The judge today avoided answers like the plague, Schumer told reporters. Schumer said Trump is testing the fundamental underpinnings of U.S. democracy and its institutions. These times deserve answers, and Judge Gorsuch did not provide them. I have serious concerns about this nominee, said Schumer, who added that he had not yet made up his mind on whether or not to support Gorsuch. The shorthanded Supreme Court currently has four liberals and four conservatives, meaning Gorsuchs confirmation would reinstate a conservative majority.  Trumps fellow Republicans control the Senate 52-48 but Schumer insisted that Gorsuch would need to win 60 votes, rather than a simple majority, to move toward confirmation. Democrats can seek to use a procedural maneuver to block a confirmation vote if Gorsuchs supporters cannot muster 60 votes, although Republicans could change the Senate rules. Schumers questions to Gorsuch followed Trumps directive to temporarily ban people from seven Muslim-majority countries and any refugees from entering the United States. The ban, which Trump said was needed to protect the United States from Islamist militants, was suspended by a federal judge, pending an appeal by the Trump administration. His questions about the Emoluments Clause come in light of a lawsuit filed by ethics lawyers accusing Trump of allowing his businesses to accept payments from foreign governments, which is prohibited under that constitutional provision. Democrats argued that it is more important than ever for a Supreme Court nominee to demonstrate judicial independence, citing Trumps harsh criticism of federal judges who have issued rulings against him. But Republicans belittled Democratic efforts to discredit Gorsuch. If they keep working to paint Judge Gorsuch as a mouth-breathing bald eagle hunter, theyll embarrass themselves, said Republican Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, who also met with Gorsuch on Tuesday.  Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah told Reuters the Democratic questioning of the nominees potential independence flies in the face of everything I know about Judge Gorsuch. Lee described Gorsuch is fair, decent, impartial. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"
"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": "" NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court is weighing arguments for and against President Donald Trumps temporary travel ban, but its decision this week may not yet answer the underlying legal questions being raised in the fast-moving case.  The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco is expected to rule only on the narrow question of whether a lower courts emergency halt to an executive order by Trump was justified. Trump signed the order on Jan. 27 barring citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries for 90 days and halted all refugee entries for four months.  The appeals court has several options. It could kick the case back to lower court judge James Robart in Seattle, saying it is premature for them to make a ruling before he has had a chance to consider all the evidence. Robart stopped Trumps order just a week after he issued it and before all the arguments had been developed on both sides.  Or the panel of three appellate judges could side with the government and find halting the order was harmful to national security, reinstating it while the case continues.  Their decision is one step in what will be a long, historic case, Stephen Yale-Loehr, a professor at Cornell University Law School who specializes in immigration. Ultimately, the case is likely to end up in the U.S. Supreme Court, legal experts said.  The case is the first serious test of executive authority since Trump became president on Jan. 20, and legal experts said there were three main issues at play for the judiciary.  The broad questions in the case are whether the states have the right to challenge federal immigration laws, how much power the court has to question the presidents national security decisions, and if the order discriminates against Muslims.  Washington state filed the original lawsuit, claiming it was hurt by the ban when students and faculty from state-run universities and corporate employees were stranded overseas.  Trump administration lawyer August Flentje argued at an appeals court hearing on Tuesday that the states lack standing to sue the federal government over immigration law, but his arguments were questioned by the judges.  If the court decides the states are allowed to bring the case, the next major question is about the limits of the presidents power.  Historically courts have been exceedingly deferential to governmental actions in the immigration area, said Jonathan Adler, a Case Western Reserve University School of Law professor. Though, he added, the way they carried it out understandably makes some people, and perhaps some courts, uneasy with applying the traditional rules.  Trump issued the order late on a Friday and caused chaos at airports as officials struggled to quickly change procedures.  At Tuesdays hearing, Judge Richard Clifton, an appointee of Republican president George W. Bush and Judge William Canby, an appointee of Democratic president Jimmy Carter, pushed the government to explain what would happen if Trump simply decided to ban all Muslims from entering the United States. Would anybody be able to challenge that? Canby asked.  Flentje emphasized that the order did not ban Muslims. He said the president made a determination about immigration policy based on a legitimate assessment of risk.  The government has said its order is grounded in a law passed by congress that allows the president to suspend the entry of any class of aliens that he deems would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.  When asked by the third judge - Michelle Friedland, appointed by Democrat Barack Obama - if that meant the presidents decisions are unreviewable Flentje, after a pause, answered yes. When pressed, Flentje acknowledged, however, that constitutional concerns had been raised about the order.  One of the main concerns is allegations by the states, civil rights groups, some lawmakers and citizens that the order discriminates in violation of the constitutions First Amendment, which prohibits favoring one religion over another.  The judges will have to decide whether to look exclusively at the actual text of the presidents order, which does not mention any particular religion, or consider outside comments by Trump and his team to discern their intent.  Washington states attorney Noah Purcell told the hearing that even though the lawsuit is at an early stage, the amount of evidence that Trump intended to discriminate against Muslims is remarkable. It cited Trumps campaign promises of a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.  In a tweet on Monday night, Trump said the threat from radical Islamic terrorism is very real urging the courts to act quickly.  Government lawyer Flentje countered Purcell by saying there was danger in second guessing Trumps decision-making about U.S. security based on some newspaper articles.  Clifton asked about statements on Fox News by Trump adviser Rudolph Giuliani, former New York mayor and former prosecutor, that Trump had asked him to figure out how to make a Muslim ban legal.  Do you deny that in fact the statements attributed to then candidate Trump and to his political advisers and most recently Mr. Giuliani? Clifton asked. Either those types of statements were made or not, said Clifton. If they were made it is potential evidence.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Low gas prices, a desperate need for revenue to fix crumbling roads, and a post-election period that gives politicians the space to tackle controversial issues have breathed life into efforts to raise the taxes, said Carl Davis, research director at the non-partisan Washington D.C.-based Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.  In all, 21 state legislatures will consider bills aimed at increasing gas taxes this year, Davis said. Some states that have gone 10 or 20 or almost 30 years without a gas tax rate increase, and theyve seen the purchasing power of their taxes decimated by inflation. Those rates need to be updated, he said. There are states that have a lot of catching up to do.   Chief among those are five politically conservative, traditionally tax-averse states that have not raised their fuel tax rates since the 1980s or earlier. Alaska, Oklahoma, Mississippi, South Carolina and Tennessee  all of which voted for U.S. President Donald Trump in November  are debating gas tax increases in their state legislatures right now.  As funds and their purchasing power have been depleted over the last few decades, states are coming to realize they have to raise revenues to maintain the transportation assets they have, Kevin Pula, a policy specialist at the National Conference of State Legislatures, told Reuters. Alaska has not increased its fuels tax in almost 47 years and has the lowest rate in the nation. But faced with a budget shortfall, Governor Bill Walker, an independent, has proposed tripling fuel tax rates this session.  In Oklahoma, low oil and gas prices have created an estimated $870 million shortfall in the 2018 fiscal year. Republican Governor Mary Fallin in a speech on Monday proposed increasing the gasoline and diesel excise taxes by 7 cents and 10 cents, respectively, to 24 cents per gallon each.  This increase keeps Oklahomas motor fuel tax rates well below the national average of over 29 cents per gallon, Fallin said.  Mississippi, South Carolina and Tennessee all have gas tax measures in their state legislatures.  Momentum for gasoline tax increases began in 2012. Since then, 19 states have raised their gas taxes including liberal-leaning blue states Massachusetts, Maryland, Vermont and New Jersey. Deep red Wyoming raised its gas tax in 2013, as did fellow conservative states Idaho and Nebraska in 2015.  Even if the states do not pass their gas tax increases this year, they could still eventually become law.  Its very unusual at the state level to see a measure proposed and then immediately enacted, said Joung Lee, an associate director at the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. It usually takes several bites at the apple, he said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Puzders certification from the Office of Government Ethics arrived at the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions exactly two months after Puzder was nominated to the job by President Donald Trump. A spokesman for Puzder, George Thompson, said he expects that Puzder will turn in a separate questionnaire to the committee by Thursday morning. Puzder is the chief executive officer of CKE Restaurants Inc, which owns primarily franchised restaurants including Carls Jr. and Hardees. Tentative plans for Puzders hearing have been repeatedly postponed amid delays with a review by the Office of Government Ethics. Those stem from the complexities surrounding how Puzder will divest himself from CKE Restaurants, which is owned by private equity firm Roark Capital Group. Other companies in Roark Capitals portfolio include Corner Bakery, Cinnabon, Arbys, Carvel and Auntie Annes. Senate Democrats have been highly critical of Puzder, a staunch critic of an overtime rule championed by the former Obama administration. His nomination has sparked protests around the country by some CKE fast-food workers and the union-backed Fight for $15 movement to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Workers from a number of CKEs franchised locations have also complained of wage and hour concerns and other labor conditions in recent weeks. In a letter to Puzder sent on Wednesday before the ethics paperwork was sent to the Senate, the committees ranking Democrat, Patty Murray, said she wanted to receive a detailed account of his plans for recusals, divestments and resignations in order to avoid potential conflicts of interest stemming from his business relationship with Roark Capital Group. The franchise models pervasive presence in the fast food industry, the frequency of serious labor violations connected with franchising and your past or present financial interest in Roark raise questions regarding your ability to faithfully carry out the Department of Labors mandate, Murray wrote.

(Reuters) - A three-judge panel has sided at least temporarily with North Carolina Democratic Governor Roy Cooper in his fight against a Republican-backed attempt to curtail his powers by requiring legislative confirmation of cabinet appointments. The law was among a series of measures approved by lawmakers in December limiting Coopers executive authority after he defeated incumbent Republican Governor Pat McCrory. Cooper sued to block it, arguing that requiring Senate consent to his cabinet secretaries was unprecedented and unconstitutional. In an order Tuesday evening, the trio of state judges said the governor was likely to succeed in his challenge. The court is absolutely correct in their decision and should not be intimidated by threats from legislative leaders, Cooper said in a statement on Wednesday. Eight of the 10 cabinet secretaries for the state have been appointed and sworn in. The temporary restraining order halted a hearing set for Wednesday to review Coopers appointee for secretary of the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs.  Republican lawmakers vowed they would eventually meet to review the cabinet members qualifications and potential conflicts of interests. Republicans have said such confirmation hearings were lawful and would serve as a check on executive power.  Senate leader Phil Berger and House Speaker Tim Moore, both Republicans, said the judges were legislating from the bench and called on them to reverse their order.

The National Resources Defense Council, Communications Workers of America, and Public Citizen said in their lawsuit that the Jan. 30 order would harm the public. They said it would block or force the repeal of regulations needed to protect health, safety, and the environment, across a broad range of topics - from automobile safety, to occupational health, to air pollution, to endangered species. The White House defended the order, saying that it was part of the administrations efforts to help companies create jobs and that the groups are making assumptions about the orders impact.  The lawsuit presumes a lot of outcomes that are wildly inaccurate, White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters at a daily press briefing. He added that over-regulation has hurt economic growth and that reviewing regulations should be welcomed. The order does not apply to most of the financial reform rules introduced by the Obama administration or to rules mandated by statutes.     Republican President Donald Trumps order is a part of his partys larger effort to undo many of the actions of former President Barack Obama, a Democrat who left office last month after two four-year terms.  In Congress, conservative lawmakers have already moved to stamp out five Obama-era rules on corruption, the environment, labor and guns. Companies have lauded the effort to deregulate, saying it will help boost their businesses and the larger U.S. economy. On Wednesday, Tokyo-based SoftBank Group Corp, whose chief executive has backed Trumps efforts, said easing rules will make it easier to do business in the United States. In addition to Trump, Wednesdays lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia named federal departments and agencies, particularly those with jurisdiction over environmental, transportation and energy issues.

Today, I am announcing my run for Governor because I love Illinois, but we have never been in worse shape, Kennedy said in an emailed statement.

Illinois Republican Party spokesman Steven Yaffe said in a statement that Kennedy secretly met with the states House of Representatives Speaker Mike Madigan to kiss his ring.

The question is how long does it take to implement the full replacement of Obamacare, House Speaker Paul Ryan told a news briefing. We hope to get this done as fast as possible. Ryan was responding to questions about Republican President Donald Trumps weekend interview with Fox News in which he said it might take until next year to replace the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, which Republicans consider federal government overreach. Trump and congressional Republicans campaigned on a promise to scrap the 2010 healthcare law. But they are struggling to agree on a replacement for the law, which has enabled up to 20 million previously uninsured Americans to obtain health coverage. Maybe itll take till sometime into next year, Trump said.   On Tuesday at the White House, spokesman Sean Spicer said the administration was optimistic about getting this thing completed by this year. Spicer also said Trump still favors lowering drug prices as part of healthcare reform, with the government negotiating directly with companies on prices to be paid by the Medicare insurance program. Spicer said Trump was committed to using his skills as a businessman to drive pharmaceutical prices down. Ryan said it was important to get U.S. Representative Tom Price confirmed as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services soon, so he too can get to work with replacing the healthcare law. The Senate is expected to confirm Price this week. Ryan said he was not bothered by recent protests against dismantling Obamacare that have taken place at some Republican lawmakers meetings with constituents. Peaceful protests are something we honor in this country, he said. While Republicans voted last month to start scrapping Obamacare, they missed a target date of Jan. 27 to begin drafting legislation. This raised some doubts about how quickly they will be able to undo the complicated law, even though they have the majority in Congress. At a recent congressional retreat, Republican leaders told lawmakers they hoped Congress would legislate the repeal by March or April, as part of a process known as budget reconciliation. But some Republicans, like Representative Tom McClintock, have said they think doing it this way will actually make repealing Obamacare harder and slower, while further disrupting an already faltering healthcare market.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and U.S. President Donald Trump agreed in an overnight phone call on joint action against Islamic State in the Syrian towns of Raqqa and al-Bab, both held by the militants, Turkish presidency sources said on Wednesday. U.S.-Turkish differences during former President Barack Obamas administration impeded the U.S.-led campaign against Islamic State, and closer coordination could mean faster progress towards freeing swathes of northern Syria from IS. Erdogan now hopes that relations with Washington, strained by the presence in the United States of a cleric he blames for an attempted military coup last year and by U.S. support for Kurdish militia in Syria, can be reset under Trump. Turkey has the second largest army in the NATO alliance and is key to any success in rolling back and eventually neutralising IS in Syria and Iraq where IS declared a cross-border caliphate after lightning advances in 2014. Turkey has presented a detailed plan to oust Islamic State from its Raqqa urban stronghold in northeastern Syria and strategy discussions with the Trump administration are under way, according to Erdogans spokesman, Ibrahim Kalin. The operational details were not discussed on this call ... Now detailed planning will be conducted in coordination, he told Turkish broadcaster NTV in an interview. Ankara believes recent IS attacks in Turkey, including a New Years Day shooting in an Istanbul nightclub that killed 39 people, have been steered from al-Bab and Raqqa, and regards a clear-out of the towns as a national security priority. Turkish government and Syrian rebel sources said on Wednesday insurgents backed by Turkeys military had taken the outskirts of al-Bab, northeast of Aleppo. If al-Bab falls, Ankara would strengthen its sway over an area of northern Syria where it has created a de facto buffer zone. Syrian government forces have also advanced on al-Bab from the south, bringing them into close proximity with their Turkish and rebel enemies in one of the most complex battlefields of Syrias six-year-old civil war. But Turkey said international coordination was under way to prevent clashes with Syrian forces. The White House said that in the phone call, Trump spoke about the two countries shared commitment to combating terrorism in all its forms and welcomed Turkish contributions to the fight against Islamic State. But it gave few details. Sources in Erdogans office said the two leaders had touched on issues including a safe zone, as well as the regional migrant crisis and the fight against terrorism. Turkey has long advocated a secure zone for displaced civilians in Syria threatened by Islamist militants or forces fighting for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. They also said Erdogan had urged the United States not to support the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia and that new CIA Director Mike Pompeo would be in Turkey on Thursday to discuss that and other issues with Turkish counterparts. There was no immediate confirmation from Washington of Pompeos visit. But the offices of both leaders said Trump had reiterated U.S. support for Turkey as a strategic partner and NATO ally during Tuesdays phone call. Turkey has long urged world powers to help create a safe zone, which it also sees as a way to purge its border of Islamic State and Kurdish militia fighters, and stem a wave of migration that has caused tensions with Europe.  Obama and U.S. allies balked at the idea, saying it would entail significant ground forces and planes to patrol a no-fly zone, a dicey commitment in such a crowded and messy conflict. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an alliance of U.S.-backed militias, launched a new phase of its campaign against Islamic State in Raqqa on Saturday. Turkey has repeatedly said it wants to be part of the U.S.-led operation to retake Raqqa from the ultra-hardline Sunni militant Islamic State, but does not want the YPG, which is part of the SDF alliance, to be involved. Relations between Erdogan and Obama soured over U.S. support for the YPG, which Ankara regards as a terrorist group and an extension of Kurdish insurgents fighting inside Turkey. The Turkish army and Syrian rebel groups it supports have been fighting IS in a separate campaign around al-Bab, northeast of the city of Aleppo. Ankara has complained in the past about a lack of U.S. support for that campaign. Kalin said there had been better coordination with the U.S.-led coalition on air strikes in the last 10 days. He added that Ankaras priority remained the creation of a safe zone between the Syrian towns of Azaz and Jarablus, a strip of border territory to the north of al-Bab. The Turkish sources said Pompeo would discuss both the YPG and steps against the network of U.S.-based Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey accuses of orchestrating last Julys coup attempt. Gulen denies any involvement. Turkey has been frustrated by what it considers to be  Washingtons reluctance to hand over Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since 1999. As you know, we have two fundamental issues with the U.S. administration inherited from Obamas period. One is the support given to YPG and the other is the (Gulen) problem, Kalin said. Our president spoke about these openly and clearly. Trump was informed on these and, without going into too much detail, he said lets ask our teams to work on this and lets give the necessary instructions.

Trumps Jan. 27 order, which he says is necessary for national security, sought to bar entry by travelers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days, and by all refugees for 120 days, except for refugees from Syria, who face an indefinite ban. The move, which sparked protests and chaos at U.S. and overseas airports, has been suspended by a federal judge in Seattle and is now under intense scrutiny from a U.S. federal appeals court questioning whether it unfairly targeted people over their religion. Chinas government has offered mild criticism of the ban, saying immigration policy was a sovereign right but reasonable concerns must be considered. But the official Xinhua news agency said Trumps order shows that his administration has no correct recognition of the responsibility it needs to shoulder in a global fight against terrorism. Radical elements around the world could use the ban to further justify their ruthless causes, and to gain more recruits, Xinhua said in a commentary. That is a grave threat not only to the safety and security of the United States, but that of others worldwide. Banned countries on the list, such as Iraq, Libya and Syria, have been victimized by terrorism because previous U.S. governments and other Western powers deliberately intervened for self-interests, it added. Such commentaries from Xinhua do not equate to government policy, but often reflect official thinking. The worlds most populous nation generally accepts few refugees. China offered permanent residence to 1,576 foreigners in 2016, the public security ministry has said, but such openings are largely reserved for experts and professionals. China, which says it faces a serious threat from terrorism, has often rebuked the United States and other Western countries for what it considers their double standards on terrorism. Nervous about being implicated in possible human rights abuses, Western nations have been reluctant to cooperate in Chinas campaign in its far western region of Xinjiang, where  officials say Islamist militants aim to set up a separate state. Rights advocates say ethnic violence in the region in recent years is a response to repressive government policies affecting the largely Muslim Uighur people who call Xinjiang home, though China denies rights abuses there.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""NEW YORK (Reuters) - When former reality television contestant Summer Zervos accused Donald Trump of sexual misconduct last fall, she pursued her claims solely in the court of public opinion, since the allegations dated too far back to allow a lawsuit. But last month, she found a fresh approach to fight the former host of The Apprentice, who has vehemently denied her allegations that he groped her in 2007. By professing his innocence, the man who is now president of the United States had effectively called her a liar, Servos alleges in a defamation lawsuit. The suit copied a rare legal tactic employed most notably by several women who have accused the actor and comedian Bill Cosby of sexual assault: using his denials as the basis for a defamation claim. It is not uncommon for high-profile allegations against celebrities to prompt defamation lawsuits, but they are usually filed by the star against the accuser. In 2014, however, Joseph Cammarata, the attorney for Cosby accuser Tamara Green, realized he could adapt that strategy for his own purposes after Cosbys lawyer issued a statement calling the allegations fantastical. Like many other Cosby accusers, Green was unable to sue for assault because the alleged incident occurred decades ago. A direct claim for the assault is not available, so I came up with the idea that a defamation claim would be the appropriate vehicle to use to address the underlying harm, said Cammarata, whose lawsuit now includes seven Cosby accusers as plaintiffs. All told, 10 Cosby accusers filed four defamation lawsuits in three states. In simple terms, the argument is that Trump and Cosby have effectively branded the women as liars by denying the incidents occurred. But the women face a difficult challenge in making their cases, experts say. Merely saying, I didnt do it, is traditionally not seen in defamation law as calling your accuser a liar, even though logically thats what it means, said Rod Smolla, dean of the Delaware Law School and a First Amendment scholar.  But if you go beyond that  if you go from, I didnt do it, to, Shes a liar, now you have arguably made a statement of fact that could be subject to liability, he added. Trumps status as president does not shield him from civil liability for actions he took prior to assuming office. In a statement on Tuesday, the attorney defending Trump in the Zervos lawsuit, Marc Kasowitz, said he and Trumps personal lawyer would soon file a response to the lawsuit. President Trump continues to deny any allegation of wrongdoing raised in said complaint, he said. Cosby, 79, who faces allegations of sexual misconduct from approximately 50 women, has also denied any wrongdoing. The Cosby and Trump plaintiffs are taking on a tough double burden, experts said. First, the only way to show the denials by both men are untrue is to prove the incidents took place as described. The burden is going to be on her to show that Trump is actually saying something thats false, Clay Calvert, a First Amendment expert at the University of Florida, said of Zervos. In addition, the women must show Trump and Crosby crossed the line into defamation by deliberately making false statements that seriously harmed the accusers reputations. In defamation cases, courts typically examine statements to determine whether they were factual or opinion, as expressing an opinion is generally protected by the First Amendment. Making that distinction can be challenging. In the Cosby cases, for instance, judges have split on whether the lawsuits should proceed, even coming to opposite conclusions regarding the same statement from his attorney. U.S. District Judge Mark Mastroianni in Massachusetts rejected Cosbys attempts to have two cases, including Greens lawsuit, thrown out. In his rulings, the judge found that a November 2014 statement from Cosbys lawyer calling the allegations unsubstantiated, fantastical stories could be reasonably seen as factual, and therefore potentially defamatory. By contrast, a Pittsburgh federal judge, Arthur Schwab, tossed a similar case against Cosby, finding that the same statement was pure opinion and thus protected. Unlike Cosby, who has been fairly circumspect in his public statements, Trump has aggressively attacked his accusers, calling the claims 100 percent fabricated and made-up. His rhetoric could make him more vulnerable to a defamation claim, experts said. Trump has said he never met Zervos at a hotel, despite her allegation that he groped her at a hotel in Beverly Hills, California. That type of specific fact-based assertion can also make it easier to show defamation if it can be proven false, according to Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California in Los Angeles. So much depends on the particular statement and the particular context surrounding that statement, he said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON/HOUSTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Army will grant the final permit for the controversial Dakota Access oil pipeline after an order from President Donald Trump to expedite the project despite opposition from Native American tribes and climate activists. In a court filing on Tuesday, the Army said that it would allow the final section of the line to tunnel under North Dakotas Lake Oahe, part of the Missouri River system. This could enable the $3.8 billion pipeline to begin operation as soon as June.   Energy Transfer Partners (ETP.N) is building the 1,170-mile (1,885 km) line to help move crude from the shale oilfields of North Dakota to Illinois en route to the Gulf of Mexico, where many U.S. refineries are located. Protests against the project last year drew drew thousands of people to the North Dakota plains including Native American tribes and environmental activists, and protest camps sprung up. The movement attracted high-profile political and celebrity supporters. The permit was the last bureaucratic hurdle to the pipelines completion, and Tuesdays decision drew praise from supporters of the project and outrage from activists, including promises of a legal challenge from the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. Its great to see this new administration following through on their promises and letting projects go forward to the benefit of American consumers and workers, said John Stoody, spokesman for the Association of Oil Pipe Lines.  The Standing Rock Sioux, which contends the pipeline would desecrate sacred sites and potentially pollute its water source,       vowed to shut pipeline operations down if construction is completed, without elaborating how it would do so. The tribe called on its supporters to protest in Washington on March 10 rather than return to North Dakota. As Native peoples, we have been knocked down again, but we will get back up, the tribe said in the statement. We will rise above the greed and corruption that has plagued our peoples since first contact. We call on the Native Nations of the United States to stand together, unite and fight back. Former President Barack Obamas administration last year delayed completion of the pipeline pending a review of tribal concerns and in December ordered an environmental study. Less than two weeks after Trump ordered a review of the permit request, the Army said in a filing in District Court in Washington D.C. it would cancel that study. The final permit, known as an easement, could come in as little as a day, according to the filing. There was no need for the environmental study as there was already enough information on the potential impact of the pipeline to grant the permit, Robert Speer, acting secretary of the U.S. Army, said in a statement. Trump issued an order on Jan. 24 to expedite both the Dakota Access Pipeline and to revive another controversial multibillion dollar oil artery: Keystone XL. Obamas administration blocked that project in 2015. At the Dakota Access construction site, law enforcement and protesters clashed violently on several occasions throughout the fall. More than 600 people were arrested, and police were criticized for using water cannons in 25-degree Fahrenheit (minus 4-degree Celsius) weather against activists in late November.  The granting of an easement, without any environmental review or tribal consultation, is not the end of this fight, said Tom Goldtooth, executive director of the Indigenous Environmental Network, one of the primary groups protesting the line. It is the new beginning. Expect mass resistance far beyond what Trump has seen so far.  Any legal challenge is likely to be a difficult one for pipeline opponents as presidential authority to grant such permits is generally accepted in the courts. The tribe said in a statement the decision wrongfully terminated environmental study of the project. Deborah Sivas, professor of environmental law at Stanford and director of Stanfords Environmental Law Clinic, said a challenge by the tribe would likely rely on the reasons the Army Corps itself gave for why more review was needed in December. The tribe will probably argue that an abrupt reversal without a sufficient explanation for why the additional analysis is not necessary is arbitrary and should, therefore, be set aside, she said in an email. Supporters say the pipeline is safer than rail or trucks to transport the oil.   Shares of Energy Transfer Partners finished up 20 cents at $39.20, reversing earlier losses on the news.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""LONDON (Reuters) - President Donald Trumps review of post-crisis banking rules could sound the death knell for new global standards now being finalized and rip apart a common approach to regulating international lenders, bankers and regulators said. Central banks and watchdogs around the world have spent the past eight years drawing up regulation aimed at preventing a repeat of the 2007-2009 financial crisis, but there are fears that project could unravel after Trump said he wants the U.S. to row back on capital rules.     Trumps order for a regulatory review to overcome what he sees as obstacles to lending came as banking watchdogs were trying to complete the final piece of global capital requirements, known as Basel III.  Given that the United States wants to shrink the banking rule book, there are doubts over whether the Basel rules can make it over the finishing line next month if they dont have backing from the United States. Without support from the worlds biggest capital market, other countries would be less willing to commit too. The core aim of the outstanding part of Basel III that regulators are working on - dubbed Basel IV by critical banks who worry about more stringent capital requirements - is to impose more consistency into how banks calculate the amount of capital they hold against risky assets like loans.     JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon said in the aftermath of the financial crisis that European rivals had been a lot more aggressive than American banks in calculating capital, meaning they were holding less.      European policymakers have rejected that criticism, but their regions banks have been lobbying against the remaining Basel rules, saying they would force them to increase significantly the amount of capital they need to hold.      If the United States fails to approve the completion of Basel III, the perceived problem that European banks get away with holding less capital than U.S. lenders may not be properly tackled, a source involved in the negotiations said.      Its in the interests of American banks to get this done, the source said. Others are less optimistic that a deal can now be done after Trumps intervention. Its going to delay completing Basel III, and perhaps lead to it not being concluded, an adviser to banks said on condition of anonymity. I do fear that Basel IV is doomed, a banking industry official added. There are headwinds from elsewhere, too. Patrick McHenry, Republican vice chairman of the House financial services committee, fired a warning shot at Federal Reserve Governor Janet Yellen about the Basel talks in a letter dated Jan. 31, ahead of Trumps executive order. The Fed must cease all attempts to negotiate binding standards burdening American business until the Trump Administration has had the opportunity to nominate officials that prioritize Americas best interests, McHenry said.     While lawmakers often call on regulators to ease pressure on firms, regulators said Trumps intervention in banking rules gives more clout to McHenrys warning. The Basel Committee declined to comment. Trumps decision to review existing, post-crisis banking rules has rung alarm bells among regulators outside the country. Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, which regulates the euro zones main lenders, said on Monday that easing banking rules could threaten financial stability. Draghi was chairman of the Group of 20 Economies (G20)  regulatory task force, the Financial Stability Board, which during the financial crisis was instrumental in building up a global approach to reinforcing banking standards. A former regulator said the United States would be scoring an own goal by withdrawing from multilateral bodies like Basel as it would no longer be shaping rules that impinge on U.S. banking competitiveness globally.    Its early days, but what we have seen in language and rhetoric from Washington is worrying, said David Wright, a former top EU official who was part of crisis-era efforts to create the global regulatory consensus.    If you break international consensus, you are effectively opening up a regulatory race and heaven knows where it will end, said Wright, now at Flint Global, which advises companies on regulatory matters. Wright was referring to what was seen in the run-up to the financial crisis, when countries like Britain resorted to a light touch approach to banks to make London a more attractive financial center. Valdis Dombrovskis, the EUs financial services chief, said last week that international regulatory cooperation had been vital in tackling the financial crisis and must continue. Much will hinge on how much regulatory change Trump can actually push through. Former Democratic Congressman Barney Frank, who jointly sponsored the Dodd Frank Act that Trump wants to review, told the BBC last week he does not expect Congress to approve the wholesale rolling back of rules, but the Trump administration could pressure U.S. regulators to ease up on applying existing requirements.    Anil Kashyap, a Bank of England policymaker, said last month that Trumps nomination for the powerful role of Fed Vice Chair in charge of banking supervision would shape the U.S. approach to international rule-making. It will have a huge impact, a regulatory source added.    The fear among global regulators is that multilateral bodies like the Basel Committee and the Financial Stability Board could be abandoned by the United States under Trump. Jose Ignacio Goirigolzarri, chairman of Spains Bankia, told Spanish television on Tuesday he would be concerned if Trump was questioning the usefulness of international banking rules. It would worry me very much because I think its very important, very relevant that there have been advances in the homogenization of regulation amongst developed countries, he said.

Senators Tom Cotton and David Perdue said their bill would cut the number of immigrants granted U.S. residency each year to 500,000 from 1 million, through measures including cutting far back on which relatives can be brought into the country and eliminating a diversity visa lottery. The legislation does not address visas specifically tied to employment, such as the H-1B visas for skilled workers used by many technology companies. Cotton and Perdue said they had consulted Republican President Donald Trump, who vowed to crack down on both illegal and legal immigration during his campaign for the White House. Cotton said he had spoken to Trump about the bill by telephone as recently as Tuesday morning. The measure faces stiff opposition in Congress. Although Trumps fellow Republicans control majorities in both the Senate and House of Representatives, several back comprehensive immigration reform, not a tough crackdown. Republican Senator John McCain said he disagreed with the bill. A long-time advocate for immigration reform, McCain praised the contribution of immigrants to the United States. We need more Sergey Brins and people like that who were born outside of this country and came here, received an education and made enormous progress for all mankind, McCain told reporters, referring to the Google co-founder, who came to the United States as a refugee from Russia. Any measure also would need Democratic support to advance in the Senate, and Democrats, who cite studies showing that immigrants boost the U.S. economy, are strongly opposed. Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen called it wrong and senseless to separate families and cut successful visa programs.  Perdue and Cotton acknowledged the bill would not come up any time soon, saying they hoped for a Senate vote this year. Senator John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said Congress first needed to address border security, but said the new measure will be a helpful constructive proposal. The bill would admit only immediate family members of immigrants, eliminating preferences for adult siblings or adult children. Cotton said it would exclude parents unless they were sick and the family promised not to rely on public benefits. The proposal came amid a larger immigration fight over Trumps travel ban on people from seven Muslim-majority countries and refugees. Cotton said his goal was to stop competition that lowers wages for workers without high school or college degrees. Unless we reverse this trend, we are going to create a near-permanent underclass for whom the American dream is always just out of reach, he said. Asked if the White House would support the legislation and whether it was working with the senators, a spokesman said, We are reviewing it. U.S. companies often argue in favor of immigration.

ForwardKeys, which analyses 16 million flight reservations a day from major global reservation systems, said bookings for international arrivals to the United States over the next three months were 2.3 percent higher than last year. But on Jan. 27, the day Trump issued the executive order, bookings had been 3.4 percent ahead of the previous year, Forwardkeys data showed. When the travel ban was in place from Jan. 28 to Feb. 4, bookings to the United States dropped 6.5 percent, including an 80 percent slump in reservations from the seven countries listed on Trumps order and a 13.6 percent drop from Western Europe. On the day the curbs were lifted by a U.S. judge, bookings from Iran surged, ForwardKeys said, leaving reservations for travel to the United States five times higher on Feb. 3 and Feb. 4 than the same two days a year earlier. Most of those bookings were for arrival in the United States on Feb. 5 and Feb. 6. ForwardKeys CEO Olivier Jager cautioned that the data was just a snapshot of an eight-day period and it would continue to monitor the situation. Other groups, such as the U.N.

The tie-breaking vote, which Senate officials said was unprecedented to confirm a Cabinet nominee, followed an all-night debate on DeVos as Senate Democrats tried to pressure at least one more Republican to oppose her and defeat the nomination. Only two Republicans joined the 46 Democrats and two independents in opposition to DeVos. Critics have called her unprepared to lead the Department of Education after a rocky Senate confirmation hearing. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer immediately derided the proceeding. This cabinet nom is so unqualified, so divisive, that @MikePenceVP had to drive down Pennsylvania Ave to cast the deciding vote, he wrote in a Twitter post after the vote. Under the U.S. Constitution, the vice president also serves as president of the Senate, with the power to cast votes only when there are ties on nominations or legislation. Republican Trump tweeted his congratulations to the nominee and Pence praised her. Todays vote to confirm Education Secretary @BetsyDeVos was a vote for every child having a chance at a world-class education, the vice president wrote in a Twitter post. Ultimately, only Republican Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska joined the Democrats and two independents in opposition to DeVos. That left 50 Republicans supporting her in the 100-member chamber. Historically, Cabinet nominees with weak support in the Senate ask the president to withdraw their nomination, which DeVos did not do. DeVos is married to the heir and former chief executive of Amway, which sells household and personal care items. She is also the daughter of the founders of Prince Corp, a Michigan car parts supplier, and sister of Erik Prince, the founder of the security company formerly known as Blackwater USA, now called Academi. As Monday nights debate wound down, Schumer said of DeVos: She disdains public education where 90 percent of our students are. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, urging her confirmation, said it was time to end the unprecedented delay by Democrats on the Cabinet nominations by Trump, who took office on Jan. 20. DeVos has been an advocate of charter schools, which operate independently of school districts and frequently are run by corporations. Democrats are concerned she will promote charter schools in a way that would undercut public schools, which have long been the anchor of the U.S. education system. Teachers unions, a major constituency for the Democratic Party, roundly opposed DeVos, a philanthropist and investor, to lead the department, which sets education policy for younger children and universities and also administers a college financial aid program of $1 trillion.  The Consumer Federation of America urged DeVos to confront the problem of millions of Americans in default on student loans. The new secretary needs to put borrowers and taxpayers first, rather than focusing on helping the student loan and for-profit college industries pump up their profits, it said. Following the cliffhanger vote on DeVos, the Senate promptly limited debate on Trumps choice of Senator Jeff Sessions to be attorney general. A final vote on Sessions nomination is expected sometime this week. Also up for Senate debate soon are Trumps nominations of Representative Tom Price to be secretary of Health and Human Services and ex-banker Steve Mnuchin to be Treasury secretary. All three face opposition from Senate Democrats. Also facing a rough ride is Trumps choice of Andrew Puzder to be secretary of labor.

The temporary ban ignited international protests as the United States revoked 60,000 visas and detained some travelers who landed in the United States unaware the order had been signed while they were in flight. The desire was to get it out quick so that potentially people that might be coming here to harm us would not take advantage of some period of time that they could jump on an airplane and get here, Kelly told the House of Representatives Committee on Homeland Security.  Kelly took the blame for not briefing Congress on the order before it was announced late on Jan. 27.   This is all on me by the way. I should have delayed it just a bit so that I could talk to members of Congress, he said.  Kelly said the confusion at U.S. airports was caused by court orders challenging the ban that went out the day after it went into effect, adding that his team at the Department of Homeland Security acted swiftly to tweak their operations as necessary. The order was signed also with little or no briefing of U.S. government agents responsible for implementing it, contributing to the confusion. There was also no agreement within the administration for several days over whether green card holders - foreign nationals from the seven targeted countries with permanent U.S. residency - should be admitted. The White House reversed itself later and said those with green cards would be granted waivers to enter the country.  The ban was suspended by a federal judge last Friday, opening a window for refugees and citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen to enter the United States, pending an appeal by the U.S government. Trumps executive order temporarily barred travelers from the seven Muslim-majority countries and all refugees, except refugees from Syria whom he would ban indefinitely. The ban, which Trump says is needed to protect the United States against Islamist militants, sparked condemnation from critics who said it was discriminatory against Muslims and questioned its value as a security measure. All the people who carried out fatal attacks inspired by Islamist militancy in the United States since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks were U.S. citizens or legal residents, the New America think tank says. None came to the United States or were from a family that emigrated from one of the countries listed in the travel ban, it said. (bit.ly/2keSmUO) The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco was due to hear arguments about whether to restore the ban at 3 p.m. PST (2300 GMT). Kelly defended the order, at the hearing, asserting that the seven countries on the list were known to have inadequate systems for sharing information with the United States on their potentially dangerous citizens. He said reports circulated last week that 12 countries could be added to the travel ban were false, adding that no additional countries were being considered.  Kelly also said that funding to cities that refuse to cooperate with immigration agents would only be cut on a case-by-case basis.     Trump had threatened to cut large amounts of federal funding to about 300 so-called sanctuary cities in order to pressure them to cooperate in the apprehension and deportation of illegal immigrants.    Kelly said he did not expect to meet Trumps hiring goals of 5,000 additional U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents and 10,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents within two years.

In separate calls with counterparts from the three long-time allies, they agreed to work closely to tackle threats from North Koreas nuclear ambitions and increased tensions in the East and South China seas, State Department spokesman Mark Toner said, Secretary Tillerson reiterated the Administrations intent to strengthen our military alliances, our economic partnerships, and our diplomatic cooperation, he said in a statement. Tillerson expressed interest in early meetings with his counterparts and expressed his deep respect for their nations contributions to regional security, global prosperity, democratic institutions, and the rule of law, it said. The calls come at a time of raised concerns in the Asia-Pacific about Trumps attitude to the region. During his election campaign, Trump appeared to question  U.S. alliances with Tokyo and Seoul and complained that they were not sharing enough of the cost of the U.S. security umbrella. Trump has also criticized Japans trade policies as damaging to U.S. jobs. More recently ties with Australia were strained after details of an acrimonious phone call between Trump and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull emerged and the former described a deal between the two nations on refugee resettlement as dumb. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is due to visit Washington for a two-day summit with Trump from Friday that is expected to focus on security ties in the face of a rising China and trade. Earlier on Tuesday, Japans Kyodo news agency quoted Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida as saying that Tillerson had confirmed that a long-standing commitment by Washington to defend Japanese territory applies to the Senkakus, a group of small islands that China claims and calls the Diaoyus. The State Department declined to comment on the Kyodo report but U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis reaffirmed Americas commitment to its mutual defense treaty with Japan on Friday when he met Abe in Tokyo and in a call with Abe in late January. Trump said the U.S. security commitment was ironclad. Turnbulls leadership was questioned after he was berated by  Trump and an opinion poll published on Monday showed support for his coalition had slipped to its lowest level since he took power 17 months ago and that his Liberal-National coalition would easily fall if an election were held now.

Republican Representative Jeb Hensarling said he would soon reintroduce his legislation that gives banks a choice between complying with Dodd-Frank and holding more capital. While the bill is expected to easily pass the Republican-led House, it will face resistance in the Senate, where Democrats hold enough seats to filibuster. Pence can cast votes to break ties on legislation. On Friday, Trump ordered a review of Dodd-Franks effects on business and the economy, which raised the possibility he may use his executive powers to block, undo or kill by neglect parts of the law on his own. The law, passed to prevent a repeat of the 2007-09 financial crisis, subjects banks to greater oversight and expands regulation of derivatives. Supporters say it has made the financial system stronger, while critics say it has entangled corporations in regulation that hurts the economy. Hensarling said on Tuesday he had conferred with Trump about his legislation, known as the CHOICE act, and the president seemed to support much of it. While Hensarling used sharp words to describe the agency created by Dodd-Frank to guard individuals against predatory lending, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, he did not say how it would be addressed in his bill.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""JERUSALEM/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and new U.S. President Donald Trump, seizing on an Iranian missile test, are nearing common ground on a tougher U.S. policy towards Tehran ahead of their first face-to-face talks at the White House. But people familiar with the Trump administrations thinking say that its evolving strategy is likely to be aimed not at dismantling Irans July 2015 nuclear deal with six world powers, as presidential candidate Trump sometimes advocated, but tightening its enforcement and pressuring the Islamic Republic into renegotiating key provisions. Options under consideration, they say, would include wider scrutiny of Irans compliance by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog, including access to Iranian military sites, and seeking to remove sunset terms that allow some curbs on Iranian nuclear activity to start expiring in 10 years and lift other limits after 15 years. In a shift of position for Netanyahu, all signs in Israel point to him being on board with the emerging U.S. plan, though it may prove impossible to get other world powers and Iran to consider revising the landmark nuclear deal. Two years ago, Netanyahu infuriated the Obama White House by addressing the U.S. Congress to rally hawkish opposition to a budding Iran pact he condemned as a historic mistake that should be torn up. As Trump and Netanyahu prepare for their Feb. 15 meeting, focus has shifted to Irans ballistic missile test last week. The White House said the missile launch was not a direct breach of the nuclear deal but violates the spirit of that.  Trump responded by slapping fresh sanctions on individuals and entities, some of them linked to Irans elite Revolutionary Guards (IRGC). A U.N. Security Council resolution underpinning the nuclear pact urges Iran to refrain from testing missiles designed to be able to carry nuclear warheads, but imposes no obligation. However, Trump tweeted, Iran is playing with fire and they dont appreciate how kind President Obama was to them. Not me! Trumps national security adviser, Michael Flynn, warned that Washington would no longer tolerate Irans provocations. Netanyahu appreciated the comments. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Irans supreme leader, on Tuesday dismissed the U.S. decision to put Iran on notice over its missile tests and called Trump the real face of American corruption. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif was quoted as saying Iran would not renegotiate the nuclear deal. Beyond the rhetoric, the missile test gave the new Republican president and the conservative Israeli leader - who had an often acrimonious relationship with Trumps Democratic predecessor Barack Obama - an early chance to show they are on the same page in seeking to restrain Iranian military ambitions. Netanyahu wrote on Facebook last week: At my upcoming meeting with President Trump in Washington, I intend to raise the renewal of sanctions against Iran in this context and in other contexts. Iranian aggression must not go unanswered. In London for talks with British Prime Minister Theresa May on Monday, Netanyahu said responsible nations should follow  Trumps imposition of new sanctions as Iran remained a deadly menace to Israel and threatens the world. But he stopped short of any call to cancel the nuclear accord. Israeli officials privately acknowledged that he would not advocate ripping up a deal that has been emphatically  reaffirmed by the other big power signatories - Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China - since Trumps election victory. Russia said on Monday it disagreed with Trumps assessment of Iran as the number one terrorist state and a Russian diplomat said any move to rework the nuclear pact would inflame Middle East tensions. Dont try to fix what is not broken, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said. Trumps stance could weaken the hand of pragmatists in Tehran who have been willing to negotiate a detente with the West after decades of volatile confrontation, a former senior Iranian official said. Under the accord, Tehran received relief from global economic sanctions and in return committed to capping its uranium enrichment well below the level needed for bomb-grade material, cutting the number of its centrifuge enrichment machines by two-thirds, reducing its enriched uranium stockpile and submitting to a more intrusive IAEA inspections regime. Diplomats close to the IAEA consider the deal a success so far, voicing little concern with overall Iranian compliance - despite Netanyahus insistence that it will only pave the Islamic Republics path towards nuclear weapons once major restrictions expire 15 years after its signing. With German, French and British firms busy cultivating new business with Iran, Washingtons peers in the six-power group almost surely would rebuff any U.S. thrust to reopen the deal. Daniel Shapiro, who recently ended his tenure as U.S. ambassador to Israel under Obama, told Reuters he would be surprised if Trump and Netanyahu determined so early in the time working together that they would rather scrap that agreement than try to enforce it in a tough manner and put other pressures unrelated to that deal on the Iranians. Some foreign policy expertssay U.S. efforts to tighten the screws on Iran could seek to goad it into ditching the nuclear accord in hopes that Tehran - and not Washington - would then have to shoulder international blame for its collapse. According to Israels Haaretz newspaper, an Israeli intelligence assessment recently presented to Netanyahu said revoking the pact would be an error, causing a chasm between Washington and other signatories like Russia and China. Amos Yadlin, former head of Israeli military intelligence, said there were many areas outside the deal where pressure could be applied on Iran to change what he called its negative behavior of subversiveness, supporting terrorism. But beyond new sanctions and sharpened rhetoric, analysts say,it is unclear how far Trump could go. Arguments for restraint would include the risk of military escalation in the Gulf, out of which 40 percent of the worlds seaborne crude oil is shipped, and strong European support for the nuclear deal. Though the new U.S. strategy is in the early stages of development, the Trump administration, the sources say, is considering arange of measures, including seeking zero tolerance for any Iranian violations. Trumps aides accused the Obama administration of turning a blind eye to some alleged Iranian infractions to avoid anything that would undermine confidence in the integrity of the deal. Obama administration officials denied being soft on Iran. Other U.S. strategy options, the sources say, include sanctioning Iranian industries that aid missile development and designating as a terrorist group the Revolutionary Guards, accused by U.S. officials of fuelling Middle East proxy wars. That designation could also dissuade foreign investment in Iran because the Guards oversee a sprawling business empire there. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Some conservative states, such as Georgia, had expressed concerns that the Obama administration move amounted to a federal takeover of elections traditionally run by state and local governments. The designation means voting machines, voter registration systems, polling places and other assets important to holding elections are eligible for priority cyber-security assistance from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). I believe we should help all of the states ... to make sure that their systems are protected in future elections, Kelly told the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Homeland Security in response to a question from Democratic U.S. Representative Cedric Richmond. I would argue that, yes, we should keep that in place. Last month, two weeks before then-President Barack Obama, a Democrat, left office, DHS said it was designating state election systems part of the nations critical infrastructure, a move that broadened the options the federal government has to protect voting equipment from cyber attacks. Other sectors considered critical infrastructure include communication and transportation systems, the banking industry and the energy grid. The 2016 presidential campaign was marred by the hacking and subsequent leaking of Democratic emails that U.S. intelligence agencies concluded were carried out by Russia in order to help now-President Donald Trump, a Republican, win. U.S. officials determined Russian hackers also targeted more than 20 states voter registration systems during the election but that there was no evidence that tallies were altered when ballots were cast on Nov. 8. Some Republican-controlled states had argued against the change, saying elections in the United States have always been carried out by state and local officials and that the federal government should not play a direct role in them. Separately on Tuesday, Republicans on the House Administration Committee voted to eliminate the federal Election Assistance Commission, which is charged with ensuring that voting machines meet security standards. The commission was itself penetrated by a Russian-speaking hacker last year after the Nov. 8 U.S. elections, according to security firm Recorded Future.

The lawsuit was filed in Oklahoma court by the Center for Media and Democracy and accuses Scott Pruitt, who is Oklahomas attorney general as well as Trumps nominee to become the top U.S. environmental regulator, of violating the states Open Records Act by failing to release those emails to the public. It also seeks to force him to respond to nine open-records requests dating to January 2015 to publish emails between his office and energy companies. Pruitts office has received more than four dozen similar requests from other groups. His inaction denies the public prompt and reasonable access to public documents and violates Oklahomas Open Records Act, said Robert Nelon, a first amendment lawyer with Hall Estill, the law firm representing the Center for Media and Democracy along with the American Civil Liberties Union. The media watchdogs first request sought access to more than 3,000 emails. Pruitts office has not told the group how many records it has identified for the other eight requests it has pending. We are doing this because these emails should be released so that people can properly vet his record before the Senate votes to confirm him, said Nick Surgey, the centers director of research. Pruitt, 48, sued the agency he intends to run 14 times on behalf of Oklahoma to weaken or gut its key regulations, earning him strong support from energy companies and Republican lawmakers who have accused the Obama administrations EPA of regulatory overreach. On Thursday, the Senate environment committee approved Pruitt despite a boycott of his nomination by the panels Democratic members. The full Senate, which is under Republican control, is expected to confirm him but has not set a date for the vote. The lawsuit submitted on Tuesday calls on the court to stop Pruitt from denying access to requested public records and to prevent his office from destroying any documents relevant to the requests. Surgey said Pruitt was seemingly unapologetic during the confirmation hearings about his strong relationships with Oklahomas oil and gas companies and that the public should be aware his ties to the types of companies he would need to regulate as EPA administrator. Pruitts office said it had contacted the Center for Media and Democracy last week to inform the group that release of their request was imminent. The fact that they have now filed suit despite our ongoing communications demonstrates that this is nothing more than political theater, Lincoln Ferguson, the attorney generals press secretary said in a statement. The office of attorney general remains committed to fulfilling both the letter and spirit of the Open Records Act. Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, a member of the Senate panel that held Pruitts hearing, accused the nominee of stonewalling the request for information about his relationships with industry.

The issue of civil asset forfeiture, created to disrupt the activities of organized crime groups, arose when sheriffs from around the United States told Trump at a White House meeting that they were under pressure to ease the practice. Id like to look into that, Trump said. Theres no reason for that. In 2016, a group of Republican and Democratic lawmakers introduced a bill, which did not become law, that would have required the government to do more to show that seized property was connected to a crime. Critics have said suspects have few avenues to challenge the seizures and that forfeiture laws were sometimes abused. Police in some cases seize property from people who are never charged or convicted. Trump, a Republican, asked acting U.S. Attorney General Dana Boente, who was at the gathering, whether executive orders or legislation were needed to support forfeiture. Boente said that was unnecessary but law enforcement agencies needed encouragement. Trump voiced disagreement with lawmakers who want to change asset forfeiture laws, and some of the sheriffs laughed when Trump suggested he might want to destroy the career of one Texas legislator. He said members of the U.S. Congress would get beat up really badly by the voters if they interfered with law enforcements activities. Later, Sheriff Harold Eavenson of Rockwall County, Texas, told Trump of his response to a state lawmaker who had introduced legislation requiring suspects first be convicted before assets could be seized. I told him that the cartel would build a monument to him in Mexico if he could get that legislation passed, Eavenson said. Who was the state senator? Trump asked.  You want to give his name? Well destroy his career, the president deadpanned, to laughter. Eavenson did not identify the lawmaker, but a Republican state senator has introduced similar legislation in Texas.

Andrew Puzder, chief executive officer of CKE Restaurants Inc, is one of several Trump nominees who face strong opposition from Senate Democrats and progressive groups. In a statement late on Monday, Puzder said he and his wife had employed a housekeeper for a few years without being aware that she was not legally permitted to work in the United States. When I learned of her status, we immediately ended her employment and offered her assistance in getting legal status, he said in the statement. He said he paid back taxes for employing the maid to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and to California.  The statement was first reported by the Huffington Post. Senator Lamar Alexander, chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, the panel that will vet Puzders nomination, said in a statement that Puzder had reported his mistake and voluntarily corrected it. I do not believe that this should disqualify him from being a cabinet secretary, he added. The disclosure came as Senate Democrats held an all-night session in a final attempt to block the nomination of Betsy DeVos, the billionaire school-choice champion whom Trump nominated to be education secretary.  Puzders tentative date for a confirmation hearing has been repeatedly postponed, as the committee awaited completion of an ethics review by the Office of Government Ethics. As of Tuesday, the committee had still not received any of the necessary paperwork on Puzders nomination, though the Federal Bureau of Investigation background check had been completed, according to a committee aide. Senator Patty Murray, the ranking Democrat on the panel, said on Tuesday she was troubled by the delay and by stories from workers for CKEs primarily franchised fast-food restaurants who have come forward in recent weeks to complain about wage theft and other labor conditions. If Mr. Puzder ever does come before our committee, hes going to have a lot of explaining to do, she said. Puzders nomination has sparked protests around the country by some CKE fast-food workers and the union-backed Fight for $15 movement to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Puzder has criticized an overtime rule championed by the Obama administration and opposes raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Additionally, some of CKEs racy advertisements featuring women in bikinis have caused Democrats to ask questions about how Puzder will address sexual harassment in the workplace. It is unclear whether the issues with hiring an undocumented worker could impede Puzders confirmation. Wilbur Ross, Trumps pick for commerce secretary, admitted last month that he recently fired a household employee who could not provide proof of legal status.  A Senate panel later approved his nomination. He was awaiting confirmation by the full Senate. However, previous presidential appointees have run into problems over immigrant labor - including two former nominees under Republican President George W. Bush and a previous nominee under Democratic President Bill Clinton.  All three of those nominees withdrew their names for consideration after the news came to light.

Their comments came after Trump criticized James Robart, the U.S. district court judge who put on hold the Republican presidents Jan. 27 order temporarily barring entry into the United States of people from seven Muslim-majority nations and halting the U.S. refugee program. Trump called Robart a so-called judge who made a ridiculous decision. Democrats have expressed worry that Gorsuch, nominated by Trump last week, could act as a rubber stamp for the Republican presidents policies on a nine-seat Supreme Court poised to revert to a conservative majority.  Its a serious concern with a president who attacks the judiciary and seems to not respect the rule of law and the Constitution that you have a really independent justice, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, set to meet with Gorsuch on Tuesday, told Reuters. Gorsuch, continuing a series of private meetings with senators ahead of his Judiciary Committee confirmation hearings, met on Monday with Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the panels top Democrat, at her Senate office. Afterward, she said Gorsuch is clearly very smart, caring, and hes well thought of in Colorado, where he serves as a federal appeals court judge. But Feinstein said she will make up her mind after the hearing about whether or not to support his confirmation. What we would like to see is an independent judge, and the hearing will determine that, Feinstein told Reuters. Gorsuch must be confirmed by the Senate to the lifetime post on the high court. Its incumbent upon Judge Gorsuch to make it clear to the American people that he does not believe in so-called judges, that he thinks its imperative that the judiciary has to be respected as an independent one-third of our government,     said Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination last year. I would look forward to hearing him speak out on that issue, Sanders added. Conservative lawyers and Republican senators who are favorable toward Gorsuch cite his record of supporting limited federal powers and his skepticism about courts deferring too much to executive branch interpretations of the law when issuing regulations as signs he would be willing to stand up to Trump. I have zero concerns about his independence being compromised, said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, a Republican who sits on the Judiciary Committee. Mississippi Senator Roger Wicker, another Republican, said Gorsuch has a trail of decisions and publications a mile long that suggest how talented he is, that are instructive as to how he would rule on any number of issues.  With four liberals and four conservatives now on the court, Gorsuchs confirmation would restore the conservative majority that had existed for decades until the death last year of Justice Antonin Scalia. Gorsuchs supporters point in particular to a recent case in which Gorsuch criticized a landmark high court ruling known as Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council. That 1984 ruling directed judges nationwide to defer to federal agencies interpretation of laws that may be ambiguous. Gorsuch in a concurring opinion called that doctrine the elephant in the room that concentrates federal power in a way that seems more than a little difficult to square with the Constitution. If Gorsuch is confirmed to serve on a court that would have five conservatives and four liberals, Democrats have expressed concern about setbacks for their positions on divisive issues such as abortion, gun control, environmental regulation and transgender rights.

President Trumps threat to weaponize federal funding is not only unconstitutional but emblematic of the cruelty he seeks to impose on our most vulnerable communities, state Senate Pro Tem Kevin de Leon, a Democrat from Los Angeles, said in a statement on Monday. State Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon, an L.A.-area Democrat, said the state has the most manufacturing jobs in the nation, and produces a quarter of the countrys food. If this is what Donald Trump thinks is out of control, Id suggest other states should be more like us, Rendon said.  The latest war of words between Trump and Democratic leaders in California, where voters chose his opponent, Hillary Clinton, two-to-one in Novembers election, began Sunday, in an interview between Trump and Fox News host Bill OReilly. During the interview, OReilly asked Trump about a bill in the state legislature, authored by de Leon, to ban law enforcement agencies in the state from cooperating with immigration officials in most circumstances. Cities who have enacted similar bans are known as sanctuary cities, and de Leons bill, if passed and signed into law by Democratic Governor Jerry Brown, would effectively extend such rules to the entire state. Trump disparaged the bill as ridiculous, saying that sanctuary cities breed crime. Well have to, well, de-fund, Trump said. We give tremendous amounts of money to California. Trump went on to say he viewed funding as a weapon. California in many ways is out of control, Trump said to OReilly. Obviously the voters agree or otherwise they wouldnt have voted for me. Last week, Trump threatened to withhold federal funding from the University of California at Berkeley, where violent protests led to the cancellation of a speech by an editor for the right-wing Breitbart News. But experts said it would be difficult for the President to withhold funds from either the university or the state. Court rulings have limited the power of the president to punish states by withholding funds, and most appropriations come from the Congress and not the executive branch.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - More than 100 companies, including most of high-techs biggest names, joined a legal brief opposing President Donald Trumps temporary travel ban, arguing that it would give companies strong incentives to move jobs outside the United States. The companies - including Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Google Inc  (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) - banded together late on Sunday to file a friend-of-the-court brief with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. They argued that the executive order temporarily banning citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries and all refugees inflicts significant harm on American business. Elon Musks Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and SpaceX were among other companies signing onto the brief on Monday, raising the number of signatories to 127.  Musk is among the few tech executives on Trumps business advisory council. He has been forced to defend his participation in recent days, particularly since Uber Technologies Incs [UBER.UL] chief executive, Travis Kalanick, quit the group on Thursday following the travel ban.  The new Republican presidents Jan. 27 executive order sparked protests and chaos at U.S. and overseas airports in the weekend that followed. Trump has defended the ban as necessary to ensure tougher vetting of people coming into the United States and better protect the country from the threat of terror attacks.  On Friday, U.S District Judge James Robart in Seattle, ruling on a lawsuit challenging the order filed by Washington state and Minnesota, temporarily lifted the ban. The federal government appealed the decision, which was heavily criticized by Trump.  In their brief, the companies argued that the order created uncertainty for companies depending on talent from overseas and global business travel to innovate and create jobs in the United States. Highly skilled immigrants will be more interested in working abroad, in places where they and their colleagues can travel freely and with assurance that their immigration status will not suddenly be revoked, the brief said. Multinational companies will have strong incentives ... to base operations outside the United States or to move or hire employees and make investments abroad. Ultimately, American workers and the economy will suffer as a result, the companies argued. A major theme of Trumps 2016 presidential campaign was bringing back jobs he said had been moved to other countries.  Responding to the lawsuit, the federal government argued in legal filings that the president was exercising his constitutional authority to control U.S. borders and that the law allows him to suspend the entry of any class of foreigners who would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.  Companies that initially joined the brief included Facebook Inc (FB.O), Twitter Inc (TWTR.N), Intel Corp (INTC.O), eBay Inc (EBAY.O), Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL], as well as non-tech corporations such as Levi Strauss & Co [LEVST.UL] and Chobani Llc.  The brief hailed the contributions inclusive immigration policies have made to the American economy. It said that immigrants or their children have founded more than 200 of the companies on the Fortune 500 list.  Trumps agenda on immigration, trade, cyber security, tax reform and other issues has caused deep consternation in the tech industry. Before the travel ban, most companies said they wanted to work with him and avoided any direct confrontations. But the immigration restrictions provoked a broad backlash in Silicon Valley, where foreign-born nationals are an integral part of the tech economy. There have been peaceful protests at Google and Facebook. Uber was the target of a boycott, and scrambled to reassure its many immigrant drivers that it was on their side. Partly because of pressure from their rank-and-file, big tech companies have separated themselves from much of corporate America in directly confronting Trump policies. Only a handful of non-tech companies joined the friend-of-the-court brief, though some of the lawyers involved said that was mainly because the group came together very quickly through personal contacts.

The House passed the measure by a voice vote. But the legislation was expected to encounter resistance in the Senate, where it failed to advance last year amid opposition by a handful of Republican lawmakers after the House passed it unanimously.  Technology companies such as Microsoft (MSFT.O) have lobbied Congress for years to pass the Email Privacy Act, which updates a decades-old law to force authorities to first get a warrant to access emails or other digital communications that are at least 180 days old.

Supporters of the bill passed Monday say it is needed to update an out of date law conceived and written before the rise of the commercial internet.  Richard Salgado, director of law enforcement and information security at Google (GOOGL.O), said in a statement the measure would fix a constitutional flaw in the ECPA. While there are disagreements about other aspects of surveillance reform, there is no disagreement that emails and electronic content deserve Fourth Amendment protections, he said.  But some senators, including No. 2 Republican John Cornyn, last year sought to use the legislation as a vehicle for amendments that would expand the FBIs domestic surveillance capabilities, effectively killing the bill.  Debate over law enforcement access to Americans electronic communications intensified last year when the FBI sought a court order to make Apple help unlock an encrypted iPhone linked to one of the shooters behind a deadly attack in San Bernardino, California.  Privacy advocates have expressed alarm at President Donald Trumps ability to expand government spying. The Republican campaigned on a law and order platform that included suggestions he may want to place some mosques in the United States under surveillance and maintain a national database on Muslims.  Microsoft last year filed a federal lawsuit against the Justice Department over ECPA, alleging that the governments use of the law violated the U.S. constitution.  It argued that ECPA is too often used to prevent companies from notifying its users, sometimes indefinitely, when investigators pry into emails and other data stored on remote servers.

Over 400 former EPA staff members sent a letter to the U.S. Senate asking it to reject the nomination of Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt as the agencys new leader, saying he has shown no interest in enforcing environmental laws. In Chicago, around 30 employees of the EPAs regional office there joined a protest organized by the Sierra Club environmental group and the American Federation of Government Employees to protest Pruitts nomination. Doug Eriksen, a spokesman for Trumps transition team at the EPA, downplayed the Chicago protest, saying employees have a right to take action on their private time.     Trump has vowed to cut regulation to revive the oil, gas and coal industries, and has said he can do so without compromising air and water quality. He nominated Pruitt, who has sued the EPA more than a dozen times as Oklahomas top prosecutor to block its regulations, to run the agency, sparking alarm among Democrats and environmentalists. Last Thursday, the Senate environment committee approved Pruitt despite a boycott of his nomination by the panels Democratic members. He is expected to be confirmed by the full Senate, in Republican control after last Novembers election, but a date for the vote has not been set.  The former EPA employees who sent the letter to the Senate wrote that they believed Pruitt has a history of siding with industry and has been reluctant to accept the strong scientific consensus on climate change. Employees at the Chicago rally raised concerns that Pruitt may cut employees and resources needed for the agency to enforce environmental regulations.  The EPA needs to be able to enforce the rules when companies are breaking the law, said Sherry Estes, an EPA lawyer who participated in the protest.

The comments by Republican Representative Mac Thornberry followed new U.S. sanctions against Iran after Tehrans recent ballistic missile tests. Washington is also concerned North Korea may be preparing to test a new ballistic missile. Thornberrys position was a sign of support in Congress for military spending to counter North Korea after President Donald Trump during the 2016 election campaign raised doubts about future U.S. funding to defend allies like South Korea and Japan. If you look at whats happening around the world, I would mention Iran and North Korea, the importance of missile defense is increasing, Thornberry said at a roundtable discussion with reporters. He said there was a need both to provide more systems and to improve missile defense technology. Actors around the world are building missiles that are harder to stop, he added. Jim Mattis, Trumps defense secretary, told South Korea last week that Washington and Seoul would stand shoulder-to-shoulder to face the threat from North Korea. Both South Korea and the United States have recommitted to plans to deploy an $800 million advanced missile defense system in South Korea later this year. More broadly, Thornberry also said he expected an end to strict limits on defense spending now that Republicans control both Congress and the White House. The 2011 Budget Control Act imposed across-the-board cuts on government spending, and under former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, congressional Democrats were able to ward off Republican pushes to increase the defense budget without also raising spending on non-defense items such as education and medical research. I think we have a tremendous opportunity to do the right thing, Thornberry said. Theres more of the federal budget being looked at, in play, if you will, than has been the case for many years. The Trump administration is expected within weeks to send Congress a request for a supplemental bill to increase defense spending this year. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

More than 1.8 million people in Britain have signed a petition calling for Trumps planned visit to be canceled or downgraded to avoid embarrassing Queen Elizabeth, part of a grassroots backlash against his immigration policies. Prime Minister Theresa May has defended the decision to offer a state visit, but more than 150 lawmakers have signed a symbolic motion calling for Trump not to be given the honor of speaking in parliament. Asked by an opposition Labour lawmaker about the possibility of a parliamentary address, House of Commons speaker John Bercow said he shared the concerns. As far as this place (parliament) is concerned, I feel very strongly that our opposition to racism and to sexism and our support for equality before the law and an independent judiciary are hugely important considerations, Bercow said, earning a round of applause from lawmakers. Trumps executive order barring entry to the United States for refugees and people from seven Muslim-majority countries has prompted worldwide protests, including by thousands of demonstrators in London. The temporary immigration ban faced a legal hurdle on Monday that could determine whether he can push through the most controversial and far reaching policy of his first two weeks in office. As one of the key figures whose approval would be needed for a parliamentary address, Bercow said he would oppose any possible move to invite Trump to speak in either of the two locations which host foreign leaders during state visits. In 2011, Trumps predecessor Barack Obama became the first U.S. president to address both houses of parliament in Westminster Hall, the oldest building in the parliamentary palace, which has also hosted South Africas Nelson Mandela and Frances Charles de Gaulle. Before the imposition of the migrant ban, I would myself have been strongly opposed to an address by President Trump in Westminster Hall. After the imposition of the migrant ban by President Trump, I am even more strongly opposed to an address by President Trump in Westminster Hall, Bercow said.

In a 52-47 vote, the Republican-controlled Senate approved a resolution to eradicate a rule requiring companies such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron Corp to publicly state taxes and other fees paid to foreign governments like Russia.  The House of Representatives already passed the measure. President Donald Trump is expected to sign it within days. On Thursday, the Senate repealed a rule that would have limited coal companies from dumping waste into streams.  After a number of legal battles, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in June 2016 completed the regulation, which supporters said could help expose questionable financial ties U.S. companies may have with foreign governments. Senate Democrats raised concerns that Exxons chief executive during those legal fights was Rex Tillerson, who was recently confirmed as U.S. secretary of state and has worked extensively in Russia. It should be lost on no one that in less than 48 hours, the Republican-controlled Senate has confirmed the former head of ExxonMobil to serve as our secretary of state, and repealed a key anti-corruption rule that Exxon Mobil and the American Petroleum Institute have erroneously fought for years, Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland said, referring to the oil industrys trade group. Exxon and other major energy corporations fought for years to block the rule, required by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law.  Cardin, the senior Democrat on the foreign relations committee, wrote the Dodd-Frank section on the payments to foreign governments with Richard Lugar, a former Republican senator. Critics of the rule said it duplicated existing regulations,  was too costly and burdensome for companies to implement and that it put U.S. companies at a competitive disadvantage with state-owned companies in other countries that do not have to divulge such information. The change could give American companies an edge over Canadian and European companies that face some of the toughest transparency rules in the world.  Republicans have taken advantage of a seldom-used law known as the Congressional Review Act to overturn recently enacted rules with simple majorities in both chambers, denying senators the opportunity to filibuster and stall a vote.  Democrats said Republicans were using the review act to help companies not the public. When it comes to giving public resources to private interests and gutting our nations health, environmental and financial standards, the Republicans cant seem to act fast enough, said Representative Raul Grijalva. Whoever theyre doing this for, it isnt the American public.       The Congressional Review Act also bars agencies from revisiting overturned rules, which could pose a legal conundrum for the SEC, which is required by law to enact a payments regulation. The Senate will next consider repealing a rule limiting venting and leaking of the powerful greenhouse gas methane by oil and gas drillers on federal and tribal lands, mostly in the U.S. West. The repeal was passed by the Republican-controlled House on Friday.  The Interior Department finalized the methane rule in November. The oil industry has argued that it would add to costs for new and existing wells. Environmentalists have said the rule would protect human health and return more than $800 million in royalties to taxpayers over 10 years.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

In a series of tweets that broadened his attack on the countrys judiciary, Trump said Americans should blame U.S. District Judge James Robart and the court system if anything happened. Trump did not elaborate on what threats the country potentially faced. He added that he had told the Department of Homeland Security to check people coming into our country VERY CAREFULLY. The courts are making the job very difficult! The Republican president labeled Robart a so-called judge on Saturday, a day after the Seattle jurist issued a temporary restraining order that prevented enforcement of a 90-day ban on citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen and a 120-day bar on all refugees. A U.S. appeals court later on Saturday denied the governments request for an immediate stay of the ruling. Vice President Mike Pence defended Trump earlier on Sunday, even as some Republicans encouraged the businessman-turned-politician to tone down his broadsides against the judicial branch of government. The president of the United States has every right to criticize the other two branches of government, Pence said on NBCs Meet the Press program. It is unusual for a sitting president to attack a member of the judiciary, which the U.S. Constitution designates as a check on the power of the executive branch and Congress. U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Trump seems intent on precipitating a constitutional crisis. Some Republicans also expressed discomfort with the situation. I think it is best not to single out judges for criticism, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on CNNs State of the Union program. We all get disappointed from time to time at the outcome in courts on things that we care about. But I think it is best to avoid criticizing judges individually. Republican Senator Ben Sasse, a vocal critic of Trump, was less restrained. We dont have so-called judges ... we dont have so-called presidents, we have people from three different branches of government who take an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution, he said on the ABC News program This Week.     The ruling by Robart, appointed by former Republican President George W. Bush, coupled with the decision by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco to deny the governments request for an immediate stay of the ruling dealt a blow to Trump barely two weeks into his presidency.  It could also be the precursor to months of legal challenges to his push to clamp down on immigration, including through the construction of a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border, and complicate the confirmation battle of his U.S. Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch. The Senates top Democrat, Chuck Schumer, said on Saturday that Gorsuch, a conservative federal appeals court judge from Colorado, must meet a higher bar to show his independence from the president. Trump, who during his presidential campaign called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States, has vowed to reinstate his controversial travel ban. He says the measures are needed to protect the United States from Islamist militants. Critics say they are unjustified and discriminatory. The legal limbo will prevail at least until the federal appeals court rules on the governments application for an emergency stay of Robarts ruling. The court was awaiting further submissions from the states of Washington and Minnesota on Sunday, and from the federal government on Monday. The final filing was due at 5 p.m. PST on Monday (0100 GMT on Tuesday). The uncertainty has created what may be a short-lived opportunity for travelers from the seven affected countries as well as refugees to get into the United States.   Sara Yarjani, an Iranian student with a U.S. visa who was attempting to return to Los Angeles to visit her parents, was among those who boarded flights to the United States after learning that Trumps travel ban had been blocked. Her visa had been stamped revoked and she was sent back to Vienna last week. She was slated to arrive in Los Angeles on Sunday, according to her sister, Sahara Muranovic.  This is our only window, Muranovic said. Maybe theyll blow it again by Monday. Trumps Jan. 27 travel restrictions have drawn protests in the United States, provoked criticism from U.S. allies and created chaos for thousands of people who have, in some cases, spent years seeking asylum. Reacting to the latest court ruling, Iraqi government spokesman Saad al-Hadithi said: It is a move in the right direction to solve the problems that it caused. In his ruling on Friday, Robart questioned the use of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States as a justification for the ban, saying no attacks had been carried out on U.S. soil by individuals from the seven affected countries since then. For Trumps order to be constitutional, Robart said, it had to be based in fact, as opposed to fiction. The 9/11 attacks were carried out by hijackers from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Lebanon, whose nationals were not affected by the order. In a series of tweets on Saturday, Trump attacked Hobarts opinion as ridiculous. What is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into U.S.? he asked. Trump told reporters at his private Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida late on Saturday: Well win. For the safety of the country well win. The Justice Departments appeal criticized Robarts reasoning, saying the ruling violated the separation of powers and stepped on the presidents authority as commander-in-chief. It said the state of Washington lacked standing to challenge Trumps order and denied it favors Christians at the expense of Muslims.The U.S. State Department and Department of Homeland Security said they were complying with Robarts ruling and many visitors were expected to start arriving on Sunday, while the government said it expected to begin admitting refugees again onMonday. A spokesman for the International Organization for Migration, Leonard Doyle, confirmed on Sunday that about 2,000 refugees were ready to travel to the United States. We expect a small number of refugees to arrive in the U.S. on Monday, Feb. 6th. They are mainly from Jordan and include people fleeing war and persecution in Syria, he said in an email. Iraqi Fuad Sharef, his wife and three children spent two years obtaining U.S. visas. They had packed up to move to America last week, but were turned back to Iraq after a failed attempt to board a U.S.-bound flight from Cairo. On Sunday, the family checked in for a Turkish Airlines flight to New York from Istanbul. Yeah, we are very excited. We are very happy, Sharef told Reuters TV. Finally, we have been cleared.

Many of those caught up in Trumps travel ban last weekend took advantage of a federal judges order temporarily suspending the order to complete their disrupted journeys to the United States. Trump faces an uphill battle to overcome a federal judges temporary hold on his travel ban, but the outcome of a ruling on the executive orders ultimate legality is less certain, experts say Several technology companies plan to send a letter Trump on Monday urging his administration to follow through on proposed changes to the travel ban, sources familiar with the letter say. Washington states lawsuit challenging Trumps executive order on immigration emerged out of a chaotic, 48-hour period in which the need for immediate action held sway over the kind of carefully thought-out strategizing that usually leads up to the filing of a major legal complaint, according to state Attorney General Bob Ferguson and other attorneys involved in actions against the order. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel says he was reassured after meetings last week with top U.S. officials that the United States is committed to a united Europe and to the NATO alliance. Despite declarations of unity at a recent European Union summit in Malta, EU countries are split on how to respond to policies from Trump, who has reversed staunch postwar U.S. support for European integration and suggested others follow Britain out of a bloc he has called a vehicle for Germany. Trumps first two weeks in office have left some European politicians leaders aghast but are drawing cheers from Frances far-right National Front, as its leader, Marine Le Pen, launches her own bid for power. The governor of Colorado says he believes the Cuban government wants to further improve relations with the United States under Trump, as he wraps up a three-day visit to the Communist-run island nation.

Any appeals of decisions by U.S. District Court Judge James Robart in Seattle face a regional court dominated by liberal-leaning judges who might not be sympathetic to Trumps rationale for the ban, and a currently shorthanded Supreme Court split 4-4 between liberals and conservatives. The temporary restraining order Robart issued on Friday in Seattle, which applies nationwide, gives him time to consider the case in more detail, but also sends a signal that he is likely to impose a more permanent injunction.    The Trump administration has appealed that order. The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said late on Saturday that it would not decide whether to lift the judges ruling, as requested by the U.S. government, until it receives briefs from both sides, with the administrations filing due on Monday. Appeals courts are generally leery of upending the status quo, which in this case - for now - is the suspension of the ban.  The upheaval prompted by the new Republican administrations initial announcement of the ban on Jan. 27, with travelers detained at airports upon entering the country, would potentially be kickstarted again if Robarts stay was lifted. The appeals court might also take into account the fact that there are several other cases around the country challenging the ban. If it were to overturn the district courts decision, another judge somewhere else in the United States could impose a new order, setting off a new cascade of court filings.  If the appeals court upholds the order, the administration could immediately ask the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene. But the high court is generally reluctant to get involved in cases at a preliminary stage, legal experts said. The high court is short one justice, as it has been for a year, leaving it split between liberals and conservatives. Any emergency request by the administration would need five votes to be granted, meaning at least one of the liberals would have to vote in favor.  I think the courts going to feel every reason to stay on the sidelines as long as possible, said Steve Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law. Trump last week nominated a conservative appeals court judge, Neil Gorsuch, to fill the vacancy, but he will not be sitting on the Supreme Court for at least two months. Gorsuchs vote, if he is confirmed by the U.S. Senate, could come into play if the case were to reach the court at a later stage of the litigation. Once the case proceeds past the injunction stage of the litigation and onto the merits of whether the order is legally sound, legal experts differ over how strong the governments case would be.  Richard Primus, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Michigan Law School, said the administration could struggle to convince courts that the ban was justified by national security concerns.  The Supreme Court has previously rejected the idea that the government does not need to offer a basis for its actions in the national security context, including the landmark 1971 Pentagon Papers case, in which the administration of President Richard Nixon tried unsuccessfully to prevent the press from publishing information about United States policy toward Vietnam. The governments argument so far in support of the order is pretty weak, Primus said. Jonathan Adler, a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law, said the administration has legal precedent on its side, with the courts generally deferential to executive action on immigration.  However, he said it is unusual for the courts to be asked to endorse a policy that appears to have been adopted in as kind of haphazard and arbitrary way as this one appears to have been.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": "" (Corrects first paragraph to make it jurist instead of justice as Robart is not a justice) By Mica Rosenberg and Nathan Layne (Reuters) - U.S. Judge James Robart emerged from relative obscurity on Saturday as the first jurist to come under fire from the president since he took office after his temporary order to lift Donald Trumps immigration ban. In a reaction that went viral on Twitter, Trump called the 69-year-old Robart a so-called judge whose ridiculous opinion essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country. To those who know Robart, who has been on the federal bench in Seattle for more than a decade after his appointment by another Republican, President George W. Bush, the ensuing drama surrounding the move was a far cry from the judges standard. He is relatively apolitical, said Douglas Adkins, a private equity investor and former investment banker who has known Robart since childhood. Hes not a conservative or a liberal. Hes a man interested in the law and fairness. Late on Friday, Robart grabbed national headlines with his decision to temporarily lift Trumps week-old travel ban for citizens of seven mainly Muslim countries and refugees. His ruling was just a first step in considering the merits of the case challenging the ban. The Justice Department on Saturday filed a formal notice that it intends to appeal the ruling. As a candidate, Trump had criticized federal judge Gonzalo Curiel, who was overseeing a case against his Trump University - arguing Curiel could not be impartial because of his Mexican heritage and Trumps vow to crack down on Mexican immigrants. But by lashing out at Robart as president, Trumps anti-judiciary stance takes on new importance: it hits at the very heart of the checks and balances system meant to protect the country from government abuse of power.         Coincidentally, in his wide-reaching ruling on Friday, Robart emphasized that the three branches of government - the executive branch, Congress and the judiciary - should function as equals. The work of the Judiciary, and this court, is limited to ensuring that the actions taken by the other two branches comport with our countrys laws, and more importantly, our constitution, Robart wrote.  Reached by email, Robart declined to comment on Trumps tweets. A graduate of Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington, and Georgetown University Law Center, Robart spent 30 years in private practice at the law firm now known as Lane Powell, before being appointed to the bench by Bush in 2004. Adkins said Robart and his wife have no children but have been foster parents to several immigrant children over the years, primarily from Southeast Asia. Robart could not be reached for comment.  The judge served in the past as the president of the Seattle Childrens Home and was a former trustee of the Childrens Home Society of Washington, according to his official biography on the federal court website. Those organizations provide mental health services for at-risk youth and help troubled families. His involvement with children may have helped contribute to his understanding of the people impacted by this ruling but would not have shaped his interpretation of the rule of law, said Paul Lawrence, who was one of the attorneys who filed an amicus brief backing Washington State in the immigration case. During his confirmation hearing, Robart recalled providing pro-bono legal services early in his career to people who in many times felt that the legal system was stacked against them. He said he learned that the law could be, if properly used, an opportunity for them to seek redress if they had been wronged, according to a transcript of the testimony. Often sporting bow-ties with his black robes, Robart is known for saying from the bench in 2016 that black lives matter. He cited the statement popularized by protesters during a hearing about a 2012 consent decree with the federal government that required the Seattle police department to address allegations of bias and excessive force. In 2011, Robart put a temporary hold on a state rule change that would have cut government funding for disabled children and families in Washington.  When faced with a conflict between the financial and budgetary concerns ... and the preventable human suffering, Robart wrote in that opinion, the balance of hardships tips in the favor of preventing human suffering. Adkins said he thought his friend would be able to take Trumps attacks in stride. His view is that criticism is important, said Adkins.   ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

(Reuters) - President Donald Trump said in remarks broadcast on Sunday that he would put Vice President Mike Pence in charge of a commission to probe what he believes was voter fraud in last Novembers election.\t\t There is an overwhelming consensus among state officials, election experts, and politicians that voter fraud is rare in the United States, but Trump has repeatedly said he thinks perhaps millions of votes cast in the Nov. 8 election were fraudulent. Im going to set up a commission to be headed by Vice President Pence and were going to look at it very, very carefully, Trump told Fox News Channels Bill OReilly in an interview taped on Friday. Trump, who was spending the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, captured the presidency by winning enough of the state-by-state Electoral College votes to defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton. Still, Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes, piling up an overwhelming majority in deeply Democratic states like California. This has irked Trump and as a result he has claimed voter fraud without evidence. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said on CNNs State of the Union that election fraud does occur but that there is no evidence that it occurred in such a significant number that would have changed the presidential election.

The ruling given late on Saturday denied a request from the U.S. Department of Justice to immediately restore Trumps order, which a judge in Washington state had blocked on Friday. It is a move in the right direction to solve the problems that it caused, the Iraqi spokesman, Saad al-Hadithi, told Reuters. Trumps executive order last week put a 120-day halt on the U.S. refugee program, barred Syrian refugees indefinitely and imposed a 90-day suspension on people from seven majority Muslim countries - Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Religious minorities persecuted by the Islamic State group, and other Iraqis fleeing violence, were among those affected. The ban would have prevented a total of 20,000 people in precarious circumstances in the seven countries targeted from  resettling in the U.S. during the 120 days covered by the suspension, according to the United Nations. Baghdad protested against the ban, calling it unfair and saying that no Iraqi had been involved in attacks on U.S. soil. But it refrained from retaliating as it seeks to maintain U.S. support for Iraqi forces battling Islamic State in Mosul. The U.S. has more than 5,000 troops deployed in Iraq, providing critical air and ground support for Iraqi and Kurdish forces fighting the militants, who declared a self-styled caliphate over parts of Syria and Iraq in 2014.

They seemed eager for the chance to build a relationship with President Trump and have it be a constructive one, Governor John Hickenlooper, a Democrat, said of his meeting with Cubas point person for U.S. relations, JosefinaVidal. He said in an interview that Vidal, director of U.S. affairs at the Cuban foreign ministry, and other foreign ministry officials were cautiously optimistic. They realize they have to wait and that the new administration has a lot of things going on. They understand things could change in some ways, but I didnt sense there was any fear or some sort of depression, the governor said. Hickenlooper, who traveled with a cultural and business delegation, was the highest-ranking elected U.S. official to meet with Vidal since Trump assumed office last month. Trump has said he wanted a better deal than that brokered by his predecessor, Barack Obama. On Friday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said a full review of Americas foreign policy toward Cuba was underway. Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro stunned the world in December 2014 when they announced the two governments would restore diplomatic ties after more than 50 years of Cold War hostilities and work to normalize relations. The Colorado governor said the purpose of his trip was to view post-Fidel Castro Cuba and invite the country to his states Biennial of the Americas, which brings together the cultures, businesses and ideas of North and South America. Hickenlooper said the Cubans had enthusiastically accepted the invitation to attend the event in September. Hickenlooper said he did not doubt many innocent people were hurt during the early years of the Revolution, but most of those involved had passed away. The younger people seem eager to build a relationship with the United States, he said. The governor, a former entrepreneur and restaurant owner, spent a day meeting with small business owners and said he had visited five private eateries. I was surprised.

Buoyed by Trumps election and Britains shock Brexit vote to quit the European Union, the anti-immigration, anti-EU FN hopes Le Pen can ride the same populist wave to victory in this springs presidential election. Since taking office on Jan. 20, Trump has moved quickly to implement his America First vision by pulling out of a Pacific trade deal, barring travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries and confirming his intention to build a wall along the border with Mexico, among a flurry of other executive orders, though the travel ban has since been blocked by a judge. His actions have provoked condemnation from some European governments and prompted one EU leader, European Council President Donald Tusk, to say he poses a threat to the bloc, alongside Russia, China and Islamist militants. But they win approving responses from members of the FN, which favors curbing migration, rejecting international trade treaties and introducing intelligent protectionism to support  French firms. What surprises me is not what Donald Trump does, but that people are surprised that a candidate elected on a program actually implements it, said Victor Birra, a 23-year-old business school student. Here, politicians have been elected for 40 years on manifestos they never implement, said Birra, who heads the FN youth section in the city of Lyon, where Le Pen launched her campaign at the weekend. I think its a good thing that he puts Americans first. Claire Richert, a 69 year-old retired teacher who joined the FN three years ago, agreed. Hes taking measures to protect his country against terrorism and thats a good thing, she said. She said a similar ban could help protect France, where Islamic State militants have killed more than 230 people in a series of attacks over the past two years. The FN is not the only group in Europe to be embracing Trump. Austrias far-right Freedom Party and the former leader of the UK Independence Party, Nigel Farage, are among his fans. Le Pen herself was spotted on a visit to the Trump Tower in New York last month. Top FN officials share the rank-and-files positive view of the new U.S. president. Hes been implementing some measures weve had in our program for a long time, so we wont say were surprised or opposed to it, said Jean Messiha, who has been overseeing the drafting of Le Pens presidential manifesto. Hes doing it the American way and there are some things we wouldnt do here, he said. But he added: Each should do as they wish in their own country according to their countrys best interest. Opinion polls suggest 48-year-old Le Pen is likely to follow in the footsteps of her father Jean-Marie, who made it through to the run-off of the 2002 presidential election but was defeated by Jacques Chirac. Current surveys show she is likely to lose in the second round to independent centrist Emmanuel Macron, who has surged at the expense of scandal-hit conservative candidate Francois Fillon. But after Trumps shock win over Hillary Clinton in November, Le Pen supporters believe anything can happen. We were told that it was absolutely impossible for Trump to win the election. He was elected, said William Penel, a 24-year-old bank employee from Marseille. We were told the British would never leave the European Union ... but the Brexit was voted for.

European Union leaders meeting in Malta found themselves taking sides, between their summit chairman, our Donald Tusk, and the new U.S. president, Donald Trump. But despite declarations of unity, EU states are split on how to respond to policies from a man who has reversed staunch postwar U.S. support for European integration and suggested others follow Britain out of a bloc he has called a vehicle for Germany. Tusk, a former Polish prime minister, said EU leaders gave him the our Donald nickname in Malta. He presented it as a sign of their support, saying before the summit that Trump posed a threat to the bloc, alongside Russia, China and violent Islam. The mood in the room was our Donald and the other Donald, said one person present at the talks, where Tusk also felt confident enough in his support to confirm he wants a second term as president of the European Council. His political enemies in the Warsaw government publicly disavowed any sense of unanimity behind Tusk, however, calling his criticism of Trump a gross abuse and accusing him of sowing fear and seeking confrontation.  Others, less publicly, said there was wider disquiet that the EU could turn its back on its Transatlantic relationship. Such internal arguments pit historic unease, especially in France, over U.S. influence against fears of weakening a Western front against Russia and, increasingly, China. How they play out will help shape Trumps hopes, for example, of saving U.S. money spent on NATO and shifting world trade in Americans favor. They will also flavor the EUs Brexit talks with London - where Prime Minister Theresa May sees Britain being a bridge between Washington and Brussels - as well as efforts by some states to tighten cooperation on euro zone economic policies and other areas, notably an independent EU military capability. As a Pole well aware it is U.S. forces that underpin NATOs security guarantees in eastern Europe, Tusk nuanced his call to Europeans to pull together to defend their independent interests against the superpowers, the United States, Russia and China with an appeal to Americans to preserve the Transatlantic bond without which global order and peace cannot survive. But some leaders worry Trumps coolness toward NATO and the exit of well-armed Britain will fuel ambitions for Europeans to loosen that bond - notably in Paris, which has often chafed at Anglo-American influence and where officials say Trump shows France has been right to seek strategic autonomy for the EU. The French ... are as usual saying Its just the European Union now; theres no such thing as the West, said a senior eastern European diplomat, criticizing Pariss view.  The Germans are much more cautious. There is a clear issue to be decided on whether we should seek a common ground to engage with the United States, or turn our backs. As EU leaders prepare to map out a post-Brexit strategy at a 60th anniversary summit in Rome next month, French President Francois Hollande criticized Trump and eastern European governments he accused of raking in EU subsidies but then breaking ranks and undermining the bloc by seeking special favor from Washington. Many in the east are especially alarmed by Trumps warmer tone toward Russia but some back his entry ban on Muslims, which echoes their own criticisms of EU refugee policies. German Chancellor Angela Merkel took a less confrontational tone but stressed the need for multilateralism - a prod to Trump not to try and circumvent the EU by talking only to national leaders, and to Europeans to speak with a single voice. Whether the other Donald gets that message is another matter, given a seemingly hazy grasp on who is who in Brussels. The tycoon-turned-president told an interviewer last month he had spoken to the head of the European Union and named his interlocutor as Jean-Claude Juncker, the EU chief executive.  In fact, however, he had spoken to our Donald, Tusk.  Sometimes I have an impression that the new administration does not know the EU in detail, Juncker said drily on Friday.

Well win. For the safety of the country, well win, he told reporters at his private Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, shortly after the Justice Department filed a notice that it intends to appeal the order. Trumps personal attack on U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle went too far for some who said the president was undermining an institution designed to check the power of the White House and Congress. The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned! Trump said on Twitter early on Saturday. Trump has said extreme vetting of refugees and immigrants is needed to prevent terrorist attacks. Throughout the day, Trump continued to criticize the decision in tweets. Late Saturday, Trump showed no signs of backing down. The judge opens up our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interests at heart. Bad people are very happy! he tweeted. As the ban lifted, refugees and thousands of travelers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen who had been stopped in their tracks last weekend by Trumps executive order scrambled to get flights to quickly enter the United States. The Justice Department did not say when it would file its appeal with the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals of the ruling made by Robart late on Friday that also lifted Trumps temporary ban imposed on refugee admissions. The judge appointed by former Republican President George W. Bush questioned the constitutionality of Trumps order.  The three-judge panel that will decide whether to immediately block the ruling includes appointees of George W. Bush and two former Democratic presidents, Jimmy Carter and Barack Obama. Trumps tweets criticizing the judges decision could make it tougher for Justice Department attorneys as they seek to defend the executive order in Washington state and other courts, said Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University, adding that presidents are usually circumspect about commenting on government litigation. Its hard for the president to demand that courts respect his inherent authority when he is disrespecting the inherent authority of the judiciary. That certainly tends to poison the well for litigation, Turley said. U.S. immigration advocacy groups including the American Civil Liberties Union and International Refugee Assistance Project on Saturday in a joint statement urged those with now valid visas from the seven nations to consider rebooking travel to the United States immediately because the ruling could be overturned or put on hold. A U.S. State Department email reviewed by Reuters said the department is working to begin admitting refugees including Syrians as soon as Monday. It is unusual for a president to attack a member of the judiciary, which the U.S. Constitution designates as a check to the power of the executive branch and Congress. Reached by email Saturday, Robart declined comment on Trumps tweets. Democratic U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont said in a statement Saturday that Trumps hostility toward the rule of law is not just embarrassing, it is dangerous. He seems intent on precipitating a constitutional crisis. Read the so-called Constitution, tweeted Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence committee. In an interview with ABC scheduled to air on Sunday, Vice President Mike Pence said he did not think that Trumps criticisms of the judge undermined the separation of powers. I think the American people are very accustomed to this president speaking his mind and speaking very straight with them, Pence said, according to an excerpt of the interview. The court ruling was the first move in what could be months of legal challenges to Trumps push to clamp down on immigration. His order set off chaos last week at airports across the United States where travelers were stranded and thousands of people gathered to protest. Americans are divided over Trumps order. A Reuters/Ipsos poll this week showed 49 percent favored it while 41 percent did not. Wes Parker, a retiree from Long Beach, California, held a sign saying Trump is love at the Los Angeles International Airport, and said he supported the tighter measures. We just have to support the travel pause, said Parker, 62. If you were a new president coming in, wouldnt you want what you feel safe with? Rights groups, Democrats and U.S. allies have condemned the travel ban as discriminatory. On Saturday, there were protests against the immigrant curb in Washington, New York, Los Angeles and other cities. At the White House, hundreds of protesters chanted Donald, Donald cant you see? Youre not welcome in D.C. The sudden reversal of the ban catapulted would-be immigrants back to airports, with uncertainty over how long the window to enter the United States will remain open. In Erbil, the capital of the Kurdish region of northern Iraq, Fuad Sharef and his family prepared to fly on Saturday to Istanbul and then New York before starting a new life in Nashville, Tennessee. I am very happy that we are going to travel today. Finally, we made it, said Sharef, who was stopped from boarding a New York-bound flight last week. The Department of Homeland Security said on Saturday it would return to its normal procedures for screening travelers  but that the Justice Department would file for an emergency stay of the order at the earliest possible time. Some travelers told Reuters they were cautious about the sudden change. I will not say if I have hope or not. I wait, watch and then I build my hopes, said Josephine Abu Assaleh, 60, who was stopped from entering the United States after landing in Philadelphia last week with five members of her family. We left the matter with the lawyers. When they tell us the decision has been canceled, we will decide whether to go back or not, she told Reuters in Damascus, speaking by telephone. Virtually all refugees also were barred by Trumps order, upending the lives of thousands of people who have spent years seeking asylum in the United States. Friday nights court decision sent refugee advocacy and resettlement agencies scrambling to help people in the pipeline. Iraqi refugee Nizar al-Qassab, 52, told Reuters in Lebanon that his family had been due to travel to the United States for resettlement on Jan. 31. The trip was canceled two days before that and he was now waiting for a phone call from U.N. officials overseeing their case.  Its in Gods hands, he said.

Robarts ruling came in a case brought by the state attorney general of Washington state and was backed by major state employers Amazon.com Inc and Expedia Inc.. The lawsuit is one of several now filed against the Trump executive order around the United States, but it was the first case leading to a broad decision that applies nationwide. The Justice Department appeal criticized Robarts legal reasoning, saying it violates the separation of powers and steps on the presidents authority as commander chief. The appeal said the state of Washington lacked standing to challenge the order and denied that the order favors Christians at the expense of Muslims. Congress gave the president the unreviewable authority to suspend the admission of any class of visitor, the Justice Department wrote. Courts are particularly ill-equipped to second-guess the presidents prospective judgment about future risks, the appeal said, calling the decision vastly overbroad. Washington state lawyers worked around the clock last weekend against the backdrop of turbulent scenes at U.S. airports, where immigrants were detained by federal officials unprepared to implement the presidents directive. A spokesman for Washington state attorney general Bob Ferguson didnt immediately comment early Sunday.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department on Saturday moved to begin admitting refugees, including Syrians, as soon as Monday after a federal judge on Friday blocked a Trump administration temporary ban on refugee admissions.An email from the State Departments refugee office reviewed by Reuters Saturday said the U.S. government is working with its legal team and interagency and overseas partners to comply with the ruling. Trumps Jan. 27 executive order had suspended refugee admissions for 120 days and indefinitely barred Syrian refugees but U.S. Judge James Robart in Seattle on Friday blocked the presidents order. A U.S. State Department official told Reuters on Saturday that officials expect some refugees to arrive Monday. The U.S. instructed the International Organization for Migration to rebook refugees of all nationalities, including Syrians, who were to schedule to arrive since the Trumps order was signed, the email said. We are focusing on booking refugee travel through February 17. We are asking that arrivals resume this Monday, the first normal travel day of the week, if possible.  We are aware that some refugees may not be ready to depart on short notice, the email said. A United Nations spokesman, Leonard Doyle, told the New York Times about 2,000 refugees were ready to travel. Refugees do not usually enter on weekends, a U.S. official said, as the department hews to a strict set of rules on how their admissions are processed.  Other travelers from seven Muslim majority countries affected by President Donald Trumps week-old curb on immigration can rework their flights after the judges order, as long as they have valid visas.  Refugees fleeing war, hunger and persecution have less autonomy. Advocates working on their behalf urged the government to move quickly on admitting them.       International Refugee Assistance Project Director Becca Heller called for the instant resumption of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program to immediately take the most vulnerable refugees out of harms way. During the week of the ban, the government admitted 843 refugees - but no Syrian refugees, government figures show. Officials previously told Reuters that they were in transit and had already been cleared for resettlement before the ban took effect. For refugee families, they are trying to keep expectations in check and hope they do not end up back where they started.  Ayham Oubeid, a Syrian living in Cleveland, has been waiting for over a year for his brother Georges family to come to the United States as refugees. His brother, who has health issues, is living in Dubai on a work visa that covers him, his six-year-old daughter and five-months pregnant wife. George left his job and moved the family out of their apartment when he was told they would be resettled in the United States on Feb. 13. But the familys plane tickets were canceled when Trump announced the temporary ban. Without Georges job, the family could lose the work visa and be sent back to Syria in the midst of its deadly civil war. Upon hearing of the judges ruling from Friday, Oubeid called George. He was careful not to be too hopeful, knowing the judges order could be overturned. I dont want to get excited. I dont want my brother to get excited. Because it was hard for him when he lost everything and was told he couldnt come, Oubeid said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"
"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""SEATTLE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson arrived in Seattle last Saturday after a trip to Florida, public outrage over the immigration order issued the previous day by President Donald Trump was quickly growing. He went home, greeted his family and then went to work.  By late Monday afternoon, just minutes before the court closed for the day, Ferguson, a Democrat, and his team of lawyers were ready to file the first state lawsuit seeking to block the order. On Friday, they won a dramatic courtroom victory when U.S. District Judge James Robart put on hold the travel ban for refugees and citizens of seven mainly Muslim countries. The lawsuit emerged out of a chaotic 48-hour period in which the need for immediate action held sway over the kind of carefully thought-out strategizing that usually leads up to a major legal complaint being filed, according to Ferguson and other attorneys involved in actions against the order. We knew we had one shot, Ferguson said in an interview, in reference to the bid for a temporary restraining that would immediately overturn Trumps executive order. The lawsuit is one of several now filed against the executive order around the United States, but it was the first case leading to a broad decision that applies nationwide.  The fight over the immigration order is just the first of what is likely to be a series of court battles between Democratic attorneys general, the top legal officers in liberal-leaning states, and the administration. Several attorneys general have already said they expect to sue Trump on various issues if he oversteps his authority, including on the environment and consumer protection. President Trump on Saturday ridiculed Judge Robart, a George W. Bush appointee, and his decision. The Justice Department filed a formal appeal. The Washington state lawyers worked around the clock last Saturday and Sunday against the backdrop of turbulent scenes at U.S. airports, where immigrants were detained by federal officials unprepared to implement the presidents directive. There was little time to coordinate with other states, though ultimately one other state, Minnesota, joined the effort. Additional states, including Virginia, New York and Hawaii, have filed their own lawsuits or sought to intervene in cases brought by individuals affected by the ban. State attorneys general did not collectively decide to let Washington file first for any strategic advantage, Ferguson said. Rather, Washington was able most quickly to marshal evidence of the harm Trumps order caused to the state, which is crucial to establish legal standing.  Ferguson called the general counsels at major Washington employers Amazon.com Inc. and Expedia Inc. for their support. The companies eventually filed sworn statements in court saying the ban hurt their businesses.     The state lawyers also gathered information on the harm to state residents and institutions such as the university system, which the judge appeared to find persuasive. The legal assault on the order has involved Ferguson and other Democratic lawyers taking a leaf from the play-book followed by Republican states that successfully challenged actions taken by Trumps predecessor, former President Barack Obama. Washington states claims rely in part on the same legal arguments that Texas and 25 other Republican-led states made when they challenged Obamas November 2014 plan to protect up to four million immigrants from deportation. In that case, the Republican states argued that Obama overstepped his constitutional powers by infringing upon the authority of Congress.  Washington and other states say Trump has violated the Constitution too, albeit on different grounds. They say he has violated protections against discrimination on the basis of religion by targeting Muslims. The state has a responsibility to protect the health, safety, and well-being of all its residents, the lawsuit said. In the 2014 case, Texas, like Washington state in the Trump case, asked for a nationwide injunction.  Where the fight against Trumps order differs from the Texas challenge to Obama is that various lawsuits have been filed around the country by states and civil rights groups. The Texas case was a single lawsuit that the other states joined. ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt said there was little time to talk strategy among the many states and advocacy groups opposing the order, as would normally happen. Its moving too quickly, he said. That sense of urgency was all too clear to Washington state lawyers on Monday as they feverishly gathered the required documents to file with the lawsuit, including the motion for a temporary restraining order. Unlike other court papers filed electronically, a paper copy of that motion had to be delivered to the clerks office in person. So Noah Purcell, the solicitor general, led a race to the Seattle courthouse with others from the office just as the building was about to close. They pulled up to the courthouse, jumped out of the car and ran up the steps to the doors before they were locked. They arrived just in time. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Ecclestone, 86, was replaced by American Chase Carey on Jan. 23 as chief executive of Formula One and appointed Emeritus Chairman - a position without a clearly defined role for the Briton. Liberty have, however, said they hope Ecclestone will continue to offer advice to the board. If it had been me in the case of Liberty, Id have kept Bernie on to do the things that hes superbly good at - such as dealing with the promoters and the organizers and all that side of it, Mosley told Reuters. The Briton, a close ally of Ecclestone while running the governing body, said Liberty could have concentrated on doing the things that up to now have not been done in Formula One such as virtual reality and digital technology. But of course they bought a business and are fully entitled to come in and think they can run the whole business better and well just have to see what happens, added the 76-year-old, speaking at F1s annual Zoom charity auction on Friday night. Mosley, who stood down as president of the International Automobile Federation in 2009, cautioned against too much rapid change in the sport. Liberty have spoken about increasing the number of grands prix, particularly in the Americas, changing the weekend format and giving every round of the championship the Super Bowl treatment. Carey, who has appointed former ESPN executive Sean Bratches to run the commercial side with former Mercedes principal Ross Brawn overseeing motorsport matters, has spoken of F1 being like 21 Super Bowls in a season. Youve always got to be careful, if it aint broke dont fix it. But they are fully aware of that, said Mosley. They (Liberty) are serious business people. Whether they can deal with everything better than they could have dealt with it using Bernie for the things hes good at, and then doing the things that they know about, is an open question. We shall see. Mosley agreed that Liberty had plenty on their plate in the coming months and might find a few bumps in the road ahead despite their undoubted expertise. It always looks easy from the outside, he warned. Its like if I think I could go and fix horse racing. But if you actually go and try and do it, you find there are a whole mass of problems you never even knew about. But maybe they will be very successful and get the job done. With Super Bowl 51 coming up in Houston on Sunday, Mosley was also wary of comparisons between how the National Football League spectacular is presented over the course of a week and grand prix racing. I think thats easy to say, its not quite clear to me what that means, he said of the suggestion that every race could be treated like a Super Bowl, with more razzamatazz and events leading up to it. But the Super Bowl...is that so wonderful? I dont want to be unkind, but Americans always think they can do everything better than anybody else.

Mattis reiterated that provocations by North Korea, which is advancing its nuclear weapons and missile programs, as well as Chinas growing assertiveness in the South and East China Seas, left no room for doubt about U.S. commitment to Japans defense. That was similar to the message that Mattis - making his first overseas trip since taking office - delivered in South Korea, Washingtons other key Asian ally, earlier in the week. He appeared eager to reassure Japan of U.S. resolve, after a 2016 election campaign in which Trump suggested both South Korea and Japan were benefiting from a U.S. security umbrella without sharing enough of the costs. The U.S.-Japan alliance is critical to ensuring that this region remains safe and secure  not just now, but for years to come, Mattis told a joint news conference with Japanese Defense Minister Tomomi Inada. But in what could been seen as a subtle prod to Japan to do more, he added: But make no mistake: in my meetings with Japanese leaders, both our nations recognize that we must not be found complacent in the face of the emerging challenges we face. As our alliance grows, it will be important for both our nations to continue investing in our defense personnel and capabilities. Mattis said Tokyos financial support for U.S. troops in Japan had been a model of cost-sharing while Inada told the same news conference there had been no discussion of whether Japan should increase that funding. Mattis also noted that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has increased defense spending since taking office in December 2012, a move he said was on the right track. Japans defense spending is around 1 percent of gross domestic product, compared to around 2 percent for China and over 3 percent for the United States. DEEPER THREE-WAY TIES Mattis also repeated that Trumps administration would adhere to Washingtons commitment to defend disputed East China Sea islands that are under Japanese control but claimed also by China, an assurance that Tokyo has been keen to hear. Inada said she told Mattis that Japan would play a proactive security role, in line with legal changes enacted under Abe that eased the limits of its pacifist constitution on its militarys operations overseas. At the start of her talks with Mattis, Inada said she hoped his visit to Seoul and Tokyo would deepen three-way security ties. Japans relations with South Korea have frayed recently due to a feud over wartime history, just as tensions over North Korea make cooperation vital. South Korea is an important neighbor, Inada said.  I want to link Secretary Mattis visit to Japan and South Korea to the further deepening of defense cooperation among the three countries.  Japans relations with South Korea have frayed recently due to a feud over wartime history, just as tensions over North Korea make cooperation between the two allies vital. Japan last month temporarily recalled its ambassador to South Korea over a statue near the Japanese consulate in Busan city commemorating Korean comfort women. The term comfort women is a euphemism for women forced to work in Japanese military brothels.

President Donald Trump has vowed a more aggressive policy against Tehran and his administration is warning of concrete action if Iran does not curb its ballistic missile program and continues support in regional proxy conflicts. The United States announced new sanctions on Friday, just two days after the Trump administration put Iran on notice following a ballistic missile test. Mattis said putting Iran on notice was worthwhile, given its behavior. As far as Iran goes, this is the single biggest state sponsor of terrorism in the world and I think it is wise to make certain that Iran recognizes that what it is doing is getting the attention of a lot of people, Mattis told a news conference in Tokyo in his most detailed remarks on Iran since taking over the Pentagon. Still, he firmly played down the idea of any military buildup. I dont see any need to increase the number of forces we have in the Middle East at this time. Thats not in the cards right now, he said. We always have the capability to do so. But right now I dont think its necessary. The United States has already sent a Navy destroyer to patrol off the coast of Yemen to protect waterways from Houthi militia aligned with Iran. But there are other actions Washington could take, including giving greater priority to rotating aircraft carriers through the Gulf. There is currently no U.S. aircraft carrier in the Gulf, for example. The U.S. Navy believes having a robust presence helps deter any moves by Iran to block that strategic waterway. In 2008 and 2010, in moves that prompted critics to accuse Iran of destabilizing the region, the Islamic Republic threatened to disrupt oil shipping in the Gulf by shutting the Strait of Hormuz if there were any attack on its nuclear sites. Mattis said ignoring Iranian behavior - something former President Barack Obamas critics routinely accused him of doing - wouldnt work.      It does no good to ignore it, it does no good to dismiss it, Mattis said, without citing Obama or his policies. The White House has said that while the latest sanctions were a reaction to recent events, they had been under consideration before.

The revocation means the government voided travel visas for people trying to enter the United States but the visas could be restored later without a new application, said William Cocks, a spokesman for consular affairs at the State Department. We will communicate updates to affected travelers following the 90-day review, he said.  Earlier news reports, citing a government attorney at a federal court hearing, put the figure at more than 100,000 visas. The government issued over 11 million immigrant and non-immigrant visas in fiscal year 2015, the State Department said.     The immigration executive order signed by Trump a week ago temporarily halted the U.S. refugee program and imposed a 90-day suspension on people traveling from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Trump said the measures would help protect Americans from terrorist attacks. Under President Barack Obama, Trumps predecessor, the United States added those seven countries as countries of concern under its visa waiver program, effectively toughening U.S. visa procedures for individuals who visited those places during the past five years. Trumps executive order was at least in part informed by those restrictions. The new president, who took office on Jan. 20, went further by temporarily barring passport holders from those seven countries.  The State Department first issued the guidance about revoking the visas on Jan. 27, the day Trump signed his executive order, according to a memo filed in a court case in Massachusetts.  But confusion about the roll out of the order sparked protests at airports across the country where people had been detained and led to a wave of lawsuits filed by individuals, states and civil rights groups.  To further clarify how the order should be applied, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) sent out a letter to all of its employees on Feb. 2, according to a copy of the memo seen by Reuters. The memo said the agency was continuing to process all applications and petitions for people inside the United States regardless of their country of origin. It also said all applications for permanent residency and adjustment of status can move forward. USCIS said they could not discuss internal employee communications.  The Department of Homeland Security had earlier clarified, after some initial back-and-forth, that the order would not apply to green card holders. Also people from the seven countries who hold dual citizenship are allowed to enter the United States on the passport of a non-restricted nation when eligible, according to Feb. 2 guidance posted by U.S. Customs and Border Protections website.

The sanctions on 25 individuals and entities were the opening salvo by President Donald Trump who has vowed a more aggressive policy against Tehran and came two days after the administration had put Iran on notice following a ballistic missile test. The Trump Administration will no longer tolerate Irans provocations that threaten our interests, National Security Advisor Michael Flynn said. The days of turning a blind eye to Irans hostile and belligerent actions toward the United States and the world community are over, Flynn said in a White House statement. Suggesting that more concrete action could follow if Iran does not curb its ballistic missile program and continues support in regional proxy conflicts, a senior administration official said the latest sanctions were the initial steps in response to Irans provocative behavior. The administration was undertaking a larger strategic review of how it responds to Iran. Iran denounced the sanctions as illegal and said it would impose legal restrictions on American individuals and entities helping regional terrorist groups, state TV quoted a Foreign Ministry statement as saying.

The White House said that while the sanctions were a reaction to recent events, they had been under consideration before. It added that a landmark 2015 deal to curb Irans nuclear program was not in the best interest of the United States. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the missile test did not violate the nuclear agreement. Its not a direct violation ... I think there is no question that it violates the spirit of that, Spicer said in an interview with MSNBC. He said the nuclear agreement was a sweetheart deal for Iran. Citing a foreign ministry statement, Irans semi-official Fars news agency said the missile program is the undeniable and inalienable right of our nation under international law and the UN charter. Any foreign interference in this regard is a violation of international law. The new designations stuck to areas that remain under sanctions even with the 2015 nuclear deal sealed between Iran and world powers in place, such as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, an elite military body that is powerful in Iranian politics and the economy, and Irans ballistic missile program. Zarif led Irans delegation at the nuclear negotiations in 2015. Among those affected by the sanctions were what it said was a Lebanon-based network run by the Revolutionary Guards. The list is actually so targeted and comparatively mild, it leads one to surmise that it may have been a set of targets devised by the Obama administration, and was ready to go when Trump came into office, said Adam Smith, former senior advisor to the Director of the U.S. Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control. As such, the real test for which way the Trump team will go on Iran may well be not this list release but the next one, whenever that occurs, Smith said. The sanctions impact will be more symbolic than practical, especially as they do not affect the lifting of broader U.S. and international sanctions that took place under the nuclear deal. Also, few of the Iranian entities being targeted are likely to have U.S. assets that can be frozen, and U.S. companies, with few exceptions, are barred from doing business with Iran.     Meanwhile, the U.S. moved a Navy destroyer, the USS Cole, close to the Bab al-Mandab Strait off the coast of Yemen to protect waterways from Houthi militia aligned with Iran. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel on Friday expressed understanding over the sanctions, but warned against conflating Sundays test with the nuclear deal. Earlier on Friday, Trump tweeted: Iran is playing with fire. U.S. Senator Mark Warner expressed support for the sanctions, adding: I urge the Administration to bring clarity to their overall strategy towards Iran, and to refrain from ambiguous rhetoric  or provocative tweets  that will exacerbate efforts to confront those challenges. Some of the entities sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury are based in the United Arab Emirates, Lebanon and China. Among those affected were companies, individuals and brokers the U.S. Treasury said support a trade network run by Iranian businessman Abdollah Asgharzadeh. Treasury said he supported Shahid Hemmat Industrial Group, which the United States has said is a subsidiary of an Iranian entity that runs Irans ballistic missile program. Hasan Dehghan Ebrahimi, a Beirut-based official with the Revolutionary Guards Qods Force, which runs its operations abroad, was put under sanctions for acting on behalf of the Qods Force, Treasury said. Three Lebanese companies involved in waste collection, pharmaceuticals, and construction were also listed under the sanctions for being owned or controlled by Muhammad Abd-al-Amir Farhat, one of Ebrahimis employees. Treasury said he has facilitated millions of dollars in cash transfers to Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. Two of his employees and a company he manages were also sanctioned. Treasury said Ebrahimi and his employees used a Lebanon-based network to transfer funds, launder money, and conduct business. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Enrollment was down from 9.7 million a year ago but the decline was smaller than some had predicted amid President Donald Trumps push to overturn former President Barack Obamas signature healthcare reform under which the plans are sold. With several insurers pulling out over rising costs, and Republican congressional efforts to scuttle the Affordable Care Act (ACA), known as Obamacare, the enrollment period was seen as a test of the programs popularity. HealthCare.gov sells health insurance under the ACA for 39 states. The remaining states run their own exchanges. The total number of plan selections across all states for the entire open enrollment period will be released in March. Average premiums for the second-lowest cost silver plan rose 25 percent compared with the previous year. At the same time the number of insurance providers choosing to participate in the exchanges fell by 28 percent. Of the 9.2 million, about 3 million were new consumers while 6.2 million were returning consumers. The figures include any cancellations that occurred during the period. Trumps surprise victory in early November as the enrollment period got underway created serious doubts about whether people would sign up for the insurance program. A move by the Trump administration to pull television ads reminding consumers that the enrollment deadline was approaching likely contributed to the dropoff. This may have cost about 500,000 additional enrollments, said Ron Pollack, executive director of healthcare consumer advocacy group Families USA, in a statement, calling the move an attempt to sabotage enrollment. And despite all that, millions of consumers still got their insurance through the ACA, Pollack said. Meanwhile, Republican efforts to repeal the healthcare law have stumbled over an inability so far to come up with a comprehensive replacement plan. Republican Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee this week said changes to the law would be made in chunks and would be better labeled a repair.

Though the order was short on specifics, financial markets embraced Trumps signal that looser banking regulation is coming and pushed bank stocks higher. The Dow Jones U.S. Banks stocks index closed up 2.6 percent. .DJUSBK [.N]  At a White House forum on Friday with U.S. business leaders, including JPMorgan Chases (JPM.N) CEO Jamie Dimon, Trump said his administration expects to be cutting a lot out of Dodd-Frank. That will involve a lot more than issuing an order, said former Democratic congressman Barney Frank, co-author of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law that raised capital requirements for banks, restricted their trading by means of the Volcker Rule, and created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to guard against predatory lending. Trump cant make any substantial change in the financial reform bill without Congress, Frank told Reuters. The language in the order doesnt do anything. It tells the secretary of the Treasury to give them something to read. The tone of it is to weaken the bill. Trump and other critics of the Dodd-Frank law say its regulations have hindered lending. At the meeting with CEOs on Friday Trump said, I have so many people, friends of mine, that have nice businesses that cant borrow money...because the banks just wont let them borrow because of the rules and regulations in Dodd-Frank. Despite such criticisms, recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis showed U.S. commercial-bank lending at a 70-year high, climbing steadily since late-2010. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren who lobbied for the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau accused Trump of forsaking middle and lower-income individuals to help banks. The Wall Street bankers and lobbyists whose greed and recklessness nearly destroyed this country may be toasting each other with champagne, but the American people have not forgotten the 2008 financial crisis - and they will not forget what happened today, she said in a statement. Trumps adviser leading the deregulation effort, National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, was previously a top official at Goldman Sachs (GS.N). Billionaire investor Carl Icahn, meanwhile, is counseling Trump on regulation across the government. One order signed by Trump requires the U.S. Treasury Secretary to submit possible regulatory changes and legislation modifying Dodd-Frank in 120 days, according to a White House official. Trumps pick for Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, also a former Goldman banker, has yet to be confirmed by the full Senate. Meanwhile, a memo tells the Labor Department to review a fiduciary rule for brokers offering retirement advice that was finalized in 2016. While early reports said Trump wanted to push off the rules implementation, originally slated for April, by 180 days, the order did not mention any delay. The Labor Department late on Friday said it was considering legal options for delaying.  Representatives of the six largest U.S. banks  JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N)  either declined to comment or did not have an immediate comment. Bankers, lawyers and lobbyists privately said Trumps order would not do much immediately. Also they said that they would prefer less-extensive modifications to Dodd-Frank after spending billions of dollars complying with the law. Many want to make it a little bit more user-friendly, said John Kanas, chairman of BankUnited (BKU.N), a lender with less than $20 billion in assets.  House of Representatives Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling, a Republican, told reporters at the White House that Trumps approach reflects legislation he has drafted to review Dodd-Frank. Hensarling is expected to re-introduce his bill allowing banks to choose between complying with Dodd-Frank and holding more capital later this month. Trump could also make changes simply by appointing new personnel or not enforcing rules. A lot of the regulations of Dodd-Frank required a bit of a cop-on-the-beat if you will, to ensure enforcement and if you have a different cop-on-the-beat, they enforce different rules, or they enforce the rules differently, said FBR & CO financial policy analyst Edward Mills. Many regulators, though, were appointed by Trumps predecessor, President Barack Obama, and intend to complete their terms. Trump cannot fire heads of independent agencies, including the three top bank regulators: Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, Comptroller of the Currency Thomas Curry, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp Chairman Martin Gruenberg.  In addition, the term for Richard Cordray, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau director, stretches into next year. Republican lawmakers are pushing Trump to fire Cordray, but a federal courts decision allowing him to has been stayed pending appeal.  Meanwhile, some U.S. financial policy leaders want to keep the law. Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said on Friday Dodd-Frank has largely been helpful and led to a banking system with more and better capital.

Wealth managers from Wall Street to Wisconsin have spent the last six years lobbying against the retirement advice rule that Trump began killing off with a swipe of his pen. The United States ratchets up pressure on Iran, putting sanctions on 13 individuals and 12 entities days after the White House put Tehran on notice over a ballistic missile test.

A federal judge in Boston declines to extend a temporary restraining order that allowed some immigrants into the United States from certain countries despite being barred by Trumps recent executive order. Tens of thousands of visas were revoked under Trumps travel ban, the State Department says. U.S. immigration officials have postponed interviews with asylum seekers in an Australian camp since Trumps executive order on immigration, suggesting Washington is already blocking progress on a controversial refugee resettlement deal. Chief executives of major U.S. companies met with Trump at the White House, with some expressing concern about the ban on people from seven Muslim-majority countries traveling to the United States. Congressional Republicans repeal a securities disclosure rule aimed at curbing corruption at energy and mining companies and vote to ax emissions limits on drilling operations, part of a push to remove Obama-era regulations on extractive industries.

The Feb. 16 conference titled Libya-U.S. Relations 2017: New Vision, Hope and Opportunities, and co-hosted by the National Council on U.S.-Libya Relations, had listed Libyan speakers, including two former prime ministers and the head of the National Oil Corporation (NOC). As a result of the executive order, banning Libyan citizens from entrance to the USA, it will not be feasible for the full complement of speakers, sponsors and guests to be in Washington, D.C., as originally planned, a statement from the conference organizers said.  A new date for the conference would be announced soon. The executive order by Trump comes at a time of uncertainty over U.S. policy in Libya, which remains mired in the chaos that followed the NATO-backed 2011 uprising against long-time leader Muammar Gaddafi. This administration recognizes the role of the oil industry in economic stability and recognizes the importance of economic stability for political stability, Rihab El Haj, a member of the National Council on U.S.-Libya relations, told Reuters. We have been working for visa waivers for speakers and key sponsors and based on our conversations with the various institutions involved in making the decision, there was consensus this was an important event and there is political will to facilitate the conference but its just a question of timing and we understand that humanitarian exceptions are a priority, she said. The United Nations-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) was strongly supported by the administration of former President Barack Obama, but has struggled to assert its authority in Tripoli and beyond.

An expert in radical Islamist media said the footage by unknown militants appeared to be part of videos first released by jihadists online some 10 years ago, undermining the Pentagons explanation about its value.  A U.S. Central Command spokesman confirmed that the video was removed from the website because the contents were old.    We didnt want it to appear that we were trying to pass off an old video as a new video, spokesman Colonel John Thomas said. It is the latest controversy surrounding the raid on a branch of al Qaeda in Yemen, the first such operation authorized by President Donald Trump as commander in chief. The military said the video was found on Sunday in the operation in al-Bayda province in which a U.S. Navy SEAL, militants and civilians were killed.      A U.S. Central Command spokesman had said on Friday the clip of a ski-masked man encouraging people to build bombs, was one example of the volumes of sensitive al-Qaeda terror-planning information recovered during the operation.  The Department of Defense posted the video on its web site on Friday but pulled it off within several hours when questions began to arise about its age.     The footage appeared to be similar to that in other videos that surfaced online in 2007.  The video clip that was posted and abruptly taken down was one of 25 videos that appeared (published) in 2007, said Adam Raisman, a senior analyst at SITE group which monitors extremists online. He added that the only difference was that the Pentagon video had English subtitles added.        Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis said the video was still of worth, even if it may have been created earlier.  It does not matter when the video was made, that they had it is still illustrative of who they are and what their intentions are, Davis said.      U.S. Navy SEAL William Ryan Owens was killed in the raid, which the Pentagon said also killed 14 militants. Medics at the scene said about 30 people, including 10 women and children, also died. U.S. military officials told Reuters this week that the operation went ahead without sufficient intelligence, ground support or adequate backup preparations.  As a result, three officials said, the attacking SEAL team found itself dropping onto a reinforced al Qaeda base defended by landmines, snipers, and a larger than expected contingent of heavily armed Islamist extremists.         But Central Command said earlier this week that it only asks for operations it believes have a good chance of success based on its planning.

A landmark policy from the Obama era, the so-called fiduciary rule requires brokers and financial advisers to act in the best interest of retirement savers. This restricts their ability to earn commissions and to sell some higher-fee products. Wall Street has argued it would harm consumers because it would raise compliance costs and therefore fees, and force them to get rid of Main Street clients and small businesses that offer 401(k) plans. Trumps executive order asks the Labor Department to review whether the rule needs to be changed or dumped. Both supporters and opponents are girding to argue their case. But the industry has the edge, with Trump officials stating they were planning on rolling back regulation generally and criticizing the fiduciary rule in particular. The Chamber of Commerce, one of a number of trade groups which have filed lawsuits to kill the rule, cheered Trumps order. We look forward to swift action from the Department of Labor in putting this delay into effect and reevaluating matters of policy and law, the Chamber said in a statement. Shares of banks with large wealth management divisions jumped on Friday with Bank of America (BAC.N) up 2.5 percent, Morgan Stanley (MS.N) 5.5 percent stronger and Wells Fargo (WFC.N) over 2 percent higher. Insurers, whose sales of annuity products were at risk from the rule, also rose, with shares of Prudential (PRU.N) up 1.9 percent and Metlife (MET.N) 1 percent stronger. Everyone will be pleased that DOLs rush to get it done before the administration change is set back, said Judi Carsrud, director of government relations for the National Association of Insurance Financial Advisors (NAIFA), which has been fighting the rule for years. NAIFA plans to pursue a very straightforward fix such as a legislative approach that directs retirement account advisers to act in clients best interest  a standard that Carsrud believes the groups members already meet. The Obama administration had said conflicted advice costs American families $17 billion a year but the industry has said that figure was inflated. No-one disputes the high cost that firms would have to pay to comply with the new rule, an amount the Labor Department estimates at as much as $31 billion over the next decade. Banks have already started changing things with Bank of America saying this week it would more clearly disclose the fees it charges clients of its Merrill Lynch wealth management business. Bank of America Corp had already started cutting back on transactional accounts that charge clients a commission for every trade, rather than a flat fee based on assets. Morgan Stanley (MS.N) has decided to keep such accounts but is making changes that will allow advisers to work within the rules confines by creating new contracts, re-training advisors and updating supervisory software. Swiss bank UBS UBSN.VX welcomed Trumps order and said it supported the creation of a fiduciary rule under the Securities and Exchange Commission, which could apply to all advisers not just retirement advisers. Wells Fargo said it would continue to work with regulators to ensure higher standards of care for investment clients. Other banks either declined to comment or were not immediately available to comment. Implementing changes was particularly tough for small-time financial advisers. Along with two colleagues, Juli McNeely, who runs McNeely Financial Services in Spencer, Wisconsin has spent between 45 and 60 hours each week since December preparing for the rule. Their work has focused largely on figuring out which clients from their rural community should now pay a flat fee for financial advice, instead of commissions, and creating new templates for paperwork. Now we have a little breathing room to make sure we do this right and not quickly to meet a deadline, said McNeely, who voted for Trump, in part because of his pro-business stance. One person who has yet to comment on the retirement rule review is the person who will be at the center of it  Trumps choice to head the Labor Department, Andy Puzder. Puzder, chief executive of fastfood group CKE Restaurants, has been a vocal opponent of what he has called overregulation during the Obama administration. The 401(k) plans he offers his own employees are less generous than some rivals, suggesting a more industry-friendly approach. While the Labor Secretary cannot unilaterally repeal a rule, his agency can rewrite and change a rule substantially or scrap it. William Galvin, the top securities regulator in Massachusetts, described Trumps order as reckless. My office will continue to protect small investors when those in Washington cave to big business. Not all proponents of the rule were as pessimistic. Theres no question that in the minds of industry lobbyist, delay is just a step toward repeal, said Barbara Roper, investor protection director for the Consumer Federation of America (CFA).

The measure, a centerpiece of the House Republican tax reform blueprint backed by Speaker Paul Ryan, is intended to encourage investment and manufacturing in the United States. But it faces mounting pressure from U.S. retailers, oil refiners and automakers who fear it could result in higher prices for consumer goods including gasoline.  Major U.S. exporters on Thursday threw their support behind a border tax, but President Donald Trump has sent mixed signals and some U.S. Senate Republicans question whether it would pass muster under international trade rules. We are listening carefully and exploring a number of ideas on both design and the transition of this provision to accommodate some of the concerns, valid concerns, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady told a conference on tax issues. Im confident ... that the design of the border adjustability and the transition of it will allay those concerns, he added without providing details. He previously said the committee would look at transition rules but has not suggested possible design changes until now.  The Texas Republican, whose panel is working on tax reform legislation, is not considering product or industry exemptions but said the committee is engaged in discussions with industries including import-dependent oil refiners.  The border adjustment proposal would exempt U.S. corporate export revenues from tax but impose a 20 percent levy on imports by preventing U.S. companies from deducting import costs from their taxable income. Import-dependent companies say the sweeping change could hurt their businesses and customers. Their concerns about consumer impacts or tax impacts, we dont want those either, Brady said. Brady said the policy would tax all products sold in the United States equally while matching the export tax approach of U.S. trading partners. He acknowledged that the change could be phased in over time to help smooth the transition but denied that the proposal would violate international trade rules by penalizing imports or subsidizing exports. Business lobbyists have suggested a number of changes, from a nominal tax to compensate import-dependent businesses to an import tax rate that would vary by country of origin to match the taxes U.S. products face abroad.         We know where we want to go and were going to listen to all ideas. But were going to end up with a tax code that taxes products at the same equal rate in the United States, he said.

Trump and his policies, from questioning the value of NATO and free trade to banning Muslim refugees, came up repeatedly in discussions in Malta on external challenges facing the Union. British Prime Minister Theresa May, about to lead her country out of the EU, briefed peers on her visit to Washington last week and assured them Trump was committed to cooperating in their defense  just as Britain would also be after Brexit. Francois Hollande, the outgoing Socialist president of France, led criticism of Trump, calling it unacceptable for him to applaud Brexit and forecast the break-up of the EU. In thinly veiled rebukes to May and some eastern states, he warned of trying to cut their own transatlantic deals. A lot of countries should think of their future first of all in the European Union rather than imagining I dont what kind of bilateral relationship with the United States, he said. Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite, who like many in the east is alarmed by Trumps conciliatory noises to Moscow, poured cold water on Mays suggestion Britain could be a link to Washington. Europe did not need a bridge, she was quoted as saying, because it could communicate with Trump on Twitter. But her Polish neighbor, Beata Szydlo, reserved her main  criticisms for her predecessor as prime minister, EU summit chair Donald Tusk, who described Trump this week as a threat to the EU, along with Russia, China and militant Islam.  European politicians trying to build this sense of fear ... are making a mistake, said Szydlo, whose government, like Trump, has spoken out against Muslim immigration. One cannot be confrontational in our relations with the United States. Stressing the need for unity, the blocs dominant leader, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, said Europeans still had common ground with the United States in many areas, while not sharing Trumps scepticism about many international institutions. We have again made very clear our common values and our faith in multilateralism, she told a news conference.  The Union would, she said, push for free trade deals with more nations as Trump pulls back. But cooperation with the United States against militant threats would continue, she said. One EU diplomat said France was clearly pushing to use the Trump presidency to rally Europeans behind a policy of greater distance from Washington and turning to the EU, rather than NATO, for their security.  The Germans are much more cautious, the diplomat said. There is a clear issue to be decided: whether we seek common ground to engage with the United States, or turn our backs. Summit host Joseph Muscat, the Maltese prime minister, chose to emphasize balance in summing up the discussions, speaking of concern at Trumps policy but no sense of anti-Americanism. There was a sense that we need to engage with the U.S. just the same, Muscat said. But we need to show that we cannot stay silent where there are principles involved.

Under the 2015 accord between Tehran and six world powers, Iran agreed to curb its nuclear program in exchange for relief from some U.S., European and U.N. economic sanctions. Many experts consider it a success so far. The Trump administration this week signaled a harder but ambiguous line toward Iran by putting the Islamic Republic on notice after an Iranian ballistic missile test, and then by imposing economic sanctions on 13 individuals and 12 entities on Friday.. The options the administration is considering include insisting the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the U.N. nuclear watchdog, get tougher policing Irans compliance, including demanding access to military sites, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The basic idea is that the IAEA has to be granted access, said one source with knowledge of the matter, acknowledging it would be difficult for the U.S. administration to win support for military site inspections from the other 34 countries on the IAEA board of governors. The U.S. also would seek to remove sunset provisions from the pact that allow some restrictions on Irans nuclear program to start expiring in 10 years, something critics consider the deals biggest flaw, the two sources said.         In addition, the administration could press the agency to report more information on Irans compliance with the nuclear pact, one of the sources said, noting the agency has cut back on reporting some data, such as how much low-enriched uranium Iran is stockpiling. The administration is also weighing a push to tighten the rules of the Procurement Working Group, a panel set up under the accord to make it harder for Iran to win approval to import sensitive technologies and materials that might be used for nuclear purposes, said one of the sources. There are concerns that the Obama administration was too lenient in agreeing to Iranian purchases of nuclear-related materials, including 116 metric tons of natural uranium, for which Tehran has no apparent need, one source said. Getting the United States partners in the nuclear deal, a group known as the P5+1 that includes Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia, into such a negotiation is likely to be extremely difficult, let alone bringing the Iranians along. It seems to be a long shot, said a P5+1 source on the odds of getting the group into a new negotiation aimed at tightening up the nuclear deal, formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) or at creating a sort of JCPOA II. Iranian officials have rejected the idea of renegotiating the deal, and Trumps stance could weaken the hand of those in Tehran who have been willing to negotiate with the West, said a former senior Iranian official. Hardliners will use Trumps stance to strengthen their position, said a former senior Iranian official close to President Hassan Rouhani. They have always been against Rouhanis dtente policy toward West. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - The DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, named for former Democratic lawmakers Senator Chris Dodd and Representative Barney Frank, was signed by former President Barack Obama in 2010 as a response to the financial crisis. Dodd-Frank is the most sweeping financial regulatory statute enacted since the response to the Great Depression in the 1930s. It created new regulatory bodies and directed already-existing agencies to write hundreds of regulations aimed at creating stability in the financial markets. Republican lawmakers, including President Donald Trump, have said that Dodd-Frank is burdensome for financial institutions, and many seek to repeal it in whole or part. Trump signed an executive order on Friday that did not mention Dodd-Frank by name. But White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told reporters on Friday, Dodd-Frank is a disastrous policy thats hindering our markets and the order would be the first step taken to review the law. Here are some of the Dodd-Frank laws main provisions: The Financial Stability Oversight Council Dodd-Frank created the FSOC to monitor risk in the financial system and it was granted the power to deem institutions, including non-bank firms such as asset managers and insurance companies systemically important financial institutions. These firms are often called too-big-to-fail and subject to additional capital requirements. The Office of Financial Research Dodd-Frank created the independent Office of Financial Research within the Treasury Department to provide data and support related to risks in the financial system to relevant government agencies, including the FSOC. This data is used in part to assess whether a firm is a systemically important financial institution. Consumer Financial Protection Board Dodd-Frank created the CFPB, a federal agency that oversees consumer protection in the financial sector, including banks, payday lenders, credit unions, mortgage servicers and other companies. A federal appeals court ruled in October that the bureaus structure is unconstitutional because its director, currently Richard Cordray, cannot be removed by the president without cause. That ruling was stayed and has not taken effect pending appeal. Volcker Rule A portion of Dodd-Frank known named for former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker prohibits commercial banks from also engaging in proprietary trading and restricts them from investing in hedge and private equity funds. The Volcker Rule also limits the liabilities that can be taken on by the countrys largest banks. The rule was delayed several times and took effect in July 2015. Some large Wall Street banks asked the Federal Reserve to grant them an additional five-year grace period to comply with the rule. Capital Requirements The laws so-called capital requirements forced banks to fund themselves more by raising money from shareholders than by borrowing. Regulators used a variety of requirements to force banks to cut their reliance on debt, including by imposing tougher rules for riskier assets. The most stringent requirements fell on the biggest banks. Banks say the process has been costly.  Living Wills Dodd-Frank required banks with assets of $50 billion or more to submit living wills to regulators. A banks living will is a kind of prepackaged bankruptcy plan that will guide its dissolution and liquidation without taxpayer assistance should it collapse. If these living wills are deemed insufficient by regulators, institutions get another chance to submit a new plan. At that point, if regulators again deem a living will insufficient, a bank can face sanctions.    Swaps Push-Out Rule The initial swaps proposal prohibited banks active in swaps markets from receiving federal assistance. The rule was narrowed to apply to only swaps entities. A swaps entity is a swap dealer that is registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission or Securities and Exchange Commission. The rule does not apply to depository banks that have swaps divisions, which remain eligible to be insured by the federal government. Regulated Institutions A number of Dodd-Franks provisions were designed to direct agencies to regulate entities such as private equity funds and hedge funds for the first time. It also required a brand new regulatory regime for over-the-counter derivatives, which imposed capital and margin requirements, central clearing and trading transparency rules on the marketplace.

White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said in an interview with MSNBCs Chris Matthews on Thursday that Trumps executive order was justified in part by the Bowling Green massacre of 2011. She added, Most people dont know that because it didnt get covered.  During the interview Conway told how two Iraqis who came to the United States and were radicalized were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre. No such event occurred.  Conway corrected herself on Friday in a post on Twitter, saying, Honest mistakes abound. The phrase Bowling Green massacre was the top trending topic on Twitter on Friday morning as thousands of social media users mocked Conway. Very grateful no one seriously hurt in the Louvre attack ... or the (completely fake) Bowling Green Massacre. Please dont make up attacks, tweeted Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) on Friday.  In May 2011, two Iraqi men were arrested in Bowling Green, Kentucky, and charged with attempting to send weapons and money to al Qaeda in Iraq. They admitted to using improvised explosive devices against U.S. soldiers in Iraq. Mohanad Shareef Hammadi and Waad Ramadan Alwan pleaded guilty and were sentenced to life in prison and 40 years in prison, respectively. Prosecutors at the time said neither was charged with plotting attacks within the United States. Conway said on Twitter that she meant to say Bowling Green terrorists. She also slammed a network reporter for criticizing her. NBC reporter texted me at 632am re:a diff story; never asked what I meant on @Hardball b4 slamming me on @TODAYshow Not cool, not journalism, Conway (@KellyannePolls) wrote. On Inauguration Day, Zeke Miller, a TIME Magazine reporter, incorrectly reported that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.s bust was removed from the oval office, causing an uproar on social media. Miller (@ZekeJMiller), tweeted later that evening that the bust was obscured by an agent and a door and issued multiple apologies for his error. In a similar reaction to Conway, Trumps administration responded by ripping the media for spreading fake news, with spokesman Sean Spicer describing his actions as deliberately false reporting during his first White House press briefing. As Bowling Green massacre swept social media, a website called The Bowling Green Massacre Fund carrying a parody of Conways comments surfaced on Friday. It read, We all still carry the vivid memories of what horrors occurred at Bowling Green, but some still relive those moments everyday as they work to rebuild a community torn apart.

By March, the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate is likely to be deliberating on whether to approve Neil Gorsuch, a conservative federal appeals court judge from Colorado, to the court. Where Gorsuch stands on social issues like transgender rights is likely to be a much-discussed question during the confirmation process. Republicans are hoping the Senate Judiciary Committee holds hearings and votes on the nomination by late March, paving the way for a vote in the full Senate the first week of April, before the chamber begins a two week spring recess, according to Senate aides. In the transgender case, in which the eight-justice court could be split 4-4 without a ninth vote, a Virginia public school district is fighting to prevent a female-born transgender high school student from using the boys bathroom. The dispute involves a transgender student named Gavin Grimm, who identifies as male and sued in 2015 to win the right to use the schools boys bathroom. At the heart of the case is the question of whether transgender people are covered by a ban on gender discrimination in education under federal law. The administration of former President Barack Obama said it was. The Trump administration has not yet weighed in. Until the Senate approves a nominee, the court remains one justice short following the February death of Antonin Scalia, which left it with four conservatives and four liberals. That raises the possibility of a 4-4 ruling that would leave in place the decision favoring Grimm by the Richmond-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. A 4-4 ruling would set no nationwide legal precedent. It is also possible that the court could rehear the case if Gorsuch is confirmed. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Tehran has already announced it will stop U.S. citizens entering the country following Washingtons decision to ban refugees and citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries including Iran. A special committee in Tehran reviewed their cases and decided to oppose the visit by the U.S. freestyle wrestling team, Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Ghasemi was quoted by state television as saying.

In a statement issued two weeks before Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is due to visit U.S. President Donald Trump, the White House said the administration has not taken an official position on settlement activity. Trump, a Republican, has signaled he could be more accommodating toward settlement projects than his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama. The latest statement reflects slightly more nuanced language on how the new administration views settlement activity. While we dont believe the existence of settlements is an impediment to peace, the construction of new settlements or the expansion of existing settlements beyond their current borders may not be helpful in achieving that goal, the White House said in a statement. The statement could disappoint Israels far-right, which had hoped Trump would give an unqualified green light on rapid settlement construction in the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem - areas Israel captured in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.  In the first Israeli reaction to the statement, Danny Danon, Israels ambassador to the United Nations, said it was too early to tell how it would affect future building. Its still too early to tell ... I would not categorize this as a U-turn by the U.S. administration but the issue is clearly on their agenda ... the issue will be discussed when the prime minister (Netanyahu) meets the president in Washington, Danon told Israel Radio. We will not always agree on everything, he added.      U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson spoke by phone with Netanyahu on Thursday, the State Department said. It did not say whether they discussed the White House statement. Obama routinely criticized settlement construction plans and his administration often described settlement activity as lacking legitimacy and impeding peace. The White House statement came as Israel has ratcheted up settlement activity. On Wednesday, it said it would establish a new settlement in the occupied West Bank, the first since the late 1990s. It also announced plans for 3,000 more settlement homes in the West Bank, the third such declaration in less than two weeks since Trump took office. An announcement a week ago by Israel that it would build some 2,500 more dwellings in the West Bank, where Palestinians now seek statehood, drew rebukes from the Palestinians and the European Union.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli officials welcomed on Friday what they took as U.S. consent to expand existing settlements, after the White House reversed a long-standing policy of condemning building on occupied land. In its first substantive announcement on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the Trump administration said it did not see existing settlements hampering peace with the Palestinians, although it recognized that expansion of existing settlements beyond their current borders may not be helpful in achieving that goal. At one level, that appeared to be an attempt to rein in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has announced wide-ranging settlement expansion plans since the Jan. 20 inauguration, including around 6,000 new homes. But on closer reading, the statement was a softening of policy from the Obama administration and even that of George W. Bush, because it does not view settlements as an obstacle to peace or rule out their expansion within existing blocs. Netanyahu will be happy, a senior Israeli diplomat said in a text message. Pretty much carte blanche to build as much as we want in existing settlements as long as we dont enlarge their physical acreage. No problem there. Israels deputy foreign minister, Tzipi Hotovely from the right-wing of Netanyahus Likud party, interpreted it in a similar way, saying construction in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want for their own state together with Gaza, would go on unhindered. It is also the opinion of the White House that settlements are not an obstacle to peace and, indeed, they have never been an obstacle to peace, she said. Therefore, the conclusion is that more building is not the problem. Israel seized the West Bank and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war. The 50th anniversary of the occupation, which Israel marks as a reunification of Jerusalem, is in June.  There was no immediate comment from the Palestinians. Since taking office, President Trump has largely kept quiet on the Israeli-Palestinian issue, making no comment in response to Netanyahus announcements for thousands more settler homes, a silence interpreted as endorsement. During the campaign, Trump said he would not interfere or push Israel to negotiate on a two-state solution to the conflict. He has nominated David Friedman as ambassador to Israel, a religious Jew who has raised money for the settlements and supports moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Trump supported that idea during the election campaign, but it has been put on the back-burner in recent weeks. Under Barack Obama, the White House maintained a firm anti-settlements line, calling them illegitimate and an obstacle to peace. Most of the world considers settlements illegal under international law, a position Israel rejects. The European Union and Britain issued statements this week criticizing Netanyahus settlement plans, which they see as further breaking up the West Bank and undermining the possibility of a contiguous Palestinian state ever emerging. Netanyahu, who will visit Trump in Washington on Feb. 15, may see the White House statement as doubly beneficial. As well as not ruling out building within existing blocs, which Israel hopes to retain in any final agreement with the Palestinians, it may allow him to silence far-right voices in his own coalition calling for much greater settlement growth and annexation of parts of the West Bank.  Trump has effectively set a limit on how far-ranging settlement-building can be, so Netanyahu will be able to tell the far-right their ambitions are out of the question. At the same time, Netanyahu may have to curtail some of the plans he himself has announced in recent days. While most of the 6,000 settler homes he has promised are in existing blocs, many are not and may have to be scrapped if he wants to adhere to the White House line. He may also have to rethink a pledge this week to build the first new West Bank settlement since the 1990s. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Since taking office last month, U.S. President Donald Trump has pledged to get tough with Iran, warning the Islamic Republic after its ballistic missile test on Sunday that it was playing with fire and all U.S. options were on the table. Analysts say those options could range from diplomacy to military action and some scared Iranians are even preparing escape plans, just as they did in the eight-year war with Iraq when Saddam Husseins jets pounded Iranian towns and cities. I told my children to have their passports ready ... if attacked by Israel or America we can flee to Turkey by car because airports will be closed, said Ghorbanali Azhari, 65, a retired teacher in the Western city of Kermanshah. We have had enough. An eight-year war, economic hardship, sanctions ... I cannot let my grandchildren live in fear. There will be bloodshed, Azhari said. Trump plans to impose sanctions on several Iranian entities following its missile test, while crafting a broader strategy to counter what he sees as Irans destabilizing behavior, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday. Irans most powerful authority, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has continued to denounce the United States, suggesting the antagonism between the two countries since the 1979 revolution will not abate because of the nuclear deal.  I thought Irans political and economic isolation was  over ... but now I am deeply concerned about a military strike, said private bank employee Homayoun Barkhordar. I do not want war with any country. I love my country. We just want to live in peace, said the 38-year-old father of two. While experts say both sides would take care to avoid armed confrontation in the oil-rich Gulf, U.S. threats of reprisals for the missile test, coupled with Irans defiant reaction, could ratchet up tensions dangerously. I am thinking of moving to a small town, said Ali Gharveh in the central city of Isfahan, which was bombed by Iraq during the 1980-88 war. Life is cheaper and is safer than big cities that might be the main targets if America wants to attack Iran.  The United States and Iran have been at loggerheads since the revolution that toppled the U.S.-backed Shah and Washington cut diplomatic ties when students stormed the U.S. embassy soon after and took 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. The United States and its regional allies accuse Iran of trying to tighten its grip on Arab states, from Iraq to Lebanon, to Syria to Yemen, and Trump has accused former U.S. President Barack Obama of being too kind to Tehran. Days after coming to power, Trump barred residents from seven mainly Muslim countries, including Iran, from traveling to the United States for 90 days. Officials in Iran said Tehran would limit issuing visas to Americans in response. I always wanted my two children to study in America. But the new government is just spreading hatred towards Iranians, said Firuzeh Hengam, a computer engineer in the central city of Kashan. They say no options are off the table. It means attacking Iran is among their options. But while many Iranians worry about an escalation with the United States, just as they worry about economic hardship at home, they are also loyal and defiant.  Iran is my home no matter who the rulers are. Look at Syrians who left their country because of the war. They are being humiliated ... I do not want to be like them, said hairdresser Samira Azamzadeh, 47, in the northern city of Rasht. I dont have money to go abroad. I am a single mother of two teenage girls. Irans economy has been hit hard by the double hammer blows of years of sanctions over its nuclear program and the plunge in oil prices since the middle of 2014.  Iranians had pinned their hopes on economic progress following the nuclear deal, but a year after sanctions were lifted the economy is only recovering slowly and deals with Western investors are few and far between. They now worry that U.S. aggression and the curbs on travel will make wary Western investors even less likely to return to do business with Tehran. The economic situation will even get worse because of the Americas tough language. It will scare away foreign investors, said Omid Sadrzadeh, a factory owner in Karaj near the capital Tehran. One former senior Iranian official also said Trumps approach was playing into the hands of powerful hardliners such as Irans elite Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). The IRGC controls the countrys missile program and its deputy said on Thursday it had many underground missile facilities hidden in the mountains. Irans hardliners want a war. It will strengthen their position in the establishment. They want Iran to be isolated, said the official, who asked not to be named. They will do whatever they can to deepen tension between Iran and America, from launching missiles to giving fiery speeches. Analysts say Tehran could retaliate against any military strike with hit-and-run attacks in the Gulf and by closing the Strait of Hormuz, the strategic waterway through which some 40 percent of Gulf oil exports pass. Iranian authorities have warned arch-enemy Israel and the United States in the past that Tehrans response to a military strike would be tough, and some of Irans guided missiles have the range to strike Israel. Arash Kiai, a teenager in the central city of Yazd is scared, and angry, both with Trump and Iranian officials. But he will fall in line behind them if it comes to war. Whatever happens in the world they blame Iran. But why? We are peaceful people, he said. I am not an Iran regime supporter but Trump has no right to humiliate Iranians.

On Friday morning, the Senate voted 52 to 48 on a procedural measure paving the way to the final confirmation vote, which the education committee chairman, Senator Lamar Alexander, said will happen early in the week. DeVos, a billionaire philanthropist and charter-schools advocate, has faced unusually fierce opposition for a role that rarely receives congressional debate or public notice.  After her confirmation hearing, where DeVos seemed ill-equipped to discuss public education issues and suggested allowing guns at schools to fend off bear attacks, voters flooded Capitol Hill with calls and emails to block her nomination. Senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski have said they will not vote for her, the first Republicans to break party ranks and vote against one of Trumps cabinet nominees. If one more Republican sides with Democrats against her nomination, DeVos will become only the 10th cabinet nominee in U.S. history rejected by Congress.  Voting margins are so thin that Pence, as head of the Senate, may have to cast a tie-breaking vote. The Senates top Democrat, Charles Schumer, pressed Republicans to consider voting against her over the weekend. The nominee for the secretary of education is one of the worst nominees that has ever been brought before this body for a cabinet position, he said on the Senate floor. Sometimes loyalty to a new president demands a bit too much. Alexander, a former education secretary, is confident that DeVos will ultimately be approved. On the Senate floor he said she would be excellent in the role. Republicans see DeVos as a champion of low-income children and local control of education. I would argue that she has been among the forefront of the leaders...for the most successful reform of the last 30 years to change and improve public education, and that would be the public charter schools, he said. Democrats worry DeVos support for charters, which operate  independently of school districts and are frequently run by corporations, means she wants to undermine public schools.  They also have expressed dismay about her refusal to pledge to uphold rules on sexual assault, for-profit colleges and fair access to disabled students, as well as potential conflicts of interest with her investments.

Critics included Uber drivers, many of whom are immigrants themselves. Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that, Kalanick, who had planned to attend a meeting of the group on Friday, said in an email to staff that was seen by Reuters. Uber spokeswoman Chelsea Kohler later confirmed that he had left the group. Social media campaigns had targeted Uber, urging users to delete accounts and opt for rival Lyft Inc. Uber has been emailing users who deleted their accounts to say it shares their concerns and will compensate drivers affected by the ban.  Kalanick said he spoke briefly to Trump about the immigration order and its issues for our community and told the president he would not join the economic council. The CEO came under increasing pressure to leave the council after Trump issued an executive order temporarily barring people from seven majority-Muslim nations from entering the United States. There are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that. The executive order is hurting many people in communities all across America, he wrote in a note to employees. Families are being separated, people are stranded overseas and theres a growing fear the U.S. is no longer a place that welcomes immigrants. The White House said in a statement Thursday evening that did not mention Uber that Trump understands the importance of an open dialogue with fellow business leaders to discuss how to best make our nations economy stronger. The move could put pressure on other CEOs expected to attend a meeting with Trump on Friday. General Motors Co said its chief executive would attend, while Walt Disney Co said earlier Thursday its chief executive would not attend because of a long-planned board meeting. Others expected to take part include the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase & Co, Blackstone Group LP, IBM Corp and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Others that are part of the council include Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk, PepsiCo Inc CEO Indra Nooyi and Boston Consulting Group CEO Rich Lesser. Musk said he would attend the meeting.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trumps defense secretary warned North Korea on Friday of an effective and overwhelming response if it chose to use nuclear weapons, as he reassured South Korea of steadfast U.S. support. Any attack on the United States, or our allies, will be defeated, and any use of nuclear weapons would be met with a response that would be effective and overwhelming, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said at South Koreas defense ministry, at the end of a two-day visit. Mattis remarks come amid concern that North Korea could be readying to test a new ballistic missile, in what could be an early challenge for Trumps administration. North Korea, which regularly threatens to destroy South Korea and its main ally, the United States, conducted more than 20 missile tests last year, as well as two nuclear tests, in defiance of U.N. resolutions and sanctions. The North also appears to have also restarted operation of a reactor at its main Yongbyon nuclear facility that produces plutonium that can be used for its nuclear weapons program, according to the U.S. think-tank 38 North. North Korea continues to launch missiles, develop its nuclear weapons program and engage in threatening rhetoric and behavior, Mattis said. North Koreas actions have prompted the United States and South Korea to respond by bolstering defenses, including the expected deployment of a U.S. missile defense system, known as Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), in South Korea later this year.  The two sides reconfirmed that commitment on Friday. China, however, has objected to THAAD, saying it is a direct threat to Chinas own security and will do nothing to bring North Korea back to the negotiating table, leading to calls from some South Korean opposition leaders to delay or cancel it. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang reiterated Chinas opposition, which he said would never change. We do not believe this move will be conducive to resolving the Korean peninsula nuclear issue or to maintaining peace and stability on the peninsula, Lu told a daily news briefing in Beijing.  South Korean Defense Minister Han Min-koo said Mattis visit to Seoul - his first trip abroad as defense secretary - sent a clear message of strong U.S. support. Faced with a current severe security situation, Secretary Mattis visit to Korea ... also communicates the strongest warning to North Korea, Han said.  Once fully developed, a North Korean intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) could threaten the continental United States, which is about 9,000 km (5,500 miles) from North Korea. ICBMs have a minimum range of about 5,500 km (3,400 miles), but some are designed to travel 10,000 km (6,200 miles) or more. Former U.S. officials and other experts have said the United States essentially has two options when it comes to trying to curb North Koreas fast-expanding nuclear and missile programs - negotiate or take military action. Neither path offers certain success and the military option is fraught with huge dangers, especially for Japan and South Korea, U.S. allies in close proximity to North Korea. Mattis is due in Japan later on Friday. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Trump has railed against Chinas trade practices, blaming them for U.S. job losses, and has threatened to impose punitive tariffs on Chinese imports. Beijing says it will work with Washington to resolve any trade disputes, but state media has warned of retaliation if Trump takes the first steps toward a trade war. Branstad, currently the governor of Iowa, said he would help to work out differences and that there was immense potential for more Chinese investment in the United States. We want to continue to enhance the relationship and to increase trade between our two countries, Branstad told Chinas official Xinhua news agency in an interview in the United States published late on Thursday. I hope ... that I can play a constructive role trying to work out many of these differences in a way that makes it a win-win. It is beneficial to both of our countries, and also benefits the rest of the world, Xinhua cited Branstad as saying. I think we have seen just the tip of the iceberg of the potential (Chinese) investments here, he said. Trumps nomination of Branstad, a longtime Republican governor who has developed relationships with Chinese President Xi Jinping and other Chinese leaders, was well-received, even among some Democrats.  He still faces a confirmation hearing. Trump has moved to fill his administration with critics of Chinas trade policies, including Wilbur Ross for Commerce Secretary, Robert Lighthizer for U.S. Trade Representative, and Peter Navarro, an economist and China hawk who will serve as a White House adviser. Xi and Trump have yet to speak since Trump took office, though they did talk soon after Trump won the election. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang, asked whether a call was in the offing, would only say the two countries were continuing to remain in close contact.  Free trade advocates worry that Trumps trade team will be too quick to use tariffs to keep imports out, raising costs for manufacturers that rely on imported parts - or even sparking retaliatory trade wars. Xi made a vigorous defense of globalization at the World Economic Forum last month, and presented Chinas economy as a wide open, despite complaints from the foreign business community that Beijing has not made good on pledges of economic liberalization.  The official China Daily newspaper said on Friday that China could weather trade frictions better than the United States, as its exports accounted for a larger proportion of global trade, but that Trumps words and actions bode ill for relations. China needs to cast aside any illusions it may have had that Trump was just mouthing off to attract votes and instead be prepared for the worst, the paper said in an editorial. Commentary from influential Chinese state-run media does not equate with policy, but can be reflective of official thinking.  Trumps daughter, Ivanka Trump, was greeted by Chinas ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, at a Lunar New Year reception at the embassy in Washington on Thursday. The China Daily said her father had broken a tradition of U.S. presidents sending New Years greetings to people of Chinese origin in the United States for their most important festival.

The ACLU filed the lawsuit in federal court in the Northern District of California on behalf of three student visa holders, including one Yemeni who left the United States and is unable to come back, according to court documents.   The lawsuit is a proposed class-action brought on behalf of nationals who are living or have lived in the United States and are originally from the Muslim-majority nations whose citizens President Donald Trump has temporarily banned from entering the United States, with some exceptions. The suit is the latest in a series of legal actions challenging the executive order that was issued last Friday. Federal judges in several states have placed limits on the order.  The order set off protests over the weekend at several major airports as immigration and customs officials struggled to interpret the new rules. The plaintiffs and the members of the class fear that, in the event they attempt to enter or re-enter the United States, they will be denied permission to do so, the lawsuit said.  It accuses Trump and his administration of violating the free speech, religious freedom and due process rights of those affected by the order, and says it is an attempt to fulfill a campaign promise made by Trump to ban Muslims from entering the United States.  Senior advisers to defendant Trump have engaged in anti-Muslim rhetoric that provides additional support for the notion that the executive order was prompted by animus toward Islam and Muslims, the suit said. Department of Justice officials could not be reached for comment late on Thursday.

Two influential conservatives in the House of Representatives, worried that the process was getting bogged down, said the repeal measure that the Republican-majority Congress passed last year should be taken up quickly. But in the Senate, Republican Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and chairman of the health committee counseled patience. He said changes to the law would be made in chunks and would be better labeled a repair. Its more accurate to talk about repairing it ... were repairing the damage Obamacare has done, Alexander said outside the Senate. Were not repealing all of Obamacare, its not technically possible to do that (now) in the procedures that we have in the Senate, and secondly, there are some parts of it we want to keep, he said. But Vice President Mike Pence, asked in a Fox News interview about talk of repairing Obamacare, pushed back, saying: We are absolutely committed to follow through on President Trumps directive to repeal and replace Obamacare and to have the Congress do it at the same time.   Trump and congressional Republicans campaigned on a promise to dismantle the 2010 Affordable Care Act, former President Barack Obamas signature domestic legislation that Republicans  consider federal government overreach.  While Republicans voted last month to start the process of scrapping the law, they missed a target date of Jan. 27 to begin drafting legislation to do so. At a congressional retreat last week, Republican leaders told lawmakers they hoped Congress would finish the repeal by March or April.  Representative Mark Meadows, chairman of the conservative Freedom Caucus, and Representative Jim Jordan, the caucus former chairman, urged the party leadership on Thursday to quickly enact a repeal measure. Thats what the American people expect us to do  and they expect us to do it quickly, they said. Obama, a Democrat, vetoed the repeal passed by the Republican-controlled Congress last year. Three of the biggest national insurers have also stepped up pressure on the lawmakers to act. Aetna Inc (AET.N), Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) and Cigna Corp (CI.N) this week urged changes in Obamacare individual plan regulations in the next few weeks, in time for them to decide if they will sell the products in 2018. They want stricter oversight of eligibility and enrollment periods, as well as other changes. Without them, these insurers say they may pull out of the Obamacare exchanges next year, which would lead to less competition and higher premium rates. Rates for 2017 rose an average of 25 percent. Edmund Haislmaier, a Heritage Foundation senior research fellow who advised the Trump transition team to help craft the regulation change but has not seen the final version, said he expected it to address concerns of insurers. He said insurers were consulted. The incoming administration and the insurers have by in large the same agenda on a lot of this stuff, said Haislmaier. He said that pleasing the insurers could help Congress move more quickly on a plan to repeal and replace the law. The (administration) can reassure Republicans that were taking steps so the market doesnt blow up when you move ahead with legislation, and I think that would actually maybe move the process along on the Hill, he said. Democrats were enjoying the Republican turmoil. They have long accused Republicans of rushing to gut the law without having a replacement plan ready. The law has enabled up to 20 million previously uninsured Americans to obtain health coverage. They (Republicans) havent come up with the so-called repairs, the Senates No. 2 Democrat, Dick Durbin of Illinois, said in a hallway.

In remarks that did not touch on foreign policy specifics, Tillerson addressed the dissent within the department that emerged this week in a memo signed by more than 900 officials in protest against Trumps decision to suspend the U.S. refugee program and restrict travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries. One of the great challenges and thrills for the State Department staff is deciding how to confront changing conditions in every corner of the world, said Tillerson, I encourage all of you to use your natural and well-developed skills to adapt to changes here at home as well. I know this was a hotly contested election and we do not all feel the same way about the outcome, said Tillerson. Each of us is entitled to expression of our political beliefs, but we cannot let our personal convictions overwhelm our ability to work as one team. He also signaled he would impose changes to improve the functioning of the department and said the security of diplomats was a priority. There was no readout after his meeting with Gabriel at the State Department, although discussions were likely focused on the NATO alliance, the future of the Iran nuclear agreement and trade.  His separate phone calls with foreign ministers from Canada and Mexico coincided with Trump saying on Thursday he wanted early talks on the North American Free Trade Agreement, which he wants to renegotiate or repeal. I know him and we are very excited having the opportunity to work with him, Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said in an interview on CNN on Thursday evening, adding that he would meet Tillerson shortly. The two met a couple of times when Videgaray was finance minister and Tillerson at Exxon, he said. Tillerson also spoke by phone with Netanyahu, the State Department said in a statement. It did not say whether they discussed a White House statement that said Israeli settlements in occupied territories may not be helpful in achieving peace with Palestinians, adopting a more measured tone than its previous pro-Israel announcements.

As Trump used a prayer breakfast to take aim at a long-standing statutory barrier between politics and religion called the Johnson Amendment, civil liberties and gay rights groups expressed concern that he might consider an executive order to allow government agencies and businesses to deny services to gay people in the name of religious freedom. Trump did not reference such an order in his remarks. But he lambasted the Johnson Amendment, which prohibits tax-exempt organizations such as churches and other places of worship, charities and educational institutions from directly or indirectly participating in any political campaign in favor or against a political candidate.  I will get rid of and totally destroy the Johnson Amendment and allow our representatives of faith to speak freely and without fear of retribution. I will do that, remember, Trump told U.S. politicians, religious leaders and guests including Jordans King Abdullah at the annual National Prayer Breakfast. White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters Trump wanted to find ways to make sure people were not penalized for following through on their religious beliefs.  A draft executive order on religious freedom circulating among advocacy groups would allow government officials to deny marriage licenses to gay couples and let businesses withhold services from gay people, activists said.  The White House said it was not working on such an order. Trump previously spoke out against the Johnson amendment during the campaign and won the support of evangelical Christian leaders including Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. A change in the law would require action in the Republican-led U.S. Congress, and Republican lawmakers introduced legislation that would reverse the policy. After Trumps remarks, Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters he has always supported eliminating the Johnson Amendment. Critics including the group Americans United for Separation of Church and State expressed alarm. President Donald Trump and his allies in the religious right seek to turn Americas houses of worship into miniature political action committees, said the groups executive director, Barry Lynn. It would also lead some houses of worship to focus on supporting candidates in exchange for financial and other aid. That would be a disaster for both churches and politics in America, Lynn said. Peter Montgomery of the liberal advocacy group People For the American Way said Trump wants to pay back religious conservatives who helped get him elected by letting them turn their churches into political machines with tax-exempt charitable dollars. Scrapping the Johnson Amendment has been a goal of Christian conservatives, who contend it violates free speech and religious freedom rights. The U.S. Constitutions First Amendment guarantees freedom of religion and bars the government from establishing an official religion. We are encouraged to see that President Trump understands the very real constitutional violation posed by the Johnson Amendment and that he is committed to restoring a pastors right to speak freely from the pulpit without fearing government retribution, said Erik Stanley, senior counsel for the conservative Christian legal group Alliance Defending Freedom. Trump used the opening moments of the usually solemn prayer breakfast to deride actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, his successor on a reality TV show, for his viewership ratings.  Trump said Schwarzenegger, the Republican former governor of California, had disastrous ratings on the NBC reality TV program Celebrity Apprentice, which Trump previously starred in. They hired a big, big movie star, Arnold Schwarzenegger, to take my place. And we know how that turned out, Trump said. Its been a total disaster. ... And I want to just pray for Arnold if we can, for those ratings, OK? Schwarzenegger, who endorsed Ohio Governor John Kasich over Trump for the Republican presidential nomination, shot back, alluding to the controversies of Trumps first two weeks in office. Hey Donald, I have a great idea, Schwarzenegger said in a video. Why dont we switch jobs? You take over TV, because youre such an expert in ratings, and I take over your job. And then people can finally sleep comfortably again. Spicer later called Trumps remarks light-hearted and part of an absolutely beautiful speech. Trump a week ago put a 120-day halt on the U.S. refugee program, barred Syrian refugees indefinitely and imposed a 90-day suspension on people from seven predominantly Muslim countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Trump defended his directive on Thursday as crucial to ensuring religious freedom and tolerance in America, and said he wanted to prevent a beachhead of intolerance from spreading in the United States. He also called terrorism a fundamental threat to religious freedom. The world is in trouble, but were going to straighten it out. OK? Thats what I do. I fix things, Trump said. When you hear about the tough phone calls Im having, dont worry about it, Trump added, apparently referring to telephone conversations including one with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. Its time were going to be a little tough folks. Were taken advantage of by every nation in the world virtually. Its not going to happen anymore, Trump said.

The watchdog agency would also look at DHS adherence to court orders and allegations of individual misconduct on the part of DHS personnel, the statement said.If circumstances warrant, the OIG will consider including other issues that may arise during the course of the review. The order, which barred Syrian refugees indefinitely and imposed a 90-day suspension on people from seven predominantly Muslim countries, triggered widespread protests and caused confusion for travelers around the world.

In California, a federal judge in Los Angeles ruled that Trumps administration must allow immigrants with initial clearance for legal residency to enter the United States despite the ban. Massachusetts, New York, Virginia and Washington state have also challenged the order. Ali Vayeghan, an Iranian citizen and U.S. visa holder who was forced out of the country last week, became on Thursday the first person allowed back into United States because of the California court action. Vayeghan declined to comment on Trump or the order when speaking with reporters at Los Angeles International Airport but said through an interpreter, This is what human rights look like. The OIG statement said it would provide a final report to Kelly, the U.S. Congress and the public after its review but didnt say how long the review would take. DHS includes the Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agencies. Democratic U.S. Senators Tammy Duckworth and Dick Durbin had sought the investigation. Though Im encouraged by the DHS Inspector Generals decision to investigate the chaotic implementation of this un-American and unconstitutional executive order, I will continue to fight for it to be revoked, Durbin said in a statement.

The proposed revamp, reported by Reuters on Wednesday, would rename the multi-agency Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) task force to Countering Islamic Extremism or Countering Radical Islamic Extremism, and eliminate initiatives aimed at other violent hate groups in the United States. Abandoning efforts to counter violent white supremacist ideology is profoundly misguided and will endanger Americans,     New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement, adding that he urged President Donald Trump to keep the focus on  all extremist threats. Hugh Handeyside, a staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, said an explicit focus on American Muslims would violate basic constitutional principles, suggesting the changes described would be met with legal challenges. The Anti-Defamation League also criticized the plan, citing internal research that found 74 percent of deaths caused by domestic extremists between 2007 and 2016 were caused by right-wing extremists such as white supremacists, sovereign citizens and militia adherents. Postings on white supremacist websites welcomed the potential changes.  Facebook Inc., which like many internet platforms is often used by extremists, has financially supported at least one  CVE initiative but had no comment Thursday on the prospective changes. Sharp rhetoric about the threat posed by radical Islam was a central part of Trumps 2016 election campaign. The Republican frequently ridiculed then President Barack Obama and Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton for being politically correct in their approach to groups such as Islamic State. Contributors to Stormfront, a white supremacist web site, praised the administration.  Oh my goodness. Is this for real. Amazing my government no longer targets me as the enemy, wrote one prolific poster going by the username Magog.  Another regular poster, Celtchar, wrote: Wow. It just keeps getting better and better, adding that the anti-fascist movements days are numbered. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) declined to comment on the proposed changes. Last Friday, Trump signed an executive order temporarily blocking travel to the United States by people from seven predominantly Muslim countries, prompting a global outcry and charges from his critics that he was advancing a white nationalist agenda. Trump has said he wants to put America first but has rejected characterizations of the order as a Muslim ban. Trumps moves have already undermined participation in the CVE program, which is based on working with community groups to identify potential lone wolf attackers and recruits. Minnesota-based Ka Joog, a nonprofit which provides community based programs for Somali youth, late Wednesday became the second group to pull out of the program, citing concerns about the Trump administrations posture toward Muslims in turning down a $499,998 grant. Thats a lot of money, especially in the nonprofit world, said Mohamed Farah, the organizations director. But at the end of the day it all comes down to principle. I am a refugee, I am a Muslim, I am an immigrant and this president is against everything I stand for.     Last week, Leaders Advancing & Helping Communities, a Michigan-based group led by Lebanese-Americans and another grant recipient, declined a $500,000 provided by the DHS.

Gina Haspel, who will serve under new Central Intelligence Agency Director Mike Pompeo, was the first woman spy to reach the CIAs second-highest position, and her selection won applause inside the agencys Virginia headquarters and from many longtime U.S. intelligence professionals. However, Haspel once ran a secret CIA prison in Thailand where two suspected al-Qaeda members were waterboarded, intelligence and congressional officials said on condition of anonymity. She helped carry out an order to destroy videotapes of the waterboarding, which simulates drowning and is considered a form of torture, these people said.  Her promotion, combined with the possibility Trump could seek to reopen black site prisons and has endorsed waterboarding, may be controversial, despite the fact Pompeo and defense secretary James Mattis have rejected so called enhanced interrogation techniques. A draft executive order requesting a review of whether the U.S. should reopen CIA prisons in other countries and revisit other interrogation methods not considered torture has been circulating within the White House, but it is not clear if it will be issued, and if it is, whether any nations would agree to host such facilities again, the officials said. I appreciate Ms. Haspels many years of service at the CIA, yet I want some reassurance from her that she intends to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law, like Director Pompeo testified that he would during his confirmation process, said Democrat Mark Warner, vice chairman of the Senate intelligence committee. Christopher Anders, the deputy director of the Washington office of the American Civil Liberties Union, said he was gravely concerned about Haspels appointment. Haspel has served in a number of overseas posts, including as chief of a major CIA station, and although she was briefly acting head of the National Clandestine Service in 2013, Senator Dianne Feinstein, ranking minority member of the intelligence committee, opposed her permanent promotion to that job. Other veteran officials, though, praised Pompeo for choosing her. It speaks well of him for picking a seasoned veteran of the agency who is widely and deeply respected by the workforce as well as those outside the agency, said former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who resigned on January 20 after 50 years of military and intelligence service.

Trumps threat in a tweet provoked a response from California lawmakers, who in discussions on the floor of the state senate called it distasteful and an abuse of power, marking the latest clash between the Republican president and officials in the Democratic-majority state. If U.C. Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view - NO FEDERAL FUNDS? Trump wrote on Twitter at 6:13 a.m. EST (1113 GMT).  It was not immediately clear what action Trump could take without authorization from Congress, or without risking legal action.  In California, a mostly Democratic state where lawmakers have already begun preparing legislation to combat Trumps policies on immigration and climate change, the response was swift. To have the man at the helm of the most powerful nation of the world tweeting and threatening the University of California and talking about withholding funds, thats unique and I find that very distasteful, said Senate leader Kevin de Leon, a Los Angeles Democrat. Lawmakers said they would look into whether President Trump could actually take funds from the university which receives $400 to $450 million in funding for research annually. In 2016, the university also received $216 million in federal student aid, a legislative official said. All we have to go on now is another angry tweet, said Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon, a Democrat from the Los Angeles suburb of Paramount. He said lawmakers would continue to seek ways to protect the state, a Democratic stronghold where voters went two-to-one for Trumps opponent, Hillary Clinton in the November, 2016 election.      We have been having ongoing discussions on how to protect California from potential harm from the Trump Administration  those discussions will continue, Rendon said. Trumps tweet came in response to violence that broke out on the Universitys flagship campus amid demonstrations against the appearance of Milo Yiannopoulos of Breitbart News, the right-wing website formerly headed by presidential adviser Steve Bannon. On Thursday, Berkeley Chancellor Nicholas Dirks condemned the violence. Last night the Berkeley campus was invaded by more than 100 armed individuals clad in all black who utilized paramilitary tactics to engage in violent, destructive behavior, Dirks said. He said the 38,000-student campus, home to the Free Speech Movement of the 1960s, respected Yiannopoulos right to speak. U.S. Representative Barbara Lee, a Democrat whose district includes Berkeley, vowed to fight any attempt to slash funding. Simply put, President Trumps empty threat to cut funding from UC Berkeley is an abuse of power, Lee said. According to a Reuters review, the research money received by the university includes $121 million from the National Science Foundation for scientific research and $125 million from the Health and Human Services department for health and medical research. It may be difficult for Trump to cut off this money, as much of it is awarded through a competitive process that evaluates projects based on scientific merit. Yiannopoulos has been a provocative figure on the internet  for years, and has been widely criticized for comments he has made about Muslims, Black Lives Matter activists and feminists. Obviously its a liberal campus so they hate any libertarians or conservatives who dare to express an opinion on their campuses, he told Fox News. They particularly dont like me.

(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump does not have the authority to withhold funding from the University of California at Berkeley where violent protests led to the cancellation of a speech by a far-right editor, academics and experts said on Thursday. Trump threatened to cut funds for the universitys flagship Berkeley campus in a Twitter posting accusing the institution of failing to support free speech and practicing violence against innocent people. But academics and experts interviewed by Reuters said state universities mostly receive federal funds in the form of research grants and financial aid to students, and these cannot be revoked for reasons related to freedom of speech. There is nothing in current legislation that would allow President Trump to do that, said Don Heller, a provost at the University of San Francisco and an expert in public education financing. UC Berkeley receives between $400 million and $450 million annually in federal funding for research, and about $216 million for student financial aid, officials said. Some of that can be withheld but only in very specific circumstances, such as the publication of fraudulent research or the refusal of a university to comply with the Title IX law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in educational programs. To add freedom of speech to that list of offenses would take new legislation in Congress, Heller and other experts said. And even if such a law were passed, Berkeleys situation would be highly unlikely to be affected, said Terry Hartle, vice president for Government and Public Affairs at the American Council on Education.  That is because in Berkeleys case, the university had attempted to facilitate the speech on Wednesday night, cancelling it only after police became concerned about safety. Because the crowd had grown so violent and agitated, it was our recommendation to the speaker that his public safety was in jeopardy, UC Berkeley police department spokeswoman Sergeant Sabrina Reich said in a telephone interview.  Milo Yiannopoulos, an editor at Breitbart News, was escorted by police from the campus as a relatively small group among the 1500 protesters smashed windows and set fires and the campus was put on lockdown. There were no injuries. Yiannopoulos has been a provocative figure on the internet  for years, and has been widely criticized for comments he has made about Muslims, Black Lives Matter activists and feminists. Trump, whose aide Steve Bannon previously ran the right-wing, nationalist Breitbart site, tweeted his response shortly before dawn in Washington on Thursday. If U.C. Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view - NO FEDERAL FUNDS? the President wrote.   His administration was not immediately available for further comment on Thursday. Longer-term, there were some steps a Trump administration could take that would affect the university.  For instance, the Department of Energy could conceivably seek to relocate the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, which is in the hills above the campus and is managed by the University of California, said Bob Shireman, a former deputy undersecretary for education in the Obama administration. There are things that if a president really wanted to punish some particular college they could influence those decisions but it would take a long time and there would be a lot of reaction, said Shireman, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress moved swiftly on Thursday to undo Obama-era rules on the environment, corruption, labor and guns, with the Senate wiping from the books a rule aimed at reducing water pollution. By a vote of 54-45, the Senate approved a resolution already passed in the House of Representatives to kill the rule aimed at keeping pollutants out of streams in areas near mountaintop removal coal-mining sites.  The resolution now goes to President Donald Trump, who is expected to sign it quickly. It was only the second time the Congressional Review Act, which allows lawmakers to stop newly minted regulations in their tracks, has been used successfully since it was passed in 2000. The Senate then turned to an equally controversial rule requiring mining and energy companies such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron to disclose taxes and other payments they make to governments at home and abroad. Democrats, who cannot filibuster the resolution, attempted to slow the process by pushing debate late into the night, with a vote scheduled for shortly after 6:30 a.m. on Friday. Republicans are using their control of Congress and the White House to attack regulations they believe hurt the economy. They cast the stream protection rule as harming industry and usurping state rights. The Obama Administrations stream buffer rule was an attack against coal miners and their families, said the top Senate Republican, Mitch McConnell, adding it had threatened jobs in his home state of Kentucky. Environmental activists and many Democrats said it would have made drinking water safer by monitoring for pollutants such as lead. Given that many of these toxins are known to cause birth defects, developmental delays, and other health and environmental impacts, this basic monitoring provision was essential, said Jeni Collins, associate legislative representative for environmental group Earthjustice. The coal industry hopes the repeal will lead Trump to overturn a moratorium by former President Barack Obamas administration on some coal leases. Senator Joe Manchin, who represents West Virginia, historically coal country, was one of the few Democrats who supported killing the rule. He told CNN more than 400 changes had been made to the regulation as it was drafted. Theres nobody in West Virginia that wants dirty water and dirty air, but you cant throw 400 different regulations ... on top of what we already have and expect anyone to survive, he said. Also on Thursday, the House on Thursday overturned Obama administration rules addressing pay discrimination at federal contractors and requiring expanded background checks for gun purchasers who receive Social Security benefits and have a history of mental illness. It plans on Friday to kill a measure addressing methane emissions on public lands. The Senate will then take all three up. The Senate is also targeting rules enacted in the final months of Obamas administration for extinction. Senator David Perdue, a Republican from Georgia, introduced on Wednesday a resolution for killing one intended to protect users of gift and prepaid cards. Under the Congressional Review Act, lawmakers can vote to undo regulations with a simple majority. Agencies cannot revisit overturned regulations. Timing in the law means any regulation enacted since May is eligible for repeal. The House already approved a resolution ending the rule that requires oil companies to publicly state taxes and payments, which is part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law.  Republicans and some oil and mining companies say the rule is burdensome and costly and duplicates other long-standing regulations. Supporters of the rule see it as vital for exposing bribery and questionable financial ties U.S. companies may have with foreign governments, as well as showing shareholders how their money is spent.

Renewed violence flared this week between Moscow-backed rebels and Ukraine government forces that has caused the highest casualty rate since mid-December and cut off power and water to thousands of civilians on both sides of the frontline. That this surge of attacks began the day after he talked with you by phone is a clear indication that Vladimir Putin is moving quickly to test you as commander in chief. Americas response will have lasting consequences, McCain said in a letter to Trump released by his office. Washington has supplied aid to Ukraine including drones, radar, first-aid kits, night vision and communications gear as part Democratic President Barack Obamas strategy of providing non-lethal military assistance while focusing on sanctions and diplomacy to end the war. The election of Trump, whose call for better relations with Moscow, has alarmed Kiev as the conflict has remained unresolved. Lawmakers in Washington expressed support for Ukraine on Thursday and called for restraint from Moscow. McCain urged Trump to use his authority under an existing  defense policy law to provide lethal assistance to Ukraine. Vladimir Putins violent campaign to destabilize and dismember the sovereign nation of Ukraine will not stop unless and until he meets a strong and determined response, McCain wrote. McCain also urged Trump to expand current sanctions against Russia that were put in place after its annexation of Ukraines Crimea region in 2014. Democratic Senator Ben Cardin, top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he would work with McCain and other senators to codify the existing sanctions into law. It is incumbent upon the Senate to clearly express its support for the sovereignty of Ukrainian and solidarity with our close allies in Europe, he said. Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in the House of Representatives, also cautioned the Trump administration on Thursday against easing sanctions on Moscow, saying such a move would be staggeringly dangerous. On Wednesday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg called on Russia to use its considerable influence with separatist rebels to end the violence, which brought the festering conflict back into focus amid warnings of a looming humanitarian crisis in freezing winter temperatures.

I consider it unfortunate on the occasion of my first appearance here I must condemn the aggressive actions of Russia, Haley said, making her first public remarks inside the Security Council since being sworn in as the United States representative to the United Nations last month. It shouldnt happen, or be that way. We do want to better our relations with Russia. However, the dire situation in eastern Ukraine is one that demands clear and strong condemnation of Russian actions.  Her remarks came amid speculation over U.S. President Donald Trumps intentions towards Moscow. Trump has praised Russias President Vladimir Putin and expressed a wish for improved relations between the two countries.  Haley made clear that tensions over the Ukraine would not end soon, including the matter of sanctions slapped on Russia related to the annexation of Crimea three years ago.      Eastern Ukraine of course is not the only part of the country suffering because of Russias aggressive actions. The United States continues to condemn and call for an immediate end to the Russian occupation of Crimea, Haley said.   Crimea is a part of Ukraine. Our Crimea related sanctions will remain in place until Russia returns control of the peninsula to Ukraine. The United States and other Western powers imposed sanctions on Russia in 2014 over its annexation of the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine and its support for pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine. Russias ambassador to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, disputed Haleys commentary on Crimea, but welcomed his American counterpart. It was friendly enough, given the circumstances and given the subject we were discussing, the Russian ambassador told reporters.  He noted the chance for a new start after ties between Russia and United States frayed in Obamas second term. If there is an opportunity to have better relations with the United States, if there is an opportunity for us to work better with the United States... then we should take this opportunity.  He faulted the Obama administration for not doing enough to end the conflict in Ukraine and called on the Trump government to bring its influence to bear.   Clearly they are the people who are listened to in Kiev. Ukraine and Russia had blamed each other for a surge in fighting in recent days around the government-held industrial town of Avdiivka that has led to the highest casualty toll in weeks and cut off power and water to thousands of civilians on the front line. At the Thursday Security Council session, Ukraines U.N. ambassador, Volodymr Yelchenko, who holds the presidency of the Security Council for February, said the strife around Avdiivka started with artillery shelling by the Russian army and Russian-backed fighters from the two suburbs they control abutting the town. Churkin blamed Ukrainian security forces for starting the bloodshed. U.N. under-secretary-general for political affairs, Jeffrey Feltman, painted a grim picture of the situation on the ground. Hundreds of thousand of civilians on both sides of the contact line are still at risk of losing all access to water, heating and electricity, bringing the specter of further displacements closer, Feltman said.

Republican Governor Terry Branstad has said he supports the bill.  Planned Parenthood draws the ire of many Republicans because it provides abortions, and Republican President Donald Trump has pledged to defund the organization.  This change will allow Iowa to restrict government funding to family planning services away from organizations that perform abortions that are not medically necessary, Republican Senator Amy Sinclair, one of the bills sponsors, said on Thursday before the vote.   Planned Parenthood denounced the vote.  The Republican lawmakers who continue to advance this bill should be ashamed of themselves. They are playing political games, with the lives of low-income Iowans at stake, Planned Parenthood of the Heartland said in a statement. This bill does nothing to advance their extremist agenda to limit access to abortion. Instead, it blocks access to crucial family planning services for thousands of Iowans  the very services that most effectively prevent abortion. Its a self-serving, misleading and dangerous political game. The bill directs the Iowa Department of Human Services to discontinue the Medicaid family planning network waiver on July 1 and replace it with a state family planning services program.  Eligibility requirements for the new network would remain the same, but no funding would be provided to organizations that provide abortions or maintain facilities where abortions are carried out.  Planned Parenthood is Iowas largest abortion provider with 12 clinics in the state, but no public money is used for abortions, according to the Des Moines Register.   Branstad has proposed paying for the new state-run program by shifting $2.8 million in funds from services for vulnerable adults, families and children, the newspaper reported.

Trump, speaking at a prayer breakfast attended by politicians, faith leaders and guests including Jordans King Abdullah, said he wanted to prevent a beachhead of intolerance from spreading in the United States. The world is in trouble, but were going to straighten it out, OK? Thats what I do - I fix things, Trump said in his speech. Trumps executive order a week ago put a 120-day halt on the U.S. refugee program, barred Syrian refugees indefinitely and imposed a 90-day suspension on people from seven predominantly Muslim countries - Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The measure, which Trump says is aimed at protecting the country from terrorist attacks, has drawn protests and legal challenges. Trump, a wealthy businessman and former reality TV star who had never previously held public office when he was sworn in on Jan. 20, also sought to reassure the large crowd about the nature of his phone calls with world leaders. The Washington Post said Trump had a tense call with Australias Prime Minister about his immigration order. Believe me, when you hear about the tough phone calls Im having - dont worry about it. Just dont worry about it, Trump said. He did not specify which calls he was referring to. Were taken advantage of by every nation in the world virtually. Its not going to happen anymore, said Trump, who campaigned on a stance of America first that he said would ensure the country was not taken advantage of in its trade or other foreign relations. Trump said violence against religious minorities must end.   All nations have a moral obligation to speak out against such violence. All nations have a duty to work together to confront it, and to confront it viciously, if we have to, he said. Trump said the United States has taken necessary action in recent days to protect religious liberty in the United States, referring to his immigration action. Critics of the measure have accused him of violating the constitutional guarantee of religious freedom, because the designated countries are majority-Muslim, and of slamming the door shut to refugees. Trump has said the move was necessary to ensure a more thorough vetting of people coming into the United States.  Our nation has the most generous immigration system in the world. There are those who would exploit that generosity to undermine the values that we hold so dear, Trump said. There are those who would seek to enter our country for the purpose of spreading violence, or oppressing other people based upon their faith or their lifestyle - not right. We will not allow a beachhead of intolerance to spread in our nation, he said. Trump said his administrations new system would ensure that people entering the United States embrace U.S. values including religious liberty. He also pledged to get rid of the Johnson Amendment, a tax provision that prevents tax-exempt charities like churches from being involved in political campaigns. The White House said on Wednesday it has issued updated guidance on the travel order clarifying that legal permanent residents, or green card holders, from the designated countries require no waiver to enter the United States.

One source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said about eight Iranian entities were to be sanctioned, or designated in U.S. legal jargon, for terrorism-related activities and about 17 for ballistic missile-related activities under separate existing U.S. executive orders. The source declined to name the entities. The sources said the new sanctions had been in the works for some time and that Irans decision to test-fire a ballistic missile on Sunday had helped to trigger U.S. President Donald Trumps decision to impose them. The White House signaled a newly aggressive stance toward Iran on Wednesday when Michael Flynn, Trumps national security adviser, made a statement putting Iran on notice for test-firing the missile and senior U.S. officials said the administration was reviewing how to respond. The new sanctions may be the leading edge of a tougher policy but the sources stressed that the United States was imposing them in a manner so as not to conflict with the 2015 Iran nuclear deal under which Tehran agreed to curb its nuclear program in return for relief from economic sanctions. Trump said earlier on Thursday that nothing is off the table in dealing with Iran following the missile launch, and his fellow Republicans in Congress said they would back him up with new sanctions. Trumps comment was in response to a question about whether he would consider military options to respond to Tehran, a day after Flynns comment about putting Iran on notice. The sanctions are not likely to have much, if any, practical effect on the Iranian entities or on U.S. companies or individuals who are, with few exceptions, barred from dealing with Iran. The sanctions are to be imposed under Executive Order 13224, which freezes the U.S. assets of entities or individuals who commit, threaten to commit, or support terrorism, and Executive Order 13382, which freezes the assets of weapons of mass destruction proliferators or their supporters. Given the long history of U.S. sanctions against Tehran dating to the 1979 Islamic Revolution, there are unlikely to be any assets under U.S. jurisdiction to be blocked. However, the sanctions could have the effect of dissuading foreign companies from dealing with the Iranian entities who are designated, said Brookings Institution analyst Robert Einhorn.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - When gay former law clerk Joshua Goodbaum married his partner in 2014, he got effusive and emotional reassurance from his former boss, President Donald Trumps conservative U.S. Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch. Goodbaum, now an attorney in Connecticut, recalled fondly their conversation on the week of the wedding: He said, This is a wonderful thing. Youll see how your relationship grows. Goodbaum, who in 2009 served as a clerk for the Colorado federal appeals court judge, added: I have never felt the least whiff from him of homophobia or intolerance toward gay people. As the U.S. Senate weighs whether to confirm the Republican presidents nomination of Gorsuch for a lifetime seat on the nations highest court, his views on social issues, such as gay rights, are under scrutiny by Democrats and Republicans alike. The Supreme Court periodically makes landmark civil rights decisions such as the 2015 ruling legalizing gay marriage nationwide. In their current term, for instance, the justices will tackle a major transgender rights case. For a year, the court has had eight justices, not the requisite nine, because Republicans refused to consider Democratic former President Barack Obamas nomination of Merrick Garland. Democrats remain furious with the Republicans for that, and are scouring Gorsuchs record to build their case against his Senate confirmation. When he was named as a nominee by Trump on Tuesday, Gorsuch, 49, immediately came under attack from liberal groups that pounced on his social issues record, which is thin but offers clues on how he might behave as a justice, if confirmed. Like Goodbaum, friends and acquaintances of Gorsuch, many of them Democrats, said he is genial, tolerant and respectful. In some ways, he differs in style from the justice he was named to replace, the late Antonin Scalia, who was known for being combative and blunt on the bench. Gorsuch would not put politics before the law, these people said. But his conservative legal philosophy indicates he would likely vote with like-minded conservative justices on the closely divided court. He rejects the idea that liberals can press their social agenda in the courts. That could signaled he may be less likelyto side with Justice Anthony Kennedy, a conservative who often casts the deciding vote in close cases. Kennedy has joined with liberal justices in backing gay marriage, abortion rights and, most recently, a limited form of racial preferences in college admissions. It remains an open question whether Gorsuch wouldvote for conservative agenda items such as expanding religious liberties in a way some critics say allows for discrimination against gays and others, restricting voting rights and lifting campaign finance restrictions. In a 2005 article for conservative magazine National Review, Gorsuch said liberals have become addicted to the courtroom, relying on judges and lawyers rather than elected leaders and the ballot box, as the primary means of effecting their social agenda on everything from gay marriage to assisted suicide to the use of vouchers for private-school education.  Some liberal politicians and advocacy groups have labeled Gorsuch a conservative hardliner in part over his role in deciding a 2013 case involving the Christian owners of the arts-and-crafts retailer Hobby Lobby. The ruling allowed owners of private companies to object on religious grounds to a federal requirement that they provide insurance to employees that pays for womens birth control. It was affirmed by the Supreme Court. We absolutely must not confirm a Supreme Court nominee who has ruled that the religious beliefs of employers can trump the law, said Rachel Tiven, chief executive of Lambda Legal, an advocacy group for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. On another issue, Gorsuch last October said his colleagues on the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals should have reconsidered a ruling that prevented Utah Governor Gary Herbert from suspending funding to womens healthcare and abortion provider Planned Parenthood over videos purported to show its officials negotiating the sale of fetal tissue.  In 2006, Gorsuch wrote a book arguing against legalization of assisted suicide and euthanasia. After Trump nominated him, many social conservatives and religious groups, perhaps looking back at his book, said they hoped Gorsuch would vote on the court to roll back abortion rights. In the book, Gorsuch cited the inviolability of human life, calling it a basic good. The Knights of Columbus, a Roman Catholic fraternal organization, saidGorsuchwould uphold religious freedoms and the right to life of every person. Former clerks said they do not know how Gorsuch, a member of the Episcopal church, would vote on gay marriage or abortion. But they said he never brought his religion into his work.  Hes not the kind of person to use his post to push an agenda, saidJason Murray, a Gorsuch clerk in 2011 who is a Democrat. You could certainly say Judge Gorsuch is a conservative. But I dont see how his personality or record bears out that he is an extremist, Murray said. Some who knowGorsuchpersonally said his respect for legal precedent could prevent radical attempts to change the law. Hes very sensitive to the importance of societal stability. So if he were to change Roe v. Wade significantly I would be surprised, added TracyAshmore, a Democratic lawyer from Denver, referring to the landmark 1973 Supreme Court ruling legalizing abortion.

Loyal patrons who rely on the stores for staples of daily life had to look elsewhere for lunch after more than 1,000 locations shut their doors from noon to 8 p.m. in a move coordinated by groups including the Muslim Community Network and the Yemeni American Community. Bodega, a Spanish word meaning wine shop, is New York City slang for small stores selling everything from deli foods to newspapers and cat litter.  We want to send the message that were here, said Sulaiman Alaodyi, a 24-year-old cashier at the Best and Tasty deli in the borough of the Bronx, a bodega that is normally open around the clock. This was the first time it closed its doors since it started business nine months ago.  The protests followed the decision by Trumps administration to put a four-month hold on letting refugees into the United States and to temporarily bar travelers from Yemen, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan and Somalia. The order, which is being challenged in U.S. courts, left some travelers stranded and others held at airports on arrival. It provoked an outpouring of anger and dismay from immigrants, refugees and supporters. Many store owners and workers who shut up shop were going to rally and hold public sundown prayers outside Brooklyn Borough Hall. Were going to go out and support all our brothers and sisters who are detained in airports and in other countries that cant get back, Alaodyi said. This is just not fair. New York City is home to many immigrants from Yemen, a country of about 24 million in the Arabian Peninsula. Many live in Brooklyn, but some are in Manhattan, Queens and the Bronx. Golden Deli, a Yemeni-owned bodega in Manhattan, was swelling with customers who picked up early lunches before it closed. Nermin Radoncic, 22, walked up shortly after workers pulled down the shutters at noon.  Radoncic, who lives nearby but is moving to Queens, was disappointed he could not buy a pastrami and Swiss sandwich on his last day in the neighborhood. But he said he supported the protest. They make the bomb sandwiches, Radoncic said of Golden Deli. This is like the best deli out here. Trump is a jerk. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Insiders acknowledge the cautious strategy could anger progressives whose support helped bring Trudeau to power in 2015 but say for now, he has no choice but to hold fire: Canada sends 75 percent of its exports to the United States and could suffer if it is targeted by Trump. Why poke a grizzly bear while its having lunch? Trump has just got into office and he is formulating his economic plans, said one senior political source. While Trudeaus close friendship with former President Barack Obama was often referred to as a bromance and dude-plomacy, Canadian prime ministers have not always had close ties with U.S. presidents. Still, few in Ottawa have experienced anything like Trump, insiders said. He is totally unpredictable, said another government source. Although Canada regards the United States as its closest ally, Trudeau has yet to visit Washington to see Trump.  A visit tentatively scheduled this week was canceled after a shooter killed six Muslims in a Quebec mosque and no new date has been set, said two people familiar with the matter. Michael Kergin, a former Canadian ambassador to Washington, said Trudeaus caution was wise. Hes been playing it pretty well by restraining the temptation to be publicly critical of the president. At the same time, its a delicate balance, said Kergin, now a senior adviser at law firm Bennett Jones. Trudeau was also right not to follow British Prime Minister Theresa May in rushing to Washington to gin up a special relationship, only to watch Trump make an unpopular move on immigration after she left, Kergin said. Trump labeled a refugee swap deal with Australia dumb on Thursday after a telephone call with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull that the Washington Post reported was acrimonious. Turnbull kept any sparring behind closed doors. Trudeau, however, has taken indirect shots. When Trump signed orders banning people from seven Muslim-majority states, Trudeau tweeted that Canada was open to those fleeing war. His chief spokeswoman blasted U.S. network Fox News on Tuesday for a tweet falsely claiming the Quebec gunman was of Moroccan origin. But she said nothing publicly when Trumps spokesman said the attack on Muslims showed why it was important to suspend immigration from Muslim nations.   This approach infuriates the opposition New Democrats, who have called on Trudeau to denounce Trumps racist immigration policy.  Trudeau team members acknowledge that over time, Liberals could lose support before a 2019 election if the prime minister is deemed not to be standing up for Canadian values such as inclusiveness. That is a risk, but well address it closer to the time, said the first Ottawa insider. Surveys show the Liberals have a healthy, but narrowing, advantage over their nearest rivals. Pollster Nik Nanos of Nanos Research said it was too early for Trudeau to be aggressive.  He has to avoid making any kind of criticism. Trump has a very thin skin and hes quick to lash out, he said.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The battered U.S. coal industry rejoiced after the Senate voted on Thursday to repeal a rule that limited companies from dumping mining waste in streams, saying the move could halt the sectors decline. The Senate, approving a resolution passed by the House of Representatives on Wednesday, overturned the Stream Protection Rule as part of a broader move by Republicans to reverse what they see as overregulation by former President Barack Obamas administration on energy development. The demise of the rule had been expected. The Congressional Review Act allows Congress, controlled by Republicans, to undo rules finalized at the end of a previous administration. This is one very, very important step to get coal back on its feet and stop the hemorrhaging of jobs that weve seen, said Luke Popovich, a spokesman for the National Mining Association.  The coal industry hopes the move is the first step toward a recovery under President Donald Trump, who has vowed to clear away regulation to support more mining. Coal advocates are hoping his administration will overturn a moratorium the Obama administration placed on new coal leases on federal lands, and scrap regulations on carbon dioxide emissions. The coal waste rule was intended to protect 6,000 miles (9,700 km) of streams and large areas of forests over the next two decades, the Interior Department said when it issued the rule in December. It argued the rule would protect drinking water without undermining the economy or energy supply. The coal industry countered that the rule could have reduced the number of direct mining jobs by 30 percent and made 60 percent of its existing reservoirs uneconomic to produce.   Coal companies such as Arch Coal Inc and Peabody Energy Corp - two of the nations biggest miners - experienced recent bankruptcies because of a surge in production of natural gas and new regulations curbing carbon dioxide emissions.  Stephanie Weiler, a spokeswoman at Peabody Energy said the company was pleased by the elimination of the rule and supported any actions aimed at reining in unnecessary regulations that dont improve the environment yet harm the economic and jobs landscape. Arch did not immediately comment. Gary Broadbent, a spokesman for private company Murray Energy, said the rule was an attempt to destroy our nations underground coal mines and put coal miners out of work. Democratic Senator Edward Markey said the coal industrys request that Republicans kill the rule amounted to saying: Please protect us from having to protect the public.

Feinbergs move would make him the latest Wall Street veteran to serve under Trump. U.S. Treasury Secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin, U.S. Commerce Secretary designate Wilbur Ross, and Gary Cohn, director of the White House National Economic Council, are just some of the high-profile financiers who have agreed to join Trumps administration. It is not clear what role Feinberg is discussing with Trumps senior team. His appointment would require him to provide voluminous information and disclosures to the Office of Government Ethics and comply with all applicable conflict-of-interest rules and regulations, Cerberus told its investors earlier on Thursday in a letter seen by Reuters. Cerberus also told its investors that it has a succession plan in place that would result in minimal changes to the current management and operation of the firm. Feinberg, who served as one of Trumps economic advisers during his U.S. election campaign, co-founded Cerberus in 1992.  A Princeton graduate, he previously worked at bond trader Drexel Burnham Lambert. Forbes Magazine currently pegs 56-year-old Feinbergs net worth at $1.25 billion. Feinberg rarely gives interviews and has been photographed only a few times by news photographers. It is not clear how he would respond to the publicity of a job within the administration, assuming the role being discussed is a high-profile one.  Cerberus became well known for a $7.4 billion deal it struck in 2007, along with co-investors, to buy an 80 percent stake in car maker Chrysler and its financing arm Chrysler Financial. Chrysler was pushed to the brink of liquidation in 2009 before a bailout that was the subject of intense debate within the administration of former U.S. President Barack Obama. Cerberus lost control of the automaker during its restructuring. In December 2010, Cerberus struck a deal to sell Chrysler Financial to Toronto-Dominion Bank for $6.3 billion. A source close to Cerberus said at the time that deal meant the private equity firm would end up close to break-even on its investment in Chrysler as a whole. Feinberg attracted more controversy in 2012, when a gunman killed 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, using a Bushmaster rifle made by Freedom Group Inc, an arms manufacturer owned by Cerberus. Following unease by Cerberus investors, the New York-based buyout firm sought to sell Freedom Group but could not sell it for the $1 billion price tag it expected. Instead, Feinberg came up with a mechanism for Cerberus fund investors to sell their stakes in Freedom Group.  Cerberus has more than $30 billion in assets under management.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - Scientists may steal a page from the oil industrys playbook to stop President Donald Trump rewriting the U.S. position on climate change, by relying on an obscure law meant to ensure federal agencies present accurate information. The 2001 Information Quality Act, passed under Republican President George W. Bush, has for years provided a way for companies and their lobbyists to challenge federal agencies assumptions on issues ranging from the threats posed by global warming to the health effects of petrochemicals. Now, as Trumps leadership seeks to get the Environmental Protection Agency into line with the new administrations more pro-business and anti-regulation agenda, the act could become a tool for rebellious scientists and climate advocates, legal experts said. Trump has expressed doubts about the science behind climate change, putting his administration on a collision course with an overwhelming majority of scientists who believe that human consumption of fossil fuels is warming the planet and triggering sea level rise and more frequent powerful storms. A spokesman for Trumps EPA said last week that the agencys website is under review, raising worries of a rewrite that could put the site at odds with EPA employees own research. A Trump administration official did not respond to a request for comment. Posting blatantly false information on the EPAs website would violate the Information Quality Act, said Romany Webb, a climate law fellow at Columbia University. The guidelines clearly state that information disseminated to the public, including via a website, must be substantively accurate. Michael Halpern, deputy director for the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a non-profit climate science advocacy group, said the Information Quality Act could be one of the options scientists consider using to ensure federal agencies match scientific research. The Information Quality Act allows individuals who object to information presented by a federal agency to request a correction. If the agency denies the request, the individual can appeal in a process overseen by an independent inspector general. In the case of the EPA, the appeal would go to a panel of political appointees  who will likely be named after Trumps pick to head the EPA, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, is confirmed. The EPAs Inspector General, however, is already in place: Arthur Elkins, a former EPA lawyer appointed by Barack Obama in 2010. We have discretionary authority to look at anything we think is important and valuable to the agencys activities, Alan Larsen, counsel to the Inspector General, told Reuters. If employees were asked to do something improper ... they could bring that to the IGs office. The Washington Post reported this week that a member of the Trump transition team had sent an email stating inspectors general across federal agencies were being held over on a temporary basis. After some backlash, Trump transition team members then sought to reassure the inspectors general they would not be forced out, the Post reported. There are other ways employees can flag their concerns, including by complaining to the agencysScientific Integrity Officer. The Scientific Integrity Office meets quarterly with the Inspector Generals office to discuss complaints. Industrys use of the Information Quality Act over the years has had mixed results. Just five of the 20 requests for correction filed in 2014 ended up fully or partially corrected, according to a report to Congress. Halpern said, however, that he expected better results if scientists file complaints rather than industry.  Overruling a correction request brought by scientists within the agency, he said, could violate the EPAs scientific integrity policy, which states agency scientists have the right of last review over information that relies on their expertise. A former EPA official who asked not to be named said that, under normal circumstances, the internal mechanisms to protect website accuracy should work, but added were in uncharted territory.""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Budget committee Chairman Mike Enzi, a Wyoming Republican, told the panel Mulvaney is uniquely qualified to be budget director: He is a proven budget hawk thats been vocal about our need to rein in government spending and debt.      But the nominee came under fire from Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination last year.  The Vermont lawmaker warned that Mulvaneys positions on Social Security and Medicare contradict Trumps campaign statements to leave the programs untouched. Sanders also said his failure to pay taxes for a nanny he employed from 2000 to 2004 should disqualify him as a nominee.

Environmental groups, which have strongly criticized the choice of Pruitt, raised concerns that the nomination was pushed through to the full Senate.

The program, Countering Violent Extremism, or CVE, would be changed to Countering Islamic Extremism or Countering Radical Islamic Extremism, the sources said, and would no longer target groups such as white supremacists who have also carried out bombings and shootings in the United States.  MORE For hardline West Bank settlers, Jared Kushner's their man Iranians fear attacks and economic isolation as Trump talks tough Republicans wrestle with effort to cut Obamacare Such a change would reflect Trumps election campaign rhetoric and criticism of former President Barack Obama for being weak in the fight against Islamic State and for refusing to use the phrase radical Islam in describing it. Islamic State has claimed responsibility for attacks on civilians in several countries.  The CVE program aims to deter groups or potential lone attackers through community partnerships and educational programs or counter-messaging campaigns in cooperation with companies such as Google (GOOGL.O) and Facebook (FB.O).  Some proponents of the program fear that rebranding it could make it more difficult for the government to work with Muslims already hesitant to trust the new administration, particularly after Trump issued an executive order last Friday temporarily blocking travel to the United States from seven predominantly Muslim countries.  WATCH Uber CEO quits Trump advisory board Still, the CVE program, which focuses on U.S. residents and is separate from a military effort to fight extremism online, has been criticized even by some supporters as ineffective.  A source who has worked closely with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on the program said Trump transition team members first met with a CVE task force in December and floated the idea of changing the name and focus.  In a meetinglast Thursdayattended by senior staff for DHS Secretary John Kelly, government employees were asked to defend why they chose certain community organizations as recipients of CVE program grants, said the source, who requested anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the discussions.  Although CVE funding has been appropriated by Congress and the grant recipients were notified in the final days of the Obama administration, the money still may not go out the door, the source said, adding that Kelly is reviewing the matter.  The department declined comment. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.  Some Republicans in Congress have long assailed the program as politically correct and ineffective, asserting that singling out and using the term radical Islam as the trigger for many violent attacks would help focus deterrence efforts.  Others counter that branding the problem as radical Islam would only serve to alienate more than three million Americans who practice Islam peacefully.  Many community groups, meanwhile, had already been cautious about the program, partly over concerns that it could double as a surveillance tool for law enforcement.  Hoda Hawa, director of policy for the Muslim Public Affairs Council, said she was told last week by people within DHS that there was a push to refocus the CVE effort from tackling all violent ideology to only Islamist extremism.  That is concerning for us because they are targeting a faith group and casting it under a net of suspicion, she said.  Another source familiar with the matter was told last week by a DHS official that a name change would take place. Three other sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said such plans had been discussed but were unable to attest whether they had been finalized.  The Obama administration sought to foster relationships with community groups to engage them in the counterterrorism effort. In 2016, Congress appropriated $10 million in grants for CVE efforts and DHS awarded the first round of grants on Jan. 13, a week before Trump was inaugurated.  Among those approved were local governments, city police departments, universities and non-profit organizations. In addition to organizations dedicated to combating Islamic States recruitment in the United States, grants also went to Life After Hate, which rehabilitates former neo-Nazis and other domestic extremists.  Just in the past two years, authorities blamed radical and violent ideologies as the motives for a white supremacists shooting rampage inside a historic African-American church in Charleston, South Carolina and Islamist militants for shootings and bombings in California, Florida and New York.  One grant recipient, Leaders Advancing & Helping Communities, a Michigan-based group led by Lebanese-Americans, has declined a $500,000 DHS grant it had sought, according to an email the group sent that was seen by Reuters. A representative for the group confirmed the grant had been rejected but declined further comment.  Given the current political climate and cause for concern, LAHC has chosen to decline the award, said the email, which was sent last Thursday, a day before Trump issued his immigration order, which was condemned at home and abroad as discriminating against Muslims while the White House said it was to to protect the American people from terrorist attacks by foreign nationals.

(Reuters) - The U.S. military said on Wednesday it was looking into whether more civilians were killed in a raid on al Qaeda in Yemen on the weekend, in the first operation authorized by President Donald Trump as commander in chief.  U.S. Navy SEAL William Ryan Owens was killed in the raid on a branch of al Qaeda, also known as AQAP, in al Bayda province, which the Pentagon said also killed 14 militants. However, medics at the scene said about 30 people, including 10 women and children, were killed.  U.S. Central Command said in a statement that an investigating team had concluded regrettably that civilian non-combatants were likely killed during Sundays raid. It said children may have been among the casualties.  Central Command said its assessment seeks to determine if there were any still-undetected civilian casualties in the ferocious firefight.  DONT MISS Trump tightens Iran sanctions, Tehran hits back Business Watch - Panic in Silicon Valley Reuters TV - Inside a Mexican migrant shelter U.S. military officials told Reuters that Trump approved his first covert counterterrorism operation without sufficient intelligence, ground support or adequate backup preparations.  As a result, three officials said, the attacking SEAL team found itself dropping onto a reinforced al Qaeda base defended by landmines, snipers, and a larger than expected contingent of heavily armed Islamist extremists.  The Pentagon directed queries about the officials characterization of the raid to U.S. Central Command, which pointed only to its statement on Wednesday.  CENTCOM asks for operations we believe have a good chance for success and when we ask for authorization we certainly believe there is a chance of successful operations based on our planning, CENTCOM spokesman Colonel John Thomas said.  Any operation where you are going to put operators on the ground has inherent risks, he said.  The U.S. officials said the extremists base had been identified as a target before the Obama administration left office on Jan. 20, but then-President Barack Obama held off approving a raid ahead of his departure.  A White House official said the operation was thoroughly vetted by the previous administration and that the previous defense secretary had signed off on it in January. The raid was delayed for operational reasons, the White House official said.  The military officials who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity said a brutal firefight killed Owens and at least 15 Yemeni women and children. One of the dead was the 8-year-old daughter of Anwar al-Awlaki, a militant killed by a 2011 U.S. drone strike.  Some of the women were firing at the U.S. force, Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis told reporters.  The American elite forces did not seize any militants or take any prisoners offsite, but White House spokesman Sean Spicer said on Wednesday the raid yielded benefits.  Knowing that we killed an estimated 14 AQAP members and that we gathered an unbelievable amount of intelligence that will prevent the potential deaths or attacks on American soil  is something that I think most service members understand, that thats why they joined the service, Spicer said.  A senior leader in Yemens al Qaeda branch, Abdulraoof al-Dhahab, and other militants were killed in the gunbattle, al Qaeda said.  One of the three U.S. officials said on-the-ground surveillance of the compound was minimal, at best.  The decision was made ... to leave it to the incoming administration, partly in the hope that more and better intelligence could be collected, that official said.  As Sundays firefight intensified, the raiders called in Marine helicopter gunships and Harrier jump jets, and then two MV-22 Osprey vertical takeoff and landing aircraft to extract the SEALs.  One of the two suffered engine failure, two of the officials said, and hit the ground so hard that two crew members were injured, and one of the Marine jets had to launch a precision-guided bomb to destroy it.  Trump traveled to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware on Wednesday in an unexpected visit to meet the family of Owens, who had been a chief special warfare operator.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House put Iran on notice on Wednesday for test-firing a ballistic missile and said it was reviewing how to respond, taking an aggressive posture toward Tehran that could raise tensions in the region. While the exact implications of the U.S. threat were unclear, the new administration signaled that President Donald Trump intended to do more, possibly including imposing new sanctions, to curb what he sees as defiance of a nuclear deal negotiated in 2015 by then-President Barack Obama. The tough talk commits the administration to back up its rhetoric with action, which could cast doubt on the future of the Iran agreement and sow further uncertainty in an already chaotic Middle East, experts said. Trump has frequently criticized the Iran nuclear deal, calling the agreement weak and ineffective. Officials declined to say whether the military option was on the table, although Pentagon spokesman Christopher Sherwood said: The U.S. military has not changed its posture in response to the Iranian test missile launch on Sunday. A fiery statement from Trumps national security adviser, Michael Flynn, marked some of the most aggressive rhetoric by the administration that took office on Jan. 20, making clear that Obamas less confrontational approach toward Iran was over. Flynn said that instead of being thankful to the United States for the nuclear deal, Iran is now feeling emboldened. As of today, we are officially putting Iran on notice, he told reporters in his first appearance in the White House press briefing room. He said the launch and an attack on Monday against a Saudi naval vessel by Iran-allied Houthi militants off the coast of Yemen underscored Irans destabilizing behavior across the Middle East.  Iran confirmed it had tested a new missile but said it did not breach a nuclear accord reached with world powers or a U.N. Security Council resolution that endorsed the pact. Analysts said Iran could interpret Flynns warning as bluster given that the Trump administration is still formulating a response. Its a vague way of drawing a line in the sand, said Mark Fitzpatrick, executive director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies-Americas. Taken literally, it could mean: You do this one more time and youll pay for it. But how would the U.S. respond? The warning could foreshadow more aggressive economic and diplomatic measures against Iran. Three senior U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a range of options, including economic sanctions, was being considered and that a broad review was being conducted of the U.S. posture toward Iran. One official said the intent of Flynns message was to make clear the administration would not be shy or reticent toward Tehran. We are in the process of evaluating the strategic options and the framework for how we want to approach these issues, the official said. We do not want to be premature or rash or take any action that would foreclose options or unnecessarily contribute to a negative response. Our sincere hope is that the Iranians will heed this notice today and will change their behavior, he said. Iran has test-fired several ballistic missiles since the nuclear deal in 2015, but the latest test was the first since Trump became president.  The issue came to the forefront on the same day that the U.S. Senate confirmed former Exxon Mobil Corp Chief Executive Rex Tillerson as secretary of state. Trump told Tillerson at his swearing-in ceremony that although you inherit enormous challenges in the Middle East and around the world, I believe we can achieve peace and security in these very, very troubled times.  Simon Henderson, a Gulf expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said there was a danger of a miscalculation by Washington or Tehran. The question now is will the Iranian logic be: My goodness, this guy is serious, wed better behave ourselves? he said. Or do they say: Why dont we tweak him a bit more to see what he really means, maybe test him. The administrations tough statement came midway through a three-day exercise by 18 U.S., French, British and Australian warships and an undisclosed number of aircraft close to Iranian waters in the Gulf, according to a statement by U.S. Central Command.     Trump is due to hold talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a strident critic of the Iran nuclear deal, at the White House on February 15. The U.S. president and Saudi Arabias ruler, King Salman, spoke by phone on Sunday and were described by the White House as agreeing on the importance of enforcing the deal and addressing Irans destabilizing regional activities. Sunni Muslim-dominated Saudi Arabia, home to Mecca and other Islamic holy sites, and Shiite Muslim-majority Iran are regional rivals. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Another idea is to offer to increase liquid natural gas (LNG) imports from the United States, a source in the ruling coalition told Reuters. Another option, if Abe determines that Trump is most concerned about the trade gap, is to increase imports of U.S. shale oil or gas on top of the investment package, according to a top executive at a major Japanese corporation who is close to Abe. Japanese officials have been scrambling to respond to Trumps scattershot comments since he took office.  He has threatened to impose a tax on car imports from Mexico, criticized Japans trade gap with the United States and most recently accused Japan, along with China and Germany, of devaluing their currencies to the detriment of U.S. companies. (Abe) wants to know whats the most important thing for Trump, said the executive, who declined to be identified. If it is the trade surplus that Trump cares the most about, for instance, then we could come up with a few possible solutions, including importing more U.S. shale oil or gas.  Abes approach toward Trump would be not accommodating, not opposing, he said. Utilities would be resistant to buying more U.S. shale gas because they have already committed to buying large amounts and Japans demand for energy is falling, an executive at a Japanese gas importer told Reuters on condition of anonymity.  Prices for LNG in Asia LNG-AS have fallen by almost a fifth this year amid a supply glut. Japan is the worlds biggest buyer of the gas cooled to liquid form for transport on ships and takes in nearly a third of global shipments. Once seen as a panacea for Japans energy crisis after the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011 led to the shutdown of most reactors in the country, U.S. shale gas is now just one of many options for Japan to meet its needs. Japan took in its first shipment of shale gas in liquid form this month and more shipments are likely to come as more export terminals start shipments this year and next.

The relationship between the United States and Mexico has become strained after U.S. President Donald Trump vowed to build a wall between the two countries to keep out illegal immigrants, drug dealers and criminals and make Mexico pay for it. Lori Robinson, chief of the U.S. Northern Command, and Kurt Tidd, head of the Southern U.S. Command, attended the talks, two people familiar with the matter said. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity so they could discuss the meeting. It was one of the first known meetings between U.S. and Mexican officials since Trump became president in January, after threatening to upend years of cooperation between the two neighbors with divisive rhetoric on trade and security. One of the sources said the talks focused on Mexicos commitment to securing its southern border to keep out criminals and illegal immigrants. The source said that U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Roberta Jacobson also attended. Mexicos Foreign Ministry said Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray was not present.

Mexicos presidential spokesman, Eduardo Sanchez, was not immediately able to comment on CNNs report but said it sounded more logical.

Tuesdays ruling by U.S. District Judge Andre Birotte Jr follows decisions by federal judges in at least four other states that also limited the executive order Trump issued on Friday.  But it goes further, by focusing on a large group of people from the seven nations of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen - the countries targeted in the executive order - who are outside the United States and trying to enter.  In the temporary ruling, Birotte ordered U.S. officials to refrain from removing, detaining or blocking the entry of plaintiffs or any other person ... with a valid immigrant visa who is arriving from one of the seven nations.   According to the U.S. Department of State, immigrant visas are the first step to becoming a lawful permanent resident, or a green card holder. Birottes ruling does not apply to tourists, students or business travelers with non-immigrant visas.

A spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security cited its policy of not commenting on pending litigation.

More than 200 people with immigrant visas who left Yemen and are related to U.S. citizens or legal residents are stranded in Djibouti across the Bab el-Mandeb Strait from Yemen and were barred from flying to the United States, Goldberg said by telephone from Djibouti. Its terrible because I have children here who are without their parents, she said.  Some other children in the group are U.S. citizens whose parents were traveling with immigrant visas, she added. In Boston, U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs on Sunday issued a ruling, to last seven days, that barred the detention and removal of approved refugees, visa holders and permanent U.S. residents who entered from the seven countries. By early Thursday in Djibouti, Goldberg said, no one from the group she represented was being allowed to leave for the United States. She accused the Trump administration of absolutely ignoring rulings she believes should allow their departure. In an email, a State Department official confirmed the agency had provisionally revoked relevant visas as defined under Trumps executive order.  The White House said on Wednesday it has issued updated guidance on the order clarifying that green card holders require no waiver to enter the United States.

Local medics said 30 people including 10 women and children were killed in the helicopter-born Navy SEAL attack on a cluster of houses in Yemens southern al-Bayda province. Al Qaeda said in a statement that a senior leader and an unspecified number of other militants were killed.

The raid ... is a good example of what not to do, ICGs senior Arabian Pensinsula analyst April Alley wrote. The use of U.S. troops and the high number of civilian casualties ... are deeply inflammatory and breed anti-American resentment across the Yemeni political spectrum that works to the advantage of AQAP, she added. Nearly two years of civil war in the impoverished Arabian Peninsula country has allowed local branches of al Qaeda and Islamic State to expand and carry out new attacks within Yemen. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) is one of the global militant groups most active branches. It unsuccessfully plotted to blow up U.S.-bound airliners and claimed responsibility for a 2015 shooting at the satirical Charlie Hebdo magazine in Paris. Former President Barack Obama repeatedly killed top leaders in the organization with unmanned drone attacks but, ICG said, that strategy may not ultimately defeat it.

They regard Kushner, whose familys charitable foundation has donated tens of thousands of dollars to their settlement, as part of a diplomatic rebalancing after what they view as eight years of anti-Israel bias under the U.S. administration of Barack Obama. He will stand up for our interests. I suppose he will lean in our favor, said Avi Lavi, 46, who has lived in Bet El for more than 40 years. Hell be fair, as opposed to Obama, whose policy leaned always towards the Arabs. New U.S. President Trump says his son-in-law Kushner, 36, is capable of brokering the ultimate deal to deliver peace between Israelis and Palestinians.     Roi Margalit, manager of the Bet El Yeshiva, a seminary complex with around 400 students, said Kushner, an Orthodox Jewish father of three, understood the position of Israeli settlers better than previous envoys. At least now we have someone who knows us, the 43-year-old added. He will now have to study the other side (the Palestinians) and see if there is any common ground.      Trumps pick for Israeli ambassador has sparked particular enthusiasm in the community: David Friedman, who chairs the American Friends of Bet El Institutions fundraising group. The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Kushner and Friedman. Kushner, a businessman who built his career on real estate and publishing, has said little about his views about one of the worlds most intractable conflicts, either during the campaign or since Trump took office. The big question for the Palestinians is whether he can be an impartial actor given his family foundations past financial ties to Bet El.  Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has been careful to say he looks forward to working with the Trump administration, but others are less optimistic. Wasel Abu Youssef, a senior official at the Palestine Liberation Organisation, the main Palestinian political umbrella body, said Kushner could not be a neutral envoy if he was supportive of Israeli settlements. Hani al-Masri, a political scientist and director of the Palestinian Center for Policy Research and Strategic Studies, said Kushner would be a representative of Israel rather than of the United States. If he attempts to resume negotiations, he will seek to hold them at a lower level than previous negotiations. It will be more biased to the Israeli position in an era where Israel is more extreme.  Palestinians want the West Bank and Gaza Strip for an independent state, with its capital in East Jerusalem.  Israel has built about 120 settlements in the West Bank. About 350,000 settlers live there and a further 200,000 in East Jerusalem, among about 2.6 million Palestinians.     Most countries consider the settlements illegal and an obstacle to peace as they reduce and fragment the territory Palestinians need for a viable state.  Israel disagrees, citing biblical, historical and political connections to the land and security interests. Bet El, a community of 1,300 families perched on a hillside where many believe God promised Jacob the land, has been financed in part by donations from American backers. Among its donors have been the Donald J. Trump Foundation, which gave $10,000 in 2003, and the foundation of Charles and Seryl Kushner, the parents of Jared, which gave $38,000 in 2013, U.S. tax records show. The New York-based American Friends of Bet El Institutions hosts dinners to raise funds for the settlement, which overlooks the Palestinian city Ramallah. Kushner has left it up to his father-in-law to comment on what role he might play. Jared is such a good kid and hell make a deal with Israel that no one else can, Trump told The Times of London newspaper last month. Hes a natural dealmaker - everyone likes him. Middle East analysts say the settlement donations by Kushners family foundation are not necessarily deal-breakers.  After decades of failed negotiations, the real test is whether he is prepared to rethink the way the Middle East peace process is conducted, said Hugh Lovatt, a fellow of the European Council on Foreign Relations. If he reverts to pushing for a process for the sake of process and diplomatic prestige, then he will prove no more successful than his predecessors, Lovatt told Reuters.  If he acquiesces to Israeli territorial demands and gives a green light to more settlement activity, he could even do irreparable damage to the prospects of long-term peace. A key diplomatic factor will be whether the Trump administration commits itself to a two-state solution - Israel and an independent Palestinian state living side-by-side. This remains firmly the goal for the Palestinians and, according to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israelis. But some of Kushners supporters in Bet El appear to be heading in a different direction - and the political voice of hardliners could prove a significant obstacle should peace talks resume. The two-state solution is a scam, said Shai Alon, the head of the local council, who describes himself as optimistic about the Trump era.  Its not going to happen.

Hours after the Senate confirmed Tillerson as the 69th secretary of state by a 56-43 vote, the former Exxon Mobil Corp CEO was sworn in as the chief foreign affairs adviser to President Donald Trump. The Senate vote was largely along party lines, with all 52 Republicans voting in favor, along with three Democrats and one independent. Tillerson takes up his post at the State Department on Thursday morning when he will address staff. Under any circumstance, Tillerson would have inherited a messy globe with a civil war in Syria, nuclear-armed North Korea threatening to test an intercontinental ballistic missile and challenges from a rising China and an assertive Russia. In the 12 days since Trumps inauguration, however, the White House has taken steps that foreign policy professionals view as self-inflicted wounds. Weve done a series of own goals, said a senior U.S. official on condition of anonymity. There are always mess-ups and friction with new administrations. Thats not new. This is worse than usual. On Thursday, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto took the rare step of cancelling a Washington trip to meet Trump, who has repeatedly demanded Mexico pay for a wall on the U.S. border. On Friday, Trump signed an executive order imposing a four-month hold on refugees entering the United States and a temporary bar on most travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The order has not only caused consternation for the nations involved but among other Muslim-majority countries, allies such as Germany and Britain and career State Department officials. About 900 department officials signed a memo dissenting from the policy, a source familiar with the document said, an unusual rebellion against a new presidents policies. As reports of the internal dissent spread on Monday, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said career officials who disagreed should get with the program or they can go. The result has been that two constituencies Tillerson has to manage - foreign nations and the U.S. diplomatic corps - have  already got their noses out of joint before his swearing-in. He will start at a disadvantage and will have to play catch-up to build trust with his foreign counterparts and with State Department employees, said John Bellinger, a State Department legal adviser under Republican President George W. Bush. Tillerson walks into a situation where he has got an unhappy and suspicious White House and he has an unhappy and suspicious workforce, said another former State Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. It would have been difficult enough given the chaos. Several current and former U.S. officials said they were dismayed by the process that led to the executive order, with little evidence that there was broad consultation within the government, let alone with Congress or foreign allies. The secretary of homeland security, John Kelly, was reported to have been largely blindsided by the order. According to the New York Times, he was on a White House conference call getting his first full briefing on it when Trump signed the order. Loren DeJonge Schulman, a former national security council and Pentagon official, said the belief that Trump did not bring his top advisers into the discussion of the matter would itself handicap the new secretary of state. The secretary of states power and his influence primarily derive from the idea that he speaks for the president, said Schulman, now at the Center for a New American Security think tank in Washington, saying it was an open secret the White House may not be consulting cabinet officials on such matters. The fact that foreign audiences will realize that on day one is going to definitely weaken his hand, she said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Trumps chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and top strategist Steve Bannon told Scaramucci that he would not get the job as liaison to the business community, the New York Times reported, citing a senior administration official. Scaramucci may get another role in the future, the NYT said, adding Scaramuccis withdrawal has yet to be declared officially. The White House, Scaramucci and SkyBridge Capital, the hedge fund he founded, were not immediately available for comment. In January, Scaramucci said he would join Trumps White House staff as an adviser and public liaison to government agencies and businesses, swapping his role as one of Wall Streets splashiest showmen for a much bigger, more prestigious platform. The Mooch, as he is referred to in New York financial circles, promoted Trumps agenda at last months meeting of business and political elites in Davos, where he was billed as an adviser to the then president-elect. But his role had yet to be confirmed.    The New York Times said the reason behind Scaramuccis withdrawal was the sale of his firm, SkyBridge Capital, to a group that included a division of HNA Group, a Chinese aviation and tourism conglomerate that announced $21 billion in overseas acquisitions last year. Scaramucci had to sell his stake in the firm to assume a role in the White House but the deal had not been completed, and administration officials told the New York Times that the White House Counsels Office had predicted that it would take up to three months for Scaramucci to be cleared of potential ethics conflicts. To avoid conflicts of interest, Scaramucci had agreed to recuse himself from anything to do with SkyBridge and HNA. Trumps son-in-law, Jared Kushner, this week divested his equity interest in a flagship New York City building that is the subject of negotiations with Chinese insurer Anbang about a possible investment. Trump has tapped Kushner as his senior adviser on the Middle East.  Concern about Chinese acquisitions of U.S. assets has been growing in the United States with a number of deals blocked or derailed by increased scrutiny under the previous administration of President Barack Obama. Trump, meanwhile, has threatened to impose punitive tariffs on Chinese imports, accusing the country of keeping its currency artificially low to give it an advantage in trade deals. Scaramucci switched his loyalties to Trump after initially supporting other Republican candidates in the race to be president. Once on side, Scaramucci became a dedicated supporter, talking up Trumps policies and defending him from criticism on television and Twitter. A former Goldman Sachs banker with a down-to-earth charm - he likes to describe himself as a five foot eight Italian kid from Long Island - Scaramucci has thrived on his salesman skills. At Skybridge, he excelled at getting wealthy clients into the hottest funds as they clamored for the services of prominent managers such as John Paulson. He also launched a hedge-fund conference in Las Vegas, known as SALT, during the 2008 recession that has become a staple on Wall Streets calendar of events. The conference is being spun off as a separate entity. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The boycott in the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee delayed the transition to a new administrator for the agency. Senator Ben Cardin, a Democrat, said he could not support Pruitt, a Republican and the attorney general of Oklahoma, for a public health position because he denies the sum of empirical science and the urgency to act on climate change. At a committee confirmation hearing last month Pruitt, who has sued the agency he intends to run more than a dozen times on behalf of the oil-drilling state Oklahoma, expressed doubt about climate change science. But Pruitt said he would be would be obliged for now to uphold the agencys 2009 endangerment finding that carbon dioxide emissions harm public health. The finding is the agencys basis for regulations on those emissions.  Senator Tom Carper, the panels top Democrat, said Pruitt had provided woefully inadequate answers to written questions and had not named one agency regulation that he supported. If Mr. Pruitt is serious about leading this important agency, he should be more than willing to provide straightforward answers to our fundamental questions, Carper said. Republicans decried the move by the Democrats. This is simply a senatorial temper tantrum, said Senator Dan Sullivan of Alaska, another oil state. Trump, like Republican Senator Jim Inhofe on the panel, has called climate change a hoax. Trump has promised to make changes at the agency including doing away with previous President Barack Obamas Clean Power Plan that cracks down on emissions from coal-fired electricity generators. The plan was suspended by the Supreme Court last year. John Konkus, a spokesman for Pruitts confirmation team, said Democrats and the EPA under Obama had put politics and rhetoric ahead of their core work and ahead of the welfare of the American public. In 2013, Republican senators on the panel boycotted then- Obamas second term pick for the agency, Gina McCarthy, saying they were completely unsatisfied by her answers to more than 1,000 written questions they had asked her.

Travis County includes the Texas capital Austin, which is a so-called sanctuary city.  Abbott spokeswoman Ciara Matthews said the money that would be withheld from Travis County is a series of one-time criminal justice grants totaling $1.8 million. About $300,000 of that has already been spent, but she said the governor would not try to claw back that money.  Sanctuary cities in general offer safe harbor to illegal immigrants and often do not use municipal funds or resources to advance the enforcement of federal immigration laws. Sanctuary city is not an official designation. In January, newly elected Sheriff Sally Hernandez said in a statement on the Sheriffs Office website that she was following all state and federal laws, and upholding constitutional rights to due process for all in our criminal justice system. Our community is safer when people can report crimes without fear of deportation.  In a Jan. 20 memo seen by Reuters, her office said it would make an exception for people charged with serious crimes like murder, aggravated sexual assault, or human smuggling.  Hernandez was not available to comment on Wednesday. Travis County Judge Sarah Eckhardt, who manages the countys budget, said on Wednesday that Hernandezs directive does not violate state or federal law.  Any of the 254 sheriffs across the state of Texas has discretion to decide whether or not to put their resources toward assisting federal immigration enforcement, she said in a press conference that was webcast.  I will do everything I can to protect revenue sources. I believe it is foolhardy for the state to starve itself by starving its own programs, she said.  In a letter to Hernandez in January, Abbott said her position was not a pronouncement of sound public policy; it is a dangerous game of political Russian roulette  with the lives of Texans at stake. Abbott has voiced strong support for proposed legislation in Texas that would penalize sanctuary cities.  On Tuesday, San Francisco, another sanctuary city, filed a lawsuit challenging a Jan. 25 executive order by President Donald Trump directing the U.S. government to withhold money from cities that have adopted sanctuary policies toward illegal immigrants. The lawsuit marked the first court challenge over the sanctuary order.  New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Boston, Denver, Washington and Seattle, in addition to San Francisco, offer forms of protection to illegal immigrants, and billions of dollars in federal aid to those cities could be at risk.

In a letter addressed to Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, the American Medical Association warned that the order created barriers to healthcare by preventing international physicians from getting back into the country or obtaining visas. It also wrote that the order should not apply to patients who need timely medical care in the United States.  The AMA is concerned that this executive order is negatively impacting patient access to care and creating unintended consequences for our nations health care system, the group said in a letter posted on its web site. It is vitally important that this process not impact patient access to timely medical treatment. Last Friday, Trump put a four-month hold on allowing refugees into the United States and temporarily barred travelers from Syria and six other Muslim-majority countries, saying the moves would help protect Americans from terrorist attacks. Reuters reported earlier this week that Trumps order wreaked panic and uncertainty among refugees in the U.S. pipeline with urgent medical needs, some of whom had prioritized applications. The order could mean as many as 800 people needing medical entry will be denied entry, said Karen Monken of HIAS, a Maryland-based refugee assistance organization formerly known as the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As a lawyer in private practice for a decade, President Donald Trumps U.S. Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch often fought on behalf of business interests, including efforts to curb securities class action lawsuits, experience that could mould his thinking if he is confirmed as a justice. Gorsuch, a conservative federal appeals court judge from Colorado nominated by wealthy businessman Trump on Tuesday, could turn out to be a friend to business, having represented the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in fending off securities class actions, one of the most hotly contested areas of corporate law. The chamber is the largest U.S. business lobbying group. If confirmed, Gorsuch would be one of the only current justices with extensive experience on business issues in private practice.  Securities class action lawsuits are filed by investors who allege misconduct by a company whose stock price has tanked, hurting investors portfolios. These once-common lawsuits now face higher hurdles and are filed less often. Congress passed laws in 1995 and 1998 making it harder to bring securities class actions. Later court rulings, including one in which Gorsuch was involved, clarified the requirements under the laws. From 1995 to 2005, Gorsuch worked at boutique law firm Kellogg, Huber, Hansen, Todd, Evans & Figel in Washington, becoming a partner in 1998. He had a wide range of clients, including individuals and nonprofits, as well as various business interests. While there, he filed two briefs on behalf of the Chamber of Commerce seeking limits to securities class actions. One of Gorsuchs briefs came in a securities fraud case called Dura Pharmaceuticals v. Broudo. The Supreme Court in 2005 ruled unanimously for the company, but did not issue the kind of broad ruling Gorsuch had sought, said Patrick Coughlin, the lawyer who argued the case on behalf of the investors who sued. Of Gorsuchs role, Coughlin said representing the Chamber of Commerce is the epitome of corporate defense work for a lawyer. The chamber had always been against us, Coughlin said, referring to class action lawyers. Hed always been on the other side of what we were doing, so it was not surprising he was selected by Trump. Prior to the ruling, Gorsuch co-wrote an article in the Legal Times trade publication for lawyers in which he described some securities class actions as a free ride to fast riches for plaintiffs lawyers. He said the Dura case was a chance for the court to curb frivolous fraud claims in which plaintiffs cannot prove a stock price drop was caused by misrepresentations by a company. Gorsuchs background promises to be valuable on the Supreme Court, which hears a significant number of business disputes among the roughly 70 cases considered each annual term.  Businesses have been trying with mixed success to get the Supreme Court to put new curbs on class action litigation beyond the securities context. Class actions can lead to huge jury awards against companies and is harder to defend against than lawsuits brought by individuals. If confirmed by the U.S. Senate in time, Gorsuch could play an immediate role in a major case on whether companies can head off costly class action lawsuits by forcing employees to give up their right to pursue work-related legal claims in court as a group. Paul Bland, executive director of consumer advocacy group Public Justice, said he hoped Gorsuch, if confirmed, would see that most of what he saw as meritless cases in 2005 have been weeded out, and that the vast majority of the cases that remain raise substantial issues that protect investors. Chamber of Commerce official Tom Collamore joined Trump at the White House on Wednesday for a meeting with advocacy groups touting Gorsuchs pick, calling it a fantastic nomination. The chamber declined comment on Gorsuchs work for the group. In a statement issued after the nomination was announced, chamber President Tom Donohue congratulated Trump on the selection. When Democratic President Barack Obama last March nominated appeals court judge Merrick Garland to fill the same vacant seat on the court, there was no press release from the chamber. Senate Republicans refused to act on Garlands nomination, a move that paved the way for Trump to nominate Gorsuch to replace fellow conservative Antonin Scalia, who died in February 2016. Describing his career in private practice, Gorsuch said in his Senate questionnaire prior to his appointment by Republican President George W. Bush to the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2006 that he was involved in matters large and small for clients ranging from individuals to nonprofits to corporations, on such issues as racketeering, securities fraud and antitrust.  His former Washington law firm stressed in a statement that Gorsuch had a wide variety of clients and cited a case in which he represented people who had been targeted over payday loans. David Frederick, a lawyer at the firm, called Gorsuch a dogged, very determined lawyer. Hes the kind of lawyer you would want to have representing you, Frederick said. After leaving the firm, but before becoming a judge, he spent just over a year in Bushs Justice Department. One of his roles was overseeing antitrust litigation involving the government.

The role got a higher profile on Monday night when the Republican president promptly fired acting Attorney General Sally Yates for refusing to enforce his executive order temporarily banning all refugees and travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States. Yates was a holdover from the Obama administration. Sessions, a 70-year-old senator from Alabama and a close Trump ally since the early days of his presidential campaign, was likely to support the executive order. One of his former staffers, Stephen Miller, helped shape the document from the White House. Sessions allegiance to Trump, his hard-line immigration positions and civil rights record came under scrutiny during his 10-1/2-hour hearing before the committee on Jan. 10.  Trumps Justice Department is likely to operate in sharp contrast to the agency under Obama. Civil rights groups say the choices Trump has made in his appointments to leadership roles at the department show that the agency is preparing to neglect or even weaken civil rights protections. Hours after Trumps inauguration, the administration appointed Thomas Wheeler and John Gore to serve as interim leaders in the departments Civil Rights Division. Wheeler, the current acting head of the division, defended in private practice a school that confiscated a students breast cancer awareness bracelet for being inappropriate; a public school that held a Christmas show in which Bible excerpts were read and religious songs were sung; and the Walgreens drugstore chain in a case in which a pharmacist looked up the birth control records of a customer and shared them with the customers ex-boyfriend.

They (the Democrats) had tons of information (about Price and Mnuchin), Hatch said. Its another way of roughing up the president and his choice of nominees. But Democrats have come under pressure from liberal activists who want them to counter Trump at every turn, especially after his order last week blocking immigration from seven majority-Muslim countries. It sparked a wave of protests in major U.S. cities.  One group that has been running television ads against Mnuchin blasted Republicans for the vote.  Steven Mnuchin is such an illegitimate, compromised nominee that Republicans had to change the rules to force through his nomination, said Kait Sweeney, press secretary of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee.

Public refusals by two U.S. Senate Republicans to support Betsy DeVos, Trumps pick for education secretary, raise the possibility of a rare congressional rejection of a Cabinet nominee. The Senate confirms Rex Tillerson as secretary of state despite concerns over his ties to Russia, while committees approve Jeff Sessions, one of Trumps most controversial Cabinet selections, as attorney general, as well as two other nominees. Evangelical Christian leader Jerry Falwell Jr. will head an education reform task force under Trump and is eager to cut university regulations, including rules on dealing with campus sexual assault. The White House puts Iran on notice for test-firing a ballistic missile and says it is reviewing how to respond, abruptly adopting an aggressive posture toward Tehran that could raise tensions in the region. Defense Secretary James Mattis is expected to underscore security commitments to South Korea and Japan on his debut trip to Asia this week as concerns mount over North Koreas missile program and tensions with China. Tillerson sees his job become harder before it even begins because of administration moves that have antagonized Muslim nations, European allies, Mexico and U.S. bureaucrats. The Trump administration wants to revamp and rename a U.S. government program designed to counter all violent ideologies so that it focuses solely on Islamist extremism, five people briefed on the matter tell Reuters. Trump pays his respects to a U.S. Navy SEAL who died in a raid on al Qaeda in Yemen that went wrong, the first military operation authorized by Trump as commander in chief. Trump will likely face questions about his executive order restricting some travel to the United States when he meets with the CEOs of major U.S. companies at the White House on Friday. U.N. human rights experts warn that asylum seekers could face torture if not given haven and the Vatican calls for  openness to other cultures, adding to a drumbeat of criticism of Trumps travel curbs.

U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra in West Palm Beach said Trump National Golf Club Jupiter must repay $4.849 million plus $925,010 of interest to 65 former members for breach of contract, following a non-jury trial last August. Marra said the club had no right to keep the deposits after locking out members who had declared their plans to resign prior to Trumps purchase in November 2012. Before Trump took over, the club had permitted members who wanted to resign to keep playing golf until their replacements were found. But Trump changed the rules, declaring in a letter that as the owner of the club he did not want such members to use the club, and telling them youre out. Marra, however, said this deprived the plaintiffs of their continuing right to use the club until new members joined. By categorically denying class members all rights to club access because they remained on the resignation waiting list as of December 31, 2012, defendant revoked or canceled their memberships, and should have refunded their deposits, he said. The Trump Organization said in a statement that it disagreed with the decision and will appeal. At the time Trump purchased the club, it was suffering financially, making it unlikely that these members would ever get back their deposits, it added. Brad Edwards, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in an interview that our clients are thrilled that they are getting exactly what they deserve. He added: I think President Trump is going to respect this judgment. In a footnote, Marra noted that Trump was a private citizen at all times relevant to the lawsuit, and that he would refer to Trump as such in the decision. In doing so, the court means no disrespect to him or to the esteemed position he now holds, wrote Marra, an appointee of former President George W. Bush. The case is Hirsch et al v.

Trump rehashed his grievances over a report that erroneously said a bust of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. had been removed from the White House Oval Office - a mistake that was quickly corrected but caused a stir on social media. It was never even touched. So I think it was a disgrace, but thats the way the press is, Trump said, calling the report fake news. Trump returned to the theme a couple of times during the portion of the event that was open to media. He slammed CNN, also calling it fake news, but praised Fox News, and took one more whack as reporters were led out of the Roosevelt Room. A lot of the media is actually the opposition party. Theyre so biased. Its a disgrace, he said. Trump has said he has a running war with the media, blaming it for underestimating his chances during the presidential campaign and accusing it of favoring his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. He has kept up the attacks since his Jan. 20 inauguration. The listening session at the White House was attended by African-American supporters of Trump and other officials to celebrate the start of Black History Month and discuss issues affecting the black community. Trump pledged during his campaign to improve the lives of black residents of inner cities and crack down on crime and violence in urban areas, especially in Chicago, where murders have spiked. Last month, Trump threatened to send in the Feds if Chicago did not get its murder rate under control. One of the attendees, Cleveland-based pastor Darrell Scott, said Trump would take a proactive approach to dealing with violence in Chicago that did not simply involve locking people up. Were not just going to send in Feds and start arresting black people, Scott told reporters. Scott told Trump that some gang members from Chicago had reached out to him about having a meeting to reduce the violence, which Trump said he encouraged. If theyre not going to solve the problem  and what youre doing is the right thing  then were going to solve the problem for them, Trump told Scott while reporters were still in the room. Because were going to have to do something about Chicago. Pastor Corey Brooks from New Beginnings Church of Chicago, who did not attend the session, said in a phone interview he had spoken with a White House official about a possible meeting with the gang leaders but that details were unclear.  Other religious leaders in Chicago were skeptical about such a meeting, saying the citys splintered gangs no longer had clear leaders. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The Senate is expected to take up repealing the rules, both of which were years in the making, as soon as Thursday. Under the virtually untested Congressional Review Act, the Republican-led Congress can vote to permanently undo newly minted regulations. Agencies cannot revisit overturned regulations and timing in the law means any regulation enacted in the Obama administrations final months are eligible for axing. Required by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law, the Securities and Exchange Commissions extraction rule was approved this summer to require companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp to publicly state the taxes and other fees they pay to governments.  Exxon, and other major energy corporations, fought for years to keep the rule from seeing the light of day. After a series of legal battles the SEC in June 2016 finally completed the rule, which supporters say can help expose questionable financial ties U.S. companies may have with foreign governments. During Wednesdays debate, Representative Maxine Waters, the senior Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, raised concerns that Exxons CEO during those fights was Rex Tillerson, just confirmed in the top diplomatic post of Secretary of State. During Tillersons confirmation hearings, he raised Democrats hackles by saying he did not know Exxon lobbied against U.S. sanctions on Russia, where he did business for years. Republicans say the rule is burdensome and costly for energy companies, and also duplicates other long-standing regulations. On the House floor Republican Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the Financial Services Committee, called the rule part of a radical leftist elitist agenda against carbon-based jobs. The stream buffer rule is intended to lessen the amount of waste from mountain-top removal coal mining deposited in local waterways.  Republican lawmakers, though, say it is hurting coal jobs by placing unworkable limits on the industry. Democrats, on the other hand, say it cuts down on water pollution. Republicans consider loosening regulation as high a priority as dismantling the Affordable Care Act and rewriting the tax code, according to Kevin McCarthy, the second most powerful Republican in the House. On Thursday, the House will vote on repealing three other rules - on methane on public lands, expanding background checks for some gun purchases, and requiring federal contractors to post information on their workers. In recent weeks, the House has also passed bills to slow down regulatory processes and President Donald Trump, a fellow Republican, has issued executive orders trying to shrink the government bureaucracy.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Public refusals on Wednesday by two U.S. Senate Republicans to support Betsy DeVos, President Donald Trumps pick for education secretary, raised the possibility of a rare congressional rejection of a Cabinet nominee. In an ominous sign for Trump, Republican senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski said they would not vote for DeVos, a billionaire philanthropist and charter-school advocate.  They would be the first Republicans to break party ranks and vote against one of Trumps cabinet selections. Democrats, uniformly opposed to DeVos, are expected to oppose her as a block. They would only need for three Republicans to side with them to make DeVos just the 10th cabinet nominee in U.S. history to be rejected by Congress. Collins and Murkowski also created a possible speed bump in confirming another Trump nominee, that of Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions for Attorney General.  Once Sessions, who was approved by Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, becomes the countrys top law enforcement officer, he will have to vacate his seat and can no longer cast a vote supporting DeVos. With voting margins so thin, his departure would put her nomination in peril. Soon after Collins and Murkowski staked out their opposition to DeVos, the White House said it is confident that she will ultimately be approved.  Senator John Cornyn, responsible for tallying Republican votes in the chamber, was also confident DeVos would be confirmed. Nonetheless, DeVos opponents kicked into high gear on Wednesday to press other Republican Senators to vote no when the chamber begins considering the nomination, expected on Friday at the earliest. I cannot support this nominee, Murkowski said in a floor speech saying she needed to make her intentions clear to her colleagues. DeVos nomination barely squeaked through a Senate committee vote on Tuesday, with both Collins and Murkowski saying they voted yes only so the entire Senate could debate the matter. Trumps early nominations, primarily for security posts, had an easier time on Capitol Hill than names now before the Senate. Republicans hold majorities in both the Senate and House of Representatives, but Democrats have been on a blitz to try to block the nominations, often raising concerns about conflicts of interest. On Wednesday, the Senate Finance Committee had to suspend its rules to advance Treasury Secretary nominee Steve Mnuchin and Health Secretary nominee Tom Price to the full chamber for approval, the final step in the confirmation process.  Committee Democrats on Tuesday had boycotted the vote, forcing Republicans to scrap a requirement that at least one Democrat be present for a vote. Confirmation hearings for Labor Secretary nominee Andy Puzder have been indefinitely delayed over ethics filings. Meanwhile, the Senate confirmed Rex Tillerson as secretary of state on Wednesday, filling a key national security spot despite concerns about the former Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) chief executive officers ties to Russia.  Education Secretary nominees are rarely the focus of congressional debate or political protests. DeVos, though, has faced unusually fierce opposition since her confirmation hearing, where she appeared unfamiliar with education laws and public school issues.  Old-guard Republicans including Former first ladies Barbara Bush and Laura Bush have defended her as a lifelong champion of low-income students and literacy.

Companies whose chief executives are expected to attend the meeting of the presidents business advisory panel include JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), General Motors Co (GM.N), Blackstone Group LP (BX.N), IBM Corp (IBM.N), Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), two officials briefed on the meeting said on Wednesday. Activists are already pressuring the CEOs to raise concerns about the travel restrictions at the meeting, which comes at the end of another turbulent week for the Trump administration. Trumps order last Friday, barring travel into the United States by people from seven Muslim-majority countries, touched off public protests and stirred unease among employees at many big U.S. companies. CEOs have been faced with difficult choices to either criticize Trumps move at a time when they are trying to win White House support on tax and trade policies, or remain silent and take heat from consumers and employees dismayed by the order. The Trump administration says the travel ban is aimed at strengthening national security. Backlash over the measure knocked the wind out of the post-inaugural stock market rally, although major indexes rebounded on Wednesday.  Trumps executive order put a 120-day halt on the U.S. refugee program, barred Syrian refugees indefinitely and imposed a 90-day suspension on people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Along with protests it has prompted legal challenges in the United States and drawn criticism from several leading U.S. companies. Among those critics, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick wrote in an email to employees Saturday that the ban will impact many innocent people  an issue that I will raise this coming Friday when I go to Washington for President Trumps first business advisory group meeting. Trump will kick off the two-hour meeting with an address lasting 10-15 minutes and will be followed by Stephen Schwarzman, the billionaire founder of private equity group Blackstone (BX.N), who chairs the panel and assembled it at  Trumps request. Four topics will be discussed   regulatory relief, women in the work force, tax and trade, and infrastructure  with two to three people talking briefly about each subject to help shape  how the administration should be thinking, according to a person familiar with the matter. Investors said the CEOs would be mindful of Trumps penchant for rebuking companies publicly.  Given recent history, being called out publicly is something that the CEOs in that room and other CEOs will absolutely be mindful to avoid, said Jim Russell, vice president at Bahl & Gaynor Inc, which oversees $17 billion and owns shares in several of the companies attending Fridays meeting. Im sure they will pick their fights carefully and articulate them carefully. It was not clear if all 19 members of the Presidents Strategic and Policy Forum would attend Fridays meeting. Other members include the CEOs of Tesla Inc (TSLA.O), Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Boeing Co (BA.N). Tesla founder Elon Musk said this week that the travel order should be modified and he would seek a consensus among members of the advisory council. Ford Motor Co (F.N) Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. and CEO Mark Fields have also criticized the travel measure. GM has declined to take a position. On Wednesday, a group of religious investors, human rights groups other activists urged members of the business advisory panel to speak out against the travel restrictions at the meeting with Trump. In a joint letter to the corporate leaders, the group said Trumps order undermines respect for human rights and the lives of workers and their families in the U.S. and beyond, and disrupts economic activity  and company operations.  The letter was signed by dozens of people, including representatives of firms focused on socially-responsible investing like Calvert Research and Management and Domini Impact Investments. Others included representatives of the International Corporate Accountability Roundtable, the Institute for Human Rights and Business and the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility. Companies that have been most critical of Trumps immigration orders include Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O), and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), none of which form part of the business advisory panel.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran said on Wednesday it had test-fired a new ballistic missile, prompting a tough response from a senior adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump. Irans defense minister said the test did not breach the Islamic Republics nuclear agreement with world powers or a U.N. Security Council resolution endorsing the pact, Iran has test-fired several ballistic missiles since the nuclear deal in 2015, but the latest test was the first since Trump entered the White House. Trump said during his election campaign that he would stop Irans missile program. The recent test was in line with our plans and we will not allow foreigners to interfere in our defense affairs, Defence Minister Hossein Dehghan told Tasnim news agency. The test did not violate the nuclear deal or (U.N.) Resolution 2231. Trumps national security adviser, Michael Flynn, said the United States was putting Iran on notice over its destabilizing activity after it fired the missile. As of today, we are officially putting Iran on notice, Flynn said, without explaining exactly what that meant. Flynn said the missile launch defied the U.N. resolution that called on Iran not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons. A U.S. official said Iran had test-launched a medium-range ballistic missile on Sunday and it exploded after traveling 630 miles (1,010 km).  The Security Council held an emergency meeting on Tuesday and recommended the missile testing be studied at committee level. The new U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, called the test unacceptable.  Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Tuesday that Tehran would never use its ballistic missiles to attack another country. Some 220 Iranian members of parliament reaffirmed support for Tehrans missile program, calling international condemnation of the tests illogical. The Islamic Republic of Iran is against weapons of mass destruction, so its missile capability is the only available deterrence against enemy hostility, the lawmakers said in a statement carried on state media on Wednesday. The state news agency IRNA quoted Ali Shamkhani, head of Irans National Security Council, as saying Iran would not seek permission from any country or international organization for development of our conventional defensive capability.  The Security Council resolution was adopted to buttress the deal under which Iran curbed its nuclear activities to allay concerns they could be used to develop atomic bombs, in exchange for relief from economic sanctions. The resolution urged Tehran to refrain from work on ballistic missiles designed to deliver nuclear weapons. Critics say the resolutions language does not make this obligatory. Tehran says it has not carried out any work on missiles specifically designed to carry nuclear payloads. The test on Sunday, according to U.S. officials, was of a type of missile that had also been tested seven months ago. Iran has one of the Middle Easts largest missile programs  but it has been dogged by a poor record for accuracy. However, Hossein Salami, deputy head of Irans Revolutionary Guards, said on the day of the test that the country was now one of the few whose ballistic missiles were capable of hitting moving objects. This would enable Iran to hit enemy ships, drones or incoming ballistic missiles.  Some of Irans precision-guided missiles have the range to strike its regional enemy Israel. On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Irans new missile test a flagrant violation of the U.N. resolution. He said he would ask Trump in their meeting in mid- February for a renewal of sanctions against Iran. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Wednesday proposed an increase of 0.25 percent on average in payments to health insurers who offer Medicare Advantage insurance, which provides health benefits to more than 18 million elderly or disabled people. Enrollment in these plans grew by about 7 percent last year to account for about one-third of Medicare members, making it an important growth business for private insurers who are facing changes in their business as Republicans seek to repeal and replace Obamacare. It is not clear if Republicans will make any broad changes to the Medicare Advantage program, or to Medicare. Ipsita Smolinski, managing director at Capitol Street in Washington D.C. said on Wednesday that Medicare Advantage could get a boost amid the Republican push for private programs.  The payment rate increase of 25 basis points was in line with estimates that analysts had released ahead of time and shares of insurers including UnitedHealth Group Inc and Humana Inc, two of the largest providers of these plans, were little changed in after-hours trading. JPMorgans Gary Taylor said in a research note last week that he had been expecting a proposal for payments that were flat to slightly up from the rate that the government is now paying insurers who provide plans. Last year, the government proposed an increase of about 1.35 percent but later trimmed that back about 50 basis points. But insurers have 30 days to respond to the proposed payment rates and other changes included in the regulatory notice, which this year was 159 pages long, and may ask for a bigger increase.  The 2018 update is only a smidge better than flat which I suspect may anger some plans, Smolinski said. She said she expected that the payment rate could rise between now and when final rates are set. Insurers use the payment rate information provided by the government to prepare bids to sell Medicare Advantage plans in specific areas.  The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the division of the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services that regulates Medicare, will announce the final rate on April 3.  It said that it expected an additional 2.5 percent increase in payments related to coding of medical services.  The payment rate takes into account annual growth in medical costs and statutory requirements to reduce government payments to insurers for Medicare Advantage closer to the level it pays in traditional fee-for-service Medicare. Marilyn Tavenner, the CEO of Americas Health Insurance Plans, the industrys biggest lobbying group, said that it is reviewing the notice to be sure the program is protected from harmful cuts.

(Reuters) - Native Americans and activists protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline project expressed alarm on Wednesday after federal lawmakers from North Dakota said the final permit had been granted for the project, a statement later contradicted by the Army, which issues such permits. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said on Wednesday it has started a review for the permit but that the easement had not been granted. The Assistant Secretary for the Army Civil Works will make a decision on the pipeline once a full review and analysis is completed in accordance with the directive, it said in a statement. (Graphic: here) Activists in North Dakota expressed anger after two lawmakers said late on Tuesday that final right-of-way for the pipeline had already been approved.  In a statement late on Tuesday, activists at the Sacred Stone camp, the original protest camp on Standing Rock Sioux land, called on other activists to return for prayer and direct action.      The Standing Rock Sioux tribe, along with other Native American groups, environmentalists and other activists have argued that the $3.8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline led by  Energy Transfer Partners LP would damage sacred lands and could leak oil into the tribes water supply. Proponents believe the pipeline is necessary to transport U.S. oil safely and that it would create jobs. The pipeline would stretch for 1,170 miles (1,885 km) from North Dakotas oil-producing Bakken region to Patoka, Illinois. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe had successfully won delays from the Obama administration for further environmental review, but last week President Donald Trump signed an executive order telling the Corps of Engineers to expedite review of the project. It is unclear how long that review will take. It still needs a required permit to tunnel under Lake Oahe, a reservoir that is part of the Missouri River. The reservoir is the water source for the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, whose land in Cannon Ball is adjacent to the lines route.    Jade Begay, spokeswoman for the Indigenous Environmental Network, a nonprofit group and one of the primary groups protesting the line, said: People (in protest camps) are watching pretty closely. People are in a reactionary place and it is dangerous for politicians to put out these unfounded statements.  In a statement posted on their website, the Sacred Stone camp - the original camp, established last April - asked protesters to return to their encampment so that they could stage another demonstration. That camp is located on Sioux land in Sioux County; it is not the site of the bulk of protests, which are in Morton County on federal land.  The main protest camp, known as Oceti Sakowin, had been the staging ground for ongoing protests, some of which led to violent clashes between law enforcement and activists.  That camp is in the process of being broken down, because it is located on a flood plain, and when it floods, any remaining structures could foul the river.  Protesters on Wednesday attempted to set up another camp across from Oceti Sakowin, on the other side of Highway 1806, on private property. In a press release, North Dakota law enforcement said they asked protesters to leave the camp, and after refusals, evicted about 40 people from that land, which is owned by Dakota Access. On Tuesday, U.S. Senator John Hoeven of North Dakota said in a statement that Acting Secretary of the Army Robert Speer had told him and Vice President Mike Pence that Speer directed the Corps to proceed with the easement. U.S. Representative Kevin Cramer also said he had been informed of the directive. A spokesman for Hoeven, Don Canton, said on Wednesday that Speer told the senator that the Army Corps was doing its due diligence in acting on Trumps memo from last week, and that Hoeven had not discussed the environmental study with the Corps. Lewis Grassrope, a member of the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe in South Dakota, said the Trump administration and North Dakota  lawmakers were trying to inspire fear and anger through premature statements. They want us to react and go do actions, which will give them the right to say, OK, theyre not peaceful. So lets put in this pipeline, he said.     Several groups opposing the project, including the Standing Rock Sioux, said they would fight the granting of an easement in court, as an environmental study still needs to be completed. Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault II last week said he requested a meeting with Trump, but has not received a response. Standing Rock representatives were not available for comment on Wednesday, but Begay said that Trump, when he made these executive orders, did not have any consultation with tribal leaders.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Wednesday urged Senate Republicans to go nuclear and impose a rule change to force a simple majority vote on confirmation if Democrats block his U.S. Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, as Democrats maneuvered for a hard fight. Gorsuch, a federal appeals court judge from Colorado seen as a conservative intellectual, began holding private meetings with senators, starting with top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell, to drum up support for his nomination a day after Trump picked  the 49-year-old for a lifetime job on the countrys top court. Trumps fellow Republicans control the Senate 52-48. Democrats signaled on Wednesday they would set up a procedural hurdle, known as a filibuster, requiring 60 votes, rather than a simple majority, to move toward confirmation of Gorsuch. The president urged McConnell to change long-standing Senate rules to eliminate the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees, a move dubbed the nuclear option, if Democrats block Gorsuch. We want to have him (Gorsuch) go through an elegant process as opposed to a demeaning process, because theyre very demeaning on the other side, and they want to make you look as bad as possible, Trump said, referring to Democrats. If we end up with that gridlock, I would say: If you can, Mitch, go nuclear, Trump said at a White House meeting with conservative advocacy groups. Supreme Court nominations require Senate confirmation.  If confirmed, Gorsuch would reinstate the Supreme Courts conservative majority, in place for decades until Justice Antonin Scalias death last Feb. 13. The courts ideological shift could prove pivotal on a range of issues including presidential powers, abortion, the death penalty and transgender, gun and religious rights. Trumps comments came as Democrats plotted strategy on how to deal with Gorsuchs nomination. They remain furious over McConnells refusal last year to let the Senate hold confirmation hearings or a vote on Democratic President Barack Obamas nomination of Merrick Garland to succeed Scalia on the court.  Some Democratic senators, arguing that Republicans stole a Supreme Court seat from Obama, announced their opposition to Gorsuch, while others said they were willing to hear him out. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor that if Gorsuch could not meet the same standard Republicans insisted on for Obamas Supreme Court nominees, at least 60 votes for confirmation, then the problem lies not with the Senate, but with the nominee. The answer should not be to change the rules of the Senate, but to change the nominee to someone who can earn 60 votes. Sixty votes produces a mainstream candidate, Schumer added. To get those 60 votes, Republicans hope to lure eight Democrats up for re-election in 2018 in Republican-leaning states or states that voted for Trump last November. Those include Democrats from Indiana, North Dakota, West Virginia, Missouri, Michigan, Montana and Wisconsin as well as closely divided Maine. Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Republican-leaning Ohio, already announced he would vote against Gorsuch. Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin said she would review Gorsuchs record but was deeply troubled over his stances against disabled students, workers and womens reproductive healthcare. Senator Jon Tester of Montana said in an interview he wanted to review Gorscuchs record on womens rights and other issues, adding the judges stance on end-of-life issues distresses me. Gorsuch is known for siding with the Christian owners of a company that challenged federal requirements that businesses provide insurance coverage for womens birth control and for writing against euthanasia and assisted suicide. The influential, deep-pocketed Americans for Prosperity is promising a vigorous effort to help Gorsuch get confirmed and is using its network of wealthy contributors to build support, especially in battleground states. The organization is led by multi-billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch. It has been ramping up its political campaign donations in support of Republican candidates for the Senate and other offices.     Schumer said that while Trump campaigned as someone who would be for the working man and woman, he now had chosen a Supreme Court nominee who sides with CEOs over citizens. Unfortunately, Judge Gorsuch has proven to have a judicial philosophy outside of the mainstream and time and again has subjugated individual rights to those of corporations, said Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who came out in opposition to the nomination.  Senator Joe Manchin, a moderate Democrat who met with the nominee on Wednesday, said a Supreme Court nominee should have to win the support of 60 senators but urged fellow Democrats to give Gorsuch a chance. Manchin, whose home state, West Virginia, voted overwhelmingly for Trump, is up for re-election in 2018. Senate aides said Republicans were hoping the Judiciary Committee could hold hearings and a vote on the nomination by late March, paving the way for confirmation by the full Senate in the first week of April. If that happens, Gorsuch could be on the high court in time to year a major transgender rights case. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - President Donald Trumps travel restrictions on people from seven countries could dampen international enrollment at U.S. colleges, at a time they have become increasingly reliant on tuition revenue from overseas students. Colleges and universities have struggled in recent years with slowing tuition growth, increased competition and a stronger focus on making education more affordable. (Graphic: here) Those factors have increased the importance of international students, who made up 5.2 percent of enrollment last year, up from 3.2 percent a decade earlier, according to the Institute of International Education, or IIE.  International student growth is important for many institutions, said Roy Eappen, municipal research analyst at Wells Fargo. Many international students come to the U.S. to study and are willing to pay full price for higher education. Analysts said international student applications could be hit by the White House travel order. Trump suspended travelers from seven majority-Muslim countries - Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen - saying the move would help protect Americans from terrorist attacks. The curbs come at a delicate point in the admissions cycle because students are beginning to decide where to enroll this autumn, said Susan Fitzgerald, associate managing director, Moodys. You could see an impact in the fall. We just dont know yet. U.S. universities in both Democratic- and Republican-led states said over the weekend they were unnerved by the executive order.  Lee Bollinger, president of New Yorks Columbia University, wrote in a statement on Sunday that if this order stands, there is the certainty of a profound impact on our University community. Of the 1,043,839 international students in the United States during the 2015-16 school year, 17,354, or 1.7 percent, came from the countries affected by the order, IIE data shows. While that is a small portion of the total, there could be a broader impact on the countrys ability to attract students from the global marketplace if the United States becomes viewed as  potentially less welcoming for international students, some analysts said. Wells Fargos Eappen said any kind of anti-immigration sentiment may lead to a pullback in demand from international students.  IIE President Allan Goodman said in an emailed statement that beyond the immediate impact of students from specific countries who are not able to enter the country, there could be a ripple effect of significant unintended economic consequences as students, faculty and researchers from other countries decide whether to come to the United States. Public universities have increasingly fallen victim to state budget cuts or tuition freezes, while many private universities now discount tuition, meaning they slash their price tags to lure prospective students. In many parts of the country, enrollment numbers are on the decline and university debt is on the rise. That makes attracting international students increasingly important. International students make up an estimated 10 to 12 percent of tuition revenue among U.S. schools rated by Moodys, Fitzgerald said.  University education for Americans is subsidized by foreigners who occupy seats in classrooms, said David Kotok, chairman and chief investment officer of Cumberland Advisors. Ask any dean or provost what his schools financial structure would look like if there were no foreign students enrolled. According to NAFSA, an international education association, international students contributed $32.8 billion and supported more than 400,000 jobs in the U.S. economy during the 2015-2016 academic year.  Moodys Fitzgerald said international students had become a counterweight to the relatively low revenue growth from domestic students among U.S. schools. It would be an additional challenge for the sector should it fall, Fitzgerald said.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Under the order released on Friday, travelers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen may not enter the country for at least 90 days while Kelly and others determine whether there is enough information available to screen them. Some of those countries that are currently on the list may not be taken off the list anytime soon, if they are countries that are in various states of collapse, as an example, Kelly told a press conference. Kelly said others may be added if it is determined they could tighten up their procedures to ensure more secure vetting. Several lawsuits have been filed blocking portions of the order, which drew harsh criticism from some of Trumps fellow Republicans, Democrats, human rights organizations and some Western U.S. allies.  Vice President Mike Pence was closely questioned about the order by Republican senators during their weekly caucus lunch. Obviously what happened Friday, they have to understand, was not well done, Republican Senator Bob Corker told reporters. ... There are a lot of issues here that I dont think were well thought through. Confusion mounted during the weekend as U.S. Customs and Border Protection, a division of the Department of Homeland Security, rushed to brief airlines and customs agents about how to implement Trumps order. The executive action was not explicit about how to handle a wide range of people trying to enter the United States, including permanent residents, students and even Iraqi pilots training to protect U.S. troops. Acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan told reporters he had briefed appropriate parties within two hours of the order. Kelly said he knew the order was coming and had people involved in the general drafting of it. But a Department of Homeland Security official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Customs and Border Protection officers had no advance notice of the order or how to respond. Some issues were addressed on Tuesday. Kelly said people from the seven targeted nations who hold dual citizenship would be allowed to enter the United States on the passport of a non-restricted nation, which had been uncertain. The executive order also stopped the resettlement of refugees for 120 days. But the administration granted waivers to 872 in transit who will be arriving this week. Kelly came to the U.S. Capitol later on Tuesday to brief congressional leaders and the heads of national security committees about the order. He was peppered with questions from both Republicans and Democrats concerned about the lack of planning. Senator Claire McCaskill, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security Committee, said Kelly made clear the White House is happy with the order, and that the administration had not wanted to wait to address details about its implementation. It was pretty clear that the president wanted this executive order put in place, and he wanted it implemented immediately. And its not going anywhere, she told reporters. Since the order, 721 travelers with visas from the seven countries were denied boarding U.S.-bound flights, according to McAleenan. The department has also processed 1,060 waivers for legal permanent residents, such as green card holders. Kelly said immigration and customs officials were in compliance with court orders and no agent knowingly or intentionally violated them. The Trump administration also sought to clarify on Tuesday that citizens of U.S. ally Israel who were born in Arab countries would be allowed into the United States. The U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv said a valid U.S. visa in an Israeli passport would still be valid even if the passport holder was born in one of the seven countries.

The executive order by Trump comes at a time of uncertainty over U.S. policy in Libya, which remains mired in the chaos that followed the NATO-backed 2011 uprising against long-time leader Muammar Gaddafi. The U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA), was strongly supported by former U.S. President Barack Obamas administration, but has struggled to assert its authority in Tripoli and beyond.  Factions in eastern Libya aligned with a rival government and with powerful military commander Khalifa Haftar welcomed Trumps election, hoping for more support for their anti-Islamist stance. Trumps travel ban has angered some Libyans, including students studying or planning to study in the United States. GNA Foreign Minister Mohammed Siyala called it an unjust decision that should be reviewed.  These actions represent racial discrimination on the basis of religion and are incompatible with human rights, he told local TV station Libyas Channel.  Authorities in eastern Libya declined to comment on the ban for days. A spokesman for the eastern-based government said on Wednesday however the order could not be rejected, given Libyas own institutional confusion. A member of the eastern parliament, Youssef al-Fakhri, said that despite Libyas political and security problems, the measure was not appropriate.  The order appeared to put in jeopardy the participation of Libyans invited to a Feb. 16 conference titled Libya-U.S. Relations 2017: New Vision, Hope and Opportunities.  The event, co-hosted by the National Council on U.S.-Libya Relations, lists Libyan speakers including two former prime ministers and the head of the National Oil Corporation (NOC). Several speakers are loyal to or connected with eastern-based factions. We are clearly concerned with the risk of denial of entrance to some of our key speakers and participants from Libya, Hani Shennib, the councils president, said in an email. However, we are working diligently with authorities here in the USA and we are hopeful that a resolution to facilitate  entrance of our conference participants will [be] present in the next 2-3 days. A GNA spokesman, Ashraf al-Tulti, told Reuters Libyas foreign ministry would request exceptions from the U.S. Department of State for Libyan attendees.  Exceptions to the travel ban can be made on a case by case basis, and diplomatic visas are exempt. Tulti, who was invited to attend the Washington conference and holds a diplomatic passport, said he was still waiting for a visa. One Libyan speaker said she had a visa, but was still investigating whether she would be able to attend. Under the order released on Friday, travelers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen are banned from entering the United States for at least 90 days.

Gorsuch, who has not shied away from needling liberals on occasion, is 49 and could influence the high court for decades to come in the lifetime post, if confirmed by the Republican-led Senate. He is the youngest Supreme Court nominee since Republican President George H.W. Bush in 1991 picked Clarence Thomas, who was 43 at the time.  DONT MISS For hardline West Bank settlers, Jared Kushner's their man He currently serves as a judge on the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver, the city where he was born. He was appointed to that post in 2006 by Republican President George W. Bush.  Gorsuch, who is white, adds little diversity to the court compared with the justices appointed by Democratic President Barack Obama, both of whom were women, one becoming the first Latina justice.  But he offers geographical diversity to a court dominated by justices from the east and west coasts. As an Episcopalian, he would be the only Protestant on the court, which has three Jewish justices and five Catholics.  EXCLUSIVE Poll: A third of Americans think travel ban will make them safer Gorsuch is seen by analysts as a jurist similar to Scalia, who died on Feb. 13, 2016. Scalia, praised by Gorsuch as a lion of the law, was known not only for his hard-line conservatism but for interpreting the U.S. Constitution based on what he considered its original meaning, and laws as written by legislators. Like Scalia, Gorsuch is known for sharp writing skills.  It is the role of judges to apply, not alter, the work of the peoples representatives, Gorsuch said on Tuesday at the White House event announcing the nomination in remarks that echoed Scalias views.  Trump, a Republican, had the chance to nominate Gorsuch because the Republican-led U.S. Senate last year refused to consider Obamas nominee, appeals court judge Merrick Garland.  Democrats, angered by the treatment of Garland, and opposing Gorsuchs conservative views, may seek to block his nomination.  Trump may have favored Gorsuch for the job in hopes of a smoother confirmation process than for other potential candidates such as appeals court judge William Pryor, who has called the 1973 Supreme Court ruling legalizing abortion the worst abomination of constitutional law in our history.  The federal government is familiar territory for Gorsuch, who is the son of Anne Burford, the first woman to head the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. She served as Republican President Ronald Reagans top environmental official but resigned in 1983, just 22 months into the job, amid a fight with Congress over documents on the EPAs use of a fund created to clean up toxic waste dumps nationwide.  She was criticized by environmentalists for cutting the agencys enforcement efforts against polluters and slowing payments for cleaning up toxic waste.  The high court is also familiar ground for Gorsuch, who served as a clerk for two justices including a current member of the court, Anthony Kennedy, a conservative who often casts a deciding vote in close decisions. If confirmed, he would become the first clerk to join a former boss on the Supreme Court. Gorsuch also served as a clerk for Justice Byron White, a John F. Kennedy appointee, who retired from the court in 1993.  Gorsuch has strong, Ivy League academic qualifications: attending Columbia University and, like several of the other justices on the court, Harvard Law School, graduating the same year as Obama. He completed a doctorate in legal philosophy at Oxford University, spent several years in private practice and worked in George W. Bushs Justice Department.  In a 2005 article in the conservative National Review magazine, Gorsuch criticized American liberals overweening addiction to the courtroom to implement a social agenda on everything from gay marriage to assisted suicide. In his Senate confirmation hearing for his appellate court judgeship, he said the point of the article could be applied to groups across the political spectrum.  In 2013,Gorsuchplayed a role in a high-profile ruling involving arts-and-crafts retailerHobby Lobby, allowing owners of private companies to object on religious grounds to anObamacareprovision requiring employers to provide health insurance covering birth control for women.  The decision, later upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, said the provision violated a federal law called the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. In a concurrence, Gorsuchexpressed sympathy for the choice faced by the evangelical Christian owners of the company between exercising their faithor saving their business.  Gorsuch also criticized an important legal doctrine that directs courts to defer to federal agencies interpretation of statutes. Last August, in a case over immigration rules, Gorsuch called the doctrine the elephant in the room that concentrates federal power in a way that seems more than a little difficult to square with the Constitution.  He has written extensively on the topic of assisted suicide and euthanasia, arguing against legalization. In written questions related to his Senate confirmation hearings, he was asked whether his writings would make him biased in any case on the matter before him. He said his personal views would play no role in his decisions as a judge.  Gorsuch is married with two teenage daughters, and lives outside of Boulder, Colorado.  Friends and former clerks said he was a lover of the outdoors, describing him as an excellent skier, a fly fisherman and a runner.  We used to joke that he should be the face of Colorado tourism, former Gorsuch clerk Jane Nitze said.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The anti-bribery emoluments clause of the U.S. constitution bars payments by foreign governments.

He noted that Flynn like I think probably countless if not hundreds of retired flag officers, joined a speaking bureau and has given speeches at various places.

Border adjustment, which is a mainstay of the House Republican tax reform blueprint, would bring sweeping change to the U.S. corporate tax system. But it faces opposition from retailers, oil refiners and automakers who say it could raise prices for American consumers.   In a speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch did not reject the border adjustment tax proposed by House Speaker Paul Ryan. But he said there are  questions about whether it would unduly burden U.S. consumers and businesses or pass muster under international trade rules. We dont have definitive answers to any of those questions at this particular point. And without them, I dont think I can give definitive positions, Hatch said. The Utah Republican did not say whether he thinks border adjustment could clear the Senate. But he said a handful of senators have serious reservations and noted that Republicans can ill afford to lose votes from their 52-seat Senate majority, even if they use a procedure known as reconciliation to avoid a Democratic filibuster. A major concern on tax reform is producing a bill that can get through the Senate, Hatch said. Well basically need universal Republican support to pass anything through reconciliation.Thats difficult to accomplish under any circumstances, let alone on something as complicated as tax reform. Billed as a way to boost U.S. manufacturing and pay for corporate tax cuts, border adjustment would essentially tax imports but not exports. It is expected to be part of House tax reform legislation that could emerge in March or April.     Im optimistic we can find a common path, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, Hatchs congressional counterpart, said in a statement after the senators speech.  It is unclear whether the border adjustment proposal has President Donald Trumps support. The president has called the proposal too complicated, but the White House says it is an option for paying for a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.

The move, which his administration says is aimed at protecting the United States from terrorist attacks, has been condemned by many countries and has sparked protests and court challenges in the United States. A panel of U.N. human rights experts urged the Trump administration on Wednesday to protect people fleeing war and persecution, and said the measure contravened international humanitarian and human rights laws. It risks people being returned, without proper individual assessments and asylum procedures, to places in which they risk being subjected to torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, the experts said in a statement. The experts, including the U.N. special rapporteurs on migrants, racism, human rights and counter-terrorism, torture, and freedom of religion, also said the measure could lead to increased stigmatization of Muslim communities.     The Vatican, in its first comment on the order, said it was concerned. Certainly there is worry because we are messengers of another culture, that of openness, the Vaticans deputy secretary of state, Archbishop Angelo Becciu, told an Italian Catholic television station. Pope Francis, in fact, insists on the ability to integrate those who arrive in our societies and cultures, he said, also commenting on Trumps plan to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.  In Iran, President Hassan Rouhani stepped up his criticism of Trumps immigration policies, including the travel ban, dismissing the U.S. businessman-turned-president as a political novice. Tehran has already vowed to respond with legal, political and reciprocal measures. It will take him a long time and will cost the United States a lot, until he learns what is happening in the world, Rouhani said in an address on state television.   Libyas U.N.-backed government also criticized Trumps ban on its nationals. The order has put in question participation of Libyans invited to a conference on Libya planned in Washington this month.  The measure was one of a flurry of executive orders signed by Trump, a Republican, since he took office on Jan. 20. Everybody is arguing whether or not it is a BAN.

Another 33 percent said it would not make any difference and the rest said they dont know.  Trumps executive order blocked citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen and placed an indefinite ban on Syrian refugees.  Some Republican lawmakers criticized Trumps order and said it could backfire by giving terrorist organizations a new recruitment message.  This executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country, senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said in a joint statement.  The Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 49 percent of Americans agreed with the order and 41 percent disagreed. Some 53 percent of Democrats said they strongly disagree with Trumps action while 51 percent of Republicans said they strongly agree.  Democrats were more than three times as likely as Republicans to say that the U.S. should continue to take in immigrants and refugees, and Republicans were more than three times as likely as Democrats to agree that banning people from Muslim countries is necessary to prevent terrorism.  Cheryl Hoffman, 46, of Sumerduck, Virginia said she was thrilled that Trump ordered the ban.  I understand that the country was founded on immigrants, said Hoffman, who participated in the poll. Please, I get that. But Im worried that refugees are coming in and being supported by my tax dollars.  Another poll respondent, Veronica Buetel, 57, of Green, Ohio felt just the opposite: Yes, we do live in scary times, but there are other, better ways to root out terrorism.  Westy Egmont, director of the Immigrant Integration Lab at Boston College, said Americans have grown increasingly hostile toward refugees and immigrants as the influx has shifted from Eastern Europeans to people from countries like Iraq, Somalia and Afghanistan.  The rise of those numbers, as relatively small as they are, have gathered just enough attention to set off a small reaction from people who are genuinely uncomfortable with the diversity around them, Egmont said.  Most Americans, however, dont think the country should show a preference for Christian refugees, as Trump has suggested. Some 56 percent, including 72 percent of Democrats and 45 percent of Republicans, disagreed that the country should welcome Christian refugees, but not Muslim ones.  On Tuesday, the Trump administration sought to clarify that citizens of U.S. ally Israel who were born in Arab countries would be allowed into the United States.  The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English in all 50 states. It gathered poll responses from 1,201 people including 453 Democrats and 478 Republicans. It has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points for the entire sample and 5 percentage points for the Democrats and the Republicans.

Massachusetts, New York, Virginia and Washington state joined the legal battle against the travel ban, which the White House deems necessary to improve national security. The challenges contend the order violated the U.S. Constitutions guarantees of religious freedom. San Francisco became the first U.S. city to sue to challenge a Trump directive to withhold federal money from U.S. cities that have adopted sanctuary policies toward undocumented immigrants, which local officials argue help local police by making those immigrants more willing to report crimes. The legal maneuvers were the latest acts of defiance against executive orders signed by Trump last week that sparked a wave of protests in major U.S. cities, where thousands of people decried the new presidents actions as discriminatory. Both policies are in line with campaign promises by Republican businessman-turned-politician Trump, who vowed to build a wall on the Mexican border to stop illegal immigration and to take hard-line steps to prevent terrorist attacks in the United States. The restrictions on the seven Muslim-majority countries and new limits on refugees have won the support of many Americans, with 49 percent of respondents to a Reuters poll conducted Monday and Tuesday saying they agreed with the order, while 41 percent disagreed. Massachusetts contended the restrictions run afoul of the establishment clause of the 1st Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits religious preference. At bottom, what this is about is a violation of the Constitution, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said of the order halting travel by people with passports from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days. The order also barred resettlement of refugees for 120 days and indefinitely banned Syrian refugees. It discriminates against people because of their religion, it discriminates against people because of their country of origin, Healey said at a Boston press conference, flanked by leaders from the tech, healthcare and education sectors who said that the order could limit their ability to attract and retain highly educated workers. Massachusetts will be backing a lawsuit filed over the weekend in Boston federal court by two Iranian men who teach at the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth. A federal judge blocked the government from expelling those men from the country and halted enforcement of the order for seven days, following similar but more limited moves in four other states. The attorneys general of New York and Virginia also said their states were joining similar lawsuits filed in their respective federal courts challenging the ban. As we speak, there are students at our colleges and universities who are unable to return to Virginia, Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring told reporters. This is not an action I take lightly, but it is one I take with confidence in our legal analysis. On Monday, liberal-leaning Washington state became the first U.S. state to have its attorney general initiate a lawsuit against Trump to challenge the travel ban. Multiple foreign nationals have also filed lawsuits challenging the ban. They included one filed in Colorado on Tuesday by a Libyan college student and two filed in Chicago,  including one on behalf of an Iranian father of three children all living in Illinois. Protests against Trumps executive action continued on Tuesday in several cities.   A crowd of several thousand demonstrators gathered at the federal courthouse in Minneapolis, chanting Hey, hey, ho, ho Muslim ban has got to go! Dozens of protesters chanted the same slogan at Los Angeles International Airport, and more than 400 demonstrators gathered in downtown Miami to protest both the travel ban and Trumps crackdown on sanctuary cities. San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera filed suit over Trumps order threatening to cut funds to cities with sanctuary policies, a move that could stop the flow of billions of dollars to major U.S. population centers including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. If allowed to be implemented, this executive order would make our communities less safe. It would make our residents less prosperous, and it would split families apart, Herrera said. Sanctuary cities adopt policies that limit cooperation, such as refusing to comply with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainer requests. Advocates of the policies say that, beyond helping police with crime reporting, they make undocumented immigrants more willing to serve as witnesses if they do not fear that contact with law enforcement will lead to their deportation. Both the San Francisco and Massachusetts actions contend that Trumps orders in question violate the 10th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which states that powers not granted to the federal government should fall to the states. Michael Hethmon, senior counsel with the conservative Immigration Reform Law Institute in Washington, called the San Francisco lawsuit a silly political gesture, noting that prior federal court decisions make clear that the U.S. government can prohibit a policy that essentially impedes legitimate federal programs.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Tuesday nominated Neil Gorsuch for a lifetime job on the U.S. Supreme Court, picking the 49-year-old federal appeals court judge to restore the courts conservative majority and help shape rulings on divisive issues such as abortion, gun control, the death penalty and religious rights. The Colorado native faces a potentially contentious confirmation battle in the U.S. Senate after Republicans last year refused to consider Democratic President Barack Obamas nominee to fill the vacancy caused by the February 2016 death of conservative justice Antonin Scalia. The Senates top Democrat, Chuck Schumer, indicated his party would mount a procedural hurdle requiring 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate rather than a simple majority to approve Gorsuch, and expressed very serious doubts about the nominee. Liberal groups called for an all-out fight to reject Gorsuch while conservative groups and Republican senators heaped praise on him like outstanding, impressive and a home run. Gorsuch, the son of a former Reagan administration official, is the youngest nominee to the nations highest court in more than a quarter century, and he could influence the direction of the court for decades. He is a judge on the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and was appointed to that post by Republican President George W. Bush in 2006. Announcing the selection to a nighttime crowd in the White House East Room flanked by the judge and his wife, Trump said Gorsuchs resume is as good as it gets. Trump, who took office on Jan. 20 and has sparked numerous controversies, said he hopes Republicans and Democrats can come together on this nomination for the good of the country. Judge Gorsuch has outstanding legal skills, a brilliant mind, tremendous discipline, and has earned bipartisan support, Trump told an audience that included Scalias widow. Depending on their age, a justice can be active for 50 years. And his or her decisions can last a century or more, and can often be permanent, Trump added. Gorsuch is considered a conservative intellectual, known for backing religious rights and writing against euthanasia and assisted suicide, and is seen as very much in the mold of Scalia, a leading conservative voice on the court for decades. I respect ... the fact that in our legal order it is for Congress and not the courts to write new laws, Gorsuch said, as Trump looked on. It is the role of judges to apply, not alter, the work of the peoples representatives. A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge, stretching for results he prefers rather than those the law demands. A senior administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the choice of Gorsuch was seen by the White House as a significant departure from Supreme Court nominations from the recent past, given that many justices have come from the eastern United States. Gorsuch lives in Boulder, Colorado, where he raises horses and is a life-long outdoorsman. The official said a screening committee helped in the selection process that included Vice President Mike Pence, White House counsel Don McGahn, chief of staff Reince Priebus and top strategist Steve Bannon. Gorsuch became the youngest U.S. Supreme Court nominee since Republican President George H.W. Bush in 1991 selected conservative Clarence Thomas, who was 43 at the time. Gorsuch was in the same 1991 graduating class from Harvard Law School as Obama. The selection of Gorsuch, who was on a list of about 20 judges suggested by conservative legal activists, unified Republicans in a way not seen since Trumps Nov. 8 election victory, with even critics within the party such as South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham singing the nominees praises. Trump made his choice between two U.S. appeals court judges, Gorsuch and Thomas Hardiman of the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, according to a source involved in the selection process. The Senate confirmed Gorsuch for his current judgeship in 2006 by voice vote with no one voting against him. Democrats signaled it may not be easy this time. Judge Gorsuch has repeatedly sided with corporations over working people, demonstrated a hostility toward womens rights, and most troubling, hewed to an ideological approach to jurisprudence that makes me skeptical that he can be a strong, independent justice on the court, Schumer said. Trump got the opportunity to name Scalias replacement only because the Republican-led Senate, in an action with little precedent in U.S. history, refused to consider Obamas nominee for the post, appeals court judge Merrick Garland. Obama nominated Garland on March 16 but Republican senators led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell denied Garland the customary confirmation hearings and vote. This is the first time in American history that one party has blockaded a nominee for almost a year in order to deliver a seat to a president of their own party. If this tactic is rewarded rather than resisted, it will set a dangerous new precedent in American governance, Oregon Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley said. McConnell said on Tuesday he hoped the Senate would show Gorsuch fair consideration and respect the result of the recent election with an up-or-down vote on his nomination, just like the Senate treated the four first-term nominees of (Democratic) Presidents (Bill) Clinton and Obama. A rally outside the Supreme Court building staged by liberal groups drew hundreds of demonstrators against Gorsuch.  Michael Keegan, president of the liberal advocacy group People for the American Way, described Gorsuch as an ideological warrior who puts his own right-wing politics above the Constitution. Gorsuch is the son of Anne Burford, the first woman to head the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. She served in Republican President Ronald Reagans administration but resigned in 1983 amid a fight with Congress over documents on the EPAs use of a fund created to clean up toxic waste dumps nationwide. Trumps selection was one of the most consequential appointments of his young presidency as he moved to restore a conservative majority on the Supreme Court that had been in place for decades until Scalia died at age 79 on Feb. 13, 2016. Trumps fellow Republicans hold a 52-48 Senate majority, meaning some Democratic votes would be needed to confirm his pick under current rules. Trump said last week he would favor Senate Republicans eliminating the procedural move that Democrats have promised, called a filibuster, for Supreme Court nominees if Democrats block his pick. Such a change has been dubbed the nuclear option.  Trump has said his promise to appoint a conservative justice was one of the reasons he won the Nov. 8 presidential election, with Christian conservatives and others emphasizing the importance of the pick during the campaign. If confirmed, Gorsuch would expand the courts conservative wing, made up of John Roberts, Anthony Kennedy Samuel Alito and Thomas. Kennedy long has been considered the courts pivotal vote, sometimes siding with the liberals in key cases such as the June 2016 ruling striking down abortion restrictions in Texas. The courts restored conservative majority likely would be supportive toward the death penalty and gun rights and hostile toward campaign finance limits. Scalias replacement also could be pivotal in cases involving abortion, religious rights, presidential powers, transgender rights, voting rights, federal regulations others. Gorsuch boasts Ivy League credentials: attending Columbia University and, like several of the other justices on the court, Harvard Law School. He also completed a doctorate in legal philosophy at Oxford University, spent several years in private practice and worked in George W. Bushs Justice Department. Gorsuch joined an opinion in 2013 saying that owners of private companies could object on religious grounds to a provision of the Obamacare health insurance law requiring employers to provide coverage for birth control for women. As long as Kennedy and four liberals remain on the bench, the court is not expected to pare back abortion rights as many U.S. conservatives fervently hope. The Supreme Court legalized abortion in the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling. In June, the justices ruled 5-3 to strike down a Texas law that restricted abortion access, with Kennedy and the liberals in the majority. The current vacancy is the courts longest since a 391-day void from 1969 to 1970 during Republican Richard Nixons presidency. After Abe Fortas resigned from the court in May 1969, the Senate voted down two nominees put forward by Nixon before confirming Harry Blackmun, who became a justice in June 1970. Aside from that one, no other Supreme Court vacancy since the U.S. Civil War years of the 1860s has been as long as the current one. Trump may get to make additional appointments. Liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who Trump called upon to resign last July after she called him a faker, is 83 while Kennedy is 80. Stephen Breyer, another liberal, is 78.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": "" MOSCOW (Reuters) - In his book, Art of the Deal, Donald Trump said the best deals were ones where both sides got something they wanted. His credo, applied to a potential U.S.-Russia deal, flags an awkward truth for Vladimir Putin: He wants more from Trump than vice versa.  As aides try to set up a first meeting between the two presidents, the mismatched nature of their respective wish lists gives Trump the edge, and means that a deal, if one is done, may be more limited and longer in the making than the Kremlin hopes.  What the two countries can offer each another is strikingly different, said Konstantin von Eggert, a commentator for TV Rain, a Moscow TV station sometimes critical of the Kremlin.  The U.S. has a stronger hand. In biblical terms, the U.S. is the three kings bearing gold, while Russia is the shepherds with little apart from their good faith.  Appetite for a deal in Moscow, where parliament applauded Trumps election win, is palpable. The Kremlin blames Barack Obama for wrecking U.S.-Russia ties, which slid to a post-Cold War low on his watch, and with the economy struggling to emerge from two years of recession, craves a new start.  Trump's early moves spark alarm, resistance within the governmentCOMMENTARY: War College: Russia's hybrid war against the WestIran confirms new missile test, says it does not violate nuclear deal Trumps intentions toward Moscow are harder to discern, but seem to be more about what he does not want  having Russia as a time-consuming geopolitical foe  than his so far vague desire to team up with the Kremlin to fight Islamic State.  Trump has hinted he may also push for a nuclear arms deal.  Putins wish list, by contrast, is detailed, long and the items on it, such as getting U.S. sanctions imposed over Moscows actions in Ukraine eased, are potentially significant for his own political future.  He is looking to be given a free hand in the post-Soviet space, which he regards as Russias back yard.  Specifically, he would like Trump to formally or tacitly recognize Crimea, annexed from Ukraine in 2014, as Russian territory, and pressure Kiev into implementing a deal over eastern Ukraine which many Ukrainians view as unpalatable.  The icing on the cake for him would be for Trump to back a Moscow-brokered Syrian peace deal allowing President Bashar al-Assad, a staunch Moscow ally, to stay in power for now, while crushing Islamic State and delivering regional autonomy.  For Putin, described in leaked U.S. diplomatic cables as an alpha-dog, the wider prize would be respect. In his eyes, a deal would confer legitimacy and show Russia was a great power.  But, like a couple where one side is more interested than the other, the expectational imbalance is starting to show.  Trump spoke by phone to five world leaders before talking to Putin on Jan. 28 as part of a bundle of calls. The White House readout of the Putin call was vague and four sentences long; the Kremlins was effusive and fifteen sentences long.  Nor does Trump seem to be in a rush to meet. Dmitry Peskov, Putins spokesman, said the two might only meet before a G20 summit due to take place in July.  Trump has good reason not to rush.  With U.S. intelligence agencies accusing Moscow of having sponsored computer hacking to help Trump win office, a deal would hand fresh political ammunition to Trumps opponents, who say he has long been too complimentary to the Russian leader.  A delay would have the added advantage of postponing a chorus of disapproval from foreign allies and Congress, where there is bipartisan determination to block sanctions relief.  For Putin though, in his 17th year of dominating the Russian political landscape, a deal, or even an early symbolic concession such as easing minor sanctions, matters.  Expected to contest a presidential election next year that could extend his time in the Kremlin to 2024, he needs sanctions relief to help lift the economy out of recession.  U.S. and EU financial sector sanctions have cut Russias access to Western capital markets and know-how, scared off foreign investors, and  coupled with low global oil prices  have exacerbated an economic crisis that has cut real incomes and fueled inflation, making life harder for millions.  Since Putins 2012 election, consumer prices have risen by 50 percent, while a fall in the value of the rouble against the dollar after the annexation of Crimea means average salaries fell by 36 percent from 2012-2016 in dollar terms.  Official data puts inflation at 5.4 percent, but consumers say the real figure is much higher, and fear of inflation regularly ranks among Russians greatest worries in surveys.  An easing of U.S. sanctions could spur more foreign investment, helping create a feel-good factor.  It would be a huge bonus if it happened, said Chris Weafer, senior partner at economic and political consultancy Macro-Advisory Ltd, who said he thought Putin wanted to put rebuilding the economy at the heart of his next term.  The economy matters to Putin because, in the absence of any more land grabs like Crimea, greater prosperity is one of the few levers he has to get voters to come out and support him.  With state TV affording him blanket and favorable coverage and with the liberal opposition still weak, few doubt Putin would genuinely win another presidential term if, as expected, he decided to run.  But for the win to be politically durable and for Putin to be able to confidently contemplate serving out another full six-year term, he would need to win big on a respectable turnout.  That, an election showed last year, is not a given.  Around 4 million fewer Russians voted for the pro-Putin United Russia party in a September parliamentary vote compared to 2011, the last time a similar election was held.  Although the economic benefits of a Trump deal might take a while to trickle down to voters, its symbolism could boost turnout, helping Putin prolong a system based on himself.  It would be presented to the Russian people as a huge victory by Putin, said von Eggert. It would be described as a validation of his strategy to go to war in Ukraine regardless of the consequences and to turn the country into Fortress Russia.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON/TOKYO (Reuters) - President Donald Trumps defense secretary is expected to underscore U.S. security commitments to key allies South Korea and Japan on his debut trip to Asia this week as concerns mount over North Koreas missile program and tensions with China. The trip is the first for retired Marine General James Mattis since becoming Trumps Pentagon chief and is also the first foreign trip by any of Trumps cabinet secretaries.  Officials say the fact that Mattis is first heading to Asia - as opposed to perhaps visiting troops in Iraq or Afghanistan - is meant to reaffirm ties with two Asian allies hosting nearly 80,000 American troops and the importance of the region overall. That U.S. reaffirmation could be critical after Trump appeared to question the cost of such U.S. alliances during the election campaign. He also jolted the region by pulling Washington out of an Asia-Pacific trade deal that Japan had championed. Its a reassurance message, said one Trump administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity. This is for all of the people who were concerned during the campaign that then-candidate, now-president, Trump was skeptical of our alliances and was somehow going to retreat from our traditional leadership role in the region.  Trump himself has spoken with the leaders of both Japan and South Korea in recent days and will host Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Washington on Feb. 10. Mattis leaves the United States on Feb. 1, heading first to Seoul before continuing to Tokyo on Feb. 3.  Trump singled out both South Korea and Japan on the campaign trail, suggesting they were benefiting from the U.S. security umbrella without sharing enough of the costs. In one 2016 television interview, Trump said of the 28,500 U.S. troops deployed to South Korea: We get practically nothing compared to the cost of this. Why are we doing this? Mattis, in his confirmation hearing, appeared to play down those remarks, noting that there was a long history of U.S. presidents and even defense secretaries calling on allies to pay their fair share of defense costs. But his visit to the region comes amid concerns North Korea may be readying to test a new ballistic missile, in what could be an early challenge for Trumps administration. Speaking with South Korean Defense Minister Han Min-koo ahead of his trip, Mattis reaffirmed a U.S. commitment to defend the country and provide extended deterrence using the full range of U.S. capabilities. Analysts expect Mattis to seek an update on South Koreas early moves to host a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, which, once in place sometime in 2017, would defend against North Koreas nuclear and ballistic capabilities. Still, a South Korean military official played down expectations of any big announcements during the trip, saying Mattis first visit would likely be an ice-breaking session for both countries. In Tokyo, Mattis is to meet Defense Minister Tomomi Inada, who has repeatedly said Japan is bearing its fair share of the costs for U.S. troops stationed there and has stressed that the alliance is good for both nations.   Japans defense spending remains around 1 percent of GDP, far behind China, which is locked in a dispute with Japan over a group of East China Sea islets 220 km (140 miles) northeast of Taiwan known as the Senkakus in Tokyo and the Diaoyus in Beijing. The trip also comes amid growing concern about Chinas military moves in the South China Sea. Tension with Beijing escalated last week when Trumps White House vowed to defend international territories there.  China responded by saying it had irrefutable sovereignty over disputed islands in the strategic waterway. What U.S. military people say is that considering the pace of Chinas military build-up such as anti-ship missiles and fighters, there are worries about Japans capabilities, said a senior Japanese defense ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - At the U.S. State Department, the dissent began building soon after President Donald Trump signed an executive order late on Friday to limit immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. Opposition mounted through the weekend as a draft memo criticizing Trumps policy was written up in Washington and circulated by email to U.S. diplomatic posts around the world, according to multiple officials involved in the effort. By Monday, two of the officials said they considered withdrawing their names from the document, fearing a backlash. On Tuesday, just 12 days into Trumps presidency, the memo with some 900 signatures was delivered to the State Department policy planning office and from there to other top officials, said one source familiar with the document.  Sources said this was an unprecedented number of names on a memo sent through the departments formal dissent channel. The memo is just one example of the alarm and, in some cases, resistance spreading within the federal bureaucracy as Trumps administration makes sharp policy turns while ignoring some of the agencies charged with implementation, according to interviews with more than 20 current and former U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity and in some cases asked that their departments not be identified. Still fearful of recriminations, one official said some diplomats discussed whether they could qualify for professional liability insurance, which would cover legal costs in the case of disciplinary action, through the American Foreign Service Association union. The White House did not respond to an email requesting comment.  Earlier, when the existence of the memo surfaced, White House spokesman Sean Spicer warned that anyone at the State Department who questioned Trumps immigration policies should either get with the program, or they can go. Elsewhere in the federal bureaucracy, officials have hastily saved scientific research and public information on climate change and other issues, fearing the new administration would strip it from their websites.  Officials have also set up alternative Twitter accounts to criticize the administration. Reuters could not verify the owners of the roughly 50 rogue accounts.  Other officials have begun debating whether to quit.Most of those whom Reuters interviewed said that, while the administrations policies concerned them, they are more worried that Trump might try to ignore legal and legislative restraints on presidential power. Trump upset many by signing his controversial executive order on immigration without consulting key agencies and members of Congress. When they try to ram through things that have foreign policy and national security implications, it demands consultation, said a career official who worked in a part of the government charged with implementing the immigration order. But there was no meaningful consultation, despite what they said. A career civil servant at the Federal Communications Commission said he was considering quitting, citing a fear widespread at the agency of being cut out of the decision-making processes. Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a Republican like Trump, said he learned about the immigration order only after the president had signed it. Corker said he talked with White House representatives on Sunday and believed they had gotten the message on the need for inter-agency coordination.  I would find it hard to believe that they on Tuesday dont understand that what they did on Friday could have been done in a much better way, he said.  Most new presidents, particularly Republicans, who favor limited government, have tussles with the federal bureaucracy. President Ronald Reagan fired 11,000 air traffic controllers, all federal employees, in 1981, early in his tenure, after they ignored his order to return to work. But Philip Wallach, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank, said Trumps apparent hostility to those who must implement his policies was in a different league.  There certainly is something about Trumps chip-on-the-shoulder attitude that makes it seem like hes itching for a potential long-term fight with the bureaucracy, rather than something he works to develop a smooth relationship with, he said.  To succeed with his economic reform agenda, Trump will need federal agencies, Wallach said. Thats going to require a lot of affirmative government work, not just smashing things up. Several government managers said they have advised their employees not to react so early in Trumps presidency. Some of the things Trump is doing are foolish and make no sense from a management perspective, said a career State Department official who supervises scores of civil servants. But Ive told my folks to be professional and stay calm  dont panic, the official said. What else can I tell them? Someone needs to be an adult. Otherwise, wed have chaos.  In a farewell speech to about 100 State Department officials on Tuesday, Thomas Countryman, the actingundersecretary of state for arms control and international security, called on colleagues to stay despite their concerns. We still have a duty - you have a duty - to stay and give your best professional guidance, with loyalty, to the new administration, he said. Because a foreign policy without professionals is - by definition - an amateur foreign policy. You will help to frame and make the choices.

Trumps executive order to temporarily ban refugees entering the United States and limit migration from seven Muslim-majority  countries has drawn widespread protest in Britain, and nearly 1.8 million people have signed a petition to stop his state visit, planned for later this year. But the YouGov poll found 49 percent of Britons believe the state visit should go ahead and that only 36 percent want it to be canceled. A state visit would involve lavish displays of royal pageantry and a banquet hosted by Queen Elizabeth. The invitation was conveyed by Prime Minister Theresa May when she visited Washington last week, just hours before the travel ban was introduced. Britons would not like to see a similar migrant ban introduced in the UK, however, with 32 percent saying they would feel appalled by such a move and 17 percent disappointed. Only 15 percent were delighted by the prospect of similar immigration restrictions in Britain, while 13 percent said they would be pleased. The petition to stop the visit will be debated in the British parliament on Feb. 20, although such debates are usually symbolic. May has stood by the decision to invite Trump. The poll was conducted between Jan. 30-31. In all, 1,705 people were asked their views on the state visit and 6,926 were asked about any immigration ban in Britain.

The deeply divided U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee on Tuesday agreed to send her nomination to the full chamber for a vote, the final step in the confirmation process.  But the committees executive session showed DeVos faces choppy waters ahead for a post for which there is typically little congressional debate or public attention. The chairman, Republican Lamar Alexander, acted as tie-breaker after all 11 Republicans voted for Republican President Donald Trumps pick and all 11 Democrats voted against. Two Republicans - Maines Susan Collins and Alaskas Lisa Murkowski - expressed grave misgivings about the charter school advocates limited experience with public schools. They said they voted yes only so the entire Senate can debate whether DeVos is the right fit. Murkowski said she may not support DeVos in the Senate vote. Democrats said the nomination was rushed, with DeVos providing answers they described as vague and noncommittal to hundreds of written questions only 24 hours before the vote.  After many of Trumps nominees sailed through their confirmations in recent weeks, the names currently before the Senate were meeting resistance. The Senates 48 Democrats only need to pull three Republicans to their side to reject DeVos nomination. Just nine nominees have ever been turned down by the Senate. Public opposition to DeVos is unusually fierce, said Mary Kusler, lobbyist for the National Education Association, a large union that said constituents sent 1 million emails and placed 40,000 calls to senators decrying the nomination.  It was the biggest public outcry over an education secretary that Kusler has seen in her career of more than 20 years, she added. NEA and the American Federation of Teachers, another major union, say they will keep up their anti-DeVos fight during the Senate vote and expect voters will also maintain pressure. Public opinion of DeVos wobbled after her Jan. 17 hearing, where she suggested allowing guns at rural schools to fend off bear attacks.  At two rallies on Tuesday in Chicago, several hundred protesters gathered to demonstrate against DeVos nomination.   I have one child in school, and my son will be (in school) in a little over a year, said Chicago resident Mara Tierney, who attended a rally with her 3-year-old boy. I want to do what I can to ensure DeVos is not confirmed. Old-guard Republicans like former first lady Barbara Bush defended DeVos as a lifelong champion of low-income children, literacy and giving parents more choice in education. Democrats, meanwhile, blasted the nominee for supporting privatization in ways they said hurt poor students, not understanding basic education laws and issues, and courting potential conflicts of interest through her investments.

Washington agreed on a deal late last year to resettle asylum seekers, mainly from Afghanistan, Iran and Iraq, held in Australias processing centers on remote Pacific islands in Papua New Guinea and Nauru. Under the deal, Australia would in return resettle refugees from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Providing details of the plan for the first time, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the deal covered many of the refugees held in the two offshore processing centers, although they must satisfy recently tightened immigration policies. The deal specifically deals with 1,250 people that are mostly in Papua New Guinea being held, Spicer told reporters in Washington. Part of the deal is that they have to be vetted in the same manner that were doing now. There will be extreme vetting applied to all of them, he said. Trumps executive order last week suspended the U.S. refugee program and restricted entry to the United States from majority-Muslim countries Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, casting doubt over the deal with Australia. Despite the restrictions, Trump assured Australia on Sunday the United States would honor its agreement to resettle the asylum seekers. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull dismissed speculation in domestic media that Trump had not yet committed fully to the deal. The Trump administration has committed to progress with the arrangements to honor the deal, Turnbull told reporters in Canberra on Wednesday. That was the assurance the president gave me when we spoke on the weekend, he said.     Australias hardline immigration policy is a contentious issue that has drawn international condemnation from the United Nations and other rights groups, but which remains popular at home and has bipartisan political support. Some 1,161 men, women and children remain in indefinite detention in Manus Island and Nauru as of Nov. 30, the most recent data from Australias Department of Immigration shows. Another 1,000 or so people are in detention in Australia, some of them asylum seekers transported from Manus Island and Nauru for medical treatment. It was not clear how many of these would be eligible under the deal with the United States. U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials have begun assessing the asylum seekers, although there is no timeline for resettlement. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Trump, who took office on January 20, called Gorsuch on Monday to inform him that he had prevailed among a handful of finalists to succeed deceased Justice Antonin Scalia on the high court. That decision set off a rapid and secretive process to get Gorsuch to Washington without alerting journalists and other Supreme Court watchers of the presidents selection. After Trump called the Colorado-based judge, a team from the White House counsels office flew to Denver and then drove to Boulder, roughly 45 minutes away, to meet with Gorsuch and his family. They met at a neighbors house to avoid detection.  Then the White House staff spirited him though a back farm road to a waiting military plane to transport him to Washington, White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters on Tuesday night in the White House East Room. Gorsuch stayed at a friends residence before being brought to the White House for the Tuesday evening announcement. The secrecy continued up until the last minute. When Trump, a former reality television star, entered the East Room, he came alone, addressing the cameras and the waiting crowd, which included Scalias widow, at a podium before calling on Gorsuch and his wife to come in. Trumps decision came after he narrowed a list of 21 candidates down to six, including Thomas Hardiman, William Pryor, Amul Thapar, Diane Sykes, and Don Willett. Then President-elect Trump interviewed Gorsuch, Hardiman and Pryor on Jan. 14 in his New York residence. He also interviewed Thapar. He finalized the decision recently, after considering all 21 candidates very deeply, said Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser and counselor to the president. White House counsel Don McGahn informed Hardiman, Pryor and Thapar that they had not been chosen, Spicer said.  The White House was determined to keep the presidents Supreme Court selection a secret and make the announcement of his choice a success after the botched rollout of his refugee executive order contributed to confusion and worldwide criticism last weekend. The strategy to get Gorsuch confirmed will kick off right away, Spicer said, with former Senator Kelly Ayotte serving as the sherpa to help steer the nominee through the Senate confirmation process.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""NEW YORK (Reuters) - Supreme Court nominee Judge Neil Gorsuch is known for questioning how far courts should go in deferring to federal agencies on interpreting the law, a view that could be important for U.S. companies and, perhaps, for President Donald Trump. Nominated by Trump on Tuesday to fill a vacancy on the nations highest court, the 49-year-old Gorsuch is widely viewed as a sharp-eyed jurist and a crisp writer who has the potential to be a persuasive voice on the court. In a recent case, Gorsuch took a dim view of a landmark 1984 high court ruling, Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council. Widely cited, the ruling directed judges nationwide to defer to agencies interpretation of laws that may be ambiguous. It is known as Chevron deference.  Last August, in a case over immigration rules, Gorsuch called the doctrine the elephant in the room that concentrates federal power in a way that seems more than a little difficult to square with the Constitution. Showing his willingness to tackle the issue head on, he added, Maybe the time has come to face the behemoth. If Gorsuch can persuade other Supreme Court justices to question Chevron deference, companies arguing before the high court against federal regulations might have a better chance on issues ranging from the environment to immigration. At the same time, broader skepticism of deference to agencies could have long-term consequences for Trump. The new president is moving swiftly to reshape the federal bureaucracy, appointing agency heads who could upend the legacy of President Barack Obama on emissions, health care and internet policy. The courts views on agencies agendas will be critical. The idea that President Trump of all people would be the one to choose a justice who might push the court to reduce the executive power is pretty ironic, said John Nagle, a professor at the University of Notre Dame Law School. If the Supreme Court were to overturn or limit the Chevron precedent, lower courts could become more active in deciding the ultimate meaning of a statute, making it less likely that an agencys view would stand, Nagle said.  It could make it more difficult for the Trump administration to defend some of its regulatory actions in federal court, said Case Western Reserve University School of Law professor Jonathan Adler.  Republicans in Congress, particularly when Obama was in office, frequently complained about Chevron deference. They have even debated legislation that would override it. The House of Representatives passed such a bill on Jan. 11, although it is unlikely to win approval in the Senate. Gorsuch is not the first judge to take aim at the issue. In 2015, the Supreme Court ruled against the Environmental Protection Agency over its regulations for limiting pollution from mercury and other toxic materials. At that time, conservative Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a separate opinion saying the governments position raises serious questions about the constitutionality of our broader practice of deferring to agency interpretations of federal statutes. While Thomas has argued the doctrine threatens the Constitutionally-mandated separation of the different branches of government, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy have said it may threaten individual liberties, said Andrew Grossman, a conservative lawyer who has represented companies challenging government regulations. Gorsuch may be the one to bring the court together on fundamental questions of administrative power that have sparked so much controversy and divisiveness in recent years, Grossman said. Some court-watchers say that in practice the justices are inclined to support executive actions that are in keeping with their own views. But an analysis of their votes carried out by Jack Beermann, a professor at Boston University School of Law, showed that such an outcome is not uniform.

What Trump is doing is un-American, Schulz said, adding that the United States like no other country in the world stood for enlightenment, democracy and freedom. If Trump is now driving a wrecking ball through this set of values, then I will tell him as chancellor: Thats not the policy of Germany and Europe, Schulz added. Germanys Social Democrats last week nominated former European Parliament president Schulz to run against Chancellor Angela Merkel in a federal election in September, and the surprise move has boosted popular support for the centre-left party. Merkel said on Monday the global fight against terrorism does not warrant putting groups of people under suspicion, adding Trumps order to restrict people from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States violates the spirit of international cooperation. Turning to Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Ukraine conflict, Schulz said that sanctions imposed against Russia could only be lifted after both sides had implemented the so-called Minsk peace plan. As long as the Minsk peace agreement is not fully implemented, the sanctions cannot be lifted. We must tell Putin very clearly that Russia is obliged to respect and defend international law, Schulz said. Schulz comments bring more clarity about his stance on Russia after some leading Social Democrats have voiced support for a partial lifting of sanctions as long as Russia is implementing some aspects of the plan.

Trump told them the government was paying astronomical prices for medicines in its health programs for older, disabled and poor people and said he would soon appoint a new U.S. Food and Drug Administration leader. Were going to streamline the FDA, Trump said in a statement, referring to the regulatory agency responsible for vetting that new drugs are safe and effective. The meeting between Trump and the pharmaceutical executives signaled a defusing of tensions that have kept drug stock prices in check since the presidential election. Shares of most of the group rallied on Tuesday following the meeting, even as the broader stock market slid. Trump is a populist above all else, and having these (drug) prices skyrocket, hes commented that under his administration, this is not going to happen, said market strategist Quincy Crosby of Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey. She said Trump was playing a balancing act between controlling prices and loosening regulations. I dont think the majority of Americans want all regulations lifted from drug makers. Attending the meeting were top executives at Merck & Co Inc, Johnson &, Celgene Corp, Eli Lilly & Co, Amgen Inc and Switzerlands Novartis AG <NOV N.S> as well as the head of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) lobbying group.  According to a transcript of the televised portion of the meeting, Amgen Chief Executive Officer Robert Brad way promised to add 1,600 U.S. jobs at his California-based biotechnology company this year.  Amgen clarified in an email that it currently employs around 20,000 people worldwide, including 12,000 in the United States, and said the 1,600 includes new staff as well as hires to address attrition.  Celgene, Lilly, Merck and Amgen said by email after the meeting that they were encouraged by Trumps focus on innovation, tax reform and the need for a more value-driven health care system. Lilly said discussion topics also included stronger trade agreements and removing outdated regulations that drive up costs and slow innovation. PhRMA echoed those points in its own post-meeting statement, adding that the policies, if enacted, would result in up to 350,000 new jobs over the next 10 years. Tax, deregulation - those are things that could really help us expand operations, Lilly CEO Dave Ricks said. Officials at Novartis and J&J did not immediately respond to requests for additional comment.  Shares of the six companies were mostly higher, for an overall gain averaging 0.7 percent, compared with a 0.4 percent drop in the broad S&P 500. The Nasdaq Biotech Index was up 1.2 percent, reversing earlier losses, and the S&P 500 health care index gained 0.6 percent.      We have to get prices down for a lot of reasons. We have no choice, for Medicare and Medicaid, Trump said, citing the nations government insurance programs for the elderly, the poor and the disabled. Trump also said currency devaluation by other countries had increased drugmakers outsourcing their production, and he called on the companies to make more of their products in the United States.  Foreign countries must pay a fair share for drug development costs, he added. Were going to end global freeloading.   The United States typically pays more for drugs than any other developed nation. Most Western European countries, as well as Japan, have government-run health care coverage under which drug prices are negotiated.  High drug prices have become a national issue during the past two years as healthcare costs have risen Trump spooked pharmaceutical and biotech investors by saying on Jan. 11, before his inauguration, that drug companies were getting away with murder on what they charged the government for medicine and that he would do something about it.

In his first major action since becoming acting SEC chair earlier this month, Michael Piwowar announced he has directed agency staff to reconsider how companies should comply with the rule and whether additional relief from its requirements is necessary.  Piwowars action comes just one day after President Donald Trump signed an executive order that aims to slash government regulations. The White House has said the order does not apply to independent agencies like the SEC. However, independent agencies often try to voluntarily follow the spirit of such orders. The conflict minerals rule requires manufacturers, from Apple Inc to General Electric Co, to tell investors if their products contain certain minerals from the war-torn Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is one of several SEC disclosure rules required by the 2010 Dodd-Frank law that Republicans and business groups have long sought to repeal, saying they force companies to furnish politically charged information that is irrelevant to making investment decisions. Another disclosure rule hated by many companies that was also in Dodd-Frank is the resource extraction rule, which forces oil and gas companies to disclose payments to foreign governments.  Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives are slated to vote on a measure to repeal the resource extraction rule on Wednesday. In that case, Republicans are seeking to repeal it under  the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to stop recently adopted regulations through a simple majority vote. The conflict minerals rule cannot be repealed through the Congressional Review Act because the law can only be applied to rules adopted since the end of May. However, SEC staff can issue interpretive guidance to scale back its requirements or, in a more aggressive move, staff can choose not to enforce it. Piwowar said the SEC will solicit comments from the public on whether SEC staff should update its guidance on compliance. The Dodd-Frank law also contains language which would let Trump order the SEC to temporarily suspend the conflict minerals rule for two years if it might harm national security. Piwowar did not ask the president to take such a step. However, he did raise some national security concerns posed by the rule, and said it has done nothing to help the humanitarian crisis in Africa.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - For seven years, the United States has fought to keep the euro zone intact, urging European officials toward action and supporting international bailout programs to keep the 17-nation currency union from cracking apart.  That appears to have changed less than two weeks into Donald Trumps new administration.  A sharp shift in tone toward Germany, casting the euro as fuel for that countrys massive trade surplus, has raised concerns that the U.S. presidents trade-centric world view may see the euro not as a geopolitical plus, but as another needless bit of multilateralism. While Trump has refrained from commenting directly on the euro, he praised Britains decision to exit the European Union as a great thing and predicted that others would leave the bloc as the result of an influx of refugees. In comments published in the European press on Tuesday, Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro said the grossly undervalued euro served as a currency for Germany alone, allowing the country to exploit the United States and others. On Capitol Hill, Treasury Secretary-designate Steven Mnuchin softened the traditional U.S. strong dollar mantra, suggesting that the dollars current strength may be working against what has become perhaps the administrations central economic priority: reviving U.S. manufacturing and exports. Framed narrowly, that could put the United States on a clear a collision course with Germany, the worlds fourth-largest economy and home to companies that rival top U.S. industrial giants, as it is with Mexico or China.  There seems to be this desire to go back to a divide and conquer style strategy where the U.S. negotiates against individual countries, said Douglas Rediker, executive chair of International Capital Strategies and a former U.S. executive board member at the International Monetary Fund.  To single (Germany) out when they dont have authority to manipulate their currency, requires you to make a leap - which is to say that We dont care that there actually is a common currency. We are going to take you to account. Monetary policy in the euro zone is set by the European Central Bank, and it is the ECBs money creation policies that have contributed to the euros recent decline in value.  Like the U.S. Federal Reserves quantitative easing, those efforts have been regarded internationally as a reasonable response to the regions dangerous economic weakness - not as an effort to cheapen the currency to gain a trade advantage.  The question is how far will the new administration go with this? said Jeromin Zettelmeyer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a former German economic official. Trump could, for example, try to tax German goods to offset any perceived advantage gained from a cheap euro, Zettelmeyer said. An import duty has already been suggested as a way to redress alleged currency manipulation by China. Trump seems to think that having a trade deficit with another country means that the other country is somehow stealing or at least getting the better deal, said Zettelmeyer. The first days of Trumps administration have touched off a wave of anxiety in Europe. European Council President Donald Tusk went so far as to list the new government in Washington among the chief external threats faced by Europe. Criticism of Germanys trade surplus, however, is not unique to Trump.  The Treasury Department under President Obama added Germany to a watch list because of its large trade imbalances. The U.S. trade deficit with Germany stood at $77 billion as of 2015, three times that of other European Union countries combined, and $20 billion more than the deficit with Mexico, one of Trumps other economic nemeses.   But for Obama officials, the aim was to get Germany to spend more and boost its imports of goods from the rest of Europe and the rest of the world. It was not to target the euros value and, by extension, the steps taken by the ECB to revive European growth more broadly. Partly under American influence, the Group of 20 nations, including China, has in recent years agreed to consensus language that countries would refrain from competitive devaluations.  They have also generally avoided criticizing each others central banks.

On Monday, the committee sent three other recently enacted rules on the environment, corruption and guns to the full House to axe under the Congressional Review Act, which has only been used effectively once, in 2001.  The Republican-controlled House is expected to vote to overturn all five regulations on Wednesday, and then hand them off to the Senate. Agencies cannot create a new rule to replace any part of an overturned regulation, and Democrats at Tuesdays committee hearing argued that House Republicans were closing off the possibility of enacting regulations that could be needed in the future.  They also pressed for more time to consider rolling back regulations that often took months and years to craft. What weve been doing today and yesterday ... I would characterize as mindless legislating, said Representative Jim McGovern, a Democrat from Massachusetts. I worry that this whole process is going to subject a lot of vulnerable people, and a lot of working people, as well as our environment to some pretty dark consequences. New Yorks Louise Slaughter, the committees senior Democrat, while talking about the methane rule during the one-hour hearing bluntly said: I disagree wholeheartedly with what youre doing. Democrats, though, have little power to stop the overturning of regulations. Only simple majorities in both chambers are needed to kill a rule. In the past, Republicans nullification attempts were met with veto threats by former president Barack Obama, a Democrat. Now, a fellow Republican occupies the White House, President Donald Trump. Critics of the methane rule say the regulation, which covers emissions from oil and gas operations on federal and Indian land, is not necessary. They cast it as a duplicative regulation that usurps state rights and slows down the distribution of natural gas through excessive red tape. Supporters, meanwhile, say that the rule keeps oil and gas companies from polluting the environment, brings in royalties to the federal government, and reduces wasted methane. Those wanting to see the pay-discrimination rule overturned have similar complaints, saying that other rules already cover the area and that requiring federal contractors to collect information on their employees will be expensive and time-consuming.

Chao tweeted: It is an honor to rejoin the extraordinary people of @USDOT and begin working to rebuild Americas infrastructure. The Transportation Department has a $75 billion annual budget and about 60,000 employees. It includes the Federal Aviation Administration, which handles air traffic control. Chao, the wife of Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the first Asian-American woman to hold a Cabinet position, also will have to decide whether U.S. fuel efficiency standards should be revised, as some automakers have sought.

AAA CEO Marshall Doney said the group firmly believes that significant, additional investments are needed to maintain existing infrastructure and to enhance the nations (transportation) system.

A senior State Department official confirmed the memorandum had been submitted to acting Secretary of State Tom Shannon through the department's \""dissent channel,\"" a process in which officials can express unhappiness over policy (bit.ly/2jOYW0y). White House spokesman Sean Spicer said on Monday he was aware of the memo but warned career diplomats that they should either get with the program or they can go.

Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee exploited Senate rules to delay until Wednesday a vote on Senator Jeff Sessions nomination to be attorney general. That job was in the spotlight after Trump fired the acting attorney general on Monday over her refusal to defend his executive order blocking nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. Democrats also boycotted a meeting of the Senate Finance Committee where votes had been scheduled on Steve Mnuchin to be Treasury secretary and Tom Price to head the Health and Human Services Department. Since at least one Democrat is required to be present for the committee votes to take place, no votes were held. Despite the delays, all three nominees are considered likely to be confirmed once their names are sent to the full Republican-led Senate. The White House, as well as Republicans on Capitol Hill, accused Democrats of slow-walking the work of the government. The people want change. President Trump is delivering that change. And the only response from Senate Democrats so far is to try to stall the core functions of our government, said White House press secretary Sean Spicer. When will the Democrats give us our Attorney General and rest of Cabinet! Trump said in a tweet. No wonder D.C. doesnt work! Senate Democrats were unapologetic, with their leader, Chuck Schumer, saying it was their obligation to thoroughly vet Trumps Cabinet nominees. And if it takes a little longer, they could be in office up to four years, and it makes eminent sense to get their views out, Schumer told reporters. The Senate has already confirmed several of Trumps picks for national security posts, and the chamber voted 93-6 on Tuesday to confirm Elaine Chao, wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, as head of the U.S. Transportation Department. Sessions closeness to Trump - he was the first senator to endorse him during Trumps presidential campaign - was clearly working against him as far as Democrats were concerned following several days of controversy over Trumps executive order on immigration. We saw last night that it is also the duty of our nations chief law enforcement officer to support and defend the Constitution when the presidents actions do not. The attorney general swears an oath to the Constitution, not to a president, said Senator Dick Durbin, a member of the Judiciary Committee, elaborating on his opposition to Sessions. The Judiciary Committee rescheduled its vote on Sessions for 10:30 a.m (1530 GMT) on Wednesday. Democrats on the Finance Committee said they were delaying votes on Price and Mnuchin because they wanted more information on Prices stock trades in an Australian medical company and reports that Mnuchins former bank, OneWest, used automated robo-signings of foreclosure documents, which apparently contradicted statements the nominees had made to senators.  Weve made clear that we need additional information to make these judgments, said Senator Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the committee. It was unclear when the committee votes would be held.

Trump last Friday banned travel into the United States by people from seven Muslim-majority countries, leading to protests, confusion and legal challenges. This is totally unacceptable, John Sigmund, whose sister, Johanna Sigmund, died inside the World Trade Center in New York on Sept. 11, 2001, told reporters on a conference call. It goes against everything we stand for as Americans. The text of the order specifically made reference to the hijacked plane attacks, which killed about 3,000 people. But the relatives who spoke on Tuesday pointed out that none of the Sept. 11 Islamist militant hijackers was from any of the seven countries named in Trumps order. Trumps order halted travel by people with passports from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days, and stopped resettlement of refugees for 120 days. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia, two from United Arab Emirates and one each from Lebanon and Egypt.  The White House has described the order as necessary to protect the American people from terrorist attacks by foreign nationals admitted to the United States. Sept. 11 family members said Trumps action would sow mistrust among Muslim Americans and hurt refugees from war-torn countries. Most of the relatives are members of September 11 Families for Peaceful Tomorrows, a group formed in 2002 that opposed the war in Iraq. I am actually sickened by President Trumps use of 9/11 in this executive order, said Terry McGovern, whose mother was killed at the World Trade Center. Dont use our loved ones, and specifically my mother, to turn away refugees. Not all Sept. 11 families may agree, however. Kathleen Ganci, the widow of a fire department official killed in the attacks, told The New York Times she supported efforts to restrict travel to ensure national security.

Kushner said he would step down as CEO of Kushner Companies, a family owned real estate company, and begin to divest himself of substantial assets after he was made a senior White House advisor to US President Donald Trump, his father-in-law. Mr. Kushner divested his equity interest in 666 Fifth Avenue, and has no role in the management or operations of the property, a Kushner Companies spokesperson said in an emailed statement to IFR. Mr. Kushners ownership interests were sold using a third-party appraisal for fair market value to a family trust, of which he is not a beneficiary, the spokesperson said. Neither Ivanka Trump nor her and Kushners children are beneficiaries to the family trust, the spokesperson also confirmed. When asked by IFR, Kushner Companies declined to give any detail about the sale price of the equity stake and declined to discuss any aspect of the outstanding debt on the property. Kushner bought the property for US$1.8bn in 2007 - the highest price ever paid for a single office building sale in the United States at the time, according to Kroll Bond Rating Agency - but it was last valued well below that level. The last appraisal, completed in 2011 as part of a debt restructuring, valued the building at just US$820m. Kroll, which said the building was 20% vacant as of July 2016, valued the property at US$982.1m. Kushner and his partners in 666 Fifth took out US$1.2bn of senior debt to buy the property, which was later packaged and sold into three CMBS deals. It is not clear what the divestiture means for the debt on the property. The senior debt was restructured in 2011 and extended to February 2019.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": "" (In this Jan. 30 story, corrects spelling of Sergey Brin in paragraph 24) By Roberta Rampton and Julia Edwards Ainsley WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump fired top federal government lawyer Sally Yates on Monday after she took the extraordinarily rare step of defying the White House and refused to defend new travel restrictions targeting seven Muslim-majority nations. It was another dramatic twist in the unusually raucous roll-out of Trumps directive that put a 120-day hold on allowing refugees into the country, an indefinite ban on refugees from Syria and a 90-day bar on citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The Friday night ban prompted protests and chaos at airports on the weekend as customs officials struggled to put the order into practise, and the fallout spread to U.S. markets on Monday,  where stocks suffered their biggest drop of 2017 and companies affected by the change spoke out against it. Yates said late on Monday that the Justice Department would not defend the order against court challenges, saying that she did not believe it would be consistent with this institutions solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right. Hours later, she was fired. The White House said Yates has betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States and portrayed her actions as political. Trump has argued tougher vetting of immigrants is needed to protect America from terror attacks but critics complain that his order unfairly singles out Muslims and defiles Americas historic reputation as a welcoming place for immigrants. Yates, an appointee of former Democratic President Barack Obama, was days away from being replaced by Trumps pick for the top spot at the Justice Department, Republican Senator Jeff Sessions, who is awaiting Senate confirmation. Ms. Yates is an Obama Administration appointee who is weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration, the White House said in a statement. The White House said that Dana Boente, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, was sworn in at 9 p.m. ET and would be acting U.S. attorney general until Sessions is approved. Boente said in an interview with the Washington Post that he would enforce the immigration order. There have been only a handful of instances in U.S. history of top Justice Department officials publicly breaking with the White House. The most famous example was in 1973, when then-Attorney General Elliot Richardson and his deputy resigned rather than obey President Richard Nixons order to fire a special prosecutor investigating the Watergate scandal. The incident, which became known as the Saturday Night Massacre, was a public relations disaster and is seen as a turning point in Nixons administration. The drama at the Justice Department is another sign of how hastily Trumps immigration order was developed and how little it was reviewed by the agencies now grappling to implement it. The White House said key government officials were briefed before Trump signed the order on Friday, but there was little coordination or consultation, resulting in confusion. Most State Department officials found out about it from media reports. Officials from the State Department circulated a draft memo of dissent on Monday, saying Trumps move would hurt Americas image abroad and inflame anti-American sentiment.  White House spokesman Sean Spicer dismissed the memo. These career bureaucrats have a problem with it? I think that they should either get with the program or they can go, he told reporters at his daily briefing. An internal Department of Homeland Security document seen by Reuters showed 348 visa holders were kept from boarding U.S.-bound flights this week, and more than 200 people came to the United States but were denied entry. More than 735 people were pulled aside for questioning by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers at airports, including 394 green card holders, who are legal permanent residents of the United States, the document said.  Trumps administration is granting waivers from the refugee ban to allow 872 people into the country this week - refugees that had already been cleared for resettlement in the United States and were in transit when the order came out. Tens of thousands of people protested Trumps order in major American cities and at airports on the weekend. Obama took the rare step of weighing in, saying through a spokesman that he was heartened by the political activism on the issue. Employees of Alphabet Incs Google in San Francisco, Mountain View, Seattle and other cities held protests. Backed by a sign that said We are a nation of immigrants, Sergey Brin, president of Alphabet, said he was outraged by the order. The U.S. had the courage to take me and my family in as refugees, he said in a YouTube video of his remarks. Federal judges blocked deportation of those detained under the order through the weekend, and more lawsuits were filed on Monday. The Council on American-Islamic Relations, the countrys biggest Muslim advocacy group, filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 people. Washington state filed a lawsuit, arguing that Trumps order violates the equal protection clause and the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Several other Democratic state attorneys general have said they are considering legal action.  It is an insult and a danger to all of the people of the state of Washington, of all faiths, Washington state Governor Jay Inslee, a Democrat, told reporters. Amazon.com Inc and Expedia Inc, both of which are based in Washington states Seattle area, are supporting the states suit. Amazon scrapped a business trip for a senior company lawyer who was born in Libya but has UK citizenship, according to a declaration filed in support of the lawsuit. Forty-nine of its employees were born in one of the banned countries, and seven new hires may need to be placed in offices outside the United States, it said. A declaration from Expedia said the order could impact the travel itineraries of at least 1,000 customers, costing it refunds as well as expenses to monitor how the order is applied and who exactly is affected.  The U.S. technology industry, a major employer of foreign workers, has been the most vocal corporate opponent to Trumps order.

Senior officials at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) interpreted the order to mean that lawful permanent residents - green card holders  who hailed from the seven Muslim-majority countries targeted in the immigration order would not face additional screening when they entered the country.  But they were quickly overruled by Bannon, who is Trumps chief strategist and oversaw the drafting of the executive order along with White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, a close ally of Bannons, the officials said. They were in charge of this operation, one senior DHS official said, adding that the experts were almost immediately overruled by the White House, which means by Bannon and Miller. A senior national security official described the pair as a tag team pushing Trumps key policies, including the immigration order which bars the entry of refugees and places a temporary hold on people from seven countries - Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Somalia and Libya. The inclusion of green card holders from those countries intensified opposition to an executive order that sparked legal challenges, protests at airports and sharp criticism from inside the Republican Party, including from some Trump allies. DHS officials say there was little or no White House consultation with immigration, customs and border security agencies on the immigration policy change, causing widespread confusion over how to implement Trumps order. A senior administration official said the order went through a review by key people at DHS and the White House National Security Council, and that several immigration staff on Capitol Hill were involved in drafting the order.  But officials said Bannon was the driving force throughout. The White House declined to comment on his role. Critics have accused Bannon of harboring anti-Semitic and white nationalist sentiments. Under Bannons leadership, his Breitbart website presented a number of conspiracy theories about Trumps Democratic rival in the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton, as well as Republicans deemed to be lacking in conservative bona fides. Bannon has ascribed his interest in populism and American nationalism to a desire to curb what he views as the corrosive effects of globalization. He has rejected what he called the ethno-nationalist tendencies of some in the movement. After becoming chief executive of Trumps election campaign in August, the former Goldman Sachs banker and Navy veteran helped lead him to victory over Clinton. He was then appointed by Trump as senior counselor and chief strategist - jobs not subject to U.S. Senate confirmation. He has been an almost constant presence by Trumps side in the first 10 days of the administration - in the White House for a meeting with American manufacturers, at CIA headquarters the day after Trump was sworn in, and in the Oval Office during British Prime Minister Theresa Mays visit. He appears to have greatly expanded his power in the first 10 days of Trumps presidency. Trumpgave him an unprecedented seat in the NSCs top-level meetings and potentially narrowed the role played by thedirector of national intelligence (DNI) and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Bannon has also asserted authority over almost all written statements from the White House and the NSC and has sent back documents for rewrites as he sees fit, one NSC official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.  Critics, including four senior U.S. intelligence officers, called the decision to formalize Bannons role at the NSC meetings a mistake, saying it risks politicizing decisions on national security. White House spokesman Sean Spicer on Monday defended Bannons inclusion in the NSC. Susan Rice, the former national security adviser in former President Barack Obamas administration, tweeted on Sunday: This is stone cold crazy. After a week of crazy.  Bannon and Miller are drowning out the opinions of more moderate advisers like White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, said a senior DHS official and two people in Washington who work closely with the White House on immigration and a range of other issues. One of those people and the DHS official said Priebus felt he had placed enough of his fellow moderate Republicans in key positions at the White House as a counterbalance to Bannon and Miller, but he has been frustrated at their outsized influence so far, especially on issues of immigration and national security.  The White House dismissed the views of the officials as gossip. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

An aide for the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions said on Tuesday that the panel will not officially schedule a hearing until the committee has received his paperwork from the Office of Government Ethics. The committee had planned to hold Puzders hearing on Feb. 7. Prior to that, the committee eyed three other possible hearing dates. Puzder, who is the CEO of CKE Restaurants, is one of several  of President Donald Trumps nominees who has faced particularly strong opposition from Senate Democrats and progressive groups. His nomination sparked protests by some CKE fast-food workers and the union-backed Fight for $15 movement to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. George Thompson, a spokesman for Puzder, said Democrats and special interest groups were obstructing President Trumps nominees and that Puzder is a proven job creator. Puzder has criticized an overtime rule championed by the Obama administration and opposes raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Last week, workers at franchised locations of Carls Jr. and Hardees, which are part of CKEs restaurant portfolio, filed a range of complaints, alleging wage theft and harassment, among other things. Additionally, some of CKEs racy advertisements featuring women in bikinis have caused Democrats to ask questions about how Puzder will address sexual harassment in the workplace. I like our ads. I like beautiful women eating burgers in bikinis, he was quoted as saying in a 2015 article in Entrepreneur magazine. He added that those ads did take on my personality. Experts say the repeated postponement of Puzders hearing and the delays over his ethics paperwork since he was first nominated on Dec. 8 are unusual and could be a sign of problems. It is a likely sign that the vetting is turning up problems and they are trying to figure out how to deal with them, said Matthew Miller, a partner at the crisis management firm Vianovo. The new delays come on the same day that the same committee voted along party lines to advance Betsy DeVos nomination as  education secretary to the full Senate floor.

A Homeland Security official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the waivers, noting that the refugees were considered in transit and had already been cleared for resettlement before the ban took effect. Refugees preparing for resettlement typically have severed personal ties and relinquished their possessions, leaving them particularly vulnerable if their plans to depart are suddenly canceled.  The waivers, granted by the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), came amid international protests against Trumps rushed executive order. Critics said the order in some cases was not clearly communicated to the agencies responsible for implementing it. It was not known if additional waivers would be granted, the official said. The document did not give the nationalities of the refugees who will be admitted into the United States.  Over the weekend, non-refugee visitors from seven majority-Muslim countries also targeted in Trumps executive order were detained, deported and in some cases blocked from boarding flights to the United States. The countries covered by the traveler ban were Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Somalia, Libya and Yemen.  The internal DHS document said that between late Friday and early Monday 348 visa holders were prevented from boarding U.S.-bound flights. In addition, more than 200 people landed in the United States but were denied entry, the document showed. More than 735 people were pulled aside for questioning by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers in airports, including 394 legal permanent U.S. residents holding green cards, over the same time period.  Trump said the executive order he signed on Friday was designed to protect the United States from foreign terrorist entry. The order stopped all refugee admissions for 120 days while government officials determine how to ensure that any refugees admitted do not pose a threat. The 872 refugees to be admitted this week, under the waivers, were screened using Obama administration procedures, which typically take two years and include several interviews and a background check. The DHS said on Sunday night that green card holders would be allowed to board U.S.-bound flights, but would be subjected to additional scrutiny upon arrival.  The public guidance from DHS also said some people from the seven majority-Muslim countries could be allowed entry to the United States on a case-by-case basis.     Congressional Democrats and some foreign countries, including key U.S. allies, put pressure on Trump on Monday over the executive order. Democratic Senators tried to force a vote on a bill to rescind the order, but were blocked by a Republican lawmaker. Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said she had 27 co-sponsors for the legislation. But under Senate rules it takes only one member to prevent a vote, and Republican Senator Tom Cotton blocked consideration of the measure. The Democrats leader in the U.S. Senate, Chuck Schumer, said he would bring legislation on Monday evening seeking to end the ban, although the measure stood little chance of being passed by the Republican-led Congress.

Shares of five of the six drug companies at the White House meeting with Trump were up more than 1 percent on average following the presidents remarks, compared with a 0.5 percent drop in the broad S&P 500. The Nasdaq Biotech Index was up 1.1 percent, reversing earlier losses, and the S&P 500 health care index gained 0.7 percent.      Attending the meeting were the CEOs of Novartis AG, Merck & Co Inc, Johnson & Johnson, Celgene Corp, Eli Lilly & Co and Amgen Inc as well as the head of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America lobbying group. Trump told the drugmakers that pricing had been astronomical. We have to get prices down for a lot of reasons. We have no choice, for Medicare and Medicaid, Trump said at the meeting, citing the nations government insurance programs for the elderly, the poor and the disabled that together are the largest U.S. purchaser of medications.    Trump also said currency devaluation by other countries had increased drugmakers outsourcing their production and called on the companies to make more of their products in the United States.  He added that foreign countries must pay fair share for drug development costs.  Were going to end global freeloading, Trump said.  Novartis  CEO Joe Jimenez, who is chairman-elect of the industry lobbying group, said last week that he wanted to talk to Trump about efforts to develop pricing models that would pay for clinical results rather than a flat price per pill, as well as plans to replace the Affordable Care Act, which is popularly known as Obamacare. Trump spooked investors in the pharmaceuticals and biotech sectors by saying on Jan. 11, before his inauguration, that drug companies were getting away with murder on what they charged the government for medicine and that he would do something about it.  That prompted the pharmaceutical lobbying group to unveil a new TV marketing campaign last week to improve its image by focusing attention on strides in research.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump signed an order on Monday that will seek to dramatically reduce federal regulations, but the policy will not apply to most of the financial reform rules introduced by the Obama administration. Trumps latest executive action will require that agencies cut two existing regulations for every new rule introduced and it will set an annual cap on the cost of new regulations. For the rest of fiscal 2017, the cap will require that the cost of any additional regulations be completely offset by undoing existing rules. But, the move does not cover independent agencies that crafted many of the rules required by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the White House said.     It also would not apply to rules mandated by statutes.  There will be regulation, there will be control, but it will be normalized control, Trump said as he signed the order in the Oval Office, surrounded by a group of small business owners. During a meeting with the business owners, Trump described the Dodd-Frank law as a disaster. He asserted that it was almost impossible now to start a small business and its virtually impossible to expand your existing business because of regulations. The creation of new U.S. businesses has actually climbed steadily since 2010, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. (bit.ly/2jnU32o)  White House spokesman Sean Spicer on Monday called the executive order a first step and said the administration would work with Congress to begin making changes to Dodd-Frank.          Implementing the new regulatory order may be difficult alongside the Trump administrations push to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, said Tom Bulleit, head of the healthcare practice in the Washington D.C. office of law firm Ropes & Gray.  As the Congress passes new legislation on healthcare, there will need to be new rules, Bulleit said.  Theres a great deal of regulation that is either expressly required by legislation or is necessary to make the legislation work, he said. Consumer groups and environmentalists criticized the push to peel back regulations, arguing that it would remove important protections for the public.    Major regulations are typically reviewed by the White Houses Office of Management and Budget (OMB) before they are issued. That review will continue under this new measure, but agencies will also have to identify what two regulations will be repealed to offset the costs of any new rule. Harvard Law School Professor Jody Freeman said the new order was entirely unnecessary, given similar cost-benefit regulatory directives made by past presidents and existing agency processes for reviewing older rules. Even it is fairly toothless in the end, it will be a weapon that OMB can use to harass agencies and slow regulation, Freeman said. The new order does not require that the repeal of the two regulations be done simultaneously with the release of additional rules.  This vests tremendous power and responsibility in the OMB director to ensure the presidents direction in how we manage this across the government, a White House official told reporters before the signing. Certain categories of regulations will be exempt from this new policy, including those dealing with the military and national security. The OMB director will also have the ability to waive this policy in certain instances.  Trump has tapped U.S. Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina to lead the OMB.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - White House press secretary Sean Spicer on Monday tried to tamp down the furor over President Donald Trumps reorganization of the National Security Council, saying nothing has changed. A comparison of Trumps order with documents from the Bush and Obama administrations, however, shows that is not entirely accurate. Unlike President Barack Obama, but like President George W. Bush, Trump did not make the U.S. Director of National Intelligence and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of staff regular members of the cabinet-level Principals Committee. But Trumps directive gives an unprecedented NSC role to a political advisor, Steve Bannon, who headed Breitbart News, a website and voice for the alt-right movement, a loose confederation that includes hardcore nationalists, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and anti-Semites. Critics of the move say it could allow domestic politics to influence national security and puts a political adviser on par with other Cabinet level officials. In his briefing on Monday, Spicer argued that identifying Bannon by his title was a move to show that the administration was transparent about who is attending top-level meetings. He said that David Axelrod, a top political adviser to Obama, attended national security meetings quite frequently. Axelrod disputed that, saying he attended early meetings under Obama only on Afghanistan-Pakistan policy. I was not a member of the committee. I did not speak or participate. I sat on the sidelines as a silent observer, he wrote on CNNs website on Monday.  A former top Obama administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, called the addition of Bannon an unprecedented politicization of foreign policy that exceeds even what hubris is the new normal. In many ways that is unprecedented, often time these discussions are analytical, very technical, and it is not a lot of politics in the room, said Shannon Green, who served on the National Security Council staff and is now a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Green said that there are few areas where the U.S. military and intelligence agencies do not have expertise and relationships with foreign governments that could be beneficial for non-military issues.      The Pentagon said it did not see Trumps reorganization as  downgrading the role of the Joint Chiefs chairman, who is the top U.S. military officer. The chairman and the U.S. intelligence czar are advisers to the National Security Council by law. Trumps directive says they will attend meetings of the Principals Committee where issues pertaining to their responsibilities and expertise are to be discussed. That is the same language used by Bush in a February 2001 order.  Defense Secretary James Mattis, when he engages with the National Security Council, whether it is with the full NSC or at a PC (Principals Committee), he intends to always have the chairman at his side when he is discussing anything that has anything to do with national security and our military, Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis said. In a statement the Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford said he would continue to provide his best military advice to the President and members of National Security Council.

Abe will visit Washington on Feb. 10 for the talks at which  Trump is expected to seek quick progress toward a two-way trade deal.  An early draft of the document, called U.S.-Japan Growth and Employment Initiative, listed five areas including  infrastructure. The document, which was read to Reuters, did not mention automotive trade, which Trump has targeted as unfair in an echo of complaints by Washington decades ago. The document left blanks for the numbers of jobs to be created and the scope of investment but a government source said several hundred thousand jobs could result. It also referred to the idea of buying dollar-denominated infrastructure bonds, a proposal that has been floated as a way Japan could take part in Trumps promised upgrade of U.S. infrastructure.  Japanese officials said they were still trying to assess just what Trump wants from Japan. In addition to singling out cars, he has also lumped Japan with China and Mexico as big contributors to Americas trade deficit. However, Japans share of the U.S. global trade gap has shrunk to 9 percent from more than half in the early 1990s. Automobiles and car parts account for about three-fourths of the overall U.S.-Japan trade gap, making it an easy target. In a phone call with Abe on Saturday, Trump reiterated his pledge to create jobs in the United States and asked that the Japanese auto industry contribute, the Nikkei business daily reported, quoting unidentified Japanese government officials. Abe is expected to meet Toyoto Motor Corp CEO Akio Toyoda this week, possibly on Friday. Mr. Trump has made a promise to Buy American, Hire American, said one former Japanese diplomat. Symbolically, autos are a very big player. The renewed focus on the automotive trade has some Japanese officials and media reminiscing - and not happily - about heated U.S.-Japan auto talks more than 20 years ago. A last-minute deal in June 1995 averted U.S. tariffs on Japanese luxury cars when Japans automakers crafted voluntary plans to boost purchases of American auto parts and expand U.S. production. That allowed the Japanese government to maintain its opposition to setting official numerical trade targets while letting U.S. negotiators also claim a win. Yoshihiro Sakamoto, the top Japanese trade bureaucrat in those talks two decades ago, said such plans - drafted behind the scenes by the auto industry and trade ministry - could be a model for addressing the situation now. Some experts pointed out, however, the ministrys clout had waned since those days. What America wants is investment, Sakamoto told Reuters. Toyota has come under fire from Trump for plans, announced in 2015, to shift production of its Corolla sedan from Canada to Mexico. Earlier this month, Japans top automaker said it would invest $10 billion in the United States over the next five years, the same as the previous five years. On Monday, Honda Motor Co Ltd and General Motors Co said they would jointly produce pollution-free hydrogen fuel cell power systems in the United States from around 2020. The companies said they would invest $85 million to add a production line at a GM battery plant in Brownstown, Michigan, and create 100 jobs. Boosting output in the United States, however, could force Japanese car makers to make tough decisions about reducing production - and jobs - back home. Central Japan Railway Company, or JR Tokai, has given the government estimates of how many jobs would be created by proposed high-speed Shinkansen railways in California and Texas and a high-tech maglev railway along the U.S. east coast, a JR Tokai spokeswoman said. She declined to release the figures. Abe, who is close to JR Tokai Chairman emeritus Yoshiyuki Kasai, has touted maglev or magnetic levitation as a dream technology that could link New York and Washington in under an hour.

Those ties were shaken last week when a planned summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto was canceled after the American said it was better to forgo it if Mexico was unwilling to pay for the wall. Trump wants a wall on the U.S. southern border to keep out illegal immigrants and says Mexico will pay for it. Mexico has flatly refused, making the issue a point of national pride. Pena Nieto and Trump spoke by telephone to calm tensions on Friday, and Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said the two administrations were in close contact and would talk this week. Dialogue has not broken off, he said. Its an extraordinarily important relationship for Mexico. While no date has been set for a new Pena Nieto-Trump summit, meetings between government officials are possible in the next few days, said Videgaray, who expressed confidence that the White House was modifying its view on payment of the wall. White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said on Sunday that payment for the wall was still under discussion, mentioning the possibility of a border tax and other fiscal measures. It could be on drug cartels, Priebus added on CBS Face the Nation. And it could be on people that are coming here illegally and paying fines. Or it could be all of the above. While cautioning he had no details of what those plans could involve, Videgaray was heartened by the comments.

The House Rules Committee sent to the full chamber three regulations enacted under former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, to ax. They were the Stream Protection Rule, the Securities and Exchange Commissions resource extraction rule, and one on gun buying. Republicans put as much urgency on limiting what they consider over-regulation that stifles economic growth as they do on overhauling the tax code and dismantling the Affordable Care Act, according to House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy.  This is the first time the Republican-led House of Representatives has targeted specific rules since convening on Jan. 3. Earlier this month it passed bills to limit regulatory agencies and Republican President Donald Trump is cutting regulation through executive orders. Under the law, Congress can use simple majority votes to stop recent regulations in their tracks. Agencies cannot create a new rule to replace any part of an overturned regulation. Timing in the law means any rules enacted in the final months of Obamas administration are eligible for axing. The law has been used effectively only once, in 2001. Both sides consider this week a test of its powers.  On Tuesday the Rules Committee will send two more regulations to the full chamber, which is expected to vote to kill all five on Wednesday and then hand them off to the Senate. Senate Republicans on Monday prepared to act quickly after the House vote, with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Environment Committee Chairman James Inhofe introducing companion measures on the stream and extraction rules. The Interior Department took years to craft the stream rule, hoping to prevent coal-mining waste from contaminating water sources in areas near mountain-top removal mining sites. Critics say it is unnecessary and goes too far, wiping out jobs and usurping state rights. The extraction rule is required in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law, but was only approved six years later this summer. It requires companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) to state publicly how much they pay governments in taxes and other fees. Opponents say it hurts U.S. energy companies, while human rights groups argue it reduces corruption. Meanwhile, the gun rule requires extra scrutiny of purchasers who receive Social Security benefits and also have a history of mental illness. Liberal groups are outraged by the rollbacks, but their traditional allies, Democratic lawmakers, have limited means to stop them in the Republican-dominated Congress. Those on the Rules Committee said important protections were being rushed to the chopping block and pleaded for hearings on the regulations, to no avail. This week House Democrats and activists are planning to rally the public, hoping to persuade Republicans to vote no.

Republican Senator Tom Cotton blocked consideration of the measure. It would have faced a difficult fight for passage in the Senate, where Trumps fellow Republicans hold a 52-48 seat majority.

The president argues that his action will protect Americans, but critics say it illegally singles out Muslims, violating U.S. law, and defiles Americas historic reputation as a welcoming place for immigrants. More than 160 Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives introduced legislation in that chamber to defund and rescind Trumps order.

The demonstration was part of a larger White Coats for Coverage effort organized by medical students across the country and came a day before the annual deadline to enroll in the Affordable Care Act (ACA), former President Barack Obamas healthcare law.   The ACA is not perfect, but pulling the rug out from under the feet of our most vulnerable patients is not the answer, Dr. Bruce Henshaw, a faculty member at Northwesterns Feinberg School of Medicine, told the group of around 600 people.  We will not stand idly by as our patients lose their rights. We will not stop today. We will write and call our representatives to ensure this doesnt happen. Students organized the event. Northwestern University spokeswoman Marla Paul said the school had no official position on the issue.  Photos on social media showed students rallying at numerous universities and cities.  Proud to join my Yale colleagues to collectively say #protectourpatients. Improve the ACA, DONT repeal it, Ryan Murphy, who shared photos of a rally at Yale University, said on Twitter.  Republican President Donald Trumps first executive order, signed hours after taking office, directed the federal government to scale back regulations, taxes and penalties under the ACA. Republican Representative Tom Price, Trumps nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, has said an overhaul of Obamacare will initially focus on individual health plans sold through online exchanges and the Medicaid health insurance program for low-income Americans.  Trump has said he wants to keep some elements of the program, such as allowing young adults to be covered under their parents insurance. He favors plans that use health savings accounts and sale of insurance across state lines. More than 8.8 million Americans were signed up for 2017 coverage under the ACA through HealthCare.gov as of Jan. 14, according to the site, up from around 8.7 million sign-ups as of Jan. 14 last year.    Arturo Salow, a second year student at Northwestern from Miami, Florida, urged people to sign up for ACA coverage before Tuesdays deadline, saying more enrollees would make a rollback more challenging for Republicans.  Id advise any patient to sign up immediately, Salow said. If they are going to take away coverage, lets make it as difficult as possible. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The panel will now vote on Mnuchins nomination on Tuesday at 10 a.m. EST (1500 GMT), Finance Committee Republican spokeswoman Julia Lawless said, calling Democrats objections to the scheduled Monday evening vote irregular. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer organized a candlelight protest on the steps of the Capitol to take place on Monday evening.  This delay will allow members to protest the presidents unconstitutional ban on Muslims entering the United States while voting on Mr. Mnuchins nomination little more than 12 hours later, said Rachel McCleery, a spokesperson for Senate Finance Committee Democrats. The move also could buy more time for some senators to reconsider their votes on Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs executive who later ran Southern California-based OneWest Bank. Senator Ron Wyden, the panels ranking Democrat, has sharply criticized Mnuchins handling of thousands of foreclosures by OneWest after he led a group of investors to buy failed mortgage lender IndyMac at the height of the recent financial crisis. Senator Mark Warner, another Democrat on the panel, on Monday announced he would vote against Mnuchins nomination. Throughout the confirmation process, Mr. Mnuchin has failed to adequately demonstrate that he will be a forceful advocate for innovative policies that will make the U.S. economy work better for the majority of Americans, Warner said in a statement, adding that he is not convinced that Mnuchin would robustly enforce post-crisis financial services restrictions. Republicans control a two-vote majority on the committee, so Democrats would need to persuade some Republicans to oppose Mnuchin to block the nomination. Nevada Republican Dean Heller, who faces a re-election campaign in 2018, subjected Mnuchin to tough questioning on OneWests foreclosures in Nevada during his confirmation hearing.

Trump on Friday announced a four-month hold on allowing refugees into the United States and a temporary bar on travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries. The decision provoked a widespread backlash in foreign capitals, documented in cables U.S. embassies sent to Washington. Typically, in the aftermath of a major foreign policy shift, a State Department spokesperson would appear on camera within days to take questions from reporters and defend or explain the U.S. positions on different issues. The State Department has not briefed since the day before Trumps Jan. 20 inauguration, however, and on Monday a department spokesperson said no one will appear at the podium until the U.S. Senate confirms a new secretary of state. At that point, we will update the press corps on our posture, the spokesperson said. Trumps desire to break with previous U.S. policies on issues including Israels construction of settlements, U.S. trade pacts, and cooperation with Russia suggests that State Department officials have not been given guidance on what positions they should articulate.     Until you know what policy youre advancing, it doesnt do you any good to get out there, said Richard Boucher, a former State Department spokesman who briefed reporters on the first weekday of the George W. Bush administration, in January 2001. The decision not to brief is a simple admission that they dont know what to say. The Senate is due to vote on Monday on moving forward on confirming Rex Tillerson, the former Exxon Mobil Corp executive whom Trump has tapped to lead the State Department.   If as expected the Senate votes to advance his nomination, a final confirmation vote would most likely take place late on Tuesday. The lack of briefings this far into a new administration is a departure from the three previous inter-party transitions. In 1993, 2001, and 2009, State Department spokespeople briefed reporters no later than Jan. 23, according to briefing transcripts stored in online archives.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Monday he would seek to ensure that women have access to late-term abortions in the state even if conservatives on the U.S. Supreme Court remove federal legal guarantees in place since the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling.  Cuomo, a Democrat who is considered a potential candidate for his partys 2020 presidential nomination, proposed an amendment to the New York Constitution that he said would preserve the status quo regardless of future Supreme Court rulings.  President Donald Trump, the Republican who took office on Jan. 20, plans to announce a nominee to the Supreme Court on Tuesday. That person, if confirmed, is expected to restore the courts conservative majority after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in 2016. The high court ruled four decades ago that the U.S. Constitution protects the right of a woman to have an abortion until the point of viability.  The court defined that as when the fetus has the capability of meaningful life outside the mothers womb, generally at about 24 weeks into pregnancy.  The court also recognized a right to abortion after viability if necessary to protect the womans life or health. If the Supreme Court were to overrule Roe v. Wade, as abortion opponents have long hoped, the procedure would remain legal only where state laws allow it.  In New York, a state law that dates to 1970 legalized abortion up to 24 weeks of pregnancy, and afterward only if the womans life is at stake, with no exception for health. The law is not enforced but could be if Roe v. Wade were overruled, abortion advocates say.  The states law was revolutionary back in the day because it legalizedabortion before Roe v. Wade, but is now unchanged, Donna Lieberman, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said in an interview this month. The state law is not as protective as Roe, she said.  Dennis Poust, a spokesman for the New York State Catholic Conference, which opposes abortion, predicted that Cuomos proposal would fail. How many abortions are enough? he said in a statement, noting New Yorks high rate of abortions. No one can credibly claim that access to abortion is under any threat in New York. There were 29.6 abortions per 1,000 women in New York in 2014, compared to 14.6 abortions per 1,000 women nationally, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit group that supports abortion rights. Cuomo told a Planned Parenthood rally in Albany, New York, on Monday that womens rights were under attack in Washington. As they threaten this nation with a possible Supreme Court nominee who will reverse Roe v. Wade, Cuomo said, according to a transcript provided by his office. Were going to protect Roe v. Wade in the State of New York. New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman issued a legal opinion in September making clear that federal court rulings supersede the states 1970 law. For a constitutional amendment to succeed in New York, majorities in the legislature must approve it twice, in successive terms, and voters must approve it.  Republicans control the New York Senate, although it is possible some Republicans might support such an amendment if pressured by constituents who favor abortion rights, said Costas Panagopoulos, a political scientist at New Yorks Fordham University.  Opposition to Trump may galvanize liberals into being aggressive, Panagopoulos said. People are scared, and that might compel them to action in a way that different circumstances might have them sitting on the sidelines, he said.  For years, states have planned for a day when the Supreme Court might overrule Roe v. Wade. Some 19 states have laws that could restrict abortion in that event, while seven have laws that would still guarantee the right to an abortion, according to the Guttmacher Institute.

Trump, set to fill the lingering vacancy on the nations highest court left by the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia in February 2016, said on Monday he will reveal his choice at the White House at 8 p.m. on Tuesday (0100 GMT on Wednesday), two days earlier than previously planned. Three conservative U.S. appeals court judges appointed to the bench by Republican former President George W. Bush were among those under close consideration. They are: Neil Gorsuch, a judge on the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals; Thomas Hardiman, who serves on the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals; and William Pryor, a judge on the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Since Scalias death, the Supreme Court has been ideologically split with four conservatives and four liberals. Another conservative justice could be pivotal in cases involving abortion, gun, religious and transgender rights, the death penalty and other contentious matters. Trumps appointee to the lifetime post could face stiff opposition from Democrats in the Republican-led U.S. Senate, which must confirm nominees to the high court. Some liberal groups have urged Democrats to do everything possible to block Trumps nominee. Democrats remain furious over Majority Leader Mitch McConnells refusal last year to allow the Senate to consider Democratic President Barack Obamas nomination of appeals court Judge Merrick Garland for the vacant seat, an action with little precedent in U.S. history. Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon vowed to pursue a procedural hurdle called a filibuster for Trumps nominee, meaning 60 votes would be needed in the 100-seat Senate unless its long-standing rules are changed. Trumps fellow Republicans hold a 52-48 majority, meaning some Democratic votes would be needed. This is the seat that Mitch McConnell and team have stolen from President Obama. I wont be complicit in this theft, Merkley said in a statement. We need to fight this Constitution-shredding gambit with everything weve got. On the Senate floor, McConnell had words of warning for Democrats, saying senators should respect Trumps election victory and give the nominee careful consideration followed by an up-or-down vote, not a filibuster. Trump, who took office on Jan. 20, said last week he would favor Senate Republicans eliminating the filibuster, a move dubbed the nuclear option, for Supreme Court nominees if Democrats block his pick. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said of Democratic opposition: Its all about politics. Its not about qualifications. The president has a right to have his nominees taken up. While not identifying the nominee, Spicer referred to the pick as he and said the selection came from the list of about 20 jurists recommended by conservative legal groups. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said this month it is hard to imagine Trump picking a nominee who Democrats could support, adding he would absolutely fight to keep the seat vacant rather than let the Senate confirm a nominee deemed to be outside the mainstream. Gorsuch, 49; Hardiman, 54; and Pryor, 51, possess strong conservative credentials. Gorsuch joined an opinion in 2013 saying that owners of private companies can object on religious grounds to a provision of the Obamacare health insurance law requiring employers to provide coverage for birth control for women. Gorsuchs mother headed the Environmental Protection Agency under Republican President Ronald Reagan before quitting under pressure in 1983. Hardiman has embraced a broad interpretation of the U.S. Constitutions right to bear arms and has backed the right of schools to restrict student speech. Gun rights activists are eager for the Supreme Court to expand on a 2008 ruling that found for the first time that there is an individual right to bear arms for self-defense in the home.  Pryor has been an outspoken critic of the courts 1973 landmark Roe v. Wade ruling legalizing abortion, calling it the worst abomination of constitutional law in our history. Conservatives are hoping the high court will back restrictions imposed on the procedure by some Republican-governed states. Last year, the Supreme Court issued its strongest endorsement of abortion rights in more than two decades, striking down a Texas abortion law imposing strict regulations on doctors and facilities in a 5-3 ruling. Pryor also joined a 2011 ruling favoring a transgender woman who said she was fired when she transitioned from male to female. The Supreme Court during its current term is due to decide a major transgender rights case for the first time. The justices have not yet heard arguments in the case, in which a Virginia public school district is fighting to prevent a female-born transgender high school student from using the boys bathroom.

The order, which Trump issued on Friday, banned immigration from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, and temporarily halted the entry of refugees. Chaos broke out as border, customs, and immigration officials struggled to act on the directive amid loud protests at major U.S. airports. The draft memo in the dissent channel, through which dissenting views are sent to the secretary of state and other top department officials, argued the policy would be counterproductive and damage Americas image abroad.  The end result of this ban will not be a drop in terror attacks in the United States; rather it will be a drop in international good will towards Americans and a threat towards our economy, said the draft memo seen by Reuters. The document argued the policy would sour relations with the  affected countries, inflame anti-American sentiment, and hurt those who seek to visit the United States for humanitarian reasons such as medical care. Moreover, such a policy runs counter to core American values of nondiscrimination, fair play, and extending a warm welcome to foreign visitors and immigrants, it added. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said he was aware of the memo and thought media reporting on the executive order had been blown way out of proportion and exaggerated. These career bureaucrats have a problem with it? I think that they should either get with the program or they can go, he told reporters at his daily briefing. Acting State Department spokesman Mark Toner, however, called the dissent channel an important vehicle to convey alternative views that Acting Secretary of State Thomas Shannon and the department as a whole value and respect. Separately, U.S. officials said the department had received multiple cables from U.S. embassies over the weekend reporting foreign dismay at Trumps executive order. Host countries expressed unhappiness, and U.S. embassies have questioned how to implement what homeland security and other officials said was a poorly conceived policy. A cable from the U.S. embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia, the country with the worlds largest Muslim population, reported     Indonesians had taken to social media to express outrage, and cited the order as an example of the Islamophobia of the new administration, said a U.S. official, reading from the cable. A cable from the U.S. embassy in Khartoum said Sudanese businessmen worried the new order would hurt their ability to attract U.S. business to Sudan in the wake of the lifting of U.S. sanctions a week earlier, the official said. The Obama administration took steps on Jan. 13 to lift a 20-year-old trade embargo against Sudan, unfreeze assets, and remove financial sanctions in what it said was a response to the countrys assistance in fighting Islamic State and other extremist groups. The U.S. embassy in Baghdad said many Iraqis viewed the order as an affront to Iraqs national pride (in a part of the world where pride and honor are often considered more important than concrete signs of support), the U.S. official said, quoting from the embassy cable. Iraq, which is allied with the United States in the battle against the Islamic State extremist group and hosts more than 5,000 U.S. troops, had no immediate comment on the order. The cable said there were 7,000 U.S. contractors associated with the U.S. mission in Iraq, 2,000 of whom are regular passport holders who could be affected if Iraq retaliated with reciprocal steps, the official said. Asked about the cables, a State Department spokesperson said: We will not comment on internal communications. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Governments from London and Berlin to Jakarta and Tehran spoke out against Trumps order to put a four-month hold on allowing refugees into the United States and temporarily ban travelers from Syria and six other Muslim-majority countries. He said the move would help protect Americans from terrorism.  In Germany - which has taken in large numbers of people fleeing the Syrian civil war - Chancellor Angela Merkel said the global fight against terrorism was no excuse for the measures and does not justify putting people of a specific background or faith under general suspicion, her spokesman said. She expressed her concerns to Trump during a phone call and reminded him that the Geneva Conventions require the international community to take in war refugees on humanitarian grounds, the spokesman added. Merkels sentiments were echoed in Paris and London; Terrorism knows no nationality. Discrimination is no response, said French Foreign minister Jean-Marc Ayrault, while his British counterpart Boris Johnson tweeted: Divisive and wrong to stigmatize because of nationality.  Along with Syria, the U.S. ban of at least 90 days affects travelers with passports from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, including those with dual nationality that includes one of those countries.  Trump said his order, which indefinitely bans refugees from Syria, was not a Muslim ban, though he added he would seek to prioritize Christian refugees fleeing the country.  The Arab League - whose members include many of the countries included in the ban as well as allies of Washington such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan - expressed deep concern and said the restrictions were unjustified. The government in Iraq, which is allied with Washington in the battle against ultra-hardline Islamist group Islamic State and hosts over 5,000 U.S. troops, did not comment on the executive order.  But some members of its parliament said Baghdad should retaliate with similar measures against the United States.  In Baghdad, influential Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr said American nationals should leave Iraq, in retaliation for the travel curbs. It would be arrogance for you to enter freely Iraq and other countries while barring to them the entrance to your country ... and therefore you should get your nationals out, he said on his website.   There was no immediate reaction to the curbs from Islamic State, although in the past it has used U.S. monitoring of Muslim foreigners to stoke Muslim anger against Washington. The Tehran government vowed to respond in kind to the U.S. ban on visitors from Iran, but on Sunday Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Twitter that Americans who already hold Iranian visas can enter the country. Unlike the U.S., our decision is not retroactive. All with valid Iranian visa will be gladly welcomed, Zarif said. Authorities in Sudan, which is also targeted by the ban, summoned the U.S. charge daffaires in Khartoum. They said the order sent a negative message, coming two weeks after Washington announced it would ease economic sanctions on the country. Trumps executive order on Friday took effect immediately, wreaking havoc and confusion for would-be travelers with passports from the seven countries and plunging Americas immigration system into chaos.       The Department of Homeland Security said about 375 travelers had been affected by the order, 109 of whom were in transit and were denied entry to the United States. Another 173 were stopped by airlines before boarding. Fuad Sharef, his wife and three children were among the first victims. They had waited two years for a visa to settle in the United States, selling their home and quitting jobs and schools in Iraq before setting off for a new life they saw as a reward for working with U.S. organizations. They were prevented from boarding their connecting flight to New York from Cairo airport on Saturday, detained overnight and forced to board a flight back to northern Iraq.  We were treated like drug dealers, escorted by deportation officers, Sharef told Reuters, likening Trumps decision to the dictatorship of former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. I am broken, I am totally broken. A 32-year-old Syrian man, Nail Zain, was among dozens of people at Istanbuls Ataturk Airport prevented from flying to the United States on Sunday. He told Reuters he was supposed to fly to Los Angeles, but officials said his visa was canceled. My wife and my son are in the United States. My son has American nationality. And we have been waiting for this moment for two years. Finally when I got the chance, they prevented me as a Syrian passport holder from traveling, he said.  He was later taken out of the terminal by authorities. Trump, a businessman who successfully tapped into American fears about militant attacks during his campaign, had promised what he called extreme vetting of immigrants and refugees from areas the White House said the U.S. Congress deemed high risk.  He said on Saturday of his order: Its working out very nicely. You see it at the airports, you see it all over.      The travel curbs, however, also drew criticism from several other countries around the globe.  In Jakarta, Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said the Muslim-majority nation deeply regretted Trumps plans for extreme vetting of people from some Muslim countries. Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni said open society, plural identity, no discrimination were the pillars of Europe, while the Danish, Swedish and Norwegian governments also registered their opposition. Danish foreign minister Anders Samuelsen tweeted: The U.S. decision not to allow entry of people from certain countries is NOT fair. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his country welcomed those fleeing war and persecution, even as Canadian airlines said they would turn back U.S.-bound passengers to comply with an immigration ban on people from seven Muslim-majority countries. To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada, he tweeted.

Pre-clearance duties are carried out by U.S. officials who have been carrying out the four-month hold Trump put on allowing refugees into the United States and temporary barring of travelers from Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen, Libya, Somalia and Sudan, the U.S. Embassy in Dublin said.

Netanyahu has been harshly critical of the deal that six world powers including the United States under president Barack Obama struck with Iran to curb its nuclear program in return for an end to multilateral sanctions. Iran is Israels avowed enemy and Israel argues that the agreement fails to prevent Iranian weapons posing a threat to its very existence. During the U.S. election campaign, Trump called the pact a disaster and the worst deal ever negotiated, though he has also said it would be hard to overturn an agreement enshrined in a U.N. resolution. In a statement on his personal Twitter account, around the same time the White House announced his Feb. 15 visit, Netanyahu said: Iran again launched a ballistic missile.

In my upcoming meeting with President Trump I intend to bring up the renewal of sanctions against Iran, Netanyahu said. Irans aggression cannot be left without a response.  The Obama administration said Irans ballistic missile tests had not violated the nuclear agreement, but Trump has said he will stop Tehrans missile program. Under the U.N. resolution approving the nuclear deal, Iran is called upon to refrain from work on ballistic missiles designed to deliver nuclear weapons for up to eight years. Critics of the deal have said the language is ambiguous and does not make compliance obligatory, while Tehran says the missiles it has tested are not specifically designed to carry nuclear warheads.

Ebell is the director of global warming and international environmental policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a  U.S. conservative think tank, and helped to guide the EPAs transition after Trump was elected in November until he was sworn in on Jan. 20. Trump, a climate skeptic, campaigned on a pledge to boost the U.S. oil and gas drilling and coal mining industries by reducing regulation. He alarmed nations that backed the 2015 Paris agreement to cut greenhouse gases by pledging to pull the United States out of the global deal agreed by nearly 200 countries. However, Trump told the New York Times in November that he had an open mind on the agreement. Trumps administration has asked the EPA to halt all contracts, grants and interagency agreements pending a review, sources said. The U.S. will clearly change its course on climate policy. Trump has made it clear he will withdraw from the Paris Agreement. He could do it by executive order tomorrow or he could do it as part of a larger package, Ebell told reporters in London on Monday. The top energy official for the European Union, meanwhile, said he hoped that Trump would stick to the Paris deal. I wouldnt hide that in discussion with our partners; there is a lot of anxiety over future U.S. policies, said European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic, who was a key broker in clinching Paris agreement. If the (U.S) administration decides to go in a different direction, I think sooner or later they will have to come back to the realization that climate change is happening.     The timing of any action by Trump is difficult to predict because government departments are still in transition, Ebell said, adding that he had not met Trump in person.  Any country wanting to pull out of the Paris agreement after ratifying it has to wait four years. A source on Trumps transition team said last year that there were speedier alternatives, such as sending a letter withdrawing from the 1992 international framework accord that is the parent treaty of the agreement; voiding U.S. involvement in both in a years time; or issuing a presidential order simply deleting the U.S. signature from the Paris accord. Ebell said the cleanest way would be to withdraw from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change itself. Whether the U.N. secretariat wants the U.S. to continue to have a seat at the table is up to them. I dont think Trump cares about that. The people who elected him would prefer not to have a seat at the table, Ebell said. Trump appointed Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, who has led 14 lawsuits against the EPA, as the agencys administrator, though a vote on his nomination has not been scheduled. The President has also drawn heavily from the energy industry lobby and pro-drilling think tanks to build its landing team for the EPA, according to a list of the newly introduced 10-member team seen by Reuters on Monday. Ebell also said he thought the political make-up of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which reviews applications for the construction and operation of natural gas pipelines, will change dramatically under Trump. Given the way the campaign went, I think you will see very quick executive action to expedite LNG (liquefied natural gas) terminals and pipelines, he said.

Your decision will do nothing. Attacks will come at you from inside America, from Americans born in America with American parents and grandparents, one Islamic State supporter posted on Telegram, an encrypted messaging app. In a move he said would help protect the United States from terrorists, Trump signed an order on Friday suspending the entry of people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for at least 90 days. Admission of all refugees was halted for four months, and for Syrians indefinitely. The sweeping travel curbs took effect immediately, wreaking havoc for would-be travellers with passports from the seven countries and prompting an international outcry. Islamic State, which has been fighting military assaults on several fronts in its heartlands of northern Syria and Iraq, has made no formal comment on Trumps ban. But some sympathisers took to social media to pour scorn on immigration restrictions they said would serve Islamic States cause.  Trump bans Muslims from entering America and kills them in Yemen, Iraq and Syria, then threatens them ... the wretch does not know he presents an invaluable service to Islamic State, a supporter calling himself Salem al-Mosuly wrote on Twitter.  An Islamist channel on the messaging app Telegram called Scholars of Haq, monitored by U.S. monitoring service SITE, asked whether Trumps policies meant he was currently the best caller to Islam - someone who attracts new believers. Of the first 48 users to respond, 34 answered that he was, according to SITE. SITE quoted one respondent, Abu Magrebi, as saying: What Trump has done has clearly revealed the truth, and harsh reality behind the American governments hatred towards Muslims. What is Trump doing to his country? He just become president and already people (are) protesting against his policy, and worldwide countries criticising him. Trump will bring American down God willing, Abu Magrebi wrote in another post monitored by SITE. By Monday morning, the Scholars of Haq channel had been taken down, along with several other channels on which Islamist militants had posted responses on Sunday. Other Islamic State supporters mocked an order issued by Trump on Sunday requiring his joint chiefs of staff give him a plan, in the next 30 days, to defeat the militant group.

Waterboarding, in which a victim is subjected to simulated drowning to force them to confess or divulge information, was used by the CIA on three suspected militants detained in secret foreign prisons during President George W.

President Donald Trumps executive order bans travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries including Iran for three months, and there is little certainty of what will happen after that. Many of the students have spent their families life savings to pay for an American higher education, which they hope will be a ticket to a well-paid job in the West or Iran.   Now they fear if they leave the country, they will not be allowed back in. They also do not know what status they will have after the three months are up, and whether they will be allowed to study, live or work in the United States.  Amin Amouhadi, 32, studies at the University of Georgia. His girlfriend, who is also Iranian, is about to finish her PhD in Canada. We were planning to get married in a month and move in together but the current ban and its possible consequences have put the future of all our plans in jeopardy, he told Reuters. I might quit my PhD program, (and) try to find a university in Canada to apply for. I cant think of any other plan. The United States is the most popular destination for Iranians studying abroad, despite decades of hostility between the two countries. The trend goes right to the top; Iranian President Hassan Rouhanis cabinet boasts more U.S. doctorates than did the cabinet of Trumps predecessor Barack Obama.   About 8,700 Iranian students were at U.S. universities in 2014, a fifth of the estimated 50,000 Iranians studying abroad, according to the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. More than 3,000 Iranian students have received PhDs from American universities in the past three years, over 7,000 U.S. academics including 40 Nobel Laureates said in a petition against the order signed by Trump on Friday. They said the ban could lead to the departure of many talented individuals.  Mohammadreza Jalaeipour, a post-doctorate student at Harvard University, has canceled a study visit to Oxford University in Britain because he was afraid he would not be able to return. The 34-year-old said he was not hopeful of extending his studies in another American university or receiving a visa for a job in the United States. This discriminatory and inhumane order is targeted to harm Iranian society. It shows that the U.S. government is dishonest when it says they have no problem with the Iranian people and they are only against the Iranian government, he said. Medical students could be among the hardest hit. Roozbeh Esfandiari is an Iranian who studied medicine in the United States before gaining a job as a researcher at Harris County psychiatric center in Houston.  He said U.S. medicine school qualifications could not be easily transferred to other countries, so it would be a major blow for Iranian graduates if they were unable to work in the United States after several years of study.   This news (Trumps order) is a headache for Iranian doctors applying for residency, he said. The Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates said on its website that it was aware of the executive order and was evaluating the potential impact on international medical students and graduates.   Even before Trumps order, the road to American higher education has always been a tough one for Iranians. Since there is no U.S. embassy in Iran, students must travel to embassies or consulates in other countries to apply, which can cost them thousands of dollars. Student visas can take many months to secure. Because of security concerns, Iranians can face background stiff checks. Zahra Razavi, a computer science student at the University of Rochester, said her husband had applied for a U.S. visa several times under the Obama administration, with no success. The Trump order has crushed their lingering hopes of living together in the United States, she added. This disaster has caused depression and deep anxiety in me. Its impossible to continue this way. I have no choice but to say goodbye to my dreams and quit my studies. Shirin Sajadi, an Iranian psychotherapist in Boston, wants to help shell-shocked students from her homeland by offering them free psychotherapy sessions.  Theres a sense of facing crisis and the need to make sense of the chaos surrounding us, she told Reuters.  Many immigrants have come to this country when they had nothing but hope for a better life. Theyve worked hard, played by the rules and hoped to succeed. But now that hope is gone. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The relaxed reaction among the kind of voters who drove Trumps historic upset victory - working- and middle-class residents of Midwest and the South - provided a striking contrast to the uproar that has gripped major coastal cities, where thousands of protesters flocked to airports where immigrants had been detained. In the St. Louis suburb of Manchester, Missouri, 72-year-old Jo Ann Tieken characterized the president as bringing reason into an overheated debate.  Somebody has to stand up, be the grown up and see what we can do better to check on people coming in, she said. Im all for everybody to stop and take a breath  Just give it a chance.  By executive order on Friday, Trump banned immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries  Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen  and temporarily halted the entry of refugees. In the electoral strongholds for Trump, residents seemed nonplussed about the uproar flashing across their television screens. They shrugged off concerns about botched execution, damage to foreign relations and legal challenges across the country.  In New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and other cities, Trumps action set off an outpouring of anger.  House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, evoked an image of the Statue of Liberty weeping. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York teared up himself on camera as he seethed over the mean-spirited and un-American immigration ban. Veterans in government agencies, including the Homeland Security and State departments, blasted Trumps team for what they called slipshod planning and scant interagency communication, criticism the White House rejected.  At airports, security officials also struggled to consistently enforce vague rules.  But allegations of operational or administrative blunders may do little to dampen enthusiasm for a president who rose to power on a populist and protectionist platform, political analysts said.  Louise Ingram, a 69-year-old retiree from Troy, Alabama, said she forgave the new administration a few glitches, such as widespread confusion over treatment of green card holders, as it moved to protect U.S. citizens from attacks. Im not opposed to immigrants, she said. I just want to make sure they are safe to come in.  A senior Trump administration official said political considerations had little to do with the executive orders. They rather represent a reaction to the 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, California; the Boston Marathon bombing; and multiple attacks by radicalized groups in Europe.  The reality is that the situation that exists today in parts of France, Germany and parts of Belgium is not a situation that we want replicated inside the United States, one official told Reuters. Candace Wheater, a 60-year-old retired school cafeteria worker from Spring Lake, Michigan, also referenced the attacks in Brussels and Paris.  Look at whats happening in Europe, she said. I dont dare travel there, out of fear. Steve Hirsch, 63, from Manassas, Virginia, drove to Washingtons Dulles airport on Sunday to pick somebody up, rather than to protest as hundreds of others did. He said he supported Trumps order. A country is not a country if it doesnt have borders, he added. He lauded Trumps actions as a calculated step toward the larger goal of tightening border security. He probably went as far as he thought he could, Hirsch said. You cant ban everybody in the world, but I think its prudent considering the conditions in certain places in the world. Trent Lott, a former Senate Republican leader from Mississippi who is now a lawyer in Washington, D.C., said the orders made sense to working-class Americans in the real world.  Out in the rest of the country, people are excited to see the president moving forward with securing the border, he said. University of Virginia political science professor Larry Sabato agreed that the weekend protests over the executive orders would not hurt Trump politically. His base is as firm as ever, he said. What hes lost in the very early polls is the Republicans who were never Trumpers and ended up voting for Trump. Trump opponents have succeeded in winning some early court decisions that could undermine the practical impact of his executive orders, but Sabato said his base would perceive those as attacks from liberal elites.  Trump could eventually lose support if he fails to keep promises important to regions that supported him, such as delivering jobs to the so-called Rust Belt, the Midwestern states dotted by dying factory towns.  Whatever Trump ultimately accomplishes, his election has ushered in a new extreme of political polarization to an already deeply divided country.  I just have not found a single person who has any neutrality at all about Donald Trump, Sabato said. In Baton Rouge, Louisiana, 40-year-old teacher Trista Carles said she had been ordered to keep her views about Trump out of the classroom.  We were told to be Switzerland, she said. Were not allowed to take any sides or views.  She has her own opinions, of course, and said she appreciated that Trump, in his blunt way, gave voice to them with no sugar-coating.  I think its just too easy to get into our country and stay illegally, she said. I feel like he is going to  to the best of his abilities  make a lot of things he said happen.

Loomis and two other attendees said Trump seemed receptive to Loomiss concerns that federally monitored police reforms introduced during the Obama administration in some cities in response to complaints of police bias and abuse are ineffective and impose an onerous burden on police forces.  Trump, Loomis said, was taken aback by the waste of money when the union chief told him that federal monitors overseeing his citys police department earned $250 an hour - a standard salary for the position.  I think hes going to have a more sensible approach to rising crime rates, Loomis said of now President Trump. What I got from the meeting was that Donald Trump is going be a very strong supporter of law and order. Emboldened by Trumps election, some of the countrys biggest police groups want to renegotiate consent decrees agreed to under President Barack Obama, the police labor groups said in interviews. Consent decrees are agreements between a police force and the Justice Department that can prescribe changes to use of force, recruiting, training and discipline. They are enforced by a federal court with the oversight of court-appointed monitors. Currently 14 police departments, including Seattle and Miami, are operating under the decrees. The police groups want to discuss the decrees with Jeff Sessions, Trumps designee for attorney general who has voiced criticism of them, although any renegotiation would be legally complicated because all parties as well as a federal judge must approve any changes. There are certainly decrees that are inartfully applied that wed like to see revisited, said Jim Pasco, the head of the Fraternal Order of Police, the nations largest police union with 330,000 members. It endorsed Trump in September and has worked with Sessions, a Republican senator from Alabama, for years while lobbying Congress for pro-police policies. Weve always found him a man whos willing to listen to alternatives to a previously charted course, Pasco said of Sessions. Civil rights groups are alarmed at the possibility that the decrees could be unraveled, saying they have been an important tool for the government to try to address issues like excessive use of force by police in Baltimore and an officer shooting in Ferguson, Missouri that led to nationwide protests.  Trump officials did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the meeting with Loomis. While Trump has not publicly commented on consent decrees, he has expressed strong support for police departments and unions, and on Jan. 20 the White House said he wants to end the dangerous anti-police atmosphere in America. There have been questions by police and conservative politicians over the effectiveness of the consent decrees, which give the Justice Department power to obtain court orders imposing reforms on police forces that routinely violate civil rights through practices such as unlawful stops and seizures, racial discrimination, and illegal uses of force. The federal program was authorized by Congress in 1994 in the aftermath of riots in Los Angeles sparked by the police beating of Rodney King. Some police unions complain the decrees stigmatize police and impose overly restrictive limits on use of force. They also chafe at what they see as misguided federal prescriptions to local problems and have fought the reforms in court.  A reform agreement that the Justice Department negotiated with the New Orleans police department in 2013, for instance, has been extraordinarily expensive to implement, said Donovan Livaccari, the lawyer for the Louisiana Fraternal Order of Police. The city of New Orleans is footing the bill. The Obama administration negotiated 24 reform agreements with law enforcement agencies during Obamas eight years in office after finding patterns of excessive force, racial bias, poor supervision and other issues, more than double the 11 agreements reached under the previous Bush administration.  Vanita Gupta, the last Obama-appointed head of the Justice Departments civil rights division, which investigates and recommends reforms for police departments, defended the use of consent decrees in an interview, saying they are apolitical ways of improving public safety and making policing more effective.  Bill Johnson, head of the National Association of Police Organizations, which represents about 241,000 officers, said he expects local police associations to examine existing consent decrees to see whether the Justice Department under Obama overstepped in imposing any measures.  Some police union officials say they have been encouraged by comments by Sessions, who has said that federal inquiries smear police departments and undermine respect for officers.  Under Attorney General Sessions, itll be more, Okay, theres a problem, lets craft an agreement as best we can and cure it, and then move onto the next thing, Johnson said.  Union officials said they expect the Trump administration to initiate and reach fewer binding reform agreements with police departments, and they hope Sessions will work with them to try to re-negotiate some of those existing agreements. Sessions said in his confirmation hearing on Jan. 10 that he wouldnt commit that there wouldnt be any changes to existing consent decrees when he becomes attorney general if police departments show improvement before they have fully complied with the terms of the decree.  A Trump transition official said Sessions would not comment on his testimony until after the Senate votes on his appointment. That vote is not expected until February. Not all union leaders agree that the decrees costs outweigh the benefits.  Sean Smoot, who directs the Police Benevolent & Protective Association of Illinois and serves as a monitor for the Cleveland police reform agreement, said the federal inquiries prompt cities to hire more cops and invest in better equipment. The decrees have had mixed results. Reforms in some cities, such as Los Angeles, have resulted in higher public satisfaction with police and declines in reports of police use of force. In other places, such as Ferguson, the city has missed multiple deadlines for implementing reforms required by its decree.  Civil rights advocates in Chicago say that given Trumps law and order platform they fear his administration will neglect the Justice Departments findings from a 13-month-long investigation into the police force.  Issued in the last days of the Obama administration, the Justice Departments Jan. 13 report found that Chicago police routinely used excessive force and violated the constitutional rights of residents, particularly minorities. City officials signed an agreement to negotiate a consent decree. But with Trump in the White House, its not clear where the leverage is going to come from for the reforms, said Jamie Kalven, founder of the Invisible Institute, a nonprofit group which advocates for police transparency.  The White House did not respond to a request for comment about Kalvens concerns. Jonathan Smith, the Obama-appointed former chief of special litigation in the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division, said he is confident that most agreements reached during the Obama era will remain intact because they are overseen by judges who are committed to their implementation.  In Cleveland, for instance, the judge who oversees the reform agreement that Loomiss union is objecting to recently rejected any efforts to renegotiate it.

Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma spoke after U.S. President Donald Trumps executive order halted travel by people with passports from Libya, Somalia, Sudan and four other Middle East nations for 90 days, and stopped refugee resettlement for 120 days. We are entering very turbulent times, Dlamini-Zuma told African leaders at the start of a summit in the 54-nation blocs headquarters in the Ethiopian capital. The very country to which many of our people were taken as slaves during the transatlantic slave trade has now decided to ban refugees from some of our countries. What do we do about this? Indeed, this is one of the greatest challenges to our unity and solidarity, the AU Commission chief added. Even before the travel ban was announced last week, African capitals had watched the transition from Barack Obamas administration to Trump with some concern, fearing his focus on America first could push trade and other ties with the continent down the U.S. list of priorities. The new U.N. secretary-general, Antonio Guterres, also hinted at unease about the U.S. administrations actions in his address at the summit, without mentioning Trump or the United States. African nations are among the worlds largest and most generous hosts of refugees. African borders remain open for those who need protection, when so many borders are being closed even in some of the most developed countries in the world, said Guterres, who took over at the U.N. helm this month.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Donald Trumps order to restrict people from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States sparked confusion and anger on Saturday after immigrants and refugees were kept off flights and left stranded in airports. In his most sweeping decision since taking office a week ago, Trump, a Republican, put a four-month hold on allowing refugees into the United States and temporarily barred travelers from Syria and six other countries. Civil rights and faith groups, activists and Democratic politicians were furious and vowed to fight the order. Capping a day of confusion and chaos and protests in several airports across the country, a federal judge in Brooklyn, New York, granted a temporary reprieve. The American Civil Liberties Union successfully argued for a temporary stay that allowed detained travelers to stay in the United States. Supporters outside the Brooklyn courtroom and at protests at airports in Dallas, Chicago, New York and elsewhere cheered the decision, but a bigger fight lay ahead. The court action does not reverse Trumps order, which was criticized by some of Americas closest allies. Trump, a businessman who successfully tapped into American fears about terror attacks during his campaign, had promised what he called extreme vetting of immigrants and refugees from areas the White House said the U.S. Congress deemed to be high risk. He told reporters in the White Houses Oval Office on Saturday that his order was not a Muslim ban and said the measures were long overdue. Its working out very nicely. You see it at the airports, you see it all over, Trump said. Along with Syria, the ban affects travelers with passports from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The Department of Homeland Security said about 375 travelers had been affected by the order, 109 of whom were in transit and were denied entry to the United States. Another 173 were stopped by airlines before boarding. The order affects a minor portion of international travelers, the department said in a statement, saying the measures inconvenienced less than 1 percent of travelers. The new rules blindsided people in transit and families waiting for them, and caused havoc for businesses with employees holding passports from the targeted nations and colleges with international students. Pegah Rahmani, 25, waited at Washingtons Dulles airport for several hours for her grandparents, both Iranian citizens with U.S. green cards. They werent treating them very well, she said. Rahmanis grandfather is 88 and legally blind. Her grandmother is 83 and recently had a stroke. They were released to loud cheers and cries. Several Democratic governors said they were examining whether they could launch legal challenges, and other groups eyed a constitutional challenge claiming religious discrimination. I dont think anyone is going to take this lying down, said Cleveland immigration lawyer David Leopold. This is the tip of the spear and more litigation is coming. The White House did not respond immediately to a request for comment.  The Department of Homeland Security said the order would stay in place. No foreign national in a foreign land, without ties to the United States, has any unfettered right to demand entry into the United States, the department statement said. Mark Krikorian, the director of the conservative Center for Immigration Studies, called lawsuits challenging the order last ditch efforts that would only apply to a few individuals, and he said a broader constitutional argument would be hard to win. The first amendment doesnt apply to foreigners living abroad. The law explicitly says the president can exclude any person or class of people he wants, Krikorian said. Some leaders from the U.S. technology industry, a major employer of foreign workers, issued warnings to their staff and called the order immoral and un-American. This ban will impact many innocent people, said Travis Kalanick, chief executive of Uber Technologies Inc UBER.UL, who said he would raise the issue at a White House meeting on Friday. Arab travelers in the Middle East and North Africa said the order was humiliating and discriminatory. Iran vowed to retaliate. Sudan called the action very unfortunate after Washington  lifted sanctions on the country just weeks ago for cooperation on combating terrorism. A Yemeni official expressed dismay at the ban. Iraqs former ambassador to the United States, Lukman Faily, told Reuters that Trumps ban was unfair to a country that itself has been a victim of terror attacks, and could backfire. We have a strong partnership with U.S., more so in the urgent fight against terrorism. This ban move will not help, and people will start questioning the bond of this partnership, Faily said. Allies in the United Kingdom, France and Germany were critical. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted a photo of himself welcoming Syrian refugees. Confusion abounded at airports as immigration and customs officials struggled to interpret the new rules. Some legal residents with green cards who were in the air when the order was issued were detained at airports upon arrival. However, senior administration officials said it would have been reckless to broadcast details of the order in advance. Other officials said green card holders from the affected countries would require extra screening and would be cleared on a case-by-case basis. Airlines were blindsided and some cabin crew were barred from entering the country. Travelers were handled differently at different points of entry and immigration lawyers advised clients to change their destination to the more lenient airports, said Houston immigration lawyer Mana Yegani. At Chicago OHare International Airport, brothers Bardia and Ayden Noohi waited for four hours for their father Kasra Noohi - who has an Iranian passport and a U.S. green card - to be allowed through. They knew Trump had pledged tougher rules but did not expect the problems. I didnt think hed actually do it, Bardia Noohi, 32, said. A lot of politicians just talk. Thousands of refugees seeking entry were thrown into limbo. Melanie Nezer of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society said she knew of roughly 2,000 who were booked to come to the United States next week. Trumps order indefinitely bans refugees from Syria. In a television interview, he said he would seek to prioritize Christian refugees fleeing the war-torn country. U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they were not consulted on the action and in some cases only learned the details as they were made public. At the State Department, a senior official said lawyers were working to interpret the executive order, which allows entry to people affected by the order when it is in the national interest. However, a federal law enforcement official said: Its unclear at this point what the threshold of national interest is. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""DUBAI (Reuters) - Emirates airline has changed pilot and flight attendant rosters  on flights to the United States following the sudden U.S. travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries, highlighting the challenges facing airlines trying to deal with the new rules. The worlds largest long-haul carrier, which flies daily to 11 U.S. cities, has made the necessary adjustments to our crewing, to comply with the latest requirements, an Emirates spokeswoman told Reuters by email on Sunday. She added U.S. flights continue to operate to schedule. President Donald Trump on Friday suspended the entry of people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The decision caught airlines off guard, according to the International Air Transport Association. I cannot think of anything comparable. This brings a mix of administrative confusion, impact and uncertainty for many travelers as well as practical operational headaches and complexities for airlines in planning their flight programs, independent aviation consultant John Strickland told Reuters. The ban applies to pilots and flight attendants from the seven countries, even though all flight crew who are not U.S. citizens already need a special visa to enter the country.  Nicoley Baublies, from the German cabin crew union UFO, said the move was very unusual and meant uncertainty for airlines in terms of planning. Lufthansa has always ensured it has very diverse crews, with staff of different nationalities and that means that we are for the first time in decades having to look at where people come from, he told Reuters at Frankfurt airport. A spokesman for Lufthansa said on Sunday it was too early to comment on the effects of the order but that airlines and passengers were required to follow the new rules. Another Emirates spokeswoman said the impact of the ban on operations would be minimal. The airline employs over 23,000 flight attendants and about 4,000 pilots from around the world, including the United States, Europe and the Middle East. Meanwhile, a spokesman for Etihad Airways of Abu Dhabi said the airline had taken steps to ensure there will be no issues for flights departing over the coming weeks. Japan Airlines (9201.T) (JAL) on Monday said it had begun screening passengers from the countries affected Trumps travel ban before their departure for the United States. JAL officials would contact the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency to confirm whether passengers would be allowed entry, a spokesman for Japans second-biggest carrier said.      It is unclear if the ban applies to dual nationals - those who hold one passport from a country on the list and another from a non-U.S. country that is not. Etihad said on its website that dual citizens could travel to the U.S. using their non-banned passport. IATA have told its members that the ban does not apply to dual nationals if they have a passport not on the list, according to an email seen by Reuters. However, the Guardian reported on Saturday, quoting State Department officials, that dual nationals were banned. US officials said on Sunday holders of green cards need to check with a U.S. consulate and will be cleared on a case by case basis. On Sunday, IATA sent another email to member airlines, seen by Reuters, asking for examples of Green Card holders being denied boarding. It also said it was seeking more information from authorities in Washington. Baublies said the uncertainty over the rules was not helping. Trump reacts in 140 characters, we dont know what it means - for people with the wrong entries in their passports or with dual nationality or married to someone from one of the countries affected, are they allowed to travel? There are also concerns the restrictions could dampen travel demand.  Ultimately this could feed through to the role airlines play in the global economy in supporting business and tourism due to as yet unquantifiable impacts on demand & cost, Strickland said. Baublies said airlines were usually among the first affected by global crises. We hope it doesnt mean that seats are left empty because people dont know where they can travel with which passport. Dubai-based Emirates and Etihad Airways are both owned by the governments of the United Arab Emirates, a U.S. ally and Muslim-majority country. Both carriers said they would continue to comply with the new rules on U.S. immigration but where possible would offer to refund or re-book affected passengers. Emirates and Etihad have also said that passengers were affected by the ban over the weekend but their flight crews had not been impacted. Qatar Airways declined to comment on the impact of the ban on flight operations, although on Saturday it issued a statement on its website that passengers would need a green card or diplomatic visa to enter the U.S. Emirates and Etihad issued similar statements.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trumps administration on Sunday tempered a key element of his move to ban entry of refugees and people from seven Muslim-majority countries in the face of mounting criticism even from some prominent Republicans and protests that drew tens of thousands in major American cities. Trump signed the directive on Friday, but the policy appeared to be evolving on the fly. Democrats and a growing number of Republicans assailed the move and foreign leaders condemned it amid court challenges and tumult at U.S. airports. The presidents critics have said his action unfairly singled out Muslims, violated U.S. law and the Constitution and defiled Americas historic reputation as hospitable to immigrants. In a fresh defense of the action on Sunday, Trump said his directive was not about religion but keeping America safe. Trump has presented the policy as a way to protect the country from the threat of Islamist militants. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said in a statement that people from the seven countries who hold so-called green cards as lawful permanent U.S. residents would not be blocked from returning to the United States from overseas,  as some had been after the directive. All green card holders who were detained at U.S. airports had been admitted into the country by late Sunday, a U.S. official familiar with the process told Reuters. The source could not provide a figure of how many people whose re-entry had been delayed, in some cases for hours. Outside the White House, where some viewing stands from Trumps Jan. 20 inaugural parade still stood, several thousand protesters denounced him, carrying signs such as Deport Trump and Fear is a terrible thing for a nations soul. Protests also were staged in cities and airports in New York, Los Angeles, Boston, Houston, Dallas and elsewhere. The Republican president on Friday put a four-month hold on allowing refugees into the country, an indefinite ban on refugees from Syria and a three-month bar on citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.  Border and customs officials struggled to put Trumps directive into practice. Confusion persisted over details of implementation, in particular for the people who hold green cards. Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a Trump supporter, said the presidents order had been poorly implemented, particularly for green card holders. The administration should immediately make appropriate revisions, and it is my hope that following a thorough review and implementation of security enhancements that many of these programs will be improved and reinstated, Corker said. Trump defended his action. To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting, Trump said in a statement on Sunday. This is not about religion - this is about terror and keeping our country safe. There are over 40 different countries worldwide that are majority Muslim that are not affected by this order. He added: We will again be issuing visas to all countries once we are sure we have reviewed and implemented the most secure policies over the next 90 days. The department said on Saturday Trumps action did apply to people with green cards who were returning to the United States from the seven nations, while a White House official said green card holders who had left the United States and wanted to return would have to visit a U.S. embassy or consulate to undergo additional screening. White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus then went on the Sunday morning news programs to say those people would not be blocked. As far as green card holders moving forward, it doesnt affect them, Priebus said on the NBC program Meet the Press. Priebus added that these green card holders would be subjected to more questioning by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agents when they try to re-enter the United States until a better program is put in place over the next several months. In an apparent indication that Kellys instructions were being implemented, some green card holders arriving in the United States said they had no trouble clearing customs.  Mahdi Tajsarvi, an engineer who lives in Virginia, said he and his wife, Arezoo Hosseini, both Iranian citizens with U.S. green cards, were asked a few routine questions by authorities at Dulles International Airport outside Washington on Sunday evening and let through within a few minutes. Priebus also said Customs and Border Patrol agents would  have discretionary authority when they encountered someone arriving who they suspect is up to no good from certain nations. Asked why Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Egypt were not included on Trumps list, Priebus said that perhaps other countries needed to be added to an executive order going forward. U.S. judges in at least five states blocked federal authorities from enforcing Trumps directive, but lawyers representing people covered by the order said some authorities were unwilling on Sunday to follow the judges rulings. U.S. Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, prominent Republican foreign policy voices, said in a joint statement Trumps order may do more to help recruit terrorists than improve U.S. security. Ultimately, we fear this executive order will become a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism, they said, adding the United States should not stop green card holders from returning to the country they call home. This executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country, the added. Trump blasted the two senators in a Twitter statement, calling them sadly weak on immigration. In a another Twitter message earlier on Sunday, Trump said the United States needed strong borders and extreme vetting, NOW. Christians in the Middle-East have been executed in large numbers. We cannot allow this horror to continue! added Trump, who successfully tapped into Americans fear of attacks during his election campaign. Trumps tweet did not mention that many more Muslims have been killed in the bloody Syrian civil war and other violence in the targeted countries. Condemnation of Trumps action poured in from abroad, including from traditional allies of the United States. In Germany, which has taken in large numbers of people fleeing the Syrian civil war, Chancellor Angela Merkel said the global fight against terrorism was no excuse for the measures and does not justify putting people of a specific background or faith under general suspicion, her spokesman said on Sunday. Canada will offer temporary residency to people stranded in the country as a result of Trumps executive order on immigration, Canadian Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen said. Briefing reporters at the White House on condition of anonymity, a U.S. administration official rejected criticism of the way Trumps plan had been carried out, saying: So it really is a massive success story in terms of implementation on every single level. Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the Republican-led U.S. Senate, had a different view, calling Trumps administration incompetent. One hand doesnt know what the other is doing, Schumer said. I think banning refugees, banning immigrants, banning religions like Islam or any other religion, is un-American, said Will Turner, 42, draped in a U.S. flag among a crowd of several thousand people in front of the White House chanting: No hate, no fear, refugees are welcome here. An official of the conservative billionaire industrialist Koch brothers political network of donors criticized Trumps immigration order at the donors winter gathering in Indian Wells, California. Our country has benefited tremendously from a history of welcoming people from all cultures and backgrounds. This is a hallmark of free and open societies, Brian Hooks said in a statement. Civil rights and some religious groups, activists and Democratic politicians have promised to fight Trumps order and Schumer said his party would introduce legislation to overturn it. Republicans control both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Priebus said that of 325,000 people who arrived from foreign countries on Saturday, 109 people were detained for further questioning, and most of them were moved out, with just a couple dozen more that remain detained.  It wasnt chaos, he said. Judges in California, Massachusetts, Virginia and Washington state, each home to international airports, issued their rulings after a similar order was issued on Saturday night by U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly in New Yorks Brooklyn borough in a case involving two Iraqis caught by the order as they flew into the country. Attorneys general from California, New York, 13 other states and Washington, D.C., condemned and pledged to fight what they called Trumps dangerous and unconstitutional order.

(Reuters) - Billionaire industrialist Charles Koch is launching a campaign to sink a border tax under consideration by Republican leaders in Congress, a move that could complicate the lawmakers efforts to find a way to pay for President Donald Trumps proposed wall on the U.S. border with Mexico. Americans for Prosperity, a conservative political advocacy group founded by Charles Koch and his brother David, plans to use its network of wealthy political donors and activists to kill the proposal, which aims to raise $1.2 trillion over 10 years on goods coming into the United States, according to officials from the group, which gathered this weekend for a conference. Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan is pushing the tax as part of a broader overhaul of the U.S. tax code. The White House has given mixed signals on whether Trump supports the approach, but proponents say revenue collected from the border tax could finance Trumps drive to build a wall along the southwestern U.S. border. Proponents also say it would discourage U.S. manufacturers from moving abroad. On Thursday, AFP sent a letter expressing its opposition to the border tax to a House panel in charge of writing tax legislation. AFP Chief Executive Officer Luke Hilgemann, in an interview, called the measure a massive tax increase on U.S. consumers, who would pay more for foreign goods. He urged Ryan to go back to the drawing board. AFP and its offshoot organizations have become a powerful force in U.S. politics, bolstering candidates and issues on federal and state levels. Besides defying Republican leaders on the border tax, the Koch-led organization on Sunday challenged Trump on a policy he implemented on Friday to stop the movement of people from countries with large Muslim populations from traveling to the United States. The travel ban is the wrong approach and will likely be counterproductive, said an official of the Koch network. Koch refused to endorse Trump during his presidential campaign, differing with the candidate over his positions on immigration and trade policy, and his practice of singling out companies for possible retribution if they move jobs abroad. Nevertheless, Hilgemann said AFP had a developing relationship with the Trump White House, which he said had reached out to his organization to discuss some policy matters. At the same time, former AFP officials have landed high-level jobs in the Trump administration, giving the group a conduit for airing its policy wishes. Looking toward the 2018 congressional and gubernatorial elections, AFP officials said they planned to boost the networks spending on policy and political activities to between $300 million and $400 million, up from an estimated $250 million for the 2016 campaigns. Hilgemann also said AFP was laying plans to mobilize activists to help win Senate confirmation of Trumps pick for the Supreme Court nominee.

Judges in California, Massachusetts, Virginia and Washington state, each home to international airports, issued their rulings after a similar order was issued on Saturday night by U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly in New Yorks Brooklyn borough. Donnelly had ruled in a lawsuit by two men from Iraq being held at John F. Kennedy International Airport. While none of the rulings struck down Fridays executive order by the new Republican president, the growing number of them could complicate the administrations effort to enforce it. The rulings add to questions about the constitutionality of the order, said Andrew Pincus, a Mayer Brown partner representing two Yemeni men who were denied U.S. entry from an overseas flight despite being legal permanent residents. People have gone through processes to obtain legal permanent resident status, or visas, Pincus said. There are serious questions about whether those rights, which were created by statute, can be unilaterally taken away without process. Trumps order halted travel by people with passports from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days, and stopped the resettlement of refugees for 120 days. He said these actions were needed to protect the American people from terrorist attacks by foreign nationals admitted to the United States. The order sparked a global backlash, including from U.S. allies that view the actions as discriminatory and divisive. Attorneys general from California, New York, 13 other states and Washington, D.C., meanwhile, in a statement condemned and pledged to fight what they called Trumps dangerous and unconstitutional order. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security on Sunday said it will comply with judicial orders, while enforcing Trumps order in a manner that ensures those entering the United States do not pose a threat to our country or the American people. Striking that balance has caused confusion, according to lawyers who worked overnight and on Sunday to help travelers at JFK Airport, Washington Dulles International Airport in northern Virginia, and elsewhere. Immigration lawyer Sharifa Abbasi said some Border Patrol agents at Dulles refused to let lawyers talk with detainees, even after being shown an order from U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema requiring such access. Abbasi said the agents instead told the lawyers to call their agencys office, where no one was answering. There is really no method to this madness, Becca Heller, director of theNew York-based International Refugee Assistance Project organization, told reporters on a conference call. Supporters of Trumps order said authorities acted properly in swiftly taking steps to enforce it.  It is better (to) be safe than sorry, said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the conservative Center forImmigration Studies in Washington. Lawsuits on behalf of more than 100 individual travelers have been filed nationwide, activists and lawyers estimated. Some have come from large corporate firms including Mayer Brown, Kirkland & Ellis, and Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton. In Boston, U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs on Sunday temporarily blocked the removal of two Iranians who have taught at the University of Massachusetts, and had been detained at the citys Logan International Airport. Burroughs ruling appeared to go further than Donnellys by barring the detention, as well as the removal, of approved refugees, visa holders and permanent U.S. residents entering from the seven countries. Donnellys order forbade only removal. Matthew Segal, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, in a statement called Burroughs ruling a huge victory for justice in the face of what he called Trumps unconstitutional ban on Muslims. The U.S. Constitutions First Amendment guarantees the free exercise of religion. Trumps order sought to prioritize refugees fleeing religious persecution, which the president said was aimed at helping Christians in Syria. Burroughs ruling also prompted some Trump critics to urge holders of green cards, which allow foreign nationals to live and work permanently in the United States, to fly into Boston, to lessen the risk of detainment. White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said several times on NBCs Meet the Press that Trumps order does not affect green card holders moving forward or going forward. In a ruling on Sunday, U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee in Los Angeles directed the return to the United States of Ali Khoshbakhti Vayeghan, who authorities had sent back to his native Iran following Trumps order.  The ruling from Brinkema, in Alexandria, Virginia, barred the Homeland Security agency from removing an estimated 50 to 60 legal permanent residents who had been detained at Dulles. In Seattle, U.S. District Judge Thomas Zilly barred the government from removing two people, who were not named in court papers. He scheduled a Feb. 3 hearing on whether to lift that stay.

U.S. judges in at least four states block federal authorities from enforcing Trumps executive order restricting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries.

Tens of thousands of people rally in U.S. East Coast cities to protest Trumps executive order. Democratic attorneys general across the United States condemn Trumps order and are discussing whether to challenge the administration in court. Trumps temporary ban on Yemeni citizens traveling to the United States is illegal and illegitimate, authorities controlled by the Iran-allied Houthi group in Yemens capital say.

The passengers, arriving in transit to Cairo airport, were stopped and re-directed to flights headed for their home countries despite holding valid visas, the sources said.  Trump on Friday put a four-month hold on allowing refugees into the United States and temporarily barred travelers from Syria and six other Muslim-majority countries, saying the moves would help protect Americans from terrorist attacks. He said his most sweeping use of his presidential powers since taking office a week ago, barring travelers from the seven nations for at least 90 days, would give his administration time to develop more stringent screening procedures for refugees, immigrants and visitors. Im establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America. Dont want them here, Trump said earlier on Friday at the Pentagon. We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people, he said. The bans, though temporary, took effect immediately, causing havoc and confusion for would-be travelers with passports from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Besides Cairo it was not immediately clear whether other  airports of countries listed by Trump had swiftly implemented the ban. Arab officials of the listed countries would not comment on the matter. The order seeks to prioritize refugees fleeing religious persecution, a move Trump separately said was aimed at helping Christians in Syria. That led some legal experts to question whether the order was constitutional. One group said it would announce a court challenge on Monday. The Council on American-Islamic Relations said the order targets Muslims because of their faith, contravening the U.S. Constitutional right to freedom of religion. President Trump has cloaked what is a discriminatory ban against nationals of Muslim countries under the banner of national security, said Greg Chen of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.  Trump has long pledged to take this kind of action, making it a prominent feature of his campaign for the Nov. 8 election. But people who work with Muslim immigrants and refugees were scrambling to determine the scope of the order. Even legal permanent residents - people with green cards allowing them to live and work in the United States - were being advised to consult immigration lawyers before traveling outside the country, or trying to return, according to Muslim Advocates, a civil rights group in Washington.  On Friday evening, Abed Ayoub of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee said he had fielded about 100 queries from people anxious about the order, which he said he believed could affect traveling green card holders, students, people coming to the United States for medical care and others. Its chaos, Ayoub said. During his campaign, Trump tapped into American fears about Islamic State militants and the flood of migrants into Europe from Syrias civil war, saying refugees could be a Trojan horse that allowed attackers to enter the United States. In December 2015, he called for a ban on all Muslims entering the United States, drawing fire for suggesting a religious test for immigrants that critics said would violate the U.S. Constitution. His idea later evolved into a proposal for extreme vetting.  Trumps order also suspends the Syrian refugee program until further notice, and will eventually give priority to minority religious groups fleeing persecution.  Trump said in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network that the exception would help Syrian Christians fleeing the civil war there. Legal experts were divided on whether this order would be constitutional. If they are thinking about an exception for Christians, in almost any other legal context discriminating in favor of one religion and against another religion could violate the constitution, said Stephen Legomsky, a former chief counsel at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in the Obama administration. But Peter Spiro, a professor at Temple University Beasley School of Law, said Trumps action would likely be constitutional because the president and Congress are allowed considerable deference when it comes to asylum decisions. Its a completely plausible prioritization, to the extent this group is actually being persecuted, Spiro said. The order may also affect special refugee programs for Iraqis who worked for the U.S. government as translators after the 2003 invasion of Iraq. It is already affecting refugees and their families, said Jen Smyers of the Church World Service, a Protestant faith-based group that works with migrants. Smyers said she spoke to an Iraqi mother whose twin daughters remain in Iraq due to processing delays. Those two 18-year-old daughters wont be able to join their mother in the U.S., she said. Democrats on Friday were quick to condemn Trumps order as un-American, saying it would tarnish the reputation of the United States as a land that welcomes immigrants. Todays executive order from President Trump is more about extreme xenophobia than extreme vetting, said Democratic Senator Edward Markey in a statement. Some Republicans praised the move. Representative Bob Goodlatte, chairman of the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, said Islamic State has threatened to use the U.S. immigration system, making it important to do more screening. I am pleased that President Trump is using the tools granted to him by Congress and the power granted by the Constitution to help keep America safe and ensure we know who is entering the United States, Goodlatte said in a statement. Without naming Trump, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Saturday it was no time to build walls between nations and criticized steps towards cancelling world trade agreements. Trump on Wednesday ordered the construction of a U.S.-Mexican border wall, a major promise during his election campaign, as part of a package of measures to curb illegal immigration. Today is not the time to erect walls between nations. They have forgotten that the Berlin wall fell years ago, Rouhani said in a speech carried live on Iranian state television. He made no direct reference to Trumps order regarding refugees and travelers from the seven mainly Muslim states. Rouhani, a pragmatist elected in 2013, thawed Irans relations with world powers after years of confrontation and engineered its 2015 deal with them under which it curbed its nuclear program in exchange for relief from sanctions. Rouhani said earlier this month that Trump could not unilaterally cancel the nuclear deal and that talk of renegotiating it was meaningless. France and Germany voiced disquiet on Saturday over Trumps new restrictions on immigration. Welcoming refugees who flee war and oppression is part of our duty, French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said at a joint news conference with German counterpart Sigmar Gabriel. The United States is a country where Christian traditions have an important meaning. Loving your neighbor is a major Christian value, and that includes helping people, said  Gabriel. I think that is what unites us in the West, and I think that is what we want to make clear to the Americans. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"
"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday his administration wants more rigorous screening of refugees and visitors from certain countries to prevent terrorist attacks. Here is what Trumps order on extreme vetting - denounced by civil rights groups as discriminatory - includes. The order bars the entry of foreign nationals from certain countries for 90 days. While no countries are specifically named in the order, it refers to a statute that would apply to seven Muslim-majority nations: Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Yemen and Iraq. There is an exception for certain types of visas, including for diplomats and the United Nations. The temporary halt is aimed at giving the Department of Homeland Security, the State Department and the Director of National Intelligence time to determine what information is needed from each country to ensure that visas are not issued to individuals posing a national security threat. The order calls for a review to create a single process for screening people entering the country, which could include holding more in-person interviews, searches of an expanded database of identity documents or longer application forms.  Under the current system, some visa applications require interviews but others do not. The government already has extensive databases but some believe they need to be expanded.  The order suspends the Visa Interview Waiver Program, which allows consular officers to exempt some applicants from face-to-face interviews if they are seeking to renew their temporary visas within a year of expiration. Immigration attorneys say the changes will make even routine applications much more complicated and time consuming and could mean that more people will need assistance to get through the visa process. In an attempt to ensure wait times for interviews are not unduly affected, the order calls for the hiring of more consular fellows to work in U.S. embassies abroad.  The order calls for the temporary halt of all refugee admissions for four months so the government can study the process and determine if additional checks are necessary, although there will be case-by-case exceptions. The orderalso implemented a blanket ban of all Syrian refugees until sufficient changes have been made to the refugee program, without giving more details. After the suspension is lifted, the government will give priority to applicants that are suffering religious-based prosecution, but only if they are minorities in their country. Trump said in a television interview that the move would protect Christians. It could also protect ethnic minorities like the Yazidis in the Middle East. This could potentially open the door to legal challenges claiming religious discrimination, some legal experts say. Once refugee admissions resume, fewer will be allowed. The 2017 cap was set at 50,000 people, compared to 85,000 designated by President Barack Obama for 2016. In a nod to certain states and cities that have objected to refugee resettlement, the order also seeks to give state and local jurisdictions a role in deciding whether or not to allow people to live there. COMPLETING THE BIOMETRIC ENTRY-EXIT TRACKING SYSTEM The system is aimed at tracking foreign visitors arrival and departure using information like finger prints. Former President Barack Obamas administration had aimed to start implementing biometric exit checks at the countrys largest airports by2018. Some experts have said that for the system to work properly, it would need to cover all land, air, and sea ports of entry, which is a major undertaking. According to a 2014 report from the Bipartisan Policy Center the system would be expensive to implement and would offer mixed value for enforcement objectives.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Divisions have emerged among advisers to President Donald Trump over whether to rescind a signature policy of his predecessor, President Barack Obama, that shields young immigrants from deportation, according to congressional sources and Republicans close to the White House. Even though Trump campaigned on a promise to roll back Obamas executive orders on immigration, the Republican has so far left intact an order safeguarding 750,000 people who were brought to the United States illegally as children, known as the dreamers. The issue has become a flashpoint for White House advisers divided between a more moderate faction such as chief of staff Reince Priebus and immigration hardliners Stephen Miller and Steve Bannon, said a former congressional aide who has been  involved with immigration issues in Washington.      Priebus has said publicly that Trump will work with Congress to get a long-term solution on the issue.  Meanwhile, Miller, said to have mastered the thinking of his former boss and anti-immigration advocate Jeff Sessions, Trumps nominee for U.S. Attorney General, as well as Bannon, former head of right-wing Breitbart News, have pushed Trump to take a harder approach and rescind the protections.  Two officials at the Department of Homeland Security expect Trump to simply stop renewing the authorizations that dreamers currently have to work, drive and obtain higher education. Under that plan, the most recently renewed authorizations would expire in two years.   But a senior House Republican aide said it was uncertain whether the administration had scrapped the idea of overturning Obamas Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, known as DACA, as the internal debate plays out.   Preserving DACA has also become somewhat of a bartering chip as Trump seeks congressional support for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and other early administration priorities. The White House is acutely aware of the firestorm in the country and within Congress that could swamp the fledgling administration just as it plunges into negotiations over the wall, healthcare, tax reform and infrastructure investments, said the senior House Republican aide. Another congressional aide described a Senate bill sponsored by Democrat Dick Durbin and Republican Lindsey Graham to protect the dreamers as the sugar that would help the medicine of the wall go down.  The bill would likely face challenges winning enough votes to pass. Efforts to attach some tough conservative amendments could lose Democratic Party support and sink the whole effort.  Trump has kept his public comments on DACA vague. In an interview with ABC News on Wednesday, Trump said his administration would be coming out with a policy to deal with dreamers over the next four weeks.  They shouldnt be very worried. They are here illegally. They shouldnt be very worried. I do have a big heart. Were going to take care of everybody. Were going to have a very strong border, Trump said in the interview with ABC.  Trump reportedly told Durbin during the inaugural luncheon at the Capitol on Jan. 20 that he did not have to worry about an executive action overturning Obamas order. But there is scant trust among Democrats that Trump will keep his word. And immigration advocates said DACA recipients live in fear and uncertainty as the message from the White House and Republicans seems to shift by the day.     House Speaker Paul Ryan told a woman protected by DACA, at a townhall hosted by CNN Jan. 12, that there should be a solution for people like her to get right with the law and not be separated from their families.  Just two days prior, Sessions, a Senator, told a Senate panel considering his confirmation that it would certainly be constitutional to repeal DACA. Sessions also attempted to force a vote to block DACA in the Senate in 2014.  Miller, Sessions former staffer, is now Trumps senior adviser for policy at the White House.  Miller is known to be a staunch advocate for restricting immigration, even by workers who enter legally on visas.  Both Miller and Bannon, Trumps senior counselor and chief strategist, are seen as outsiders to the Republican establishment and unafraid to upset people like Ryan to stay true to Trump campaign promises. Priebus, however, came to the White House after chairing the Republican National Committee and has spent years seeking to unify the party and cultivating relationships with career politicians.

In an open letter, they said U.S. President Donald Trumps executive order, which temporarily bars travelers from Syria and six other countries while putting a four-month hold on allowing refugees into the United States, had already impacted several in our community.  Canadian tech companies understand the power of inclusion and diversity of thought, and that talent and skill know no borders, the letter said.

The Canadian government has not said what action it could take, but in tweets on Saturday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the nation welcomed those fleeing war and persecution. Canadian airlines have already turned back at least one passenger who tried to fly to the United States. Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen will brief the media on the impact of the Trump order at 4 p.m. EST (2100 GMT) on Sunday, officials said. Local and national politicians across the political spectrum have already condemned Trumps ban. On Sunday, the left-leaning opposition New Democrats called for an emergency debate in the federal Parliament. Canada is eager to attract skilled tech workers from abroad while also retaining employees and students who are often lured away by global companies. More than 300,000 Canadians work in Californias Silicon Valley. Canada has benefited from the raucous U.S. election campaign, with new Canadian work permits for highly skilled workers from the United States soaring nearly 54 percent in the first eight months of 2016. In November, Canada introduced new visa measures that would allow tech companies to quickly recruit foreign talent, including fast approvals and 30-day work permits. Daniel Debow, co-founder of a startup acquired by Salesforce.com Inc in 2012 and who is now building up an artificial intelligence company, welcomed the chance to hire talented people caught by the ban. This utterly foolish action by the U.S. government is an opportunity 100 times greater to build Canada, said Debow.

Kennedy International Airport, their lawyers and two U.S. lawmakers accompanying them tried to cross into a secure area to consult with the men.  Border protection agents held them back, sparking a heated exchange. Step back! Step back! the agents shouted. A few minutes later, Heidi Nassauer, chief of passenger operations for U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at the airport, was called over.  U.S. Congress members Jerrold Nadler and Nydia Velazquez, both  Democrats from New York, wanted clarification on whether an immigration ban issued on Friday by President Donald Trump prevented the Iraqis from consulting with attorneys. Nassauer had no clear answer.  We are as much in the dark as everybody else, said the border protection official at one of the largest U.S. airports.  The tense exchange, witnessed by Reuters, was representative of the confusion at airports across the United States and others overseas after Trump abruptly halted immigration from seven majority-Muslim countries and temporarily put a stop to the entry of refugees.  The Trump administration, facing criticism over the executive orders implementation, on Saturday it would have been reckless to give details to government agencies and airports more broadly in advance of launching the security measures, which it says aimed to prevent attacks from foreign groups. But career officials in the Homeland Security and State departments told Reuters that the administration failed to appreciate the complexity of enforcing the order consistently or the need to prepare agencies and airlines. Throughout much of Saturday, government officials and security workers were left to guess who from those countries could enter the United States legally and who could not.  The day ended with U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly in Brooklyn issuing an emergency stay that temporarily allowed stranded travelers with valid visas to remain in the United States. The American Civil Liberties Union, which sought the stay, said it would help 100 to 200 people with visas or refugee status who found themselves detained in transit or at U.S. airports.  Across the country, more than a dozen similar petitions on behalf of individuals being held at airports had been filed by the end of Saturday, according to a Reuters review of data collected by WestLaw. By Sunday morning, federal judges in three more states - Massachusetts, Washington and Virginia - issued orders blocking authorities from deporting travelers impacted by Trumps executive orders. A senior administration official said Trumps order - aimed at citizens of Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen - needed to be implemented urgently to protect Americans. Theres a very strong nexus between our immigration and visa programs and terrorist plots and extremist networks inside the United States, the official told reporters in a briefing. It would be reckless and irresponsible to ... broadcast to the entire world the exact security measures youre going to take. Key figures at the Department of Homeland Security were informed, the official said, declining to elaborate. At the State Department, one of the main agencies dealing with visas and immigration, most officials first heard of the executive order on immigration through the media, according to two department officials.  While some offices were aware an executive order was coming, there was no official communication or consultation from the White House, they said.  Was there any inter-agency coordination or consultation? No, said one senior official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Immigration enforcement is among the federal governments most complex endeavors, involving seven agencies from the U.S. Coast Guard and CBP to the State and Justice Departments. Two senior officials in the Department of Homeland Security said on Saturday that they had not heard of any officials in the relevant agencies - or the congressional committees and subcommittees that oversee them - who had been consulted by anyone who helped draft the presidents order. If the result is confusion and inconsistency, the responsibility all lies at one address, said one of the officials, referring to the White House.  The official, like others, requested anonymity to discuss Trumps order.  Another Homeland Security official told Reuters that the White House worked on the executive orders with limited department participation. It has been a challenge but folks are working through it, the official said. Affected travelers had varying experiences at different airports, according to nearly 200 accounts gathered by the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA).  Many holding visas told the association they were allowed into the country without a problem despite Trumps executive order banning them. But some lawful permanent residents  those with so-called green cards  were turned away despite guidance to airlines from the CBP that they should be allowed to travel. At about 10 p.m. on Friday in Seattle, some eight hours after Trump signed the executive order, an Iranian with dual Canadian citizenship from Vancouver was sent back to Canada, the traveler reported to AILA. A half hour later in New York City, an Iranian arrived at JFK and entered the United States on a valid visa without any problems, according to AILA. One of the Iraqis detained at JFK was Hameed Khalid Darweesh, a 53-year-old Kurd who had worked as a U.S. Army translator in Iraq and had been threatened there for helping the Americans.  Visas for him and his family were issued on Jan. 20, according to a lawsuit filed on behalf of Darweesh and another Iraqi, who had also worked with U.S. military. But as soon as he landed at JFK, he was detained by CBP officers and barred from contacting his attorneys. When his attorneys, from the International Refugee Assistance Project, asked the CBP officers whom they could contact, the agents responded, Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump, according to the lawsuit.  Eventually, Darweesh was allowed to leave and met the lawmakers and his lawyers, clutching his passport and weeping with joy. The other Iraqi who was detained, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was also allowed to enter the country.  On Sunday morning, seven more detainees at JFK airport were allowed to enter the United States, said ACLU immigration attorney Andre Segura. The organization knew of at least five others that remained in the custody of border protection officials, Segura told Reuters. Conflicting media and government reports have caused confusion for airlines struggling to deal with the order. CBP informed air carriers about the executive order in a conference call late on Friday, said a person familiar with the agencys communications. CBP then sent written guidance before noon on Saturday saying that green card holders were not included in the ban and could continue to travel to the United States. The source said airlines were allowing travelers with green cards on flights until told otherwise.  The Trump administration official later told reporters that U.S. green card holders traveling outside the United States need to check with a U.S. consulate to see whether they can return. Its being cleared on a case-by-case basis, the official said.  On Sunday morning, the administration addressed the issue again but left questions over how green cards holders would be screened and by what agencies. The executive order doesnt affect green card holders moving forward, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus addressed told NBCs Meet the Press. He added that they would be subjected to extra questioning by CBP agents when they tried to re-enter the United States.  A senior administration official told Reuters, however, that it had not been determined where and how those screenings would be carried out. The nature of the screening will be up to CBP or the State Department, the official said, and specific guidelines were being drafted. They could be screened in many different ways and in many different places, the official said in an interview. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Steffen Seibert said Merkel had expressed her concerns to Trump during a telephone call on Saturday and reminded him that the Geneva Conventions require the international community to take in war refugees on humanitarian grounds. She is convinced that even the necessary, decisive battle against terrorism does not justify putting people of a specific background or faith under general suspicion, he said.      Seibert said the German government regrets the U.S. entry travel ban, would review the consequences for German citizens with dual nationalities, and would represent their interests, if needed, vis a vis our U.S. partners.

We are determined to protect the rights of our citizens and will take rapid action within the European Union about the steps that are now needed, Germanys Sigmar Gabriel and his Dutch counterpart Bert Koenders said. Trump ordered on Friday a four-month hold on allowing refugees into the United States and temporarily banned travelers from Syria and six other mainly Muslim countries.

Thomas Oppermann, who heads the parliamentary faction of the Social Democrats, the junior partner in Merkels right-center coalition, called Trumps order inhumane and foolhardy and said it would result in significant damage to the U.S. economy. The order contradicts everything that makes up the United States good reputation as a country of immigration, he told Die Welt newspaper. No one should be discriminated against because of their religious beliefs. Omid Nouripour, a Green party lawmaker who is vice-chair of the German-American parliamentary group and a German-Iranian dual national, said the new U.S. rule was a dirty symbolic gesture that would hurt hundreds of thousands of people. The German government must stand up for the over 100,000 German citizens who are affected by the order, Nouripour told Reuters. He said Trump had not included Saudi Arabia in the order because of his strong business ties there. Niema Movassat, a Left party lawmaker who also has German and Iranian citizenship, told the Tageszeitung newspaper that the ban would prevent him from visiting the United Nations to work on development issues and from visiting his relatives.  Dieter Janecek, economic spokesman for the Greens in parliament, said Germany should consider a travel ban on Trump and his senior adviser Stephen Bannon unless the order was rescinded. Trump on Saturday accepted Merkels invitation to attend the a meeting of the Group of 20 industrialized nations in Hamburg in July. He also invited Merkel to visit Washington soon.

The Iraqi government has so far declined comment on an executive order signed by new U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday that suspends the entry of travelers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for at least 90 days. The order stirred angry reactions in Iraq, where more than 5,000 U.S. troops are deployed to help Iraqi and regional Kurdish forces in the war against IS insurgents.  Some members of parliament said Iraq should retaliate with similar measures against the United States. Iraq is in the front line of the war on terrorism ... and it is unfair that the Iraqis are treated in this way, parliaments foreign affairs committee said in a statement. We call on the Iraqi government to retaliate for the decision taken by the U.S. administration, it added after a session on Sunday in Baghdad. Baghdad plans to lobby Washington to review the decision, according to two lawmakers who declined to be identified.  One of them told Reuters that the government will explain that Iraq as a sovereign country will be forced to apply similar treatment, and that would affect negatively cooperation, including military cooperation, in the conflict with IS. Popular Mobilization, a coalition of mainly Shiite Muslim paramilitary groups armed and trained by Iran to fight Islamic State, urged Prime Minister Haider al-Abadis government to expel U.S. nationals. Influential Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr said on Sunday American citizens should leave Iraq. It would be arrogance for you (Americans) to enter Iraq and other countries freely while barring them entrance to your country ... and therefore you should get your nationals out, he said on his website.  The U.S.-led coalition is providing critical air and ground support to Iraqi forces in the ongoing battle to wrest Mosul, the largest city in northern Iraq, from Islamic State.  Mosul is the last major Iraqi city still under the control of Islamic State, the ultra-hardline Sunni group that declared a self-styled caliphate over parts of Iraq and Syria in 2014. The government announced on Tuesday that Iraqi forces had recaptured all of Mosul east of the Tigris River that splits the city, and were girding for an onslaught on the jihadists on the western bank. Meanwhile, an Iraqi who worked four years as a translator for U.S. forces in the hope of obtaining a Special Immigration Visa (SIV) felt betrayed by the Trump administrations decision and said he now feared for his life. The man said he was hired by U.S. forces after he tipped them off about a house where insurgents were making car bombs in Mosul. He said that while employed by the Americans, he saved the life of a serviceman after U.S. troops came under militant attack in Mosul.  My life is (now) in danger, said the translator, who spoke in eastern Mosul and asked not to be  identified or photographed. He told Reuters he used to consider the Americans to be brothers but I dont trust those guys anymore.  He added that bureaucratic and personal problems delayed his applications to the U.S. Special Immigrant Visa program designed for those employed by the U.S. military and U.S. civilian agencies until their withdrawal from Iraq in 2011.    Please, please, please get me out of this country, he said. There are currently fewer than 500 Iraqis in the SIV pipeline, said a State Department official. Overall, more than 20,000 Iraqis have received immigrations benefits from this program, he added.  Among the Iraqis barred from traveling to the U.S. over the past 48 hours was Fuad Sharefs family, who embarked on the trip after selling their home and quitting their jobs and their school. The parents and their three children were barred on Saturday from boarding a connecting flight in Cairo to New York. Speaking by phone from Cairo airport, Sharef said the family was still in shock for having been detained there, their passports confiscated and being forced to go back to Iraq.

U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Friday that put a four-month hold on allowing refugees into the United States and temporarily barred travelers from Syria and six other countries. The order also seeks to prioritize refugees fleeing religious persecution, a move Trump separately said was aimed at helping Christians in Syria to leave. But hopes were dashed for at least one Syrian Christian Orthodox family, who were turned away at Philadelphia international airport and had to return to Lebanon. Christians in Damascus, where Syrias conflict is still felt as fighting rages through much of the country, said pledges to prioritize minorities made little difference to them. Getting U.S. visas has been the dream of all citizens in developing countries, no matter their religion, said Youssef Touma, 34, attending a church service in Damascus on Sunday. Syrians of all faiths were used to queueing at the U.S. embassys gates (to try to get visas). But it was almost impossible to get them, and has been harder since the war started. What I heard is that there will be exceptions for Christians from the ban, but not the easing of Christians travel - so that means there are still the same difficulties getting a visa, Touma said. Norma, a 30-year-old IT worker at the same church who declined to give her surname, said travel to the United States was a distant and impracticable dream. I dont know or have anyone in the U.S. If there was someone I knew, an aunt or uncle, then Id think about going myself, of course. And it would be better to undertake a safe journey to America instead of a risky one by boat to get to Germany, she said. Syrians in neighboring countries like Lebanon and Turkey have said they will primarily seek refuge in Europe, where some countries like Germany have taken in hundreds of thousands of refugees. Many have made dangerous crossings by boat from Turkey. Christians wishing to leave Syria said the U.S. preference for religious minorities could play into the hands of Islamist extremists. At the very least, it would have no real impact. I think (Islamist) extremists here would love for us to leave, to be rid of us, said Damascus resident Joseph Memari, reached by phone. Trump wrote on his Twitter account on Sunday: Christians in the Middle-East have been executed in large numbers. We cannot allow this horror to continue! Touma said statements made no difference. Minorities are always targeted by extremists and Trumps statements will not increase or decrease that, he said. They have been targeted since before Trump became president. The Christians of Maaloula (near Damascus) left the country before Trump was even considering the presidency. Christians of the Damascus countryside, like Harasta and Douma, were forced to leave their homes five years ago, he said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

In the lawsuit filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, the two men challenged Trumps directive on constitutional grounds. The suit said their connections to U.S. forces made them targets in their home country and that the pair had valid visas to enter the United States. The lawsuit highlights some of the legal obstacles facing Trumps new administration as it tries to carry out the directive, which the president signed late on Friday to impose a four-month ban on refugees entering the United States and a 90-day hold on travelers from Syria, Iran and five other Muslim-majority countries. In an emergency ruling on Saturday, U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly ordered U.S. authorities to refrain from deporting previously approved refugees as well as approved holders of valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas and other individuals ... legally authorized to enter the United States from the countries targeted in Trumps order. The American Civil Liberties Union, which sought the temporary stay, said it would help about 100 to 200 people who found themselves detained in transit or at U.S. airports after Trump signed the order. I am directing the government to stop removal if there is someone right now in danger of being removed, Donnelly said in the court hearing. No one is to be removed in this class. U.S. Department of Justice attorney Susan Riley during the hearing said, This has unfolded with such speed that we havent had an opportunity to address all the legal issues.  Many of the people in a huge crowd that had gathered outside the Brooklyn courthouse broke out into cheers after word of the judges ruling filtered out. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security in a statement hours later said only a small fraction of airline passengers arriving in the United States on Saturday were inconvenienced while enhanced security measures were implemented. These individuals went through enhanced security screenings and are being processed for entry to the United States, consistent with our immigration laws and judicial orders, the statement said.  The department said Trumps executive order remained in place and that its officers would enforce it.  Separately, a group of state attorneys general were discussing whether to file their own court challenge against Trumps order, officials in three states told Reuters. The plight of one of the men who brought the lawsuit, a former U.S. Army interpreter who was detained at John F. Kennedy International Airport, is especially compelling, said David Leopold, a former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, who is not involved in the suit. Here is a guy who was a translator who worked for the U.S. military for years, who himself was targeted by terrorists, he said. It is clear that if he is sent back, he is facing a direct threat to his life. That man, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was released later on Saturday and told a crowd of reporters at JFK Airport that he did not have ill feelings about his detention. America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world, he said.  Darweesh, 53, worked for the U.S. Army and for a U.S. contractor in Iraq from 2003 to 2013 as an interpreter and engineer, the lawsuit said. The second plaintiff, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, 33, was also detained at JFK Airport but has since been released. He is the husband of an Iraqi woman who worked for a U.S. contractor in Iraq. She already lives in Houston, the suit said.  Trump, a Republican, has said his order would help protect Americans from terrorist attacks. The lawsuit on behalf of the Iraqis challenges Trumps order on several grounds. It says the order violates the U.S. Constitutions guarantee of due process by taking away their ability to apply for asylum, and violates the guarantee of equal protection by discriminating against them on the basis of their country of origin without sufficient justification.  It also says the order violates procedural requirements of federal rulemaking. The next hearing in the case was set for Feb. 10. Supporters of the order say the president has wide authority to limit the entry of foreign nationals from specific countries when it is in the national interest. Even if they do and they win, my answer is so what? said Mark Krikorian, the director of the conservative Center for Immigration Studies. We are talking a few dozen people  that is just a last-ditch effort to get the last few people in. It doesnt really change the policy, he said. Trumps order does not mention specific religions but Trump said in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network on Friday he was acting to help Christians in Syria who were horribly treated.  Comments like that could come back to haunt the president in litigation over his order, said Hiroshi Motomura, an immigration expert at UCLA School of Law. There were comments during the campaign that focused very much on religion as the target, Motomura said. If the record showed that the origins of a particular measure were based on targeting a particular group, that could be challenged in court. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

However, a Trump administration official told reporters that green-card holders from the countries need to check with a U.S. consulate to see whether they can return, causing some confusion for airlines, which still plan to follow CBP guidance. Gulf airlines Emirates, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways said earlier on their websites that passengers would need a green card or diplomatic visa to enter the United States. An Emirates spokeswoman said a very small number of its passengers had been affected by the ban. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

On a visit to Turkey, she was asked three times to comment on Trumps move to put a four-month hold on allowing refugees into the United States and temporarily barring travelers from Syria and six other Muslim-majority countries, which he said would protect Americans from violent Islamists. She replied Washington was responsible for its policy on refugees.  But later, after her return to London, her spokesman said: Immigration policy in the United States is a matter for the government of the United States, just the same as immigration policy for this country should be set by our government.

Trumps executive order plunged Americas immigration system into chaos, with legal U.S. residents being turned away at airports, and drew criticism from U.S. Western allies including France and Germany. May, who became the first foreign leader to meet the president following his inauguration last week, had been enjoying a positive response at home for revitalizing the special relationship between the United States and Britain. But her response while in Ankara for talks with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan triggered criticism from her party. Trump really is a sickening piece of work, lawmaker Sarah Wollaston, a member of Mays Conservative Party, said on Twitter. She said Trump should be snubbed by parliament when he comes for a planned state visit to Britain later this year.

Strong leadership means not being afraid to tell someone powerful when theyre wrong. Its an ethos this country is proud of. A third Conservative member of parliament, Nadhim Zahawi, said he would be banned from the United States as a British citizen of Iraqi origin.

Today is not the time to erect walls between nations. They have forgotten that the Berlin wall fell years ago, Rouhani said in a speech carried live on Iranian state television.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday put a four-month hold on allowing refugees into the United States and temporarily barred travelers from Syria and six other Muslim-majority countries, saying the moves would help protect Americans from terrorist attacks. The needs of refugees and migrants worldwide have never been greater and the U.S. resettlement program is one of the most important in the world, the two Geneva-based agencies said in a joint statement. Trump stopped the entry of travelers from Syria and the six other nations - Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen - for at least 90 days, saying his administration needed time to develop more stringent screening processes for refugees, immigrants and visitors. IOM and UNHCR said they remained committed to working with the U.S. administration towards a shared goal of ensuring safe and secure resettlement and immigration programmes. We strongly believe that refugees should receive equal treatment for protection and assistance, and opportunities for resettlement, regardless of their religion, nationality or race, they said. Resettlement places provided by every country for vulnerable refugees, some of whom require special medical treatment not available in their first country of asylum, are vital, the agencies said. More than 30 countries take part in the programme, which starts with vetting by the UNHCR. The agencies said they hope the U.S. will continue its strong leadership role and long tradition of protecting those who are fleeing conflict and persecution. Some 25,000 refugees were resettled in the United States between October and year-end under the UNHCRs programme for the most vulnerable, the agency said on Friday. A host of U.S. federal government agencies are involved and extensive background checks are carried out, UNHCR spokeswoman Vannina Maestracci told a briefing. I think its fair to say that refugees coming into the United States to be resettled are some of the most vetted individuals entering the United States, she said. The IOM wants migration to be legal, safe and secure for all, including for destination countries, spokesman Joel Millman said.  So we hope 90 days is a temporary time and we stand ready to assist any way we can, Millman told Reuters Television. Were concerned that any delay might force some people to start from the beginning but generally speaking its a long, long process and probably 90 days is something most people will be willing to wait because they have been waiting years already.

Speaking at a joint news conference in Paris with his German counterpart Sigmar Gabriel, French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said many of Trumps decisions worried the two U.S. allies, including new immigration restrictions. Trump on Friday signed an executive order that will curb immigration and refugees from some Muslim-majority countries and he separately said he wanted the United States to give priority to Syrian Christians fleeing the civil war there. This can only worry us, but there are many subjects that worry us, Ayrault said, adding that he would soon invite his future American counterpart Rex Tillerson to Paris to explain Europes interests, values and vision of the world. Welcoming refugees who flee war and oppression is part of our duty, Ayrault said. Germany has taken in more than one million refugees and migrants, mainly from the Middle East, since 2015. Although traditionally open to asylum seekers, France has taken in far fewer refugees than Germany since the migrant crisis erupted. Some in the French government, mostly ex-premier Manuel Valls, criticizing Berlins open-door policy, as has Trump.  The United States is a country where Christian traditions have an important meaning. Loving your neighbor is a major Christian value, and that includes helping people, said Germanys Gabriel, who was on his first trip abroad since his nomination as foreign minister.  I think that is what unites us in the West, and I think that is what we want to make clear to the Americans. Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn said Trumps order would have negative consequences. The American president is dividing the Muslim world into good and evil with this, Asselborn told the Tagesspiegel German newspaper. The decision is also bad for Europe because it will increase the Muslim worlds mistrust and hatred of the West. The two countries also reiterated their position on Russian sanctions, saying they could only be lifted if progress was made in the peace process for eastern Ukraine, where a pro-Russian separatist insurgency began in 2014. They joined British Prime Minister Theresa May in cautioning Trump against premature moves on the issue.  Lets not forget there was a war, that Russia sought to take over parts of Ukraine, Ayrault said. Trump said on Friday he was only in the early stages of considering whether to lift U.S. sanctions on Russia, but insisted he wanted to follow through on his campaign pledge to pursue better relations with Russia. The French and German ministers also said the United Nations remained the best framework to lead peace talks about Syria in the aftermath of Russian-led efforts in the Kazakh capital Astana that some diplomats say might undermine the UN process. Separately, Germany and France are also continuing to work on creating a joint tactical airlift pool of Lockheed Martin Corp C-130J military transport planes, a spokesman for the German defense ministry said on Saturday. He could not confirm a report in Der Spiegel news magazine that the two countries expected to complete work on the deal and present it to U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis at a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels next month. The magazine said German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen hoped to present the joint airlift as evidence of Germanys willingness to contribute more to NATO.

But as congressional Republicans gathered for an annual policy retreat in Philadelphia on Wednesday, the 100-day goal morphed into 200 days. As the week wore on, leaders were saying it could take until the end of 2017 - or possibly longer - for passage of final legislation. Trump had a different idea when he spoke to lawmakers in Philadelphia, telling them: Enough talk. Time to deliver. The divergent views on the timetable were among many indications of tensions that simmered just below the surface at the three-day Republican retreat. Before the cameras, Trump and Republicans sought to convey an image of a happy, unified family, playing down differences over tax policy, whether to reinstate torture interrogation techniques and investigating 2016 election fraud. And clearly there is none of the open warfare that has sometimes erupted among Republicans, such as when Senator Ted Cruz infuriated many of his colleagues by leading a standoff over Obamacare that partially shut down the government in 2013. But barely visible in Philadelphia, there are potential flashpoints of disagreement within the Republican rank-and-file in Congress as well as between Republican lawmakers and the unorthodox new president. These include how and when to replace Obamacare if Republicans succeed in their quest to repeal it; how to revamp the multi-layered tax code, whether to build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico and the nature of the U.S. relationship with Russia. When it comes to tax reform, senior congressional aides said the spring of 2018 might be a more likely time than this year for the passage of legislation. Republican lawmakers lavished praise on Trump in public. In dozens of interviews, many said they felt he would be an energetic champion of issues they cared about. But some also voiced fears that his big agenda would drive up deficits and said they were still searching for details on his plans. Several Republican lawmakers and aides said they were wary of the cost of his plan to build a wall on the border with Mexico. Republican leaders have said the wall proposal under discussion would cost $12 billion to $15 billion cost but some congressional aides say it could end up easily topping $20 billion. Republican Representative Will Hurd, whose Texas district partially borders Mexico, went a step further, calling the wall an ineffective tool for stopping illegal immigration. Others warned a border adjustment tax on foreign goods to pay for that wall could hurt U.S. companies profits, raise costs for American consumers and spark retaliation by foreign trading partners. Some lawmakers also worry that some of their constituents could be at risk of losing healthcare coverage if the push to repeal Obamacare moves too quickly. Republican Representative Tom Cole said rank-and-file lawmakers have an incentive to fall in line behind Trump. You dont want to be the reason why we werent successful in getting these things done, he said. Still, Cole said Republicans are taking stock of the potential cost of the biggest items on Trumps agenda such as the wall, infrastructure projects, tax cuts and beefing up military spending. I think they worry about it, Cole said.  Following Trumps speech to the lawmakers on Thursday, Senator James Risch said that no decisions had been made on the replacement of Obamacare, a complex law that has expanded healthcare insurance to millions of Americans. Its going to take a while to resolve it, Risch said. Asked by reporters whether Republicans had a clear idea of what Trump would like to replace Obamacare with, Risch responded, In detail, no.

Life is winning again in America, Pence told the demonstrators on the National Mall, near where Trump was sworn in a week ago before hundreds of thousands. The March for Life took place in the same area where even more massive crowds flooded Washington a day after Trumps inauguration in favor of womens rights, including abortion rights. Pence, a longtime hero of the anti-abortion movement, is the most senior government official to speak in person at the rally, organizers said. As governor of Indiana, he signed what were seen as some of the nations strictest abortion laws. Pence praised the election of pro-life majorities in the Congress of the United States of America, Trumps upcoming nomination of an anti-abortion Supreme Court justice, and the presidents reinstatement on Monday of a policy that cuts off U.S. funding to healthcare providers that promote or provide abortions overseas.    Its the best day Ive ever seen for the March of Life, he said.  Trump senior aide Kellyanne Conway was one of many women to address the demonstrators before they started their march from the Mall to the U.S. Supreme Court, about 1.5 miles (2 km) away. We hear you. We see you. We respect you, Conway said. And we look forward to working with you. Protesters hoisted signs saying Choose life, I am the pro-life generation, and Equal Rights For Unborn People. A Christian rock band warmed up the crowd for Pence, leading people in hand-clapping at the rally within sight of the White House. Were here to stand up for the unborn because no one else can, and having Donald Trump in the White House makes everyone more enthusiastic, said Jim Kolar, 59, of West Palm Beach, Florida. Organizers had no immediate estimate of crowd size, but the march to the Supreme Court after the rally filled the street for many blocks amid chants of We love babies, yes, we do, we love babies, how bout you? This is good, this is a good turnout, said the Rev. Kevin Cusick, a Catholic priest from Benedict, Maryland, who has been coming to the marches off and on for more than 40 years. The March for Life is held each year close to the anniversary of the courts Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion in 1973. Trump has said Roe v. Wade should be overturned and has vowed to appoint an anti-abortion justice to fill the Supreme Court seat left vacant by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia last year. He also has pledged to defund Planned Parenthood, which draws the ire of many Republicans because it provides abortions, along with other services.  Abortion rights supporters say cutting off funding for abortion providers will prevent poor women from getting other critical heath care and birth control that could prevent unwanted pregnancies. The rally comes as the number of U.S. abortions has fallen to a record low. The Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health and rights organization, said last week that it dropped below 1 million in 2013 for the first time since 1975. A Quinnipiac University poll released on Friday showed that 64 percent of Americans say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 31 percent said it should be illegal in all or most cases. Anti-abortion forces are often inspired by a religious conviction that life begins at conception and see abortion as murder. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

According to a draft executive order published by The Daily Beast, Trump wants a committee - including his secretary of state, attorney general and director of national intelligence -to carry out a one-year review of U.S. funding to international organizations with the aim of almost halving voluntary funding. A senior U.S. administration official said on Friday that no such executive order was expected at this time. The United States is the largest contributor to the United Nations, paying 22 percent of the $5.4 billion core U.N. budget and 28 percent of the $7.9 billion U.N. peacekeeping budget.

The order temporarily suspends the United States main refugee program and halts visas being issued to citizens of several predominantly Muslim countries, including Iraq. It is expected to affect two programs U.S. lawmakers created a few years after the 2003 invasion of Iraq to help the tens of thousands of Iraqis who risked their lives helping Americans. Trump says the order is necessary to prevent Islamist militants from coming to the United States posing as refugees, but refugee advocacy groups say the lengthy screening of applicants by multiple U.S. agencies makes this fear unfounded. Iraqis coming to the United States under the Special Immigrant Visa program for Iraqis, which stopped accepting new applications in 2014, or the ongoing Direct Access Program for U.S.-Affiliated Iraqis are losing hope of ever getting out.  Mr. Trump, the new president, killed our dreams, said one Baghdad man whose wife worked for the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) as a bookkeeper. I dont have any hope to go to the United States, he said in a telephone interview, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by Iraqs Sunni and Shia militant groups  and also of unfavorable treatment by the Trump administration. More than 7,000 Iraqis, many of them interpreters for the U.S. military, have resettled in the United States under the Special Immigrant Visa program since 2008, while another 500 or so are still being processed, according to State Department figures. Another 58,000 Iraqis were awaiting interviews under the Direct Access program, according to the International Refugee Assistance Project. Tens of thousands have already arrived under the second program, but no recent total was available.   A lot of translators were trying to get the hell out of there because they had a mark on their head for working with U.S. forces, Allen Vaught, a former U.S. Army captain who went to Fallujah in western Iraq in 2003, said in a telephone interview. Theyre viewed as collaborators. He fears the order would endanger American troops by making it harder to recruit local support in war zones, a belief echoed by several advocacy groups working on behalf of Americas Iraqi employees.  While in Iraq, Vaught employed five local interpreters who initially earned $5 a week traveling with troops, sometimes without weapons or armor. He helped two of the interpreters come to the United States as refugees with their families, putting them up initially in his home in Dallas, Texas. Another two were executed by militia groups, he said.  The fifth was still mired in the refugee screening process, which can last months or years even after the initial interview. Vaught had expected to also welcome him into his home this year before he had seen a draft of Trumps order. This executive order is based on ignorance and fear, he said. And you do not lead a country with ignorance and fear. In Baghdad, the Iraqi man waiting for a visa recalled U.S, soldiers had laughed at his concerns, telling him the United States is too big a democracy to be changed on the decision of one person like Trump, he said. But he now wonders if the soldiers were right. In 2013, a USAID official encouraged his family to apply as refugees under the Direct Access program. He checked in every week or so, but is still waiting word on an appointment at the U.S. consulate for the necessary interview. The same year he filed his application, he was shot in the head while driving to work, hospitalizing him for a month and leaving him deaf in one ear. He connected that to the threats that had often flashed as text messages on his cellphone, sent by Islamist militants angered by his wifes work for USAID. Others in Iraq remained hopeful they would eventually get out.  An Iraqi man who worked for a U.S. defense contractor and later alongside U.S. troops as a mid-ranking Iraqi Army officer, recalled his excitement at getting the phone call a few weeks ago telling him that his family had an interview appointment at the U.S. consulate after two years and four applications.   He was hopeful it would still take place in mid-February, believing that American officials would be concerned about the threats to his family. He was unaware that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday temporarily halted trips by staff to interview applicants. I believe this is politics, things you hear on the news, he told Reuters by phone from Baghad on condition of anonymity. I dont think they would prevent Iraqis coming to America.

Trump has said in the past that, as part of a rapprochement he is seeking with Russia, he is prepared to review sanctions that his predecessor, Barack Obama, imposed on Russia over its 2014 annexation of Ukraines Crimea Peninsula. That move would face resistance from both influential figures in Washington and foreign leaders who believe sanctions should only be eased if Moscow complies with the Wests conditions on Ukraine. Among the U.S. sanctions causing the most pain to Russia are those targeting its financial services, limiting the Russian economys ability to raise debt, and its energy companies.  On the same day he speaks to Putin, Trump will have telephone conversation with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande, White House spokesman Sean Spicer wrote in a Tweet. Both Hollande and Merkel have argued that it is premature to ease the sanctions. Trump senior aide Kellyanne Conway said in U.S. television interviews on Friday that Trump and Putin would likely discuss a range of issues, including joint efforts to combat terrorism.  Asked on FOX Newss Fox & Friends program to comment on suggestions that the Obama administration sanctions would be on the agenda, Conway said: All of that is under consideration. The call will be the first between the Russian and U.S. leaders since Putin called Trump to congratulate him on his election victory in November.  It is a first step towards what Trump has billed as a normalization of relations after three years of tensions sparked by the conflict in Ukraine. Trump and Putin have never met and it was unclear how their very different personalities would gel. Trump is a flamboyant real estate deal-maker who often acts on gut instinct, while Putin is a former Soviet spy who calculates each step methodically. Both have spoken about ending the enmity that has dragged U.S.-Russia relations to their lowest ebb since the Cold War.     Wouldnt it be nice if we actually got along with people? Wouldnt it be nice if we actually got along, as an example, with Russia? I am all for it, Trump told a news conference in July last year. Trump is under intense scrutiny at home from critics who say he was elected with help from Russian intelligence  an allegation he denies  and that he is too ready to cut deals with a country that many of his own officials say is a threat to U.S. security. Putins spokesman Dmitry Peskov, said the Russian leader would use the call to congratulate Trump on taking office and to exchange views on U.S.-Russian ties. Asked by reporters if Ukraine would come up, Peskov said: This is the first telephone contact since President Trump took office, so one should hardly expect that (it)...will involve substantive discussions across the whole range of issues.  Well see, lets be patient. If Putin and Trump can establish a rapport, it could pave the way for deals on Ukraine and Syria, two sources of friction during the administration of Barack Obama. For the Russian leader, there is much to gain. Putin is expected to run for re-election next year, but is hampered by a sluggish economy. A softening or removal of sanctions would allow Western investment and credit to flow in, lifting growth and strengthening Putins election prospects. Any move by Trump to ease sanctions would create a dilemma for the European Union, which has its own set of sanctions against Russia linked to the Ukraine crisis. Some governments in Europe are sympathetic with Trumps stance and keen for relief from sanctions that are hurting trade with Russia. Others in the bloc believe Moscow has not met the conditions for the sanctions to be lifted. Merkel, who faces a re-election battle, has invested considerable political capital in keeping the EU aligned behind the sanctions. A German diplomat told Reuters last month: If Trump lifts the sanctions, I fear the consensus in Europe would crumble. Merkel and French President Francois Hollande met in Berlin on Friday, underlining the challenges for European unity in the face of a new U.S. president who has promised to shake up the status quo in international affairs. Lets say it honestly, there is the challenge posed by the new U.S. administration, regarding trade rules and what our position will be on managing conflicts in the world, Hollande, who will leave office after an April-May election, told reporters.

The call between Trump and Enrique Pena Nieto came a day after the Mexican president scrapped a meeting set for next week at the White House over Trumps demand that Mexico pay for a multibillion-dollar wall along the lengthy southern U.S. border with Mexico. Mexico insists it will not pay for it. Both countries issued statements saying Trump and Pena Nieto recognized their clear differences of opinion on the payment demand, and agreed to settle the matter as part of a broader discussion on all aspects of the two nations relationship. Financial markets took news of the call as a sign that the crisis in U.S-Mexican relations just days after Trump took office had eased. Mexicos peso rose on the news. Mexicos government statement said Trump and Pena Nieto agreed not to talk publicly for now about payment for the wall. The White House did not immediately clarify whether Trump had agreed not to publicly discuss how the wall would be paid for. During a joint news conference at the White House with visiting British Prime Minister Theresa May after the call, Trump did not mention the wall even as he spoke expansively about U.S. relations with Mexico. As you know, Mexico - with the United States - has out-negotiated us and beat us to a pulp through our past leaders. Theyve made us look foolish, Trump told the news conference. We have a trade deficit of $60 billion with Mexico. On top of that, the border is soft and weak, drugs are pouring in, added Trump, who during the U.S. presidential campaign accused Mexico of sending rapists and other criminals into the United States. The United States had a $58.8 billion trade deficit with its southern neighbor in the 11 months ending last November. Trump called his hour long talk with Pena Nieto very, very friendly, said he has a very good relationship with him and expressed great respect for Mexico. Mexico and the White House both called the meeting productive and constructive. Nevertheless, Trump showed no signs of backing off pledges to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Mexico and Canada and slap high tariffs on American companies that have moved jobs south of the border. Mexico sends 80 percent of its exports to the United States, and about half of Mexicos foreign direct investment over the past two decades has come from its northern neighbor. We are going to be working on a fair relationship and a new relationship with Mexico, Trump told the news conference with May. But the United States cannot continue to lose vast amounts of business, vast amounts of companies and millions and millions of people losing their jobs. That wont happen with me. Trump said the United States will renegotiate trade deals and other aspects of Americas relationship with Mexico, adding, And in the end I think it will be good for both countries. U.S. congressional leaders said on Thursday they would take up legislation to provide $12 billion to $15 billion to pay for the wall. Trump, who has insisted that Mexico will reimburse the United States for the entire cost, signed a directive on Wednesday for the wall to proceed, part of a package of measures aimed at curbing illegal immigration. The wall plan has angered Mexicans, and Trumps policies toward Mexico have put Pena Nieto on the defensive. The Republican president views the wall, a major promise during his election campaign, as part of a package of measures to curb illegal immigration. Mexico has long insisted it will not heed Trumps demands to pay for the construction project.  On Thursday, White House spokesman Sean Spicer sent the Mexican peso falling when he told reporters that Trump wanted a 20 percent tax on Mexican imports to pay for the wall. Spicer gave few details, but his comments resembled an existing idea, known as a border adjustment tax, that the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives is considering as part of a broad tax overhaul. Trump said in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network on Friday that there were options besides an import tax that could be much more positive for both countries. The White House said Fridays call also covered the importance of the friendship between the two nations, and the need for the two nations to work together to stop drug cartels, drug trafficking and illegal guns and arms sales. Mexicos government said the U.S. trade deficit also came up. In Mexico City, billionaire Mexican businessman Carlos Slim  said a united Mexico was ready to help the government negotiate with Trump and called on all political parties to support Pena Nieto in his discussions with the U.S. president. In a rare news conference by the generally media-shy mogul, Slim said Mexico needed to negotiate from a position of strength, noting that Trump, who he called a great negotiator, represented a major change in how politics will be conducted.

Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski said members of the Latin American trade bloc the Pacific Alliance must double down on efforts to open markets and strengthen ties as they navigate the turbulent waters of protectionist rhetoric. Peru, Colombia, Chile and Mexico formed the Pacific Alliance in 2011 to remove obstacles to trade and orient their markets to the fast-growing Asia-Pacific region. Right now one of us is facing serious difficulties that are not of its own making, Kuczynski said in reference to Mexico as he sat beside his Colombian counterpart on an official visit. We have to stand together on our ideals, on global trade which has done us so much good. Though Kuczynski did not mention Trump by name, his comments were some of the first rumblings of displeasure with the Trump administration from traditional U.S. allies in Latin America. Trump has insisted he will force Mexico to pay for a wall between the two countries to curb illegal immigration and drug trafficking. He has also threatened to slap taxes on Mexican imports and tear up the regional trade deal NAFTA if he cannot renegotiate it to ensure more benefits for the United States. The Mexican peso has been rocked by tensions between the two countries, firming on Friday after Trump said he had a friendly phone call with Mexican President Pena Nieto. There are clouds of uncertainty around the world, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said. We want to join the call of countries that adhere to the principles that have been so good for the world: free trade, respect for treaties... multilateral solutions. Santos said he spoke with Pena Nieto by phone on Thursday, when the Mexican leader announced he canceled a meeting with Trump as a diplomatic crisis over the proposed wall deepened. Kuczynski, a former investment banker who spent years living in the United States, said the four countries in the Pacific Alliance represent a market of some 200 million people and that each has emerged from economic crisis in the past by opening markets to global trade. Of course there are costs to global trade, of course there are job losses, but its also clear that the benefits are bigger, Kuczynski said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

From billionaire business magnate Carlos Slim to political opponents, there has been a groundswell of support for Pena Nieto, who has cut a lonely figure in months of bruising encounters with Trump. Often referred to by his initials EPN, Pena Nieto is laboring under the worst approval ratings of any Mexican president in decades due to discontent over corruption, gang violence, sluggish growth and a jump in fuel prices.     Trumps threats to scrap the NAFTA trade deal with Mexico and build a border wall have caused anger and left Mexicans feeling fearful for the future. His challenge to Pena Nieto on Thursday - saying he should skip a planned summit between the two leaders if Mexico wasnt willing to pay for the wall - was the final straw. Pena Nieto replied a couple of hours later that he had canceled his meeting with Trump, one of the presidents biggest ever hits on Twitter, getting more likes than when he personally broke news of the capture of notorious drug lord Joaquin El Chapo Guzman in January of last year. Bravo EPN!, cheered former President Vicente Fox, who had initially condemned Pena Nieto for inviting Trump to Mexico for talks last August, and who has waged a colorful and expletive-ridden campaign against the Republican on Twitter. Pena Nieto and Trump talked for about an hour by phone on Friday, pledging to work out their differences and agreeing not to speak about the wall in public for now. Meanwhile, calls for unity grew in Mexico, led by Slim, a normally media-shy 76-year-old who gave a 90-minute news conference in support of the government on Friday. This is the most surprising example of national unity Ive seen in my life, said Slim, who spent several years in the past decade as the worlds richest man. We have to back the president of Mexico so he can defend our national interests. Senior opposition leaders also urged a common front. Its time to show unity and our commitment to Mexico, Alejandra Barrales, head of the center-left Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), said on Twitter. Pena Nietos credibility has been battered by a widespread public perception that he has failed to battle corruption and indeed even encouraged it since a conflict-of-interest row embroiled him, his wife and a top minister in late 2014. Some opposition critics fear the government will try to use Trump as a screen to distract from its failings. However, two senior officials told Reuters they hoped Pena Nieto would seize the moment to act quickly and decisively to improve his image. Expressions of dismay at Trumps behavior towards Mexico have almost become a national pastime, and talk of boycotts against U.S. companies is gathering steam on social media. Slim, when asked about boycotting at his news conference, said it wasnt a good idea to turn on U.S. companies, which are creating jobs in Mexico. Some foreign companies voiced support for Mexico too. I feel Mexico is being subjected to terror at the moment, said Andreas Schindler, co-owner of German fruit wholesaler Don Limons parent Pilz Schindler, by phone from Hamburg.

In a rare news conference, the telecommunications and construction mogul called Trump a negotiator, not Terminator and said his repeated attacks on Mexico had united the country, giving President Enrique Pena Nieto strength in trade and border security talks. This is the most surprising example of national unity that Ive had the pleasure of seeing in my life, said Slim, who turns 77 on Saturday. He compared Mexicans response to that when a devastating earthquake that hit Mexico City in 1985. We have to back the president of Mexico so he defends our national interests. Slim spoke to reporters after Pena Nieto on Thursday canceled a planned Washington summit with Trump following a tweet by the American that he should stay away unless Mexico agreed to pay for a border wall. Aiming to cool tensions, the two presidents spoke for an hour by phone on Friday, and the battered peso currency strengthened. Trumps threats to impose steep tariffs on Mexican products have ravaged the peso and spread worries about the economy, which is heavily dependent on the U.S. market.  However, Slim, who spoke out against his fellow billionaire during the U.S. election campaign but had dinner with him after the Nov. 8 victory at the polls, said Trumps policies aimed at growing the U.S. economy would boost Mexicos growth as well as provide jobs for Mexican laborers living north of the border.     The circumstances in the United States are very favorable for Mexico, Slim said, adding that he has not had any communication with Trumps team since the December dinner. It wasnt a romance, he joked about the meeting. Referring repeatedly to Trumps books and other writings, Slim argued that people should not be surprised at Trumps actions because it is all in his book Great Again: How to Fix Our Crippled America, which Slim said he had not finished reading. Hes a great negotiator, Slim said. He said businesses should not be too worried if Trumps policies led to the collapse of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) underpinning Mexicos economy, saying the country could fall back on World Trade Organization tariffs. He said Mexican workers in the United States would benefit from Trumps planned infrastructure push, but warned that U.S. protectionism and other policies could hurt American consumers.  Among these changes is a return to the past, what a dear friend called regressive utopias, he said, calling on the United States to focus on advanced manufacturing. Asked about Trumps plan to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, Slim said the best barrier to illegal immigration would be investment that created opportunities and jobs in Mexico. Before the highly-anticipated news conference, speculation had been growing about whether Slim might try to run for president in 2018, but he poured cold water on that talk. I think I can do more on the business side, he said. Slims largest companies do not have much obvious exposure to any border tax Trump might impose on Mexican imports. His high-profile holding in the New York Times Co, made him a target during the U.S. campaign, when Trump accused him of using the newspaper to try to help Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton. Slims shares have limited voting rights. Slim on Friday said he had been selling New York Times stock, but his son-in-law later said this was not correct. At the conference he was flanked by two of his sons, Carlos and Marco Antonio, and his son-in-law, Arturo Elias, with other family members watching. Most of the Slim familys wealth comes from Latin America-focused telecoms giant America Movil. America Movil does have a substantial U.S. business called TracFone which sells prepaid phone plans to customers and rents the networks of big operators. His next largest companies are retail and industrial conglomerate Grupo Carso and Mexico-focused bank Grupo Financiero Inbursa. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - New Jersey prosecutors on Friday said they would not pursue criminal misconduct charges against Governor Chris Christie in connection with the Bridgegate scandal. The Office of the Bergen County Prosecutor said in a letter to a local judge it did not have sufficient evidence to prove allegations that Christie knew about a plot to close lanes at the George Washington Bridge in 2013 in order to punish a local mayor for failing to endorse Christies re-election bid. The reason is simple, but compelling - that charge cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, the letter said. Bill Brennan, a retired firefighter and activist who announced he would run for governor this year, filed the citizen complaint against Christie last September. Two former Christie allies were convicted last year of orchestrating the lane closure plot, and U.S. prosecutors introduced evidence at trial suggesting the governor was at least aware of the scheme. Christie has steadfastly denied that he knew about the closures at the time. Roy McGeady, a municipal judge in Fort Lee, had found probable cause to allow the case against Christie to proceed after a hearing at which Brennan testified. Christies lawyer was not permitted to argue or cross-examine, McGeady said, because the governor was not a defendant until probable cause was established. Bergen County Superior Court Judge Bonnie Mizdol rejected Christies subsequent request to toss the complaint outright. But she agreed with both Christies lawyers and county prosecutors that McGeady erroneously denied the governors attorney an opportunity to participate. The Bergen County Prosecutors Office said in the letter that citizen complaints typically allege minor crimes of which the complainant has personal knowledge. The letter said criminal misconduct was far outside that scope. In short, a matter of this gravity should not have been heard by a municipal court judge, the letter said. Brian Murray, a spokesman for Christie, applauded the decision on Friday. The Governor is gratified that the Bergen County Prosecutors Office has ended this baseless fiasco began by Mr. Brennan and perpetuated by Judge McGeady, Murray said in a statement. It is right and appropriate that this injustice against the Governor is finally over. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

But private bankers who work with the ultra rich say that if they had a dollar for every time a client forgot about a million, they would be, well, almost as rich as their clients. We see it all the time, with new clients, said Chris Walters of GenSpring Family Offices, SunTrust Bank Incs (STI.N) branch for clients with more than $50 million in assets. Its not that they are surprised they own the asset. They just omitted it in the inventory. Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) partner who is Trumps pick to lead the U.S. Treasury Department, was grilled by members of the Senate last week for inadvertently failing to disclose more than $100 million in real estate. On Tuesday, the nominee for head of the budget office, Mick Mulvaney, said he did not realize he needed to pay $15,000 in federal taxes for a nanny until scrutinizing his finances more closely for confirmation proceedings.  Trump himself said in an interview with Reuters last March that he does not pay much attention to his own investments in hedge funds and mutual funds. I have no idea how they are doing. I dont really care, Trump said. Im in a lot of things. I may be in a few funds. I have no idea if they are up or down. I just know that they have been very good over a period of time. Trumps lawyer Sheri Dillon has since said that he has liquidated all of his investments. Senate leadership has delayed confirmation hearings for three other wealthy Trump nominees to allow more time for nominees to file disclosures and to accommodate schedules. In response to questions about how people with millions or billions of dollars who hire experts to carefully tally their vast wealth could lose track of such big chunks of money, private bankers and family office managers said their clients simply live much more complicated financial lives than ordinary people. About one-in-five people with more than $25 million in assets hire advisers to take care of tasks like paying daily bills, managing staff at multiple homes and keeping track of assets around the globe, according to a report by research firm Spectrem. Advisers say their clients need this type of assistance because they work, socialize and travel too frequently to take care of mundane tasks themselves. Eileen Foley, head of Bank of New York Mellon Corps (BK.N) family office business, said that some clients want daily reports detailing every dollar that goes in and out of each account. They also ask for daily reports on investments, tangible assets, properties and liabilities. When a client is nominated for a position on the board of a public company or in government, this type of daily monitoring can help she said: Its not a fire drill. But even with that type of due diligence, clients often forget to mention assets held by multiple people, like limited partnerships. Those structures are harder for advisers to discover in financial statements, because they are often structured to keep ownership opaque. Mnuchin, for instance, failed to disclose around $900,000 worth of artwork held by his children, according to media reports. Mnuchin did not respond to requests for comment. He also did not initially disclose homes in New York, Los Angeles and Mexico. The complexity of a rich persons financial life usually builds over time as they acquire houses and collections and other belongings, advisers said. In many cases, if a client has not been forced to detail all their assets or confirm that every domestic employee has insurance coverage, then they probably have not done it, said Bill Woodson, head of North American family offices at Citigroup Incs (C.N) private bank. Its understandable why they forget, he said. It doesnt excuse it. (This story corrects spelling of flak in first paragraph). ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday he is only in the early stages of considering whether to lift U.S. sanctions on Russia, as British Prime Minister Theresa May, other foreign officials and U.S. lawmakers cautioned that such a move would be premature. With Trump expected to speak by phone on Saturday with Russian President Vladimir Putin for the first time since taking power a week ago, speculation has been rife that he is close to lifting sanctions imposed by then-President Barack Obama over Moscows annexation of Ukraines Crimea Peninsula in 2014. Such a move would likely cause consternation among European allies as well as many in the U.S. Congress who are also troubled by Russias intervention in the Syrian civil war and by U.S. intelligence agencies finding that Moscow meddled in the U.S. election campaign. As far as the sanctions, (it is) very early to be talking about that, Trump said, while insisting that he wanted to follow through on his campaign pledge to pursue better relations with Russia. His caution on the Russian sanctions came in response to a question at a joint news conference at the White House with May, the first foreign leader to visit the president since his inauguration. May made clear Britain wants to continue sanctions until Putin carries out the requirements in a ceasefire agreement arranged in Minsk, Belarus, in 2014. This view is shared by European allies who fear Putin could become more expansionist if he feels Trump will not intervene. We believe the sanctions should continue until we see the Minsk agreement fully implemented. And weve been continuing to argue that inside the European Union, May said. The boisterous Trump and reserved May took pains to demonstrate a readiness to maintain the special relationship between the United States and Britain, something that is particularly important for May as she steers Britain out of the European Union.  They posed for photos before a bust of Winston Churchill in the Oval Office and Trump accepted an invitation from Queen Elizabeth to visit Britain later this year. The two leaders held hands briefly as they walked down the White House colonnade to their news conference in the East Room. Later, they lunched on beef shortribs in the State Dining Room. At the news conference, Trump showed flashes of the pugnacious willingness to dispense with formality that helped him win the Nov. 8 election, registering his displeasure when a British reporter asked him what he had to say to those who are worried about you becoming the leader of the free world. This was your choice of a question? Trump said with a half smile. Then, nodding toward May as laughter erupted, he added: There goes that relationship. On ties with Moscow, Trump has long bucked establishment Washington thinking by voicing a belief that, as he said on Friday, it would be a tremendous asset to have a positive relationship with Russia. A long-time Putin critic, U.S. Senator John McCain, who like Trump is a Republican, urged Trump not to lift the sanctions, saying that he should reject such a reckless course. If he does not, I will work with my colleagues to codify sanctions against Russia into law, said McCain, a long-time Putin critic. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, the top U.S. elected Republican, told Politico of the sanctions that I think they should stay. Former NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen, now an adviser to Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, urged caution against reversing sanctions without winning concessions from Moscow, saying that, easing sanctions will only embolden Russias aggression in the region, putting the security interests of Ukraine and the United States in jeopardy. The White House encounter between Trump and May was heavily scrutinized for signs on how the relationship would develop between the leaders of two key members of the NATO alliance, who are markedly different in style but who both owe their rise to power to a tide of anti-establishment feeling in their countries. Im not as brash as you might think, Trump said at the news conference. Im a people person and I think you are too, Theresa. I think were going to have a fantastic relationship. Trump, a wealthy real estate developer and former reality TV star, had never held public office when he was elected in November. May stepped in to lead Britain after the June referendum Brexit vote to leave the EU that prompted her Conservative predecessor, David Cameron, to resign. It was notable that Trump did not give much in the way of vocal support for NATO, which he has previously declared obsolete. It was left up to May to issue support for NATO in her opening remarks at their news conference, and to encourage Trumps backing.On defense and security cooperation, we are united in our recognition of NATO as the bulwark of our collective defense, she said. Today weve reaffirmed our unshakeable commitment to this alliance  Mr. President I think you confirmed that you are 100 percent behind NATO.  (This version of the story has been refiled to clarify in 14th and 15th paragraphs on McCains remark on Trump and lifting of sanction; clarifying to show that comment if he does not refers to rejection of a reckless course.

The freeze has led to widespread concerns in states and cities about potential delays in efforts to monitor and clean up toxic pollution, particularly lead pollution in drinking water, that would put the health of Americans at risk. The agency allocates nearly $4 billion annually on projects ranging from cleaning up polluted industrial sites to testing air and water for toxins. Doug Ericksen, a former Washington state senator who is the EPAs new communications director, said in an email that $3.8 billion of the $3.9 billion in contracts and grants was cleared on Wednesday night.The remainder should be cleared today. There might be a very small number left for Monday, but not likely. The EPA has not issued any news releases about ending the freeze, which has led to uncertainty.  On Thursday, a day after Ericksen said the vast majority of the contracts and grants were cleared, five Democratic senators, including Edward Markey and Tom Carper, wrote a letter to Trump with alarm urging him to immediately reverse this troubling action.     Ericksen said they should rest assured. No projects are delayed or cut. None. Not sure how much more clear I can be, he said in the email. U.S. Representative Dan Kildee from Flint, Michigan, home to the lead poisoning crisis in drinking water, also wrote to Trump this week asking when the freeze would be lifted.

But Kildee was uncertain whether contracts and grants centering on testing and expertise about the lead crisis would be delayed. A Kildee spokesman said on Friday that the congressman had still not gotten a written response to his letter from Trump or the EPA.  The EPA sent employees an internal memo late on Friday, seen by Reuters that said it was making progress in lifting the freeze, which it called standard practice during a transition. As of today, we have completed review of our grant programs, the memo said. The review of contracts is nearly complete, with very few contracts still under review, the memo said, without elaborating.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The news comes as Cuba watchers are looking closely for signs of how the United States fragile detente with Cuba will fare under President Donald Trump. Trump has threatened to scrap moves to normalize relations, one of former President Barack Obamas signature foreign policy initiatives, if he doesnt get a better deal. Disappointed some (Florida ports) would enter into any agreement with Cuban dictatorship, Scott wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. I will recommend restricting state funds for ports that work with Cuba in my budget. Port authorities along the U.S. Southern coast are strong proponents of increased trade and travel with Cuba, and some have expressed interest in using Mariel, located on the northwest coast of the Caribbean island, as a transshipment hub. The Ports of Everglades and Palm Beach had been planning to sign agreements with Cuba during the visit of a Cuban trade delegation this week but said they decided to withdraw the deals. Port of Everglades spokeswoman Ellen Kennedy said this move would not impact trade with Cuba, which was conducted by tenants rather than the ports themselves. One of Port Everglades tenants, Crowley Maritime Corporation, has been exporting U.S.-made goods including poultry and medicine to Cuba since obtaining a license to do so from the Office of Foreign Asset Control in late 2001.  On Tuesday, Crowley also imported two containers of charcoal from Cuba, the first direct legal import from Cuba to the United States in more than half a century. Kennedy said the memorandum of understanding had been  designed to be a good will gesture to form a strong alliance with Cuban ports. Cuba and the United States have restored diplomatic ties and signed various cooperation agreements since Obama agreed with Cuban President Raul Castro in December 2014 to work to normalize relations. Obama, a Democrat, used executive orders to circumvent the longstanding U.S. trade embargo on Cuba and ease some restrictions on travel and business. The embargo can only be lifted by the U.S. Congress, which is controlled by Republicans. Trump, who can reverse Obamas executive orders, has threatened to end the detente if Cuba does not make further political and other concessions, although he has not specified what these should be.

When word swirled through Washington on Thursday that Trump might be preparing to ease U.S. sanctions on Russia, worried European diplomats began calling the National Security Council and asking if the rumors were true, said a former U.S. official familiar with the situation. The White House officials could not answer their questions because they, too, have been kept in the dark, said the former official, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.Trumps new United Nations ambassador, Nikki Haley, sent another shiver through Americas allies on Friday, warning them that if they do not have Washingtons back, she is taking names and will respond. Trumps foreign policy is totally unpredictable, said a senior official of the 28-nation European Union, which Trump has said is bound for a break-up. Defense Secretary James Mattis and Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson have said all the right things, the EU official said. But this could be like the Iraq war policy all over again, when we saw how a segment of government decides policy, not the secretary of state. Another Western diplomat said foreign ambassadors were explaining their countries positions to Congress in the hope that they would find their way to the White House. Other countries are expanding their lobbying efforts. At the end of last year, Ukraine signed a $50,000-a-month lobbying contract with Haley Barbour, a former Republican chairman and Mississippi governor. In January, the government-run China Council for the Promotion of International Trade hired Husch Blackwell LLP, to lobby about the importation of stainless steel, according to records filed with the Department of Justice.  Some uncertainty is normal when a new U.S. president finds his footing and voice on foreign affairs and installs his people in policy-making slots. But in the week since his inauguration, Trump has sent a blizzard of conflicting signals, and key slots at the State and Defense departments and the NSC remain vacant. Were trying to figure out who is who, one European diplomat said, referring to efforts to determine whether long-standing tenets of U.S. foreign policy still apply. One of President Trumps first major meetings, with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, was canceled due to Trumps demand Mexico pay for a border wall he plans to build. The two spoke by telephone on Friday after the cancellation. Trump said Wednesday he would back safe zones for refugees in Syria, but gave no indication how he would coordinate this with Turkey, Russia and allies in Europe and the Middle East. Presidential spokesman Sean Spicers suggestion the United States would stop China from taking over territory in the South China Sea and Trumps Jan. 2 tweet that a threatened North Korean test of an intercontinental ballistic missile wont happen could raise the chances of a military confrontation, Asian officials said. Some commentators say its too soon for allies to panic. It is not appropriate to be too worried, but it is not appropriate not to worry at all, said Fumiaki Kubo, a professor of American government history at the University of Tokyo. A senior official from a member of the Five Eyes nations that make up the worlds leading intelligence-sharing network said it was still important to keep intelligence channels open with Washington. The grouping comprises the United States, Australia, Canada, Britain and New Zealand. We will continue to share intelligence with the Americans, who supply the majority of information that circulates among the Five Eyes. If we hold data back from them, they could decide to do the same to us, and then we would suffer much worse consequences. But others suggested that the greater the uncertainty and the longer it lasts, the greater the chances of miscalculations by other nations that could harm U.S. interests. The high geopolitical anxiety is most evident in East Asia, where Chinas ambitions are colliding with longstanding U.S. dominance in the Pacific. During his presidential campaign, Trump suggested Japan and South Korea, which rely on a U.S. security umbrella, should defend themselves or pay Washington more to do so. Defense secretary Mattis will make his first overseas trip next week to the two countries, a choice intended to send a reassurance message, a Trump administration official said. This is for all of the people who were concerned during the campaign that then-candidate, now President Trump was skeptical of our alliances and was somehow going to retreat from our traditional leadership role in the region, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Yet Mattis has voiced sharply different opinions from Trump on key questions, including the value of the NATO alliance and the threat from Russia, and that has led officials in Tokyo and Seoul to wonder who speaks for U.S. policy. Trump took a call from President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan, which Beijing considers a rogue province, and has questioned Washingtons decades-old adherence to the one China principle. Chinas attitude at the moment is very cautious, but that does not mean weak, said Shi Yinhong, who heads the Centre for American Studies at Beijings Renmin University and has advised the government. Allies, though, worry that instead of being based partly on shared values such as democracy, free trade, and the rule of law, their dealings with the United States might become transactional and start to resemble Trumps real estate deals.We are business people.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""PHILADELPHIA/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The White House on Thursday floated the idea of imposing a 20 percent tax on goods from Mexico to pay for a wall at the southern U.S. border, sending the peso tumbling and deepening a crisis between the two neighbors. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto announced on Twitter around midday on Thursday that he was scrapping a planned trip to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly demanded that Mexico pay for a wall on the U.S. border. Later in the day, White House spokesman Sean Spicer sent the Mexican peso falling to its low for the day when he told reporters that Trump wanted a 20 percent tax on Mexican imports to pay for construction of the wall. Spicer gave few details, but his comments resembled an existing idea, known as a border adjustment tax, that the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives is considering as part of a broad tax overhaul.  The White House said later its proposal was in the early stages. Asked if Trump favored a border adjustment tax, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said such a tax would be one way of paying for the border wall. Its a buffet of options, he said. The plan being weighed by House Republicans would exempt export revenues from taxation but impose a 20 percent tax on imported goods, a significant change from current U.S. policy. If you tax exports from Mexico into the United States, youre going to make things ranging from avocados to appliances to flat-screen tvs, youre going to make them more expensive, Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray told reporters at the Mexican Embassy in Washington on Thursday night. Countries like Mexico would not pay such taxes directly. Companies would face the tax if they import products made there into the United States, potentially raising prices for American consumers. The idea is unpopular with retailers and businesses that sell imported goods in the United States. It also has met opposition from some lawmakers worried about the impact on U.S. consumers. Trump himself appeared to pan the idea in a Wall Street Journal interview last week, saying the House border adjustment provision was too complicated. Even after Trumps comments, congressional Republicans have continued to discuss the issue with White House officials in an effort to bring them on board with the idea. Trump, who visited Republican lawmakers at their policy retreat in Philadelphia, told them he would use tax reform legislation to pay for the border wall. Were working on a tax reform bill that will reduce our trade deficits, increase American exports and will generate revenue from Mexico that will pay for the wall if we decide to go that route, he said. Trump, who took office last week, views the wall, a major promise during his election campaign, as part of a package of measures to curb illegal immigration. Mexico has long insisted it will not heed Trumps demands to pay for the construction project. He signed an executive order for construction of the wall on Wednesday. The move provoked outrage in Mexico. A planned meeting between Videgaray and U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly was canceled, a department spokeswoman said.  Videgaray said Mexico would work with Trump but that paying for the wall was out of the question. There are things that go beyond negotiation, he said. This is about our dignity and our pride. Pena Nieto, who had been under pressure to cancel the summit, tweeted on Thursday: We have informed the White House that I will not attend the working meeting planned for next Tuesday with @POTUS. Trump had tweeted earlier that it would be better for the Mexican leader not to come if Mexico would not pay for the wall. He said later the meeting was canceled by mutual agreement. Relations have been frayed since Trump launched his presidential campaign in 2015, characterizing Mexican immigrants as murderers and rapists. His trade rhetoric has hit the Mexican economy, causing consumers to rein in spending and foreign businesses to wait on new investments, according to the International Monetary Fund. Trump has vowed to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada and slap high tariffs on American companies that have moved jobs south of the border. Mexico ships 80 percent of its exports to the United States, and about half of Mexicos foreign direct investment has come from its northern neighbor over the past two decades. The United States runs a $58.8 billion trade deficit with Mexico, according to the latest U.S. government figures. But Mexico is also the United States second-largest export market.

Bills have been introduced over the past month in states including North Dakota, Indiana and Iowa that would impose measures such as harsher penalties for demonstrators who disrupt traffic, and scrapping punishment for drivers who unintentionally strike protesters blocking their vehicles. The push for stricter laws comes as opponents of Trump have vowed to take to the streets to demonstrate against his policies on issues ranging from immigration to abortion and climate change. Hundreds of thousands of people took part in womens marches on Jan. 21 in cities across the country. While the fate of the bills was not immediately clear, supporters say they sum up the frustration some people feel about protests that get in the way of their daily lives. People are just kind of sick and tired of this garbage, Nick Zerwas, a Republican state representative in Minnesota, said by telephone. If you block a freeway, you ought to go to jail and when you get out, you ought to get the bill. Zerwas has introduced two bills, one of which would increase the penalty for obstructing traffic to a gross misdemeanor, meaning offenders could face up to a year in jail and a $3,000 fine. The other would make protesters pay policing costs if their protests were deemed illegal or a nuisance by a court. In Iowa, Republican state senator Jake Chapman is the lead sponsor of a bill that would make it a felony to block traffic on roads with speed limits of 55 miles-per-hour (88 km) or more. Offenders would face up to five years in jail and a $7,500 fine. People are really fed up with it, Chapman said of the disruption caused by demonstrations.  He said his constituents were not against the protests as such, but that they did not want their travel affected. He said demonstrations should be held in appropriate places. Free speech advocates said the proposals are worrying.  Whats happening is a truly alarming spread of state legislation that, if passed, will have the intent or impact of criminalizing peaceful protests, said Lee Rowland, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union rights group.  The bills were unconstitutional right out of the gate, Rowland said, adding that protests should be seen as a success of representative democracy, not a problem to be solved. Gregory Magarian, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis School of Law, said the bills present a major First Amendment problem, referring to the section of the U.S. Constitution that guarantees the right to free expression. They (the lawmakers) are putting their petty ideologies over the principles of free speech, Magarian said. Defenders of the proposals, however, argue that they were formulated out of concern for public safety above all. One bill by Indiana Republican state senator Jim Tomes calls for police to use any means necessary to clear roads of people unlawfully blocking traffic no more than 15 minutes after law enforcement learns of the obstruction.  In an emailed statement, Tomes said he had no problem with protesters who apply for permits in advance. In North Dakota, where hundreds have been arrested during protests against a pipeline, a bill by Republican state Rep. Keith Kempenich would shield motorists from liability if they unintentionally hit a protester on a roadway, injuring or killing them.  Kempenich did not respond to requests for comment, but has said he introduced the bill after his mother-in-law was caught in a protest while driving.  Its shifting the burden of proof from the motor vehicle driver to the pedestrian, he told the Bismarck Tribune.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Fresh home from failed talks in Washington, Guajardo also expressed concern about Trumps unpredictability and habits on Twitter. President Enrique Pena Nieto on Thursday canceled a scheduled visit to the United States next week following Trumps insistence that Mexico respect the United States and pay for a new wall on the southern U.S. border.  Sincerely, there is clear disagreement at the moment because of a campaign promise he made that from the Mexican perspective is unacceptable, Guajardo told Mexican television network Televisa.  It is serious, because it leaves us at an impasse until we find a mechanism to resolve it, the minister said, adding that  Trump should not underestimate Mexicos resolve on the issue.  Mexicans are not going to pay. He said communication with Trumps team remained open.   The White House on Thursday floated the idea of imposing a 20 percent tax on goods from Mexico to pay for a wall at the southern U.S. border, sending the peso tumbling and deepening the crisis between the two neighbors. Guajardo said the United States and Mexico could reach mutually beneficial improvements to the North American Free Trade Agreement if the issue of paying for the wall was resolved.   Trump had tweeted on Thursday that it would be better for the Mexican leader not to come to Washington if Mexico would not pay for the wall. Guajardo joined Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray in meetings with White House senior officials on Wednesday. He said that the meetings had been productive, but that Trumps later tweet had forced Mexico to cancel due to the question of dignity.  That unpredictability of reaction creates problems, Guajardo said, referring to Trumps Thursday tweet even as he praised a constructive attitude of other members of Trumps team including Trump strategist Stephen Bannon.  Their attitude to work, to plan, to see solutions is extraordinary, Believe me Guajardo said.

Major human rights groups have denounced Trumps stance on torture and warned against restoring a CIA secret detention program for interrogating terror suspects. Trump is also reviewing spending, including at the U.N., where the United States is the largest donor. International human rights law is clear on the absolute prohibition on torture, U.N. human rights spokesman Rupert Colville told a news briefing. Pressed repeatedly to comment on Trumps remarks this week that torture works, Colville noted that prominent U.S. Senators including Republican John McCain, himself a torture victim, and Democrat Dianne Feinstein, who chaired an inquiry on the CIA program under former President George W. Bush, had spoken out. It was still very early days in terms of how the U.N. human rights office interacts with the new administration, he said.  We have to work out strategically what is going to be effective. The UNHCR was also tepid in its comments on Trumps moves to restrict refugees. He is expected to sign an executive order that would include a temporary ban on all refugees, and a suspension of visas for citizens of Syria and six other Middle Eastern and African countries. Of course UNHCR believes that refugees should be offered assistance, protection, opportunities for resettlement, regardless of their race, religion or ethnicity, UNHCR spokeswoman Vannina Maestracci said. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has temporarily halted trips by staff to interview refugees abroad ahead of a likely shakeup of refugee policy by Trump, two sources said on Thursday. During the election campaign, Trump decried former President Barack Obamas decision to increase the number of Syrian refugees admitted to the United States over fears that some fleeing the countrys civil war might carry out attacks. Some 25,000 refugees were resettled in the United States between October and year-end under UNHCRs program for the most vulnerable, Maestracci said. A host of U.S. federal government agencies are involved and extensive background checks are carried out, she said.

The decision effectively amounts to a pause in future refugee admissions, given that the interviews are a crucial step in an often years-long process. The DHS leaderships decision to halt the interview trips was communicated to those involved in the U.S. refugee admission process on Wednesday, one of the sources said.  It means that though Trump has not yet ordered a temporary  halt to the refugee program, future admissions are likely to be delayed.  Trump is expected to sign an executive order that would include a temporary ban on all refugees, and a suspension of visas for citizens of Syria and six other Middle Eastern and African countries. White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters on Thursday that Trump could sign several executive orders on Friday, but that the nature of those had not been decided yet. Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project at the New York-based Urban Justice Center, said she was informed of the decision to halt the overseas interviews by several people in and outside of government. Gillian Christensen, a spokeswoman for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security and which conducts the interviews, said the agency had delayed a number of upcoming trips but that they had not been officially canceled. DHS officers regularly visit countries such as Jordan, Malaysia, El Salvador, Kenya and Ethiopia to interview refugees seeking to enter the United States. It is usually one of the last steps in the refugee resettlement process. Heller said the decision to halt the overseas interviews would cause delays in refugee processing even if Trump decides to maintain the refugee program or re-start it after a temporary closure. In the past, when weve frozen the refugee program to re-examine security issues, its been really important to continue processing even if you cant admit people, because processing times in this program can be two to three years, Heller     said. During the election campaign, Trump decried former President Barack Obamas decision to increase the number of Syrian refugees admitted to the United States over fears that those fleeing the countrys civil war would carry out attacks.  Obama approved allowing up to 110,000 refugees in the 2017 fiscal year, compared with 85,000 the prior year. Trump said during the election campaign that there was no proper system to vet refugees. In addition to the interviews, refugees hoping to be resettled in the United States undergo extensive security screening by multiple U.S. agencies as well as vetting by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

I see Abesvisit being more about finding a follow-through, a replacement for TPP, said the official, referring to the Trans-Pacific Partnership that Trump ditched on Monday. Given the domestic political capital (Abe has) expended on TPP, theres going to be an effort to work with him on a follow-on, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Trump, who took office last Friday, reiterated on Thursday he would strike numerous bilateral deals, as opposed to multilateral accords like the TPP. He said they would include clauses to allow a 30-day termination notice if the United States was not treated fairly. The TPP, which took years to negotiate among 12 countries,  has often been described as being, at its core, a deal between the United States and Japan, the worlds largest and third-largest economies respectively. Trump called it bad for American jobs, but proponents worry that abandoning the project could further strengthen Chinas economic hand in the region. Japanese media have said Abe is expected to meet Trump in Washington on Feb. 10, although no official announcement has been made as to the timing of the trip. The administration official said it was clear what the outlines and the contours of a deal with Japan would be, but did not go into details. I dont know if there needs to be this protracted long-term negotiation, and there may be some initial steps that are implemented prior to an official Free Trade Agreement, he said.  Its pretty clear what the problems are on the trade side and its pretty clear what the opportunities are. I dont think itll be particularlydifficult to get some movement on a couple of different aspects of the trade side relatively quickly. The White House declined comment on the officials remarks. We look forward to Prime Minister Abes upcoming visit and a productive relationship with Japan, a White House official said. Abe has touted TPP as an engine of economic reform and a counterweight to a rising China but said on Thursday it was possible Tokyo and Washington could hold bilateral free trade talks. Japan will continue to stress to the U.S. the importance of the TPP but it is not totally unfeasible for talks on EPA (Economic Partnership Agreement) and FTA (Free Trade Agreement) with the United States, Abe told parliament after being asked about trade talks between the two nations. Japans Kyodo news agency said Abe also suggested Japan would advocate retaining some form of tariffs on rice and four other key agricultural products in any trade negotiations with the United States.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - President Donald Trumps executive order directing federal agencies to take away funding from self-proclaimed sanctuary cities had one big exemption for one of his favorite constituencies: the police, who would be protected from cuts. But Trumps opponents say that very exemption makes it much more likely that a judge could strike down that section of the order as unconstitutional. It is just one example of the legal arguments that cities, immigration groups and other opponents are readying as they prepare to fight an executive order signed by Trump on Wednesday that would cut federal aid to sanctuary jurisdictions that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. Lawyers for the potential challengers pointed to court rulings that said the federal government can only withhold funds to local jurisdictions if the money is directly tied to the behavior it objects to. The Trump administration cannot cut funds for sanctuary cities healthcare and education while preserving money for police, since those jobs relate more closely to immigration enforcement, said Richard Doyle, city attorney in San Jose, California. He said it was not clear whether existing federal funding or only future grants would be targeted.    Supporters of the new Republican presidents actions say that sanctuary cities ignore federal law and think the White House will be able to answer with a strong case in court. Federal law allows Trump to restrict public assistance of any kind where an illegal alien could possibly benefit, said Dale Wilcox, executive director of the Washington-based conservative Immigration Reform Law Institute.  The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio in a news conference said his chief legal officer would be in court the hour after any specific action to withhold money came through. There is less here than meets the eye. This executive order is written in a very vague fashion, said de Blasio, a Democrat. San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera, also a Democrat, said his office was still examining whether it could sue before Trump made any specific move to cut funds.  Trumps order directed that funding be slashed to all jurisdictions that refuse to comply with a statute that requires local governments to share information with immigration authorities.  Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Unions Immigrants Rights Project, said the cities can argue they are fully in compliance with that statute, since they do share information with federal authorities, but offer limited cooperation when it comes to turning over immigrants who are not convicted criminals. There could also be procedural snarls to implementing the cuts, lawyers who specialize in federal grants said. If the U.S. government seeks to cut off grants to a certain recipient, it must go through a complicated process known as suspension and debarment, and cities would have the right to appeal. Its fair to say that they dont understand the scope and reach of federal grants law, said Edward Waters, who heads the federal grants practice at the law firm Feldesman Tucker Leifer Fidell in Washington, referring to the Trump administration. The White House would also have to negotiate with states that are home to sanctuary cities. Nearly 90 percent of $652 billion the federal government handed out through more 1,500 separate grant programs in the most recent fiscal year went to states, not directly to cities, according to a Reuters review of federal spending data. If the Trump administration wanted to try to cut off Medicaid money to Chicago, for example, it would have to work through the state government of Illinois, which could pose an additional barrier, Waters said. Advocacy groups for immigrants rights said they are also preparing their own legal challenges to other aspects of two executive orders Trump signed on Wednesday, examining sections that deal with expanding detention of immigrants and changing how asylum requests are processed.  All of our legal research is done, most of the complaints are all drafted, said Marielena Hincapie, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, based in Los Angeles. She said litigation could be filed in the next days. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Trump said on Wednesday he will absolutely do safe zones in Syria for refugees fleeing violence. According to a document seen by Reuters, he is expected in the coming days to order the Pentagon and the State Department to draft a plan to create such zones in Syria and nearby nations. The document did not spell out what would make a safe zone safe and whether it would protect refugees only from threats on the ground - such as jihadist fighters - or whether Trump envisions a no-fly zone policed by America and its allies. If it is a no-fly zone, without negotiating some agreement with Russia Trump would have to decide whether to give the U.S. military the authority to shoot down Syrian or Russian aircraft if they posed a threat to people in that zone, which his predecessor, former President Barack Obama, refused to do.   This essentially boils down to a willingness to go to war to protect refugees, said Jim Phillips, a Middle East expert at the Heritage Foundation think-tank in Washington, noting Russias advanced air defenses. Trump promised during his campaign to target jihadists from Islamic State, and he has sought to avoid being dragged deeper into Syrias conflict - raising the question of whether he might be satisfied by assurances, perhaps from Moscow, that neither Russian nor Syrian jets would target the zone. In Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Trump did not consult with Russia and warned that the consequences of such a plan ought to be weighed up. It is important that this (the plan) does not exacerbate the situation with refugees, he said.     Phillips and other experts, including former U.S. officials, said many refugees would not be satisfied by assurances from Moscow, while any deal with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who also is backed by Iran, might not go over well with Americas Arab allies. The Pentagon declined comment on Thursday, saying no formal directive to develop such plans had been handed down yet, and some U.S. military officials appeared unaware of the document before seeing it described in the media on Wednesday. Our department right now is tasked with one thing in Syria, and that is to degrade and defeat ISIS, said Captain Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman. Trumps call for a plan for safe zones is part of a larger directive expected to be signed in coming days that includes a temporary ban on most refugees to the United States and a suspension of visas for citizens of Syria and six other Middle Eastern and African countries deemed to pose a terrorism threat. During and after the presidential campaign, Trump called for no-fly zones to harbor Syrian refugees as an alternative to allowing them into the United States. Trump accused the Obama administration of failing to screen Syrian immigrants entering the United States to ensure they had no militant ties. Any safe zone in Syria guaranteed by the United States would almost certainly require some degree of U.S. military protection. Securing the ground alone would require thousands of troops, former U.S. officials and experts say. Anthony Cordesman, a military expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, cautioned that a safe zone inside Syria could become a diplomatic albatross that would force a Trump administration to juggle a host of ethnic and political tensions in Syria indefinitely. Other experts said jihadists could be attracted to the zone, either to carry out attacks that would embarrass the United States or to use the zone as a safe haven where militants could regroup.  Such a zone also would be expensive, given the need to house, feed, educate and provide medical care to the refugees. I think these people really have no idea what it takes to support 25,000 people, which is really a small number, in terms of the (internally displaced) and refugees in Syria, Cordesman said. The draft document gave no details on what would constitute a safe zone, where one might be set up and who would defend it.  Jordan, Turkey and other neighboring countries already host millions of Syrian refugees. The Turkish government pressed Obama, without success, to create a no-fly zone on Syrias border with Turkey but now is at odds with Washington over its support for Kurdish fighters in Syria.

In the United States for what will be Trumps first meeting with a foreign leader since he took office last week, May signaled a shift in foreign policy, bringing her position more in line with that of Trump. She urged the two countries and their leaders to stand united and confront new challenges, including the rise of economies in Asia that people fear could eclipse the West, the threat of Islamic extremism and a resurgent Russia. So we - our two countries together - have a responsibility to lead. Because when others step up as we step back, it is bad for America, for Britain and the world, May told members of Republican Party at their retreat in a speech often punctuated by applause from an enthusiastic crowd. This cannot mean a return to the failed policies of the past. The days of Britain and America intervening in sovereign countries in an attempt to remake the world in our own image are over. But nor can we afford to stand idly by. Her break with the interventionism that launched wars in Iraq and Afghanistan underscores a change in global politics.     It also fits with Trumps move to put America first and scores well with voters in Britain whose feeling of being left behind by globalization helped fuel Britains vote to leave the EU last year that propelled May to power. Aware that Brexit will shape her legacy, May welcomed her early visit to the United States, a boost to her attempts to show that Britain can prosper outside the European Union despite criticism at home for cozying up to Trump. On her U.S.-bound flight, May concentrated on similarities with the U.S. leader, who some reporters suggested had a style in stark contrast to her more cautious, restrained approach. Havent you ever noticed ... sometimes opposites attract? she answered with a laugh. Eager to win favor  and a trade deal  with the new U.S. president to bolster her hand in the divorce talks with the European Union, May said both countries shared many values and that, contrary to his statements that NATO was obsolete, Trump had told her he was committed to the U.S.-led military alliance. May said she supported Trumps reform agenda to make NATO and the United Nations more relevant and purposeful than they are today, and many of the priorities your government has laid out for Americas engagement with the world.  But there may be sticking points in Fridays talks - May said she condemned the use of torture and would stick to UK policy, suggesting Britain may not accept intelligence that could have come from such methods that Trump could reintroduce. We condemn torture and my view on that wont change  whether Im talking to you or talking to the president, she said when asked what impact it would have if Trump brought back a CIA program for holding terrorism suspects in secret prisons. May will have navigate the middle ground carefully, wary of being criticized as too pro-Trump or alternatively as too negative toward a future trading partner.  She has threatened to walk away from the EU if she fails to get a good deal, and some critics say that could give other countries, like the United States, the upper hand in any talks.  And the EU might not take kindly to any overly friendly overtures to a president some of the blocs main leaders have voiced concern about. Some kind of trade agreement, though, is high on her list of priorities, despite Britain and the United States being at odds over genetically modified organisms, meat production and public procurement and May unable to sign deals until after Brexit. May says she will launch the divorce talks by the end of March by triggering Article 50 of the EUs Lisbon Treaty, which gives up to two years to negotiate an exit deal. Only then can she agree with third countries. Both leaders should use the time to find areas where they could remove trade barriers, May said. Were both very clear that we want a trade deal.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Donald Trumps push to fulfill a campaign promise to replace Obamacare, his predecessors signature healthcare plan, with the help of a Republican-controlled Congress, could add to U.S. states financial strain. That is because a key component of the 2010 law allowed states to expand Medicaid, the government health insurance program for low-income Americans, and collect extra dollars that came with expansion. Thirty-one states and the District of Columbia chose to expand Medicaid enrollment through Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act. (Graphic - here) While Republicans have not agreed to specific plans, one idea gaining traction has been to convert the current system, in which states share the cost of Medicaid enrollees with the federal government, into fixed payments, or block grants, sent to the states. Trumps nominee to run the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, U.S. Representative Tom Price, has long advocated such a plan. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates a repeal of Obamacare and a cap on federal Medicaid spending, such as through a block grant or a per capita cap, could cut Medicaid funding by 41 percent over the next decade. That would likely handicap states ability to respond to larger enrollments during recessions.  It will have clear implications for state budgets, said Robin Rudowitz, the Washington-based associate director at Kaisers Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured. States could raise revenue and spend less in other areas, but these are not easy choices to make. The foundation is a nonprofit focused on health issues. Faced with inflexible federal funding, states might also decide to limit Medicaid eligibility or freeze new enrollment, reducing the number of people covered. In a letter to congressional leaders on Tuesday, the National Governors Association pleaded with lawmakers not to shift costs to states. New Jersey, one of many states struggling with ballooning public pension costs and modest revenue growth, expanded Medicaid under Republican Governor Chris Christie. That state could lose up to $3 billion in federal aid if the Affordable Care Act is repealed and have to spend $1 billion more from its budget, Democratic state lawmakers there said this week. Medicaid sits at the heart of the federal-state fiscal relationship. Over $330 billion in federal Medicaid dollars flowed to states in fiscal year 2016, accounting for more than half of all federal grants sent to state and local governments and the largest individual program, according to Standard & Poors. In 2015, the federal government paid about 60 percent of total Medicaid costs while states paid 40 percent. Medicaid enrollment also tends to spike during an economic downturn, just as state revenues are most strained, spurring the federal government to send more money to states. Despite calls from Trump to Republican lawmakers on Thursday for swift action on replacing Obamacare and on other priorities, changes will likely still take time to work out. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said the agenda would take more than 100 days and said the goal is to get these laws done in 2017, without guaranteeing an Obamacare replacement would be enacted by the end of December. With so many details still up in the air, public officials are hard-pressed to craft budgets that directly respond to their concerns. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on Tuesday said his next budget would hold a record amount of money in reserve and seek at least $1 billion of savings citywide to compensate for a huge amount of uncertainty emanating from Washington.     In California, Medicaid enrollment jumped from nearly 8 million in 2012 to more than 14 million today, thanks in part to federal healthcare reforms.  In a letter earlier this month to U.S. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Democratic California Governor Jerry Brown pleaded that Congress consider reforms that do not burden state budgets. That would be a very cynical way to prop up the federal budget - and devastating to millions of Americans, Brown wrote to the Republican congressman from California. However, Browns proposed budget this month did not include a contingency for a potential repeal of Obamacare or the threat of changes to the federal tax code. Until there is a change in policy at the federal level, we will continue to budget under the current rules of the road, said California Finance Department spokesman H.D. Palmer.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - President Donald Trump pushed Republican lawmakers on Thursday for swift action on a sweeping agenda including his planned U.S.-Mexican border wall, tax cuts and repealing the Obamacare law, despite tensions over timetables and priorities. Congressional Republicans were in Philadelphia for a three-day retreat to hammer out a legislative agenda, with the party in control of the White House, Senate and House of Representatives for the first time in a decade. This Congress is going to be the busiest Congress weve had in decades, maybe ever, Trump said in a speech to the lawmakers at a Philadelphia hotel. Enough all talk, no action. We have to deliver, Trump added. But Trump did not hold an expected question-and-answer session with the lawmakers, and his speech veered into side issues such as predicting crowd size for an anti-abortion march in Washington, alleging American voting irregularities and touting winning Pennsylvania in the Nov. 8 election. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, who initially hesitated in endorsing Trump last year and has criticized him on some issues, disputed the notion that congressional Republicans were not in synch with the New York businessman who was sworn in less than a week ago having never previously held public office. We are on the same page with the White House, Ryan said during a joint news conference with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. This is going to be an unconventional presidency, Ryan added. I think you know this by now. ... I think were going to see unconventional activities like tweets and things like that. I think thats just something that were all going to have to get used to. Trump pressed the lawmakers for action on repealing and replacing Democratic former President Barack Obamas Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, even as Republicans scramble to devise a replacement plan, and lowering taxes on all American businesses and the middle class. For weeks, Republicans talked about formulating an agenda for the first 100 days of Trumps presidency. In recent days, the talk has turned into a 200-day agenda for passing major legislation before the lawmakers August recess. Its going to take more than simply 100 days, Ryan said. Ryan said that it is our goal is to get these laws done in 2017, without guaranteeing that a replacement for Obamacare and a tax reform bill would be enacted by the end of December.  McConnell said lawmakers will take up legislation to provide $12 billion to $15 billion to pay for Trumps planned wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday for the wall to proceed, part of a package of measures aimed at curbing illegal immigration, although the action has tested already frayed relations with Mexico. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy said the pace of legislative action may frustrate Trump. President Trump comes from a different world, McCarthy told reporters. Out in the business community, he likes things done fast, and hes going to continue to push them. Thousands of anti-Trump protesters took to the streets in Philadelphia, a heavily Democratic bastion that is one of the cities that could be stripped of federal funds for protecting illegal immigrants under a Trump directive. Marchers carried signs including, Fascist Pig, Protect My Health Care, Immigration Makes America Great, Planet Over Profit and Impeach Trump. During his speech, Trump took time to explain his side of the story on Mexicos president canceling a meeting next week because of Trumps insistence that Americas southern neighbor eventually pay for the wall. Mexico has said it will not. Trump said a tax reform bill will reduce our trade deficits, increase American exports and will generate revenue from Mexico that will pay for the wall, if we decide to go that route. McConnell and Ryan did not say whether Congress would offset the walls cost by cutting other programs or simply add to huge budget deficits that Republicans have criticized for years. Ryan and McConnell also indicated congressional Republicans do not plan to modify U.S. law banning torture even as Trump considers bringing back a CIA program for holding terrorism suspects in secret overseas black site prisons where interrogation techniques often condemned as torture were used. I think the director of the CIA (Mike Pompeo) has made it clear hes going to follow the law. And I believe virtually all of my members are comfortable with the state of the law on that issue now, McConnell said. Tortures not legal, Ryan said. And we agree with it not being legal. In a highly unusual move for a visiting foreign leader, British Prime Minister Theresa May, who will see Trump in Washington on Friday, addressed the retreat, calling herself a fellow conservative who believes in the same principles that underpin the agenda of your party. She was loudly applauded for praising Trumps victory. Because of what you have done together, because of that great victory you have won, America can be stronger, greater, and more confident in the years ahead, May said.

I would. We have obstructionists, Trump told Fox News, referring to possible use of the so-called nuclear option that would overturn Senate rules requiring 60 votes to overcome a procedural hurdle, or filibuster, for Supreme Court nominees. There are currently 52 Republican senators in the 100-seat chamber. Trump plans next week to announce his choice to fill the vacancy caused by the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia in February 2016. His nominee could restore the decades-long conservative majority on the court. Democrats are seething over the Republican-led Senates refusal last year to consider Democratic President Barack Obamas nomination of appeals court Judge Merrick Garland for the lifetime post, an action with little precedent in U.S. history. Trump told Fox News anchor Sean Hannity that he had made his choice. I have made my decision pretty much in my mind, yes. Thats subject to change at the last moment. Among the front-runners are three conservative jurists: Neil Gorsuch, a judge on the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals; Thomas Hardiman, who serves on the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals; and William Pryor, on the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. On Tuesday, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said he told Trump that Democrats would fight any nominee they consider to be outside the mainstream. Assuming all 52 Senate Republicans back Trumps nominee, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would either need to lure eight Democrats to his side or change the rules and ban the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations. Despite the nuclear option threat, Nan Aron, president of the liberal Alliance for Justice, which tracks judicial nominations, said in an email to Reuters that a Democratic filibuster would still be far better than what Republicans did to Merrick Garland. More than three years ago, Democrats used their then-majority in the Senate to ban filibusters against presidential nominees other than for the Supreme Court. The move came after Republicans blocked several key Obama nominees. Vice President Mike Pence told Republican lawmakers on Thursday that Trump would nominate a strict constructionist to the court, referring to the literal interpretation of the U.S. Constitutions text without regard to changes in American society.

Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Representative Maxine Waters of California petitioned a federal court to be allowed to intervene on behalf of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in its appeal of a decision that its structure is unconstitutional. Meanwhile, six groups including U.S. Public Interest Research Group made a similar request. The ruling, that the president should be able to remove CFPB Director Richard Cordray at will, has been stayed pending appeal. Currently the director can only be fired for cause. The filings followed a request from state attorneys general to also be able to intervene in the case. Currently the whole U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is deciding whether to review the ruling in a case brought by mortgage servicer PHH Corp [PHH.N]. It could announce it will take the appeal, which most watchers expect, as early as next week.  Republicans want Trump to remove Cordray, saying the director has gone beyond his authority and provided cause to be fired. Trump has met with former Texas Representative Randy Neugebauer, a CFPB critic, indicating Trump is already seeking Cordrays replacement.  Also, Republican Senator Deb Fischer, of Nebraska, recently introduced legislation to put a commission in charge of the CFPB, and there is a good chance it will become law. Theres quite a lot of reasons to be concerned, said Michael Burr, faculty director at University of Michigans Center on Finance. It would be devastating to the very people who supported President Trump to attack and dismantle the CFPB.  The CFPB, created in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law to guard individuals from fraud in mortgages, student loans and other financial products, does not need permission from the Justice Department to file cases in courts below the Supreme Court.  That means Trump may also ask the Justice Department to file a brief in opposition in the appeal, essentially setting two agencies against each other, said Mark Calabria, who studies the CFPB for the conservative Cato Institute.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Wednesday ordered construction of a U.S.-Mexican border wall and punishment for cities shielding illegal immigrants while mulling restoring a CIA secret detention program as he launched broad but divisive plans to reshape U.S. immigration and national security policy. A draft executive order seen by Reuters that Trump is expected to sign in the coming days would block the entry of refugees from war-torn Syria and suspend the entry of any immigrants from Muslim-majority Middle Eastern and African countries Syria, Sudan, Somalia, Iraq, Iran, Libya and Yemen while permanent rules are studied. Less than a week into his presidency, Trump has moved aggressively to put his stamp on a range of policies, including steps to gut the healthcare system devised by his predecessor, and make clear that as president he is not turning toward more moderate positions than he took as a candidate. His directives on Wednesday signaled a tough action toward the roughly 11 million illegal immigrants already in the United States, most from Latin America, whom he already has threatened to deport. In a move critics called a slight to the integrity of American democracy, Trump also said on Wednesday he would seek a major investigation into what he believes was voter fraud in the November election, despite overwhelming consensus among state officials, election experts and politicians that it is rare in the United States.  We are going to restore the rule of law in the United States, Trump told an audience that included relatives of people killed by illegal immigrants at the Department of Homeland Security after signing two executive orders. The directives ordered the construction of a multibillion-dollar wall along the roughly 2,000-mile (3,200-km) U.S.-Mexico border, moved to strip federal funding from sanctuary states and cities that harbor illegal immigrants, and expanded  the force of American immigration agents. His plans prompted an outcry from immigrant advocates and Democratic lawmakers who said Trump was jeopardizing the rights and freedoms of millions of people while treating Mexico as an enemy, not an ally, and soiling Americas historic reputation as a welcoming place for immigrants of all stripes. The border wall is about political theater at the expense of civil liberties, said Christian Ramirez, director of the Southern Border Communities Coalition immigrant advocacy group. It is not national security policy. Border communities are among the safest in the nation, and patrolling them with tens of thousands of heavily armed, poorly trained, unaccountable agents puts lives at risks. This will turn these communities into de facto military zones, Ramirez said. The White House said the wall would stem the flow of drugs, crime and illegal immigration into the United States. We are in the middle of a crisis on our southern border: The unprecedented surge of illegal migrants from Central America is harming both Mexico and the United States, Trump said, adding: A nation without borders is not a nation. The immigration crackdown has sparked fear among so-called dreamers, whose parents brought them to the United States illegally and who received temporary deportation relief and work permits from President Barack Obama. Trump said the dreamers should not fear deportation. They shouldnt be very worried, Trump told ABC News in an interview broadcast on Wednesday.. Where you have great people that are here that have done a good job, they should be far less worried, he said, adding: Well be coming out with policy on that over the next period of four weeks. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan also said the dreamers should not be worried. Were focused on physical security of the border, were focused on those who are coming to do us harm from terrorist states and things like that, he told MSNBC. Trump is also expected to order a review that could lead to bringing back a CIA program for holding terrorism suspects in secret overseas black site prisons where interrogation techniques often condemned as torture were used during former Republican President George W. Bushs administration, two U.S. officials said.  Trumps actions could further test relations with Mexico. The wall plan has infuriated Mexicans. Trumps policies, including his demand that the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada be renegotiated or scrapped, have put Mexicos government on the defensive. Trump and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto are due to meet next week. Pena Nieto said on Wednesday night that he regrets and disapproves of the push by Trump to build a new wall along the border. Officials in cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Boston, Denver, Washington, San Francisco and Seattle offer some forms of protection to illegal immigrants. Billions of dollars in federal aid to those cities, often governed by Democrats, could be at risk under Trumps move. In the ABC News interview, Trump said construction on the wall would start within months, with planning starting immediately, and that Mexico would pay back to the United States 100 percent of the costs. Mexican officials have said they will not pay for the wall. The White House said Trumps goal was to get the wall started as quickly as possible using existing government funds and then work with the Republican-led Congress on further appropriations. Trump made cracking down on illegal immigration a key element of his presidential campaign, with supporters at his rallies often chanting: Build the wall. The cost, nature and extent of the wall remain unclear. Trump last year put the cost at probably $8 billion, although other estimates are higher, and he said the wall would span 1,000 miles (1,600 km) because of the terrain of the border. Trumps directives would end the practice known by critics as catch and release in which authorities apprehend illegal immigrants on U.S. territory but do not immediately detain or deport them. The directives also include hiring 5,000 more U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents used to apprehend people seeking to slip across the border and tripling the number of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents used to arrest and deport immigrants living in the United States illegally. They also create more detention space for illegal immigrants along the southern border to make it easier to detain and deport them. The intent of the proposals regarding refugees and immigrants from the seven Muslim-majority nations is to head off Islamist violence in the United States. The draft directive on immigration also suspends the U.S. refugee program for four months while determining whether permanent changes to the system are needed.

Representing scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency, NASA and other bureaus, either directly or through friends and supporters, the accounts protest restrictions they view as censorship since Trump took office on Jan. 20. Seizing on Trumps favorite mode of discourse, the feeds reflect concern that the new president, a climate change skeptic, is out to squelch federally backed research showing that emissions from fossil fuel combustion and other human activities are contributing to global warming. Cant wait for President Trump to call us FAKE NEWS, read one posting on the newly opened Twitter account @AltNatParkService. You can take our official twitter, but youll never take our free time! Reuters could not verify that all the accounts, which borrow the names and logos of their respective agencies, were being run by current federal employees of those agencies. The alternate National Park Service Twitter feed said it had passed control of its account to individuals outside the government to protect colleagues at the agency.  The introductory disclaimer borne by the @RogueNASA account was typical of many of the feeds, describing it as The unofficial Resistance team of NASA. Not an official NASA account. It beckoned readers to follow its feed for science and climate news and facts. REAL NEWS, REAL FACTS. An administrator of an associated Rogue NASA Facebook page told Reuters the alternative site was being used as a platform by agency scientists and others who support them. In some instances, the alternate Twitter accounts were registered on behalf of employees by supporters, presumably to better safeguard their anonymity, as was the case for the unofficial Rocky Mountain National Park site. An individual contacted at the alternative Twitter feed for Mount Rainier National Park said: Its not about the people running the accounts. Its about the movement its generated. We may never disclose our identity due to the current political ecosystem. The swift proliferation of such sites followed internal directives several agencies involved in environmental issues have received since Trumps inauguration requiring them to curb their dissemination of information to the public.     Last week, Interior Department staff were told to stop posting on Twitter after an employee re-tweeted posts about relatively low attendance at Trumps swearing-in, and about how material on climate change and civil rights had disappeared from the official White House website. Employees at the EPA and the departments of Interior, Agriculture and Health and Human Services have since confirmed seeing notices from the new administration either instructing them to remove web pages or limit how they communicate to the public, including through social media. The resistance movement gained steam on Tuesday when a series of climate change-related tweets were posted to the official Twitter account of Badlands National Park in South Dakota, administered under the Interior Department, but were soon deleted. A Park Service official later said those tweets came from a former employee no longer authorized to use the official account and that the agency was being encouraged to use Twitter to post public safety and park information only, and to avoid national policy issues. Within hours, unofficial resistance, or rogue, Twitter accounts began sprouting up, emblazoned with the logos of government agencies, the list growing to at least 14 such sites by Wednesday afternoon. An account dubbed @ungaggedEPA invited followers to visit its feeds of ungagged news, links, tips and conversation that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is unable to tell you, adding that it was Not directly affiliated with @EPA. Civil servants have a job to do and part of that job is to interpret the national parks and history behind it, said a former official at the Interior Department, the parent agency of the National Park Service, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The former official said that while people outside the federal government could be involved in the rogue accounts, employees with whom the official communicated were supporting the feeds. They bristle at any political involvement, the former official said. Theyre taking that as an attack on their work. You have 75l,000 people feeling attacked. Youre going to play whack-a-mole trying to stop them. I dont see this stopping. The phenomenon was not limited to U.S. environmental and natural resource employees. They were soon joined by similar alternative Twitter accounts for various science and health agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Weather Service.

A faction led by Michael Flynn, Trumps National Security Advisor, wants to add the Brotherhood to the State Department and U.S. Treasury lists of foreign terrorist organizations, the sources said. I know it has been discussed. Im in favor of it, said a Trump transition advisor, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue. The advisor said Flynns team discussed adding the group to the U.S. list of terrorist groups but said it was ultimately unclear when or even if the administration ultimately would go ahead with such a move. Other Trump advisors, as well as many veteran national security, diplomatic, law enforcement and intelligence officials argue the Brotherhood has evolved peacefully in some countries, according to officials and people close to Trumps entourage. They worry that a U.S. move to designate the entire Brotherhood a terrorist group would complicate relations with Turkey, a key American ally in the fight against Islamic State, and where the Islamist-rooted AKP Party that dominates the Turkish government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is in power. Tunisias Islamist Ennahda Party has also participated in democratic elections. The Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, the countrys oldest Islamist movement, was designated as a terrorist organization in that country in 2013. It is not clear which faction within the U.S. administration has the upper hand, and Senator Ted Cruz and Representative Mario Diaz-Balart this month introduced legislation to add the Brotherhood to the terrorist list. There was no immediate comment from the White House. Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates among others have designated the group on their terrorist lists, and Trumps nominee for Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, described the Brotherhood an an agent of radical Islam, during his Senate confirmation hearing. U.S. criminal law prohibits people in the United States from knowingly providing material support to designated terrorist organizations, and members of such groups are banned from entering the United States.Some conservative and anti-Muslim activists have argued for years that the Brotherhood, which was founded in Egypt in 1928 and sought to establish a worldwide Islamic caliphate by peaceful means, has been a breeding ground for terrorists. Some branches of the Brotherhood, including the Palestinian group Hamas, have engaged in anti-government violence and provoked violent government reactions. Ayman al-Zawahiri, the leader of al-Qaeda, was once a member of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood. Other offshoots in Turkey and Tunisia have forsworn violence and come to power by democratic means.Muslim Brotherhood President Mohammed Mursi became Egypts first freely elected president in June 2012 in the aftermath of the ousting of long-time ruler Hosni Mubarak. An army takeover stripped Mursi of power in 2013 following mass protests against his rule. Hundreds of Islamists have since been killed and arrested. Sisi and Trump spoke by phone this week and the two leaders discussed ways to boost the fight against terrorism and extremism. A U.S. official who declined to be identified told Reuters there had been discussions at the State Department which looked at intelligence and information on the group in which it was thought it would be difficult to justify legally, in terms of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, to meet the criteria. Its one thing to say one groups ideology has been used to influence a terrorist organization and another thing to say that this group is a terrorist organization, said the U.S. official. Following the Sept. 11, 2001, al Qaeda attacks on the United States, the George W. Bush administration launched investigations into the Brotherhood and related Islamist movements. After years of investigations, however, the U.S. and other governments, including Switzerlands, closed investigations of the Brotherhood leaders and financial group for lack of evidence, and removed most of the leaders from sanctions lists. A British government review into Egypts outlawed Muslim Brotherhood published in December 2015 concluded that membership of or links to the political group should be considered a possible indicator of extremism but stopped short of recommending that it should be banned.

The FDAs long-overdue response leaves key questions unanswered about the performance and effectiveness of the FDAs Office of Criminal Investigations, House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden told Reuters in a statement. An FDA spokeswoman did not have an immediate comment. Waldens comments come about four months after the congressional panel launched an examination into the criminal office and how it was managing cases involving food, drugs and devices. The review came after Reuters reported that FDA agents were concerned that managers, including former OCI Director George Karavetsos, were forcing them to pursue often toothless cases involving mislabeled foreign-imported injectable drugs, at the expense of cases with more potential to protect the public health. The agents said they had become the Botox Police and were spending hours chasing down doctors who purchased authentic versions of Allergans popular anti-wrinkle drug that were labeled for use in other countries. Those concerns came at a time when the office was seeing more than half its opened cases ultimately get closed without action, Reuters found. Reuters also reported on how the FDA permitted Karavetsos to relocate back to Florida in mid-2016 and run the OCI from its Miami office, even after the FDA had already paid more than $25,000 to move him to Maryland in 2015. The FDA did not meet the committees October deadline to provide written answers to questions until Jan. 19. The next day, Karavetsos departed to work for DLA Piper where he will represent drug and device industry clients. In its letter reviewed by Reuters, the FDA listed its investigative priorities and said that traditional metrics used to gauge success, such as arrests and convictions, cannot capture the impact of its public health mission. It also provided annual data on arrests, convictions, and the number of opened cases. However, it omitted preliminary-stage investigative numbers from the total number of cases opened each year, which makes the conviction rate appear higher, according to a side-by-side comparison. Walden said the FDA did not provide a performance plan, among other things. He also complained of redactions on a separate record, which according to a committee aide contained salary and compensation information for Karavetsos.

Trump told ABC News on Wednesday he will absolutely do safe zones in Syria for refugees fleeing violence and that Europe had made a mistake by admitting millions of refugees from Syria. President Bashar al-Assads opponents have long demanded safe zones to protect civilians who have fled government air strikes and bombardment of rebel-held areas. But reflecting uncertainties about the announcement, representatives of the insurgents voiced only cautious optimism. Weve seen no result on the ground from (U.S.) statements that were made six years ago. So therefore we await action before anything else, said Fares al-Bayoush, a rebel commander in northwestern Syria. Qatar, which backs the rebels, welcomed Trumps comments and emphasized the need to provide safe havens in Syria and to impose no-fly zones to ensure the safety of civilians. There was no immediate word from Damascus, but it is sure to oppose such a move as Assad has vowed to regain control of all Syria. Iran, which backs militias in Syria including Lebanons Hezbollah, would also oppose any U.S. intervention. Russia said it had not been consulted on Trumps plan, warning that it should not exacerbate the situation with refugees and Washington should weigh up all the consequences.  The creation of safe zones would mark a major shift in U.S. policy. Former U.S. President Barack Obama resisted an idea that would require a commitment to defend such areas from the Syrian government or its foreign allies, including Russia. Trump appears to see safe zones as a way to stem the tide of refugees which he sees as a possible threat to U.S. security. But there are no obvious answers as to how the United States would avoid the problems that have prevented it establishing safe zones in Syria before, including the complication of policing such an area in a war zone dotted with armed groups. At this stage this is very much in the realm of political maneuvering, said Yezid Sayigh, a senior fellow and Syria expert at the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut. I dont think it is signaling imminent U.S. action. Trump could order the State Department and Pentagon to produce a plan that would also create safe areas in countries surrounding Syria where millions of refugees already live. The Syrian government hopes Trump will end U.S. support for the rebels fighting Assad and refocus U.S. policy solely on fighting Islamic State, perhaps in cooperation with Russia. Trump has indicated he will do both.   Almost six years of war has turned Syria into a patchwork of areas, some controlled by Assad, some by rebel groups and others by Kurdish militia or Islamic State militants. Previous discussion of safe zones in Syria has focused on rebel-held areas in the northwest stretching from Idlib province to the Euphrates river. Areas in the southwest at the border with Jordan have also been seen as a possibility. But the complications have grown since the Syrian opposition first called for safe zones, including the deployment of Russias air force to Syria.  Defending a safe zone from attack by the Syrian government or its Russian and Iranian-backed militia allies would inevitably lead to an escalation, which is one of the reasons Obama had avoided this path in the first place, Sayigh said.  Another big challenge would be how to police the area to maintain its neutral status as a safe zone, he added. While much of Trumps Syria policy remains unclear, Syrian Kurds, who have generally avoided conflict with Assad, look set to remain central to U.S. strategy. The Syrian Kurdish YPG militia controls swathes of northeast Syria, where conflict with the government is rare and the U.S. air force mounts regular air strikes against IS targets. Syrian Kurdish autonomy in northern Syria alarms Turkey, which fears it could increase separatist sentiment among its Kurdish minority. Kurdish groups already govern northern Iraq, where the establishment of a no-fly zone in 1991 helped them on their way to autonomy from Baghdad. The YPG has links to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), a designated terrorist groups in Turkey.     Growing Kurdish influence in northern Syria largely explains why Turkey launched a major incursion into Syria last year, helping insurgents from the Free Syrian Army drive both Islamic State and Kurdish militia away from the border. The operation dubbed Euphrates Shield has created what Turkish officials call a safe zone that is 100 km (62 miles) long. This week, a new Turkish-trained Syrian police force deployed in the town of Jarablus in that strip of territory. Turkey, which hosts 2.8 million Syrian refugees, has long advocated safe zones in Syria.  But underlining the caution with which foreign governments are viewing Trumps comments, Turkey said it was waiting to see the outcome of a study requested by Trump. Aid agencies in the region are concerned. Karl Schembri, Regional Media Adviser in the Middle East for the Norwegian Refugee Council, said that from the groups  experience, we know that militarily enforced safe zones rarely work and can actually put civilians at more risk.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Environmental Protection Agency has told several lawmakers it aims to end late on Friday a freeze on grants and contracts that had been ordered by the White House, congressional aides said. The freeze has led to widespread concerns in states and cities about whether there would be delays in efforts to monitor and clean up toxic pollution, particularly lead pollution in drinking water, that would put the health of Americans at risk. The Trump administration on Monday asked the EPA to temporarily freeze grants, contracts and interagency agreements pending a review. The EPA allocates $4 billion in contracts annually on projects ranging from cleaning up polluted industrial sites to testing of air and water quality. The concerns were acute in Flint, Michigan, where children for years have been exposed to dangerous levels of lead in drinking water. After Representative Dan Kildee, whose congressional district includes Flint, and Michigans two U.S. senators wrote to President Donald Trump asking whether programs would be delayed, the EPA told them that grants to clean up the water would be uninterrupted. Congress last year approved $100 million to clean up water in Flint.   The EPA told some lawmakers it was continuing to award environmental program grants and revolving-loan fund grants to states and tribes and was working quickly to address issues related to other categories of grants, aides said. But Flint and other cities exposed to lead poisoning remain concerned about testing.  The people of Flint also rely on other EPA contracts to conduct independent water testing and provide expertise when it comes to ensuring water quality, said Mitchell Rivard, a Kildee spokesman, who was waiting for news from the EPA and Trump about those programs. An official from another Midwestern city that has suffered lead poisoning, speaking on condition of anonymity, said local politicians had asked the EPA if programs would be slowed but had received no answers. A former EPA head of grants said the freeze was troubling because it showed a total lack of communication about it with states, tribes and communities. Theyre supposed to be EPAs partners in keeping people safe and health, so they should have been consulted, or at least warned, said Karl Brooks, a former acting assistant administrator at the agency. If every polluted community has to push politicians to write letters to the EPA, the agency will be spending most of its time answering congressional letters and not getting lead out of water or mercury out of our air, he said.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration has accepted the resignations of two top State Department officials effective on Friday, a step entirely within the new presidents rights but an abrupt departure for the diplomats, officials said on Thursday. Under Secretary for Management Patrick Kennedy and acting Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Thomas Countryman both plan to leave their posts by Friday, the officials said. Turnover is the rule, rather than the exception, among the top officials in the U.S. government when the White House changes hands from one party to another, in this case from Democrat Barack Obama to Republican Donald Trump. In his first week in office, Trump has illustrated stark policy differences from Obama on trade and immigration. On Monday, Trump formally withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and on Wednesday he ordered construction of a wall on the border with Mexico and threatened to punish U.S. cities shielding illegal immigrants. Political appointees chosen by the president and confirmed by the Senate were obliged, as usual, after Trumps Nov. 8 election victory, to submit letters of resignation to give the new president the opportunity to name his own people to the jobs. Kennedy and Countryman were recently told their resignations had been accepted effective Friday, leaving their bureaus - one of which handles the departments management and the other which oversees arms control - in the hands of more junior officials. Gregory Starr, Assistant Secretary for State for Diplomatic Security and Michele Bond, Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs, are also leaving, officials said, though it was not clear under what circumstances or whether they were asked to step down by Friday. Trumps nominee for Secretary of State, former Exxon Mobil Corp chairman Rex Tillerson, has yet to be confirmed by the full Senate, leaving the agency in the hands of number three official Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Thomas Shannon. The departures were discussed at State Department Thursday morning meetings and caused some unease, in part because at least two of the officials had been asked to go by Friday.  Its not two weeks notice, said one official who spoke on condition of anonymity. However, the department itself stressed that turnover is the norm when a new political party comes to power. Of the officers whose resignations were accepted, some will continue in the Foreign Service in other positions and others will retire by choice or because they have exceeded the time limits of their grade in service, acting State Department spokesman Mark Toner said in a statement. It did not provide a detailed breakdown of whose resignations were accepted or when they were leaving. At least one media report suggested that the departures  amounted to a mass resignation, but several U.S. officials said this was not the case. Its not a mass protest or a show of indignation, said one senior U.S. official. A former senior Obama administration official said there were no plans at the National Security Council for a mass resignation and that recent conversations there with Trumps inner circle had been viewed as productive and encouraging. The State Department departures amounted to a huge brain drain, the former official said, adding that their collective experience would be difficult to recover. However, a current State Department official rejected this view, saying that while Kennedy, in particular, was seen as an institution, he could certainly be replaced. Everybody is (acting) like it is a big apocalypse. He has large shoes to fill, but the culture of the State Department is about change and moving around every few years, said the official. Its not like the building is going to fall apart. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""GENEVA (Reuters) - The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) have joined global human rights groups in their rebuke of U.S. President Donald Trump for condoning torture. Trump told ABC television in an interview on Wednesday that he thought waterboarding worked as an intelligence-gathering tool but would defer to his cabinet on whether to use it in interrogations. Two U.S. officials said also on Wednesday that Trump may order a review that could lead to bringing back a CIA program for holding terrorism suspects in secret overseas black site prisons. These practices of torturing detainees and disappearing them in black sites are serious crimes which must never be repeated, Ian Seiderman, Legal and Policy Director of the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) said in a statement. ICRC spokesman Ewan Watson said: For any political leader to advocate torture is very worrying indeed. Experience has shown that using torture doesnt work, it only grows hatred. Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and Reprieve, a British-based group which represented scores of Guantanamo detainees, have also issued rebukes. Seiderman told Reuters TV that Trump, as commander-in-chief of U.S. forces, has already signaled to those in the field that may have a propensity to engage in such practice that it is OK with the leader.  He is also sending a very unfortunate signal to other states and other countries, when the leader of the U.S says it is OK, then maybe they will think it is OK. According to a document published in the Washington Post, Trump may be planning to revoke Obama directives including one guaranteeing ICRC access to all detainees in U.S. custody. The Trump administration has denied it came from the White House.  ICRC officials have visited security detainees in U.S. custody in Afghanistan, Iraq and Guantanamo in Cuba. Their findings on conditions and treatment are shared only with detaining authorities.  In 2004, a leaked ICRC report detailed U.S. mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad, including keeping them naked for days in darkness. It said the mistreatment in some cases was tantamount to torture.  An international scandal ensued, fueled by explicit photos taken by U.S. soldiers who had abused prisoners. The ICRC has had a long and constructive dialogue with U.S. authorities on issues linked to detention and armed conflict, ICRC spokeswoman Anna Nelson said.  We plan to continue visiting detainees held by the U.S. authorities, monitoring their treatment and conditions of detention, and engaging confidentially with the authorities on these important issues, she said.  Torture is forbidden under U.S. and international law, and by pacts such as the U.N. Convention against Torture and the Geneva Conventions. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"
"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""GUADALUPE, Mexico/TORNILLO, Texas (Reuters) - President Donald Trumps plan to end the policy of catch and release - where illegal immigrants are caught and then freed pending hearings - could hit a wall, immigrant advocates warn, and not the one he is planning to build on the Mexican border. OK, Mr Trump, you dont want them released, show me where you are going to hold them - show me the building, said Ruben Garcia, the director of Annunciation House, a Roman Catholic charity in El Paso, Texas, that gives shelter to migrant families.  Garcias group received more than 400 migrants released by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement just between Monday and Wednesday, the day Trump announced tougher measures to curb illegal immigration. They are releasing them not because they want to do catch and release, but because detention centers dont have enough space, said Garcia. That underscores one potential problem of ending the practice of catch and release - almost half the immigrants apprehended by U.S. officials are now Central American families or children, and only a tiny number of detention spaces are available for those categories of immigrants. Trump did announce plans to increase the number of family detention centers, but establishing them will take time and could face legal challenges, legal experts on immigration said.   A Reuters review of U.S. Customs and Border Patrol data shows an accelerating trend of Central American families who hand themselves in at the border and are released while awaiting deportation or a decision on an asylum request. In the last three months of 2016, the number of people - almost all of them families and children - who handed themselves in to agents along the U.S.-Mexican border rose by a quarter versus the same period the year before, CBP data shows.  Agents apprehended a total of 136,670 people crossing the Mexican border, the highest number since 2008, and 48 percent of those were unaccompanied children or families with children.  Nearly 45,000 parents with children were apprehended in the October-December quarter, but the border currently has beds for only around 3,300 people in this category of immigrants, mostly at the Karnes and Dilley detention centers in Texas, according to ICE data from 2016. Because most of the families are from Central America, they cannot immediately be turned around and sent back to Mexico. Lack of space in detention centers for parents with children means that almost all such migrants, who are mostly fleeing poverty and violence in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, are fitted with an electronic ankle bracelet, given a court date and released. Many end up requesting asylum, a process that can take five or more years to be resolved, immigration lawyers say. Even without requesting asylum, it can take years to deport families through the United States bunged-up immigration courts. Trump could expand a policy practiced under former President Barack Obama of using military bases to temporarily house more immigrants. The Fort Bliss base in El Paso has housed thousands of children since September, for example. He could also explore ways to refit other existing facilities to help handle the flood of families. Building more detention centers like Karnes and Dilley will take longer. They also typically face legal challenges by civil rights lawyers concerned about the living conditions in them. Trump could also seek to expand an Obama program aimed at increasing the number of Central American asylum seekers who make their initial claim from their home country. In the long term, he could ask Mexico to let immigrants make the asylum claims from there, although ties between the two countries are now seriously frayed because of Trumps vow to force Mexico to pay for a wall on the southern U.S. border. Garcia, the shelter director, acknowledged that if Trump was finally successful in opening thousands more detention spaces for families, that would slow the numbers coming.  The word would spread that the probability they will be locked up and put on a plane had become much higher, Garcia said. Central Americans are usually deported from the United States on flights back to their home countries. While the number of turn-ins - those who hand themselves in to U.S. authorities - are highest around McAllen, Texas, the jump has been particularly noticeable in the El Paso sector of the border with Mexico. Here, 60 percent of the immigrants apprehended between October and December were children or families. For years a quiet spot on the immigration map, El Paso saw 5,200 families apprehended in the period, nearly three times as many compared to the same period a year ago, and 1,972, or double, the number of unaccompanied children. U.S Border Patrol agent Jose Romero has observed the trend first-hand along the tall, rust-colored fence punctuated with rural border crossings stretching some 40 miles (65 km) from El Paso to beyond Tornillo, Texas. A lot of the traffic we are seeing right now is family groups ... coming across and they are looking for an agent right away to turn themselves in, Romero said, calling it a change from the past, when more people were trying to sneak in undetected. They want to be apprehended. The fence, finished in 2010, ends abruptly near pecan orchards and irrigation ditches on the Texan side, across the Rio Grande from Mexicos drug war-torn Valle de Juarez, a  cotton-farming region now littered with burned-out homes. Last February, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and Obamas secretary of commerce, Penny Pritzker, opened a major new border crossing from Tornillo on the Texan side, to Guadalupe on the Mexican side, hoping to boost trade between the countries. By November, truck traffic was still light across the bridge. Instead, ICE opened a temporary holding center, with 500 places in white tents on the asphalt on the U.S. side of the bridge, to help process some of the surging numbers of migrant families apprehended by U.S. officials in the surrounding area.

The National Labor Relations Board on Thursday said Trump had named Philip Miscimarra to the temporary role, one day after the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission announced that Victoria Lipnic had been named acting chair of the commission. The NLRB oversees union elections and enforces a federal law protecting workers rights to organize. The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Under former President Barack Obama, both agencies were the target of fierce criticism from business groups and Republican officials.  Miscimarra and Lipnic, both Obama appointees, will temporarily replace Democrats who had chaired the agencies until Trumps permanent replacements are confirmed by the U.S. Senate. The EEOC and NLRB chairs make staffing decisions and have a key role in updating guidelines and setting agency priorities. The EEOC currently has one vacancy, and the NLRB has two. Despite being Obama appointees, Lipnic and Miscimarra have routinely broken with their Democratic colleagues.  Miscimarras many dissents in NLRB cases since his appointment in 2013 helped lay the foundation for claims by the business community that under Obama, the board baldly favored unions rather than promoting a balance between labor and management. In 2012, Lipnic dissented in a landmark EEOC case in which the commission ruled for the first time that discrimination against gay workers is a form of unlawful sex bias. She also objected to guidelines on pregnancy discrimination released by the commission in 2014, and regulations published the following year that made it easier for workers to sue for age discrimination. Lipnic, who worked at the U.S. Department of Labor under President George W. Bush before joining the EEOC in 2010, said in a statement that she was honored by the appointment. I believe equal employment opportunity is critical to all Americans and to how we define ourselves as a nation, she said. Miscimarra in a separate statement said his goal was to foster stability and to apply the National Labor Relations Act in an even-handed manner that serves the interests of employees, employers and unions throughout the country.

Good Day Philadelphias Mike Jerrick was discussing Conways use of the term alternative facts on Tuesday with co-host Alex Holley and guests when he said the Trump aide was good at bullshit. The group laughed at the remark before Holley apologized to the shows audience. Jerrick, who did not appear on Fox 29s Good Day on Wednesday or Thursday, has been suspended from the show for an indefinite period, Philadelphia Magazine reported, citing the host. Jerrick and Conway could not immediately be reached for comment. Fox Television Stations said in a statement that it had addressed the incident, but it offered no details. This is not in line with FOX Television Stations guidelines, the statement said. A spokeswoman with the broadcast group declined to say whether Jerrick had been suspended. Jerrick, who has also hosted the nationally syndicated Fox talk show The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet, wrote on Instagram late on Wednesday: Night off. Why not. Always a good fight. The post was followed by more than 150 comments, some from people who said they would boycott Fox until Jerricks return. The alternative facts remark drew widespread criticism on social media and has been credited with a spike in sales of George Orwells 1984 novel about a dystopian future where people are forced to simultaneously accept contradictory versions of the truth. Conway was responding to accusations that the Trump administration was fixated on the size of his inauguration crowds, saying: We feel compelled to go out and clear the air and put alternative facts out there.
