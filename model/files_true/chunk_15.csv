Strike called in Bangladesh over power price rise on day pope arrives,"DHAKA (Reuters) - Several small opposition parties in Bangladesh have called for a half-day strike on Thursday against a power tariff increase, which could cause traffic chaos in the congested capital as Pope Francis arrives for a three-day visit. The strike will begin on Thursday morning and end in the early afternoon, after the pope is expected to land in Dhaka following a visit to neighboring Myanmar. Strikes in Bangladesh often involve street protests. The Communist Party of Bangladesh, which is leading the protest against the increase in electricity prices by an average of 5.3 percent from next month, said it had no intention of disrupting the pope s visit but the action was necessary given the  burden  on the people. But police said there would be no problem.  We will be able to control the situation during the strike and there is nothing to worry about,  said police spokeswoman Sahely Ferdous. Dhaka is one of the most densely populated cities in the world, with an average traffic speed of just 7 kph (4.3 mph), slightly faster than an average walking speed, according to the World Bank. Congestion in Dhaka eats up 3.2 million working hours per day, it says. (bit.ly/2zkYr6l) Pope Francis  visit will include a mass and meetings with a group of Rohingya Muslim refugees from Myanmar.  More than 600,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh following violence in Myanmar since late August. [nL8N1NS2HN] ",worldnews,"November 24, 2017 ",1

Five Ukrainian servicemen killed in eastern Ukraine: military,"KIEV (Reuters) - Five Ukrainian servicemen were killed when pro-Russian rebels attacked government positions mostly in the Luhansk region on Thursday, the Ukrainian military said. An almost three-year-old peace agreement has failed to stop fighting in eastern Ukraine with each side accusing the other of violating the terms of a ceasefire on a near-daily basis. The Ukrainian military said in a statement they suffered losses during an eight-hour clash near the small village of Krymske, 30 km (20 miles) west of Luhansk. The situation in the Luhansk region had escalated after a conflict between separatist factions controlling the city. ",worldnews,"November 24, 2017 ",1
At least three dead as Indian passenger train derails in northern India,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - A passenger train slipped off the rails in northern India early on Friday, killing at least three people and injuring about 10, the railways ministry said. The train was on its way from Goa in western India to Patna in the east when 13 coaches derailed, the ministry said. It did not provide any reason for the accident, which occurred in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. Television news agency ANI however quoted the Uttar Pradesh Additional Director General of police as saying that the cause of accident is most probably a fractured railway track  as per local assessment.  A medical train and a relief train had reached the accident spot, the railways said. India has seen a spate of rail accidents over the last 12 months. Earlier in August, there were three separate incidents on the world s fourth-biggest rail network injuring over 165 people and killing several others. The biggest accident so far this year was on Aug. 19 in Uttar Pradesh, which resulted in the death of 23 people and led to the suspension of three senior railways officials. A crash in Uttar Pradesh last November killed 150 people. India s ailing rail network is in the midst of a $130 billion, five-year modernization process.  In addition, the government launched a $15 billion safety overhaul in February after the surge in accidents blamed on defective tracks. But in June, Reuters reported that the overhaul was facing delays as the state steel company could not meet demand for new rails. [nL3N1JO1TU] ",worldnews,"November 24, 2017 ",1
U.S. Navy halts search for three sailors lost in Philippine Sea air crash,"TOKYO (Reuters) - A U.S. Navy said it has called off a search for three sailors missing since a transport plane crashed in the Philippines Sea south of Japan on Wednesday enroute to the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier.  During the course of two days, eight U.S. Navy and Japan Maritime Defence Force ships, three helicopter squadrons and maritime patrol aircraft covered nearly 1,000 square nautical miles,  the U.S. Seventh Fleet said in a press release.  Eight other people on a C-2 Greyhound were rescued shortly after the aircraft crashed and transferred to the Reagan.  The latest Navy accident in the Asia Pacific comes after two deadly incidents in the region involving U.S. warships that have raised questions about training and the pace of Navy operations in the region, prompting a Congressional hearing and the removal of a number of some senior officers. The propeller powered C-2 on Wednesday was conducting a routine flight carrying passengers and cargo from Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni in Japan to the carrier.  The mainstay transport aircraft for the U.S. carrier fleet has been in operation for more than five decades and is due to be replaced by a long-range version of the tilt-rotor Osprey aircraft. The U.S. Navy said it is investigating the cause of the crash. Japanese Minister of Defence Itsunori Onodera told reporters on Wednesday that the U.S. Navy informed him that the crash may have been a result of engine trouble. ",worldnews,"November 24, 2017 ",1
Mexican ruling party to pick presidential candidate on February 18,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico s ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) said on Thursday registration for PRI contenders in the July 2018 presidential election will begin on Dec. 3, and that a national convention would pick the candidate on Feb. 18. In a statement, the PRI said the national convention would be made up of around 19,100 delegates to be chosen during the second week of December. President Enrique Pena Nieto is barred by law from seeking a second six-year term. Ruling Mexico continuously from 1929, the PRI had become a byword for corruption by the time it was voted out in 2000. Pena Nieto returned the party to power in 2012, but a slew of corruption scandals, ongoing gang violence and anemic growth have sapped the PRI s credibility in the past five years. The party faces an uphill struggle to hang on to power, and veteran leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, twice a runner-up for the presidency, has led most early polling for 2018. The run-up to the election takes place in the midst of fraught discussions between Mexico, the United States and Canada over the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which underpins much of the region s commerce. U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to walk away from the accord if he cannot rework it in favor of the United States. The three nations have pledged to keep talking through March.

Pope faces diplomatic dilemma in Myanmar visit,"VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis visits Myanmar next week, a delicate trip for the world s most senior Christian to a majority Buddhist country accused by Washington of the  ethnic cleansing  of Muslim Rohingya people. He will also visit Bangladesh to where more than 600,000 people have fled from what Amnesty International called  crimes against humanity  including murder, rape torture and forcible displacement, allegations the Myanmar military denies. The trip is so delicate that some of the pope s advisors have warned him against even saying the word  Rohingya,  lest he set off a diplomatic incident that could turn the country s military and government against minority Christians. The most tense moments of the Nov. 26-Dec. 2 trip are likely to be private meetings with army head Senior General Min Aung Hlaing and, separately, civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Myanmar does not recognize Rohingya as citizens nor as a group with its own identity, posing a dilemma for Francis as he visits a country of 51 million people where only around 700,000 are Roman Catholics.  He risks either compromising his moral authority or putting in danger the Christians of that country,  said Father Thomas Reese, a prominent American author and analyst at Religion News Service.  I have great admiration for the pope and his abilities, but someone should have talked him out of making this trip,  he wrote. Vatican sources say some in the Holy See believe the trip was decided too hastily after full diplomatic ties were established in May during a visit by Suu Kyi, whose global esteem as a Nobel Peace Prize laureate has been tarnished by expressing doubts about the rights abuse allegations and failing to condemn the military.  Pope Francis needs to be firm on all fronts. While the violence cannot stop without the cooperation of security forces, Suu Kyi should not be given a free pass either,  said Lynn Kuok, a fellow of the Brookings Institution s Center for East Asia Policy Studies. In a late addition to his itinerary, Francis will meet Rohingya refugees on the second leg of his trip in the Bangladesi capital Dhaka. His meeting with General Min Aung Hlaing was also a late addition following negotiations with the military by Myanmar s senior churchman, Cardinal Charles Bo.  In a video message sent to Myanmar last week, Francis said he wanted the trip to lead to  reconciliation, forgiveness and peace , to further the Gospel values of  dignity for every man and woman  and encourage harmony and cooperation. The pope has already used the word Rohingya in two appeals from the Vatican this year. Asked if he would say it in Myanmar, Vatican spokesman Greg Burke said Francis was taking the advice he had been given seriously, but added:  We will find out together during the trip ... it is not a forbidden word . Senior Vatican sources said the pope will be mindful of not doing anything that could imperil Myanmar s transition to democracy.    The Pope is one of the most respected moral voices in the world today, and for that reason his visit will be significant,  said Richard Horsey, a Yangon-based analyst and former senior United Nations official in Myanmar.  But he will be conscious of the fact that popular opinion in Myanmar is firmly behind the government and against the Rohingya, and that the intervention of a Christian leader on this religiously-charged issue could inflame sentiments rather than encourage positive movement,  Horsey said. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Wednesday called the operation against the Rohingya  ethnic cleansing  and threatened targeted sanctions for  horrendous atrocities.  Amnesty International said the Rohingya and Muslims generally in Rakhine State had been subjected to  systemic social and political exclusion  for decades and accused the military of  crimes against humanity  in the last two years including murder, rape torture and forcible displacement. Myanmar s government has denied most of the claims, and the army has said its own probe found no evidence of wrongdoing by troops who say their actions were in response to militant attacks on 30 police posts and an army base.  The Vatican has little by way of carrots and sticks that can help,  said Kuok, the Brookings fellow.  That said, the pope s visit can help to raise awareness about the Rohingya community, which may then lead to indirect pressure on governments to do more about the situation there.

Men found at northern Japan marina say they are from North Korea: police,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Police in northern Japan have found eight men near a boat at a seaside marina who said they were from North Korea, and appear to be fishermen whose vessel ran into trouble, rather than defectors, a police official said on Friday. The incident comes at a time of rising tension over North Korea s nuclear arms and missile programs after President Donald Trump redesignated the isolated nation a state sponsor of terrorism, allowing the United States to levy further sanctions. Japanese police took the men into custody after a resident of Yurihonjo, a city in the prefecture of Akita, told police of the presence of individuals of unknown nationality, the official, Yoshinobu Ito, told Reuters. The men, who said they were North Koreans, appear to be fishermen whose wooden boat, found nearby, had trouble and went adrift, Ito said. Police and authorities were now dealing with the matter, he added. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, asked if the possibility the men were spies had been ruled out, told a news conference authorities were handling the matter carefully. Japan is studying plans to cope with a possible influx of tens of thousands of North Korean evacuees should a military or other crisis break out on the peninsula, as well as how to weed out spies and terrorists among them, a domestic newspaper said. Last week, the Japan Coast Guard rescued three North Korean men on a capsized boat in the Sea of Japan, off central Japan. The men said they were fishermen and were later sent home aboard a North Korean vessel. Twelve more crew went missing. Last week a North Korean soldier dramatically defected to the South after being shot and wounded by his country s military as he made his getaway across the border in the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone between the two countries.

U.N. rights team to visit Mexico after journalist murders,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The United Nations said on Thursday a group of experts on freedom of expression will visit Mexico at the end of November to assess the safety of journalists in the country, one of the most dangerous in the world for reporters. David Kaye, U.N. Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression, and Edison Lanza, who holds the same position at the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, will visit from Nov. 27 to Dec. 4 after an invitation by the government.  This visit is about the crisis the press is going through in Mexico, the exponential increase in violence,  said Leopoldo Maldonado, the protection and defense program officer in Mexico at Article 19, a freedom of expression advocacy group. The visit comes as Mexico s journalists live through one of the worst waves of violence in recent history, with at least 11 reporters murdered in 2017, the same number killed in 2016. Over the past 17 years, 111 journalists have been killed in Mexico, more than one third of them under the administration of President Enrique Pena Nieto. Reporters are also having to contend with other forms of intimidation. In June, activists, human-rights lawyers and journalists filed a criminal complaint after experts found that their smartphones had been infected with advanced spying software sold only to the government. The Mexican government said at the time that there was no proof it was responsible for the spying and that it condemned any attempt to violate the privacy of any person. The rights experts will travel to Mexico City and the states of Guerrero, Veracruz, Tamaulipas and Sinaloa to meet legislative, executive and judicial authorities plus journalists and representatives of civil society, the U.N. said. Reporters Without Borders ranks Mexico at 147 out of 180 countries in its World Press Freedom Index, below Venezuela, South Sudan and Bangladesh, and one place above Russia.{rsf.org/en/ranking#} ",worldnews,"November 24, 2017 ",1
Syria opposition meeting in Riyadh sees no role for Assad in transition,"RIYADH/AMMAN (Reuters) - Syria s main opposition stuck by its demand on Thursday that President Bashar al-Assad play no role in an interim period under any U.N.-sponsored peace deal, despite speculation it could soften its stance because of Assad s battlefield strength. A gathering in Saudi Arabia of more than 140 participants from a broad spectrum of Syria s mainstream opposition also blasted Iran s military presence in Syria and called on Shi ite militias backed by Tehran to leave the country.  The participants stressed that this (the transition) cannot happen without the departure of Bashar al Assad and his clique at the start of the interim period,  opposition groups said in a communique at the end of the meeting. Iran-backed militias sowed  terrorism and sectarian strife  between Sunni and Shi ite Muslims, the communique said. The opposition groups met to seek a unified position ahead of U.N.-backed peace talks after two years of Russian military intervention that has helped Assad s government recapture all of Syria s main cities.   The Syrian opposition has sent a message that it is ready to enter serious direct talks over a political transition in Syria and has a unified position and a vision for the future of Syria,  Ahmad Ramadan, opposition spokesman, told Reuters. The participants elected 50 members to a High Negotiations Committee and will finalize on Friday the delegation for the next round of U.N.-sponsored talks.  We agreed with the group of components present here in Riyadh and the Cairo and Moscow platforms on the formation of one delegation to participate in direct negotiations in Geneva in a few days,  spokeswoman Basma Qadmani said. U.N. peace talks mediator Staffan de Mistura, preparing for a new round of Geneva talks, will visit Moscow on Friday, where he is expected to discuss the situation in Syria. There had been speculation that the opposition, at the meeting, could soften its demands that Kremlin ally Assad leave power before any transition. Riyad Hijab, an opposition hardliner who led the High Negotiations Committee that represented the opposition at previous rounds of negotiations, abruptly quit this week. For many years, Western and Arab countries backed the opposition demand that Assad leave office. However, since Russia joined the war on behalf of Assad s government it has become increasingly clear that Assad s opponents have no path to victory on the battlefield. Russian President Vladimir Putin has called for a congress of the Syrian government and opposition to draw up a framework for the future structure of the Syrian state, adopt a new constitution and hold elections under UN supervision.  But he has also said that any political settlement in Syria would be finalised within the Geneva peace talks process overseen by the United Nations.  The opposition has long been suspicious of the parallel diplomatic track pushed by Russia, which before the proposed Sochi congress included talks in Kazakhstan, and has insisted that political dialogue should only take place in Geneva.  The opposition communique said the participants supported a U.N. based process that would allow Syria to undergo  a radical political transition  from an  authoritarian system  to a democracy where free elections would be upheld. Negotiations should be direct and without preconditions based on past U.N. Security Council resolutions, it said. The opposition backed the restructuring of the army and security organs and preservation of state institutions, but called for the trial of those responsible for war crimes. The meeting, which included independents and Free Syrian Army military factions, also blamed the Syrian government for the lack of progress in Geneva-based talks held in the past.  The political process has not achieved its goal because of the regime s violations,  the communique said, citing the bombing of civilian areas, the siege of rebel held areas and the detention of tens of thousands of dissidents.  Syria s civil war, now in its seventh year, has killed hundreds of thousands of people and created the world s worst refugee crisis, driving more than 11 million people from their homes.

Irish government on verge of collapse ahead of EU Brexit summit,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - The Irish government was on the verge of collapse on Thursday after the party whose votes Prime Minister Leo Varadkar depends on to pass legislation said it would seek to remove the deputy prime minister in a breach of their cooperation agreement. The crisis comes three weeks ahead of a European Union summit in which the Irish government has an effective veto on whether Britain s talks on leaving the bloc progress as it determines if EU concerns about the future of the Irish border have been met. In a row that escalated rapidly, the opposition Fianna Fail party said it would put a motion of no confidence in Deputy Prime Minister Frances Fitzgerald before parliament on Tuesday over her handling of a legal case involving a police whistleblower.  That would break the three-year  confidence and supply  agreement that allowed Varadkar s Fine Gael party to form a minority government 18 months ago. Fianna Fail initially indicated it might withdraw its threat if Fitzgerald resigned but Fine Gael members of parliament passed a unanimous motion of support in Fitzgerald at an emergency meeting on Thursday evening. Asked after Fine Gael s statement whether the country was headed for an election, a senior Fianna Fail source replied:  Straight towards one.  The source declined to be named as the party s frontbench was due to hold an emergency meeting early on Friday to decide its next move.  This is ... dangerous politically at a time when the country does not need an election,  Foreign Minister Simon Coveney of Fine Gael told national Irish broadcaster RTE, in an apparent reference to the Brexit talks he had earlier described as a  historic moment  for the island of Ireland. The border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, which will be the UK s only land frontier with the bloc after its departure, is one of three issues Brussels wants broadly solved before it decides next month on whether to move the talks onto a second phase about trade, as Britain wants. Coveney told parliament on Thursday that the government was not yet ready to allow the talks to move on to the trade issues at the Dec. 14-15 summit and needed more clarity from London. A breakdown of the government s cooperation deal, which has worked relatively smoothly up until now between two parties that differ little on policy but have been bitter foes for decades, would likely lead to an election in December or January. The Fianna Fail move comes after Fitzgerald admitted she was made aware of an attempt to discredit a police whistleblower in a 2015 email, but failed to act. Fine Gael say she adhered to due process. Since Varadkar s appointment as Fine Gael leader in May, his party has narrowly led Fianna Fail in opinion polls that suggest both parties would increase their support but still struggle to form anything but another minority government.

Possible explosion detected near Argentine sub's last-known location,"MAR DEL PLATA, Argentina (Reuters) - The Argentine navy raised the possibility on Thursday that a navy submarine missing in the South Atlantic suffered an explosion, heightening concerns over the fate of the 44 crew members on the eighth day of an international search effort. A sound detected underwater by an international agency on the morning of Nov. 15, around the time the ARA San Juan sent its last signal and in the same area, was  consistent with an explosion,  navy spokesman Enrique Balbi told reporters. The sub had only a seven-day supply of oxygen, a fact that drained hope from some of the relatives of the crew who have gathered at the vessel s base in the city of Mar del Plata.  What s the point of hope if it s already over?  Itati Leguizamon, wife of one of the missing crew members, told reporters.  The navy did not have enough information to say what the cause of the explosion could have been or whether the vessel might have been attacked, Balbi said. Search-and-rescue crews were undeterred by a series of false leads that raised hope over recent days that the sub might be located. Asked during an evening news conference about the fate of the 44 sailors, Balbi said the situation was  critical .  We are not going to enter into conjecture out of respect for the families,  he added. The information about the possible explosion was received  on Thursday from the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Organization, or CTBTO, an international body that runs a global network of listening posts designed to check for secret atomic blasts. The Vienna-based agency, which has monitoring stations equipped with devices including underwater microphones that scan the oceans for sound waves, said in a statement that two of its  stations had detected an unusual signal near where the submarine went missing. The agency was more guarded about whether that  was caused by an explosion. A huge sea and air hunt is being conducted for the San Juan, a German-built, diesel-electric powered submarine that was launched in 1983, as crew members  relatives waited anxiously for news more than a week after the vessel disappeared. The relatives had been largely optimistic until Thursday. They shed tears and insulted authorities after being briefed on the news of the possible explosion. They were told about it before the public announcement. Balbi said the news of the abnormal sound was consistent with a separate report received on Wednesday of an  acoustic anomaly  in the same area and around the same time. The San Juan was some 430 km (270 miles) off the Patagonian coast when it sent its last signal.  This is very important because it allows us to correlate and confirm the acoustic anomaly from the U.S. report yesterday,  Balbi said.  Here, we re talking about a singular, short, violent, non-nuclear event, consistent with an explosion.  In Vienna, CTBTO hydroacoustic engineer Mario Zampolli said the signal his agency had detected  could be consistent with an explosion but there is no certainty about this.  Speaking to Reuters, he agreed with Balbi s description of the signal as unusual and short, adding that the cause was non-natural. The submarine was en route from Ushuaia, the southernmost city in the world, to Mar del Plata, 400 km (250 miles) south of Buenos Aires, when it reported an electrical malfunction shortly before disappearing. Some relatives have questioned authorities for letting the crew navigate on an ageing submarine - criticism that has highlighted the armed forces  dwindling resources since the end of a military dictatorship in the 1980s.  Authorities have said the level of maintenance, not the age, was what mattered, and that the vessel was in good condition.  ",worldnews,"November 23, 2017 ",1

Mexican leftist Lopez Obrador leads presidential race polls," (This version of the November 22nd story corrects deadline for parties to register candidates in eleventh par) MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican leftist presidential hopeful Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador showed leads over potential rivals in two newspaper polls published Wednesday, shortly after he unveiled key policies of his campaign platform ahead of next July s election. Lopez Obrador is almost certain to be the candidate for his National Regeneration Movement (MORENA), but other parties have yet to announce who will run for them, making accurate polling difficult.  The survey in business newspaper El Financiero showed Lopez Obrador, a former Mexico City mayor who has already vied twice for the presidency, ahead in any of ten potential candidate groupings with leads ranging from 5 to 15 percentage points.       A separate poll in national daily El Universal showed AMLO, as the politician is known locally, at the top in six candidate combinations but with smaller margins, ranging from 5 to 10 points. The 64-year-old laid out his 2018 policy platform on Monday, vowing to boost infrastructure spending without upsetting economic stability. He also published a 415-page manifesto outlining goals such as cleaning up graft with tighter financial regulations.     Lopez Obrador narrowly lost in 2006 and by a larger margin in 2012, in both cases refusing to accept results he dismissed as marred by fraud.  He previously ran a popular, moderate government as mayor of Mexico City, but rivals depict him as a dangerous firebrand and liken his policies and style to the socialist project in crisis-hit Venezuela.     Next year s election is expected to be contested by multiple candidates including independents for the first time, which will fragment the vote, a change that could favor either Lopez Obrador or the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). President Enrique Pena Nieto is barred by law from a second term. In both polls, Interior Minister Miguel Angel Osorio Chong emerges as the strongest potential candidate for the ruling party, which is considering at least four high-ranking officials.  Mexican political parties have until March to formally register candidates, but most have set a mid-December deadline to benefit from a longer campaign period.  A coalition headed by the center-right National Action Party (PAN) and center-left Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) is also contemplating several options for candidacy. El Universal conducted 1,000 face-to-face interviews between Nov. 10 and 17 nationwide, resulting in a 3.53 percent margin of error. El Financiero conducted 1,004 face-to-face interviews between Nov. 11 and 16 nationwide, and said the poll has a 3.1 percent margin of error. ",worldnews,"November 22, 2017 ",1
Peru's prime minister skeptical about bill to expand anti-graft rules,"LIMA (Reuters) - The government of Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski will likely object to a bill passed by Congress that aims to expand new anti-graft restrictions to Grana y Montero and other local partners of Brazilian builder Odebrecht [ODBES.UL], the prime minister said Thursday. Odebrecht has admitted to paying millions of dollars in bribes to officials in Peru over a decade-long period, and lawmakers want the financial constraints written to keep Odebrecht from evading payment of fines for bribery to apply to the companies it partnered with. But Prime Minister Mercedes Araoz said a new bill that sailed through the opposition-ruled Congress two weeks ago threatens to paralyze construction projects and likely violates due process.  I m not a lawyer but I do think that you always have to respect the presumption of innocence,  Araoz told foreign media in the capital Lima.  There are parts of it that we would have to take issue with.  Araoz said Congress has not yet sent the bill to the executive branch for passage and that the justice and economy ministries would study it thoroughly before taking any action. The legislation would restrict international asset transfers and the right to seize  ill gotten gains  of Grana and other Odebrecht partners. However, none of Odebrecht s local partners have been convicted of any crimes and deny taking part in Odebrecht s bribes. Grana, Peru s biggest construction group and Odebrecht s most important local partner, saw its shares drop nearly 23 percent to 2.4 soles ( 0.5573) after passage of the legislation. Grana did not immediately respond to requests for comment but has criticized the bill as unconstitutional and promised to take legal action if it becomes law. Lawmakers who back the legislation have said Odebrecht s partners likely had a hand in Odebrecht s kickback schemes and that prosecutors were working too slowly in finding other guilty parties. Grana is under investigation in the attorney general s office but has not been charged with any crime and has repeatedly denied wrongdoing. Araoz added that the government is planning to ask Congress for special legislative powers to make tax collection more efficient. However, she said the changes would be minor and ruled out any changes to tax rates. ",worldnews,"November 23, 2017 ",1
Search for missing Argentine submarine reaches 'critical phase',"MAR DEL PLATA, Argentina/BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - The search for an Argentine navy submarine missing in the South Atlantic for one week reached a  critical phase  on Wednesday as the 44 crew on board could be running low on oxygen, a navy spokesman said. Dozens of planes and boats were searching for the ARA San Juan, a mission that has plunged relatives of the sailors into an anguished wait for news and transfixed the South American country of 44 million people.   If the German-built submarine, in service for more than three decades, had sunk or was otherwise unable to rise to the surface since it gave its last location on Nov. 15, it would be using up the last of its seven-day oxygen supply.  We are in the critical phase...particularly with respect to oxygen,  navy spokesman Enrique Balbi told reporters.  There has been no contact with anything that could be the San Juan submarine.  Relatives of the crew members have gathered at a naval base in Mar del Plata, where the search is coordinated. Their concern grew as the hours ticked by. The craft was probably on the seabed because the mechanism to surface either failed or was not activated by a crew member, naval investigator Fernando Morales told Reuters in a telephone interview.  If the captain stayed at the bottom because he thought it was more prudent to stay at the bottom, it s one thing. But at this point we have to think that if he s at the bottom, it s because he could not emerge,  Morales said. In an evening news conference, Balbi said an unusual noise was detected on Nov. 15, near where the submarine last reported its position. He declined to say if the sound indicated an explosion or emergency on the vessel. Data on the noise were being analyzed, he added. Favorable weather allowed search boats to cover a greater area after being hampered by strong winds and waves for much of the past few days, Balbi said. Poor weather was expected to return on Thursday. Around 30 boats and planes and 4,000 people from Argentina, the United States, Britain, Chile and Brazil have joined the search for the submarine, which last transmitted its location about 480 km (300 miles) from the coast.  Planes have covered some 500,000 square km (190,000 square miles) of the ocean surface, but much of the area has not yet been scoured by the boats. Argentines have been gripped by the search, with local newspapers placing photographs on their front pages of crew members  relatives praying. The case has dominated discussion on social media in Argentina, with the hash tags  Los 44  (The 44) and (navy spokesman)  Enrique Balbi  becoming trending topics on Twitter. Comparisons were made to the most recent major rescue operation in the region, when 33 miners in northern Chile were rescued in 2010 after 69 days trapped underground. The submarine was en route from Ushuaia, the southernmost city in the world, to the coastal city of Mar del Plata, some 400 km (250 miles) south of Buenos Aires, when it reported an electrical malfunction shortly before disappearing last week. The submarine was launched in 1983 and underwent maintenance in 2008 in Argentina. The disappearance has highlighted the dwindling resources and lack of training faced by the armed forces since the end of a military dictatorship in the early 1980s.

Irish government on verge of collapse in spat over deputy PM,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - The Irish government was on the verge of collapse on Thursday after the party whose votes Prime Minister Leo Varadkar depends on to pass legislation appeared set to break the terms of a  confidence and supply  deal. The opposition Fianna Fail party said it would put a motion of no confidence in Deputy Prime Minister Frances Fitzgerald on Tuesday, a move that would breach the deal it agreed to support Varadkar s Fine Gael government in key votes for three years.  Fianna Fail indicated it might withdraw the motion if Fitzgerald resigned, but Foreign Minister Simon Coveney told state broadcaster RTE that Fitzgerald would not resign. The crisis comes weeks ahead of a European Union summit in which the Irish government has an effective veto on whether Britain s talks on leaving the bloc progress as it determines if EU concerns about the future of the Irish border have been met.

U.S. asks Venezuela for access to detained Citgo executives,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Washington has asked the government of leftist Nicolas Maduro for access to Venezuelan-American executives of U.S.-based refiner Citgo detained in Caracas this week, a State Department official said on Thursday.       Five of six Citgo [PDVSAC.UL] executives arrested on graft allegations are U.S. citizens, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday. All six men are being held in the headquarters of Venezuela s military counterintelligence department in Caracas, the country s state prosecutor said in a statement on Thursday.  Socialist Maduro has said that the United States, his ideological foe, had requested the men be freed, but he vowed on Wednesday they would be tried as  corrupt, thieving traitors  for allegedly seeking to personally profit from a financial deal that was detrimental to the nation.   The U.S. Embassy in Venezuela has asked that (Venezuelan) authorities grant consular access to all U.S. citizen detainees in Venezuela. We call on the (Venezuelan government) to do so immediately in accordance with the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations,  the State Department official said.  Relations between Caracas and Washington have long been tense. They have further soured under President Donald Trump since his administration imposed sanctions on Venezuelan officials including Maduro, and economic sanctions that have impeded the OPEC nation s access to international banks. U.S.-based Citgo Petroleum Corp (Citgo) is a Venezuelan-owned refiner and marketer of oil and petrochemical products and the arrests come amid a wider anti-corruption sweep in Venezuela s oil industry. Around 50 managers at state oil company PDVSA have been arrested since August.  Sources in the energy sector say the arrests owe more to Maduro s move to sideline rivals and increase his control of money-making companies as the country struggles in a devastating recession.  The political opposition says PDVSA is rife with corruption, and a congressional investigation concluded that at least $11 billion went  missing  between 2004 and 2014.  The legacy of socialism: To have destroyed PDVSA and the oil industry and turned it into a den of corruption and nepotism,  opposition lawmaker Jose Guerra said on Twitter.  They need to blame someone and some  gringos  are ideal,  Guerra later told Reuters.  The arrests rid Citgo of much of its top brass and have instilled fear throughout Venezuela s oil industry, snarling up decision making, sources close to PDVSA have told Reuters.  The arrests also come at a highly delicate time for Venezuela, which was declared in selective default this month after some late payments. But as Venezuela is making efforts to pay, bondholders of some of the world s highest yielding debt have so far been tolerant of the delays.   ",worldnews,"November 23, 2017 ",1
Guatemala prosecutors raid Millicom offices in graft probe,"GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - Guatemala s attorney general and a United Nations-backed commission against impunity in Guatemala searched the offices of Millicom International Cellular s local unit on Thursday as part of a corruption investigation. The raid comes four months after Ivan Velasquez, head of the commission, known as CICIG, said in July it would investigate Tigo, the Guatemalan affiliate of emerging markets mobile and media group Millicom, over alleged illegal campaign financing and corruption.     Tigo declined to comment on the raid. Guatemalan police arrested 17 people in July on suspicion of involvement in a corruption racket allegedly directed by the country s former communications minister, Alejandro Sinibaldi, who has been on the run since June 2016. During the probe, investigators found evidence of payments from Telecomunicaciones de Guatemala S.A. (Telgua), a subsidiary of billionaire Carlos Slim s America Movil, in Sinibaldi s account. CICIG said that the payments were made to secure the company favorable treatment in a dispute with Tigo.  America Movil said at the time it would audit the unit. In October 2015, Millicom said it had reported to U.S. and Swedish authorities  potential improper payments  on behalf of its joint-venture in Guatemala, sending its shares down.  It was not immediately clear if this was related to the current investigation.      ",worldnews,"November 23, 2017 ",1
"Fair elections in Poland at risk from ruling party bill, opposition says","WARSAW (Reuters) - A bill sponsored by Poland s ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party will undermine the fairness of elections, opposition deputies said in parliament on Thursday. The proposal would introduce live web feeds from polling stations, but also replace all current members of the State Electoral Commission, a body responsible for conducting and overseeing elections, as well as all election commissioners, giving political parties more say in naming new ones. The PiS has said its bill would make voting more transparent, but critics said the real aim is to boost the electoral prospects of the party, which has been accused by the European Commission of eroding democratic standards.  This bill is a thuggish project. This is a mine placed under elections in Poland,  the head of opposition PSL party, Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said in parliament. The socially conservative PiS, in power since late 2015, is already at loggerheads with fellow members of the European Union over its push to bring the courts and state media under more direct government control, as well as over migration. According to the 72-page long amendment that did not undergo any public consultations, seven of the nine members of the State Electoral Commission would be chosen by parliament for 9-year terms, with PiS set to directly appoint three members and the remaining parties four.  The remaining two members would be judges chosen by the head of the Constitutional Tribunal and the Supreme Administrative court.  PiS deputies have already appointed the head of the Tribunal following changes in the law that opposition parties said violated the constitution, a charge PiS denies.  The changes proposed in the bill will destabilize the election system and are a serious threat to the effective carrying out of the local elections in 2018,  the State Election Commission said in a statement last week. Head of the Commission Wojciech Hermelinski said on Thursday the amendment would also give an advantage to political parties at the expense of independent candidates. The bill would require the newly-chosen Commission to appoint nearly 400 election commissioners within 60 days of the bill coming into force, removing the requirement for the commissioners to be independent from political parties. Lawmakers are expected to initially vote on the bill early on Friday. If finally passed by the PiS-dominated parliament, the bill would still have to be signed into law by President Andrzej Duda, who could potentially veto it. ",worldnews,"November 23, 2017 ",1
German Social Democrats under pressure to form grand coalition,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The leader of Germany s Social Democrats came under growing pressure on Thursday to drop his opposition to a new  grand coalition  with Angela Merkel s conservatives, with senior politicians arguing the party had a duty to promote stability. Merkel is facing the biggest political crisis of her career since efforts to forge a three-way coalition with the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and Greens collapsed last weekend. That has raised worries across Europe of a prolonged leadership vacuum in the continent s economic powerhouse. The Social Democrats (SPD) have governed in coalition under Merkel since 2013. But leader Martin Schulz said the party must heed the will of voters by going into opposition after achieving its worst result of the postwar period in the Sept. 24 election. Pressure is growing on the party to revisit his decision, either by agreeing to prop up a conservative-led minority government by not voting against it, or by forming a renewed coalition. In either case, the position of Schulz as party leader could become untenable. If changing course and teaming up with the conservatives requires a change of leadership at the SPD, that would be unlikely before a party conference on Dec. 7-9. Schulz held a lengthy meeting with President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, a former SPD lawmaker and foreign minister, on Thursday afternoon before heading to party headquarters to consult senior party members. Steinmeier is trying to help facilitate a coalition government and avoid fresh elections.  We will talk about if and how one can get a federal government in Germany,  a senior SPD member said ahead of the meeting, adding that one option on the table was to support Merkel only indirectly by not blocking a minority government. But Stephan Weil, the SPD premier of the state of Lower Saxony, one of the party s most influential figures after he defied polls by winning re-election this year, implied a full coalition would preferable to a minority government.  Minority governments are fragile constructs,  he told the RND newspaper consortium. The SPD had to chart a path between a party rank-and-file reluctant to repeat the bruising experience of a grand coalition and its democratic obligations.  Everyone understands that the stakes are high, involving the stability of an extremely important member of the European Union,  he added. Volker Kauder, leader of the conservative parliamentary group and a key ally Merkel ally, echoed the sentiment, calling for the grand coalition to be reprised.  Europe is waiting for a Germany capable of acting so that it can finally respond to the questions raised by French President (Emmanuel) Macron,  he said, referring to Macron s call for fiscal reforms to strengthen the euro zone. Germany, the world s fourth largest economy, has long been a bastion of stability in the EU, and officials in Brussels and Paris fear months of political uncertainty could harm plans to reform euro zone governance and EU defense and asylum policies. Merkel, who remains acting chancellor until a new government is agreed, has said she would prefer to work with the SPD, but if that option fails, she would favor new elections over an unstable minority government. Another election would also provide no speedy resolution. Under Germany s constitution, the president could call another election only after Merkel had lost several votes in the Bundestag   a process that could take several months. The mass-circulation Bild newspaper reported on Wednesday that 30 members of the SPD s 153-strong parliamentary group this week had questioned Schulz s preference for going into opposition during a meeting of the parliamentary party. Speaking to ZDF television on Thursday, SPD deputy leader Karl Lauterbach said his party might have to rethink its opposition to another  grand coalition , but added he was still skeptical about joining one led by Merkel. The SPD supports Macron s proposal to give the euro zone the power to spend money to protect members of the single currency bloc against external shocks. If the SPD changes tack about a  grand coalition , however, the leader of Merkel s sister party in the state of Bavaria, the Christian Social Union (CSU), said on Thursday it should not expect the conservatives to grant any significant concessions.  We can t be blackmailed,  said Horst Seehofer, who is himself fighting to hang on as CSU leader in the face of internal opposition. ",worldnews,"November 23, 2017 ",1
EY says cooperating with authorities in Italy probe,"MILAN (Reuters) - Accounting firm EY said on Thursday it was cooperating with Milan magistrates in an investigation into whether one of its former employees in Italy had sold it confidential government information.   On Nov. 21 we became aware of the investigation targeting EY in Italy. We are examining it carefully and seriously and we are fully cooperating with the judiciary,  EY said in a statement, adding it was not in a position to comment further.   Italian magistrates suspect that Susanna Masi, a Treasury official and former EY employee, was paid some 220,000 euros ($260,000) between 2013-2015 in return for sensitive material, judicial sources involved in the case said on Wednesday. The sources said the confidential material included information on planned tax reforms which could have given EY   previously known as Ernst & Young   an unfair advantage over its rivals. Masi s lawyer, Giorgio Perroni, has denied any wrongdoing by his client. [nL8N1NS5SS]   ",worldnews,"November 23, 2017 ",1
"Journalists detained by Uganda charged with treason, police say","KAMPALA (Reuters) - Eight managers and editors of a daily newspaper arrested this week have been charged with treason, Ugandan police said on Thursday. Police raided the Red Pepper, Uganda s leading tabloid, late on Tuesday and detained the journalists, whom they accused of publishing a false story the previous day.  The story, citing unnamed sources, alleged that Rwanda believed Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni was plotting to oust its leader, Paul Kagame.  Besides treason, the journalists were charged with  offensive communication and publication of information prejudicial to national security,  police spokesman Emilian Kayima told Reuters. Kayima couldn t say when the journalists would appear in court. Rights groups and journalists have complained of escalating harassment and intimidation of independent media by security personnel in Uganda.  We believe that this is economic sabotage aimed at occasioning the media house financial loss since all its production have been stopped,  the Human Rights Network for Journalists - Uganda (HRNJ-U), a local media rights group, said in a statement issued on Thursday. Local media, including Red Pepper, have reported this month on tensions between Uganda and neighboring Rwanda over a range of economic and security disputes. Uganda s foreign affairs ministry has dismissed the reports as rumors and insisted relations between the two countries were untroubled.  ",worldnews,"November 23, 2017 ",1
Backlash among German MPs against parliamentary Twitter ban,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German lawmakers have protested after Wolfgang Schaeuble, the new president of the Bundestag, announced a ban on sending tweets from inside the parliament chamber. In a letter published in German media on Thursday, the former finance minister told lawmakers that  using devices to photograph, tweet or send messages from the plenary chamber is inappropriate to the proceedings of the Bundestag . German politicians are far behind other countries  in addressing voters via Twitter s short messaging service, and none comes close to U.S. President Donald Trump - but the measure has not gone unprotested.  This is not going to be the last word on the matter,  tweeted conservative lawmaker Dorothee B r, who with more than 64,000 followers is among the biggest Twitter stars of German politics, proving her adeptness with a winking smiley and a string of hashtags.  You can watch parliamentary sessions live, but we can t tweet from it,  tweeted her liberal colleague Frank Sitta.  Would a handwritten letter from inside be ok? It makes no sense!  It was not clear if either of those tweets had been sent from the parliament chamber. The backlash comes after an election which heard promises to address Germany s relative slowness in adopting the latest digital technologies. Politicians fear the industrial and export titan s strength risks being undermined by more nimble digital upstarts from Silicon Valley. During his decade at the finance ministry, Schaeuble earned a reputation for ruthlessly policing indebted euro zone states  budgets. Lawmakers chose him for his new job in the hope he would ably discipline a parliament that since September s national election is more fragmented than ever before. ",worldnews,"November 23, 2017 ",1
"Macron tones down criticism of Poland, but concerned by its judicial reform plans","PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday that Poland s plans to overhaul the judiciary remained a cause for concern though there were a decreasing number of subjects where the two countries did not see eye-to-eye. Frosty even under the previous French administration, bilateral relations between the two powers reached a new low in August when Macron said the Polish people deserved better leaders and he shunned Poland during an eastern Europe tour. That prompted Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlo at the time to call him  arrogant  and  inexperienced . But at a joint news conference on Thursday in Paris the two leaders appeared to want to put their differences to one side, with Macron saying:  We have disagreements, which we talked about, but also points on which we share views.  Poland s ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party has been increasingly at loggerheads with the EU since coming to office in late 2015, locked in disputes with the bloc over immigration and putting courts and media under more government control.  More than two dozen rights groups signed a petition this week saying plans to overhaul Poland s judiciary would end the country s status as a democratic state based on the rule of law. When he met Szydlo on Thursday, Macron avoided overt criticism and said it was not up to him to lecture another EU country on its domestic reforms. But he added that France would follow the conclusions of the EU Commission s investigation on Poland s judicial reforms. The EU is pressing a legal case against Poland over its judicial reform plans and has suggested the country could forfeit some development funds if it refuses to change course.   We will continue to exchange views on this topic for concerns,  Macron said.  If it turns out that what is done does not comply with European treaties, we will all draw the consequences.   If agreements are found, and it turns out it does comply, or if Poland changes the ongoing reform to comply - of which I m neither the judge nor the participant - then in that case we will no longer have any problem,  he added. Szydlo said Poland respected all the principles, values and rights of the European Union.  All the ongoing reforms comply with these principles,  she said. On another issue which has caused friction - the reform of the EU s directive on posted workers - Macron and Szydlo said there was room for compromise. The issue of the so-called posted workers pits wealthier countries against poorer peers keen to preserve current rules that allow their citizens to work elsewhere in the bloc for salaries higher than they would get at home but still lower than the local labor force. Macron won the backing of a majority of EU member states in October to limit  posted work , but Poland opposed it.  The most important thing is that we sit together at the table and talk,  Szydlo said on Thursday.     ",worldnews,"November 23, 2017 ",1
Libyan government says investigating migrant 'slave market' reports,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Libya s U.N.-backed government said on Thursday it was investigating reports of African migrants being sold as slaves and promised to bring the perpetrators to justice. Footage broadcast by CNN appearing to show African migrants being traded in Libya sparked an international outcry and protests in Europe and Africa.  There have been direct instructions issued to form an investigative committee so as to uncover the truth and to capture the wrongdoers, and those responsible, and put them before the judiciary,  Libyan Interior Minister Aref al-Khodja told journalists in Tripoli.  We are now currently waiting for the results of the investigations which I believe are coming to a close.  The CNN video showed what it said was an auction of men offered to Libyan buyers as farmhands and sold for $400, appearing to confirm earlier reports of the existence of markets for trading migrants in Libya. Many Libyans reacted with anger to the outcry, with some pointing to a European push to stop migrants from crossing the Mediterranean to Italy that activists say has resulted in a worsening of conditions for migrants inside Libya.    We call on local and international bodies to cooperate with the Attorney General s Office and provide any information that helps to reveal the truth,  the U.N.-backed government s presidency said in a statement.    We, in Libya, are victims of illegal migration and we are not a source for it,  it added, appealing to foreign powers to help stop flows from migrants  countries of origin and across Libya s southern borders. The U.N. Libya mission said on Wednesday it was  actively pursuing the matter with the Libyan authorities to set up transparent monitoring mechanism that safeguards migrants against horrific human rights abuses . Under pressure from Italy, the U.N.-backed government has co-opted local groups and tried to bolster Libya s coastguard to stem the record flows of migrants crossing the Mediterranean since 2014. Though sea arrivals to Italy are down almost a third this year, this week was marked by a surge in rescues after several days of bad weather, and one body was recovered, Italy s coast guard and humanitarian groups said. On Wednesday, 1,100 migrants were rescued from 11 boats, the coast guard said, and more than 200 were picked up on Thursday. ",worldnews,"November 23, 2017 ",1
Three Georgian military personnel wounded in Afghanistan,"KABUL (Reuters) - Three Georgian military personnel serving with the NATO-led Resolute Support mission in Afghanistan were lightly wounded when their vehicle was attacked near an airbase north of the capital Kabul, officials said. None of their injuries was considered life-threatening, Resolute Support spokesman Capt. Tom Gresback said in an emailed statement on Thursday.  During a recent patrol south of Bagram Airfield yesterday afternoon, three Georgian service members suffered minor injuries when a motorcycle-borne IED (improvised explosive device) was detonated next to their patrol,  he said. The attack came as NATO prepares to send more troops to Afghanistan to support a new U.S. strategy aimed at breaking the stalemate with the Taliban. Georgia, one of the largest contributing nations to the 13,500-strong Resolute Support mission, has around 870 troops in Afghanistan, behind only Germany, Italy and the United States. In August, a Georgian soldier was killed and six other coalition personnel were wounded in an attack on a convoy in Qarabagh district, the area in which Wednesday s attack occurred.

Russia likely to reduce troops in Syria before year-end: military chief,"SOCHI, Russia (Reuters) - The size of Russia s military force in Syria is likely to be significantly reduced and a drawdown could start before the end of the year, the chief of the Russian military general staff said on Thursday. Russia s military support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, notably through air strikes, has been crucial in defeating Islamic State and Syrian opposition forces.  There is very little left to do before the completion of military objectives. Of course, a decision will be made by the supreme commander-in-chief and the deployment will be reduced,  Valery Gerasimov told reporters on the sidelines of a meeting between President Vladimir Putin and military top brass in the Black Sea resort of Sochi. Gerasimov said forces would likely be  substantially  reduced but leave Russia with two military bases, a ceasefire-monitoring center and  a number of necessary structures to support the situation which has developed  in Syria.   Putin hosted Assad in Sochi on Monday and discussed moving from military operations to a search for a political solution to Syria s conflict. [nL8N1NR0K3] On Wednesday, Putin won the backing of Turkey and Iran to host a Syrian peace conference, taking the central role in a major diplomatic push to finally end Syria s civil war, now in its seventh year. [nL8N1NS5RQ] In March last year Putin said Russia had achieved its goals in Syria and ordered the withdrawal of the  main part  of its forces. However, a U.S.-led coalition operating in Syria said that after that statement Russia s combat power was largely intact. ",worldnews,"November 23, 2017 ",1
"Zimbabwe bourse loses $6 billion, index falls 40 percent after military takeover","HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe s stock market has shed $6 billion while its main index has slumped 40 percent since last Wednesday when the military seized power leading to the fall of Robert Mugabe, stock exchange data showed on Thursday. The main industrial index was at 315.12 points compared with 527.27 points on Wednesday last week when the military announced its takeover and put former president Mugabe under house arrest. On Thursday the index fell 4.4 percent. The Zimbabwe Stock Exchange had been on a rapid rise in the last two months, driven by investors seeking a safe haven for their investment amid fears of a return to hyperinflation in an economy suffering acute shortages of foreign exchange. But analysts said the market had entered a period of correction on investor optimism of a change in economic policy in a post-Mugabe era.  Market capitalization was $9 billion, down from $15 billion last week, bourse data showed. On the currency front, black market rates for buying cash dollars softened further on Thursday.  Buying $100 using electronic transfer cost $150, down from $180 last week. Some black market traders said they were not buying dollars at all, anticipating further softening of rates. Zimbabwe adopted the U.S. dollar in 2009, along with Britain s pound and the South African rand, to tame inflation that topped out at 500 billion percent.   The market is adjusting back to reality,  an analyst at a Harare-based asset management company said.  The gains that we had seen were being fueled by an outlook of a return to hyperinflation, continued isolation of Zimbabwe by international lenders as well as well as a depressed economic outlook.  An analyst at a local stockbrocking firm said Mnangagwa had hit the right notes with his speech on Wednesday. Mnangagwa said he wanted to grow the economy, create jobs and for Zimbabwe to re-engage the international community as the country has faced isolation since 1999 when it defaulted on its debt with the International Monetary Fund. Most of Zimbabwe s 13 million people remain poor and face currency shortages and sky-high unemployment, something Mnangagwa promised to address. ",worldnews,"November 23, 2017 ",1
"Pope, at service for Africa, decries murder of women and children","VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Thursday denounced the murder of innocent women and children as the  horrid face  of war as he presided at a special prayer service for peace in South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Francis had planned to go later this year to South Sudan, which has been hit by civil war, famine and a refugee crisis, but had to scrap the project for security reasons. During the service, which was punctuated by African singing in English, French, Italian and Swahili, Francis asked God to  break down the walls of hostility that today divide brothers and sisters, especially in South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo.   May he protect children who suffer from conflicts in which they have no part, but which rob them of their childhood and at times of life itself,  he said in his brief homily.  How hypocritical it is to deny the mass murder of women and children! Here war shows its most horrid face,  he said. St. Peter s Basilica was decked out with photographs of African children. South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011 after protracted bloodshed, then fell into civil war in late 2013, with troops loyal to President Salva Kiir fighting those backing Riek Machar, a former vice president Kiir had sacked. Both sides have targeted civilians, human rights groups say.  Right now, we are moving into the lean season, and by July of 2018, many thousands of people across South Sudan   not just isolated pockets of the country   will be dying from hunger,  said Jerry Farrell, country representative in South Sudan for  Catholic Relief Services.  What is most tragic is there absolutely shouldn t be hunger in South Sudan,  he said in an email, adding that people of different tribes inter-marry and work together but that the conflict is instigated and fanned by politicians. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, dozens of people have died in protests against President Joseph Kabila s refusal to step down at the end of his constitutional mandate last December. Unrest sparked by the uncertainty surrounding the polls has raised fears Congo could witness a repeat of the kind of violence that killed millions around the turn of the last century, mostly from hunger and disease.

PM Hariri urges Lebanese to put country first,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri said on Thursday Lebanon s political crisis was  a wake-up call  for Lebanese with different loyalties to put their country ahead of regional issues. Hariri was referring to the crisis ignited by his shock announcement on Nov. 4 that he was resigning. He made it from Saudi Arabia, a Sunni monarchy and regional powerhouse locked in a confrontation with Shi ite Islamist Iran. After returning to Lebanon this week, he shelved the decision on Wednesday at the request of President Michel Aoun.  The period that passed was perhaps like a wake-up call for all of us to look for Lebanon s interests rather than looking at problems around us,  Hariri said at the Annual Arab Banking Conference in Beirut on Thursday.  The problems around us are important, but Lebanon is more important.  Hariri reaffirmed the need for Lebanon to stick by its policy of staying out of regional conflict  not just with words but with action as well .  I want to stress that ... our main concern is stability, and this is what we ll be working on.  Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil, the head of President Aoun s political party, wrote to the Arab League chief on Thursday, stressing Lebanon s policy of staying out of regional crises, the state news agency reported.  The regional role played by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah political and military movement has greatly alarmed Saudi Arabia, Hariri s long-time ally. Hezbollah s parliamentary group met on Thursday and said in a statement afterwards that Hariri s return to Lebanon and his  positive statements  signaled a possible return to normality. Hariri said on Wednesday his decision to postpone resigning would lead to  a responsible dialogue ... that deals with divisive issues and their repercussions on Lebanon s relations with Arab brothers.  Top Lebanese officials have said Riyadh forced him to quit and held him in the kingdom. Riyadh and Hariri deny this. Hariri returned to Lebanon after an intervention by France. A leader in Hariri s Future Movement said on Thursday that Hariri s decision to wait instead of officially resigning from his post was a  wise step  that would allow for more dialogue.

Nuclear test-ban body heard noise near Argentine sub's last position,"VIENNA (Reuters) - An international nuclear test-ban body that runs a global network of listening posts designed to check for secret atomic blasts detected an  unusual signal  underwater last week near where an Argentine submarine went missing, it said on Thursday.  The Vienna-based Comprehensive nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) runs monitoring stations equipped with devices including hydrophones - underwater microphones that scan the oceans for sound waves. Two of its monitoring stations detected the unusual signal, the CTBTO said in a statement, adding that it was passing the information on to the Argentine authorities coordinating the search for the ARA San Juan, which had 44 crew on board when it went missing last week. An Argentine navy spokesman said earlier on Thursday that an abnormal sound detected near the submarine s last known position in the South Atlantic was  consistent with an explosion , but the CTBTO was more guarded on the possible cause.   It could be consistent with an explosion but there is no certainty about this,  CTBTO hydroacoustic engineer Mario Zampolli told Reuters. He agreed with the navy spokesman s description of the signal as unusual and short, adding that the cause was non-natural.  We can also calculate the time when the event happened in that location and that time is about three and a half hours after the last contact that the sub apparently had, according to what s out in the news,  he said. The stations that detected it are far apart, in the Atlantic and Indian oceans, he added. ",worldnews,"November 23, 2017 ",1

"Unbending on border, Ireland says there work to do to get Brexit deal next month","DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland, armed with an EU veto and insistent on an open Irish border after Britain leaves the bloc, is hopeful agreement can be reached by mid-December but believes sufficient progress has yet to be made. Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said on Thursday his country needed more clarity from London. The border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, which will be the UK s only land frontier with the bloc after its departure, is one of three issues Brussels wants broadly solved before it decides next month on whether to move the talks onto a second phase about trade, as Britain wants.  I am hopeful this can be reached in December, but it is by no means pre-determined... We need a lot more clarity,  Coveney told a parliamentary committee while repeating that with three weeks to go, Dublin has still not received proposals from London to allow talks to move on. Before it can sign off on the first phase of talks, the Irish government wants Britain to spell out in writing how it intends to make good on its commitment that the 500-km (310 mile) border will remain as seamless post-Brexit as it is today. Dublin has said this can be best achieved if London commits, on behalf of Northern Ireland, that there would be no regulatory divergence north and south of the border. Coveney said that includes all areas from agriculture to state aid rules. Speaking to reporters in Paris, Ireland s European Affairs Minister Helen McEntee said Dublin would continue to resist the idea expressed by some British ministers that talks need to move onto the trade phase before the border issue can be resolved.  They are asking us to take a leap in the dark and we are not going to take a leap in the dark. We need something more concrete,  McEntee said. The border question is particularly sensitive given the decades of violence over whether Northern Ireland should be part of the UK or Ireland.  Some 3,600 people were killed before the 1998 peace agreement.  We have been very clear in terms of what we re asking for, that hasn t changed for months. What has changed, perhaps, is the expectation that Ireland, maybe when we came under a bit of pressure, that we might back off or accept that this would be deferred into phase two,  Coveney said.  Some people seem to be surprised that that s not happening, maybe they weren t listening when we told them the first time, or the second time or the tenth time but I think people are listening now.

"Merkel ally calls Russia's new Syrian peace push ""height of cynicism""","BERLIN (Reuters) - A top member of Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives on Thursday dismissed Russian President Vladimir Putin s push to host a new Syrian peace process with the backing of Iran and Turkey, calling it  the height of cynicism.  The leaders of Russia, Iran and Turkey on Wednesday called on the Syrian government and moderate opposition to  participate constructively  in the planned congress, to be held in the Black Sea resort of Sochi. Juergen Hardt, foreign policy speaker for Merkel s conservatives in parliament, said Russia had repeatedly blocked efforts by the U.N. Security Council to find a constructive solution to end the Syrian civil war, now in its seventh year.  It is the height of cynicism that, of all countries, Russia and Iran, which fuelled the civil war in Syria in their own interests, causing the deaths of thousands of people, now want to develop a political vision for Syria s future,  Hardt said. Hardt said Germany s conservatives hoped that the announcement of a ceasefire was serious, and would lead to a permanent halt in fighting in Syria and an end to mass death, flight and expulsion.  Russia, Iran and the dictatorial regime in Syria could have achieved this long ago if they had wanted to,  Hardt said, noting that a solution could not be achieved under conditions set by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Hardt said a lasting peace could only be achieved if all parties were involved, and that, in turn, was only possible under a peace process led by the United Nations. The German foreign ministry had no immediate comment on Putin s new initiative. ",worldnews,"November 23, 2017 ",1
Islamic State beheads 15 of its own fighters: Afghan official,"JALALABAD, Afghanistan (Reuters) - Islamic State beheaded 15 of its own fighters due to infighting in Afghanistan s eastern province of Nangarhar, officials said, while a separate suicide attack on Thursday tore into a crowd in the provincial capital, Jalalabad, killing at least eight. The two incidents underline the insecurity and lawlessness across Afghanistan, where thousands of civilians have been killed or wounded this year amid unrelenting violence involving militant groups including Islamic State and the Taliban. In a bloody day for the province, a suicide bomber blew himself up, killing at least eight people at a meeting of supporters of a police commander who was sacked for illegal land grabbing. There was no claim of responsibility and no immediate indication of who was behind the attack on the crowd in Jalalabad, which had gathered to demand the reinstatement of the commander, who survived the attack. A spokesman for the Jalalabad hospital confirmed eight people had been killed and 15 wounded. Nangarhar, on the porous border with Pakistan, has become a stronghold for Islamic State, generally known as Daesh in Afghanistan, which has grown to become one of the country s most dangerous militant groups since it appeared around the start of 2015. Attaullah Khogyani, the provincial governor s spokesman, said the 15 Islamic State fighters were executed after a bout of infighting in the group, which has become notorious for its brutality. The killings occurred in the Surkh Ab bazaar of Achin district. Further details were not available and there was no confirmation from Islamic State, whose local branch is known as Islamic State in Khorasan, an old name for the area that includes modern Afghanistan. The Taliban and Islamic State have frequently fought each other in Nangarhar and both have been targeted by sustained U.S. air strikes. But the exact nature of the relationship between the two groups is little understood. There have been isolated incidents in Afghanistan in which the fighters of both appear to have cooperated. Afghan intelligence documents reviewed by Reuters this year showed security officials believe Islamic State is present in nine provinces, from Nangarhar and Kunar in the east to Jawzjan, Faryab and Badakhshan in the north and Ghor in the central west.

French conservatives' leader-in-waiting out to woo far-right voters,"PROVINS, France (Reuters) - France s main conservative party needs to go on the political offensive against President Emmanuel Macron by rediscovering a right-wing identity and increasing its appeal to National Front voters, its leader-in-waiting said. Laurent Wauquiez, known for his euroscepticism and hardline opinions on immigration and security, has crossed swords with many top officials in his The Republicans (LR) party. But his views and brash style have made the 42-year-old popular with the party s grass-roots and he is the clear leader in opinion polls to become LR s next head next month.  We won t bring people together by being tepid,  Wauquiez told Reuters in an interview after a party rally in Provins, south of Paris. Saying France s conservatives had for too long fallen into the trap of being too moderate, he added:  Emmanuel Macron isn t doing the job.  Whoever takes over as the head of LR, currently under an interim leadership, will face the task of uniting a divided party that is struggling to make its voice heard in parliament where, while being the biggest opposition group, it has its fewest number of seats in decades. LR was heavily favored to win this spring s presidential election until the party imploded over financial scandals that embroiled its candidate, Francois Fillon. It failed to make the election s second round, contested by centrist Macron and the far-right National Front s Marine Le Pen, and was further weakened when the new president chose several of its top officials for his cabinet, including Prime Minister Edouard Philippe. Addressing Wednesday s rally, Wauquiez delighted an audience of some 300 LR supporters with calls to stop giving free basic health care to illegal migrants and criticism of French politicians   naivety  over radical Islam. Asked about the fact that these are Le Pen favorite themes, Wauquiez, who was first elected lawmaker at 29, said:  So if Marine Le Pen says it s night-time I should say it s day-time?   Because the National Front (FN) talks about immigration I shouldn t? After the wave of attacks that have traumatized our country, the right shouldn t talk about Islamic fundamentalism?  That was the trap the French right had fallen in to for too long as well as German Chancellor Angela Merkel s  big mistake,  he said. Merkel s open-door policy on refugees was widely credited with causing her conservatives to bleed votes to the far-right  AfD party in a national election in September. France s conservatives, meanwhile, are split over how to oppose Macron, whose economic policies coincide with what many of them stand for.  Wauquiez s critics within LR say his policies may be too close to those of the FN and warn they could leave the party if he crosses that line once elected party chief.  Wauquiez, a graduate of France s elite schools and a former minister under ex-president Nicolas Sarkozy, says he is the voice of the  silent majority  and his critics have misunderstood him.  My plan is simple,  he said.  I want to reach out to those who have voted for the National Front but I would never strike any alliance with National Front officials.      Wauquiez s challenge will also be to convince LR voters who chose Macron for president   and who pollsters say are now still backing him over his economic policies   to return to the fold for the next election.  Yes, the right has been knocked down. Yes, there are tensions as we are rebuilding ourselves, and that s normal after such a stinging defeat.  Wauquiez said.  Calling the president s labor reforms a  sham . Wauquiez added:  There is another path than Emmanuel Macron s, that of a determined and unfazed right.

Venezuela's indigenous Warao decamp to uncertain future in Brazil,"PACARAIMA, Brazil (Reuters) - An indigenous tribe that journeyed hundreds of kilometers to flee the economic crisis in Venezuela has been trapped in limbo near the border in Brazil, after it was moved off the streets of the Amazon city of Manaus. Driven by hunger and illness from their traditional homeland on the Orinoco River delta in northeastern Venezuela, more than 1,200 members of the Warao tribe migrated to northern Brazil to live and beg on the streets. Brazilian authorities, nongovernmental organizations and churches have helped provide temporary shelter on the border, but the Warao s future remains uncertain. The tribe insists it will not return to Venezuela, where a deep recession has led to shortages of basic goods under President Nicolas Maduro s socialist government.   The children were dying in Venezuela from illness. There was no medicine, no food, no help,  said Rita Nieves, a cacique, or chief, of the matrilineal Warao. Members of the tribe are still making the arduous journey. Nieves was wearing her best clothes to cross back into Venezuela to bury a 3-month-old Warao baby that had just died in its mother s arms on the 1,000-km (620-mile) bus ride to Brazil.   We are staying here because things have not changed in Venezuela,  she said, sitting in a warehouse turned into a living space for 220 Warao in the small border town of Pacaraima. Children played among dozens of hammocks hanging from metal structures erected by U.N. refugee agency UNHCR. Outside, women cooked broth on wood fires and men sat listening to their shaman talk about the virtues of the moriche palm used to weave baskets and hammocks, as he puffed on a straw cigar. The Warao have lived for centuries on the Orinoco delta, but some began to leave when fish supplies were depleted by the diversion of the waters to deepen shipping lanes for Venezuelan iron ore and bauxite exports. Many went to Venezuelan cities to sell craftwork and beg on the streets. However, when the economy tipped into crisis, they began moving to Brazil last year, often just walking across the border without documents.  They were already begging in Venezuela, but those who gave them money are themselves asking for help today,  said Sister Clara, a missionary from Brazil-based humanitarian organization Fraternidade that runs two shelters for the Warao.  Who in today s crisis in Venezuela is going to buy Warao arts and crafts?  she said. Around 500 Warao arrived on the streets of Manaus last year, where they begged from drivers and sold craftwork at traffic lights. Many slept under a highway overpass until city authorities stopped the begging and moved them into shelters they did not like. Some then traveled down the Amazon to Santarem and Belem, while others returned to frontier towns, from which they can go back and forth to their delta homeland when they raise enough money.  They started staying here, sleeping in the streets, and caused a humanitarian emergency,  said Pacaraima social services secretary Isabel Davila. The town provided an abandoned warehouse with toilets, showers and a kitchen, built with funding from the Mormon church.  Like a similar shelter in the nearby city of Boa Vista that houses 500 Warao, these are temporary landing places, where the Warao can live while they get documents to legalize their status so they can find work, Davila said. But Chief Rita has no plans to move. Pacaraima s mayor promised land to grow crops and materials to make Warao craft work, she said, and she wants the Warao children to learn Portuguese. Half of the land in Roraima state is reserved for indigenous peoples, but an attempt to ask local communities to cede territory to the Warao met with a firm rebuttal.  We think they might be here for a decade,  said Danusa Sabala, a spokeswoman for Brazil s Indian affairs office FUNAI, which sees no short-term solution for the Warao. Ramon Gomez, a Warao chief in the Boa Vista shelter, said their ancestral homeland in the delta was  finished  and the situation in Venezuela was deteriorating rapidly.   When ... this President Maduro took over, everything ended, food, medicine,  G mez said.  We will be here until Venezuela changes. It will get worse before it gets better.

"Forty human traffickers arrested, 500 people rescued in West Africa","PARIS (Reuters) - Forty people were arrested and 500 people rescued after a swoop on human trafficking across West Africa, international police organization Interpol said on Thursday. The Interpol-led action comes amid a global outcry sparked by footage of Africans being solved as slaves in Libya, often the final transit for migrants wanting to reach Europe. In a statement, Interpol said that some 500 people, including 236 minors, had been rescued in simultaneous operations across Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger and Senegal. Forty suspected traffickers were arrested.  The results of this operation underline the challenge faced by law enforcement and all stakeholders in addressing human trafficking in the Sahel region,  said the operation s coordinator Innocentia Apovo.  The 40 arrested face prosecution for offences including human trafficking, forced labor and child exploitation.   They are accused of forcing victims to engage in activities ranging from begging to prostitution, with little to no regard for working conditions or human life,  the statement said.

Iraq launches operation to clear desert near Syria of Islamic State,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi forces launched an operation on Thursday to clear the desert bordering Syria of Islamic State in a final push to rid Iraq of the militant group, the military said. Troops from the Iraqi army and mainly Shi ite paramilitaries known as Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF) were taking part in the campaign against militants hiding in a large strip of border land, Iraqi military officials said.  The objective behind the operation is to prevent remaining Daesh groups from melting into the desert region and using it as a base for future attacks,  said army colonel Salah Kareem, referring to Islamic State by an Arabic acronym. Islamic State fighters who ruled over millions of people in both Iraq and Syria since proclaiming their  caliphate  in 2014, have been largely defeated in both countries this year, pushed out of all population centers to empty desert near the border. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said on Tuesday  Islamic State had been defeated from a military perspective, but he would declare final victory only after the militants were routed in the desert. [nL8N1NR57C] In the latest operation, Iraqi forces had  purified  77 villages and exerted control over a bridge and an airport, operations commander Lieutenant General Abdul Ameer Rasheed Yarallah said in a statement. Over 5,800 squared kilometers had been  purified,  he added. On Friday Iraqi forces captured the border town of Rawa, the last remaining town under Islamic State control. Iraqi army commanders say the military campaign will continue until all the frontier with Syria is secured to prevent Islamic State from launching cross border attacks.  We will completely secure the desert from all terrorist groups of Daesh and declare Iraq clean of those germs,  said army Brigadier General Shakir Kadhim. Army officials said troops advancing through sprawling desert towards the Syria border are facing landmines and roadside bombs placed by retreating militants.  We need to clean scattered villages from terrorists to make sure they no longer operate in the desert area with Syria,  said army Lieutenant-Colonel Ahmed Fairs.  Iraqi military helicopters provided cover for the advancing troops and destroyed at least three vehicles used by militants as they were trying to flee a village in the western desert, said the army officer. Islamic State s self-declared caliphate has swiftly collapsed since July, when U.S.-backed Iraqi forces captured Mosul, the group s de facto capital in Iraq, after a grueling battle that had lasted nine months. Driven also from its other main bastion in Syria s Raqqa, Islamic State has since been gradually squeezed into an ever-shrinking pocket of desert straddling the Syria-Iraq frontier, pursued by a range of enemies that include most regional states and global powers. The group s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, is believed to be hiding in the stretch of desert which runs along the border of both countries. ",worldnews,"November 23, 2017 ",1
"Cambodia's Hun Sen will fall like Mugabe, says opponent Rainsy","PARIS (Reuters) - Cambodia s Prime Minister Hun Sen will be driven from power like President Mugabe in Zimbabwe, veteran opposition chief Sam Rainsy told Reuters on Thursday, adding that Western states should impose targeted sanctions after his party was dissolved. The opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) was banned at the government s request last week, deepening Hun Sen s fight with Western donors who accuse him of demolishing democracy in the country he has ruled for over 32 years. Rainsy resigned in February from the party, saying he feared it would be banned if he did not. Defamation convictions that he calls politically motivated drove him to flee Cambodia for France in 2015.  Cambodia is at a tipping point. The people are fed up with Hun Sen and what is happening in Zimbabwe is inspiring,  Rainsy told Reuters in an interview.   Mugabe has fallen and it will soon be the turn of Hun Sen, who has become unacceptably anachronistic.  Mugabe, who had led Zimbabwe from independence in 1980, stepped down on Tuesday after the army seized power and the ruling party turned against him.  Hun Sen s government called for the CNRP ban after arresting its leader Kem Sokha on Sept. 3. It charged him with treason for an alleged plot to take over the Southeast Asian country with the help of the United States. His opponents say the charges were intended to eliminate Kem Sokha from next year s election so the strongman, who is currently the world s longest serving prime minister, can extend his rule. Rainsy, who announced his return to politics on Nov. 15, described the party ban as  just on paper . He said the opposition needed to demonstrate that it continued to garner  strong support  after winning some 3 million votes in the 2013 elections, and push Cambodia s main western donors to shy away from the Phnom Penh government.  What is important is to show Hun Sen that what he did was unacceptable. The world is not going to do business as usual with this government ... and needs to tell him it would never recognize a government that came out of these elections,  he said. According to a recording leaked online on Thursday, Hun Sen has warned his party it could still lose the vote even after the CNRP was banned, and he demanded that it improve its image. Western countries have condemned the government s crackdown on the opposition, civil rights groups and independent media and have called for the release of Kem Sokha to allow credible elections. Washington has said it is cutting planned aid for holding elections and will take further steps. France, which ruled the country for almost a century before its 1953 independence, on Thursday said the government needed to abide by a democratic process.   Hun Sen, a former commander in the ultra-leftist Khmer Rouge led by Pol Pot which is blamed for the deaths of around two million people in the 1970s, has brushed off Western criticism, and warned that trade sanctions will hurt the people first. Rainsy said the U.S. and European Union should initially withdraw all assistance for the elections and impose targeted sanctions ranging from visa bans to asset freezes. He stopped short of calling for economic sanctions, saying that this could be used further down the line.  We need personal sanctions that target individuals so that it won t hurt the people, but (hurt) the leaders who have hidden their ill-amassed fortunes abroad. They react when their personal interests are hurt,  he said. When asked about Hun Sen increasingly turning to China, Cambodia s biggest donor, Rainsy said he believed the relationship would eventually unravel.   China looks beyond Hun Sen. No government is stupid enough to continue to bet on him. What is happening in Cambodia now is reminiscent of the Khmer Rouge era. Pol Pot was isolated from the world and relied on China, but ... when it didn t need him it threw him out.    ",worldnews,"November 23, 2017 ",1
"Aid agencies say Yemen blockade remains, Egeland calls it 'collective punishment'","GENEVA (Reuters) - The Saudi-led coalition s blockade of Yemen, which has cut off food imports to a population where 7 million people are on the brink of famine, is  illegal collective punishment  of civilians, a prominent aid official said on Thursday. Major agencies said aid was still blocked a day after the Saudi-led military coalition said it would let humanitarian supplies in. The U.S.-backed coalition fighting Houthi rebels in Yemen said on Wednesday it would allow aid in through the port of Hodeidah, as well as U.N. flights to the capital Sanaa, more than two weeks after blockading the country.  We have not yet had any movement as of now,  said Jens Laerke, spokesman of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance. Jan Egeland, a former U.N. aid chief who now heads the Norwegian Refugee Council, said of the blockade:  In my view this is illegal collective punishment.   Egeland, whose group helps 1 million Yemenis, welcomed the coalition announcement as a  step in the right direction , but added:  We only have it in writing now and haven t seen it happen.  The coalition closed air, land and sea access on Nov. 6 to stop the flow of arms to the Houthis from Iran. The action came after Saudi Arabia intercepted a missile fired toward Riyadh. Iran has denied supplying weapons.  Sending a missile in the direction of Riyadh is really very bad. But those who are suffering from the blockade had nothing to do with this missile,  Egeland told Reuters while in Geneva.   Even if both the flights and humanitarian shipments will go through now, it is not solving the underlying crisis that a country that needs 90 percent of its goods imported is not getting in commercial food or fuel.  Houthi authorities who control the capital Sanaa were also imposing restrictions on access for aid workers, he said. The United Nations says some 7 million Yemenis are on the brink of famine and 945,000 have been infected since April with cholera. More than 2,200 people have died. U.N. officials have submitted requests to the coalition for deliveries via Hodeidah and Sanaa, and the  hope and expectation  was that the vital aid pipelines would re-open on Friday, the U.N. s Laerke said. The International Committee of the Red Cross said it was vital to get commercial traffic resumed.  Yemenis will need more than aid in order to survive the crisis and ward off famine,  spokeswoman Iolanda Jaquemet said. ",worldnews,"November 23, 2017 ",1

Who burned the cakes? Belgian waffle fire chokes Brussels,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The sweet smell of waffles is familiar in Belgium but on Thursday people were left choking as a fire at a waffle factory sent a dense black cloud across Brussels, disrupting some rail traffic in the capital. Police said the blaze at the Milcamps factory, which produces the national sweet treat in various regional variants, broke out at lunchtime. It was not immediately clear what started it or whether anyone was hurt.  A lot of smoke has been emitted and we are advising people to keep doors and windows shut and to stay inside. Drivers should close air vents in their cars,  local police said. A sharp smell of burned waffle caused coughing in the city center, 6 km (4 miles), from the blaze. Belgian waffles, traditionally sold from mobile vendors and street kiosks, have become popular around the world.

Iraqi militia indicates will hand heavy guns to army after Islamic State quashed,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - A prominent Iraqi militia indicated on Thursday it would give any heavy weapons it had to the military once Islamic State was defeated and rejected a proposed U.S. congressional bill designating it a terrorist group. Harakat Hezbollah al Nujaba, which has about 10,000 fighters, is one of the most important militias in Iraq. Though made up of Iraqis, it is loyal to Iran and is helping Tehran create a supply route through Iraq to Damascus. The Nujaba fights under the umbrella of the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), a mostly Iranian-backed coalition of Shi ite militias that played a role in combating Islamic State. Disarming the PMF is seen as Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi s most difficult test as Iraqi forces edge closer to declaring victory over the Sunni militants.  The heavy weapons belong to the Iraqi government, not us. We are not rebels or agents of chaos and we do not want to be a state within a state,  Hashim al-Mouasawi, the group s spokesman, said at a news conference on Thursday. He was responding to a Reuters question on whether his group would obey orders by Abadi, who as prime minister commands the military, to return heavy weaponry, reduce the number of fighters, or withdraw from Syria. He would not be drawn on the reduction of fighters or Syria.  The PMF is under the command of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces and naturally when the war is over and victory is declared, the final decision will be his,  Mouasawi said. His comments broadly echoed those of Iraqi military spokesman Brigadier General Yahya Rasool.  The tanks, armored vehicles, and machine guns belong to the army and it is natural that after the battles are over they return to the army,  Rasool told Reuters in an interview. Nujaba strongly objected to moves by Washington towards designating it a terrorist group. Nujaba blames the United States, without providing evidence, for the creation of IS. Republican U.S. Representative Ted Poe introduced a bill this month to the House of Representatives that would place Nujaba and another militia loyal to Iran on a list of terrorist groups and give President Donald Trump 90 days to impose sanctions on it once it passed.  The bill was referred to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, sparking condemnation in Baghdad from Iraqi lawmakers and Abadi himself, who said he would not allow anyone who fought Islamic State to be treated as criminals.  Accusing us of terrorism is not new or surprising. It is not a coincidence, and does not shock us, because we have never been part of the American bloc or project,  said Mouasawi. Iraq is backed by adversaries the United States and Iran in its fight against Islamic State. The United States is concerned that Iran, a Shi ite Muslim regional power, will take advantage of gains against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria to expand the influence it amassed after the U.S. invasion in 2003, something Sunni Arab rivals such as Saudi Arabia also oppose. Tens of thousands of Iraqis heeded a call to arms in 2014 after Islamic State seized a third of the country s territory, forming the PMF, which receive funding and training from Tehran and have been declared part of the Iraqi security apparatus. They are paid by the Iraqi government and officially report to the prime minister, but some Arab Sunni and Kurdish politicians describe these militias as a de facto branch of the Iran s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp (IRGC). Mouasawi openly said on Thursday his group receives support in the form of  advice  from the Guards and the commander of its foreign operations, Major-General Qassem Soleimani, and Lebanese Shi ite political and military group Hezbollah.

Italy's 5-Star tells France's Macron movement is no threat to EU,"ROME (Reuters) - Italy s anti-establishment 5-Star Movement told French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday that it does not represent a threat to the European Union, and sought to shrug off the label  populist . Leader Luigi Di Maio, whose party tops polls ahead of a national election due early next year, wrote an open letter to Macron after the French leader reportedly expressed concern about anti-system forces in Italy.  I am sure that when we get to know each other better, you will realize that our movement is not only not a threat, but is cultivating the best solutions for many of Europe s problems,  Di Maio said in the letter published on the 5-Star movement s blog.   Italian media reported this week that Macron had told former Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi he was worried about the rise of 5-Star and the Northern League, which is close to France s National Front.  Allied to Britain s United Kingdom Independence Party in the European Parliament, 5-Star is trying to distance itself from anti-immigrant, Eurosceptic parties in the rest of the bloc. Di Maio, a sober 31 year-old who has taken over leadership of the movement founded by comedian Beppe Grillo, said 5-Star shared with Macron the desire to  rebuild  Europe.  They lazily call us populist without knowing what this means, when in reality we are ... close to the people, who want pay-back and a role in changing our country,  he said.  Di Maio made no mention of a referendum on Italy s use of the euro which 5-Star originally pledged when it burst onto the political scene in 2013, but has since backed away from. Regarding EU budget rules, Di Maio said that 5-Star s point of view was  very close  to that of France, which he said had let its budget deficit rise to accommodate spending on welfare and other investments. In January, 5-Star s European parliamentarians tried and failed to split from UKIP, which successfully campaigned for Britain to leave the EU. 5-Star eventually gave up a leading role in the group.

Papua New Guinea police order protesting asylum seekers out of Australian-run camp,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - About fifty asylum seekers departed an Australian-run detention camp in Papua New Guinea on Thursday after police moved into the complex, confiscating food, water and personal belongings from the roughly 310 who remained.  The Manus Island center was sealed off after a three-week standoff the United Nations has called a  looming humanitarian crisis  as detainees defied attempts by Australia and Papua New Guinea (PNG) to close it.  Right now we have no water,  one of the asylum-seekers in the camp said in a mobile telephone message.  I came back to my room and they took my laptop and money and cigarettes.      Video images shot and posted on social media site Facebook by Sudanese refugee Abdul Aziz showed police using a megaphone to tell asylum seekers to leave because their stay at the camp, located on land used by the PNG navy, was illegal. Men boarded buses in footage he posted later on social network Twitter. The buses took the men to alternative accommodation, three sources said.  In Geneva, the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR said it had received reports of force being used to remove the refugees and asylum seekers and called for calm.  We urge both governments to engage in constructive dialogue, to de-escalate the tensions and work on urgent lasting solutions to their plight,  the U.N. High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) said in a statement noting it lacked full access to the shuttered facility.  A police blockade of the camp was still in place, Tim Costello, chief advocate of aid group World Vision Australia, said by telephone from outside, adding that he had seen buses leave and that the accommodation he had visited was unfinished. PNG immigration and police officials did not return telephone calls from Reuters to seek comment. The camp in PNG, and another on the tiny Pacific island nation of Nauru, have been the cornerstones of Australia s controversial immigration policy, which has been strongly criticized by the United Nations and rights groups. Australia opened the camps in a bid to stem a flow of asylum seekers making dangerous voyages by boat to its shores. Under its  sovereign borders  immigration policy, Australia refuses to land asylum seekers arriving by sea, and sends them to the offshore camps instead. At the camp, witnesses said officials in army fatigues led away Kurdish journalist Behrouz Boochani, a resident for four years who posts regular social media messages on conditions there. Boochani later posted that he had been released after being handcuffed for several hours and had left the camp.   My understanding is that a number of people, a small number of people, have been arrested, including the individual,  Australia s Minister for Immigration and Border Protection Peter Dutton told SKY News, referring to Boochani.     Pictures sent via a messaging service showed upturned boxes of food and torn packets of rice and instant noodles and smashed furniture, including broken beds. Last year PNG s Supreme Court ruled that the center, first opened in 2001, breached its laws and fundamental human rights, leading to the decision to close it.       But the asylum seekers say they fear for their safety if moved to a transit center on the island, and risk being resettled in PNG or another developing nation permanently.  We don t want another prison. We want to leave this place, but they need to give a good solution for us,  the first asylum-seeker said.  We don t want another prison. We want a third country.  Most of those in the camp are from Afghanistan, Iran, Myanmar, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Syria. The transit centers had food, water, security and medical services, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said.

"Waiting for May, Brussels eyes December Brexit deal","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - When Theresa May visits Brussels on Friday, EU negotiators will be listening intently for signs the British prime minister is preparing to risk a domestic backlash and raise her offer to secure a Brexit deal in December. European Union officials and diplomats from the other 27 member states involved in the process hope that within a week to 10 days of meeting European Council President Donald Tusk, during a summit with ex-Soviet neighbors, May will deliver movement on three key conditions so that her EU peers can launch a new phase of Brexit negotiations when they meet on Dec. 14-15.  I don t know what room for maneuver May has, but what we can see is a willingness to act,  one senior EU official told Reuters. Another spoke of efforts to arrange the  choreography  of a deal over the next three weeks, including an EU-UK  joint report  pinning down interim accords to unlock talks on trade.  I feel the tectonic plates moving now,  a diplomat handling Brexit for an EU government said.  Time is running out and a failure in the December Council would serve nobody s purpose.  There has been only a day of top-level talks between the two lead negotiators since a mid-October summit that dismissed May s call for immediate talks on a future trade agreement.  But talks are continuing apace behind the scenes, ahead of a deadline of early December to strike a deal which can then be formalized by the 27 government leaders at the summit.  Everyone is talking to everyone already, at all levels,  the European Commission s chief spokesman Margaritis Schinas told reporters on Thursday when he confirmed that May would meet Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels on Monday, Dec. 4. That is two days before envoys from the 27 meet on Dec. 6 to discuss a first draft of the Dec. 14-15 summit conclusions, including, crucially, whether the leaders should accept Britain has made  sufficient progress  to merit opening trade talks.  Hopes in Brussels have been raised by reports in British media that May has secured backing from pro-Brexit hardliners in her cabinet to increase the amount of a financial settlement of what Britain owes to the Union when it leaves in March 2019.   If there is a political willingness in Britain, we should be ready,  a senior EU official said, while warning that nothing was being taken for granted.  May s room for maneuver to cut a deal that would please business while irritating Britons who want a sharper break with Brussels is limited. And Germany and France, the Union s lead powers, have taken a tough line so far. With German Chancellor Angela Merkel distracted at home by a search for a new coalition, May can expect little focus from her to help smooth a deal, several diplomats said.  Some in Britain have suggested May could take advantage of Merkel s weakness at home to drive a harder bargain. But EU diplomats argue that Merkel s troubles make it harder for her, and so for the 27, to water down their existing demands. So any brinkmanship around the summit could mean no deal in December.  That would create some kind of crisis in negotiations,  the second EU official said, noting that time was already short to complete a treaty by late next year to ensure an orderly Brexit.  But maybe that is necessary.  The sides already believe they are quite close on agreeing the scope of rights for expatriate citizens in Britain and on the continent, though the EU will be particularly looking to pin Britain down to accepting its demands that any agreement be subject to enforcement through the Union s legal system. The third key criterion for moving to Phase Two, an outline agreement on how to avoid the new EU-UK land border disrupting the peace in Northern Ireland, remains a potential stumbling block. Differences of opinion between London and Dublin have been marked this month, worrying EU officials. However, it is the financial settlement that has been the most concerning for the past few months. Officials believe that  could be resolved by a combination of May stating clearly that Britain will pay a share after leaving of two major EU budget lines, staff pensions and agreed but undisbursed spending. British press reports, seen in Brussels as planted leaks from May, suggesting she might offer to pay something like 40 billion pounds ($53 billion) have encouraged EU negotiators.  While that is well short of the 60 billion euros ($71 billion) the European Commission has mentioned, that was always seen by EU officials as a maximum demand. And they are willing, they say, to help May massage the public messaging of the amount in order to limit the political flak she takes at home.  On presentational issues, Barnier is ready to help, not to call things by their real name,  an EU official said. ",worldnews,"November 22, 2017 ",1
U.N. urges Australia to protect refugees at Papua New Guinea camp,"GENEVA (Reuters) - The United Nations refugee agency called for calm on Thursday after receiving reports of force being used to remove refugees and asylum-seekers from a center closed three weeks ago on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea. About fifty asylum seekers departed an Australian-run detention camp in Papua New Guinea on Thursday after police moved into the complex, confiscating food, water and personal belongings from the roughly 310 who remained.

"Saudi aims to issue tourist visas next year, official says","DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia aims to start issuing tourist visas to foreigners next year, a senior Saudi official told CNN, as the government seeks to open up the conservative kingdom and find new sources of revenue to diversify its economy.   At present, foreigners traveling to Saudi Arabia are largely restricted to resident workers and their dependents, business travelers, and Muslim pilgrims who are given special visas to travel to holy sites.    The targets are people who want to come and literally experience this country, and really the grandness of this country,  Prince Sultan bin Salman bin Abdulaziz, head of the Saudi Commission for Tourism and Natural Heritage, said in an interview broadcast late on Wednesday.   Asked about plans for the visas, he replied:  Hopefully in 2018,  adding that the government would use online technology to make applying for visas easy. Saudi Arabia s 32-year-old heir to the throne, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, is seeking to develop new industries to wean his country off its dependency on oil exports. He has also taken some steps to loosen its ultra-strict social restrictions, scaling back the role of religious morality police and announcing plans to allowing women to drive next year. Plans to admit significant numbers of tourists from abroad have been discussed for years, only to be blocked by conservative opinion and bureaucracy; the commission announced such a plan as long ago as 2006, but it did not go ahead. This time, the government appears determined to push through the change, partly because of financial pressures. It hopes to earn billions of dollars to cover a state budget deficit caused by low oil prices.  Economic reforms aim to lift total tourism spending in the country - by local citizens as well as foreigners - to $46.6 billion in 2020 from $27.9 billion in 2015. Prince Sultan said his commission was focusing mainly on increasing numbers of local tourists. The commission has estimated Saudis spend more than $20 billion annually on tourism abroad, and persuading more of them to holiday inside the country would reduce that drain on the economy. But Prince Sultan told CNN that his commission was also working to prepare tourist spots for foreigners. The government announced plans in August to develop resorts on about 50 islands off the Red Sea coast, with the first phase of the project to be completed in 2022. The kingdom also intends to offer visits to historic sites such as Mada in Saleh, a 2,000-year-old Nabatean city carved into the rocks of the northern desert. Heir to the throne Prince Mohammed would be the first ruler from a new generation since 1953, after six kings who were all sons of state founder Abdulaziz ibn Saud. He has announced wide plans for social and political reforms to the kingdom, which is ruled as an absolute monarchy with a powerful clergy that adheres to Wahhabism, an ultra-austere version of Sunni Islam.

Fighting between rebel and army kills 27 in South Sudan,"Juba (Reuters) - Twenty-seven people were killed when rebels attacked government forces in South Sudan, a local government official said on Thursday.  Three government soldiers and 24 fighters loyal to rebel leader Riek Machar were killed in the fighting in Southern Liech state on Wednesday, Peter Makouth Malual, the region s information minister,  told Reuters.  Rebel spokesman Lam Paul Gabriel did not have a death toll for the fighting. He told Reuters he was trying to reach commanders on the ground.  As expected, the onset of the dry season has led to fresh fighting between the army and rebels.  Diplomats and analysts told Reuters earlier this month it was unlikely peace talks would resume to end a war that has already killed tens of thousands and created Africa s largest refugee crisis [L3N1NG5D4]. Crude oil output has been slashed by two-thirds to around 130,000 barrels per day by the violence.  South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011 after protracted bloodshed, then fell into civil war in late 2013, with troops loyal to President Salva Kiir fighting those backing Machar, a former vice president Kiir had sacked.

"May to meet EU's Juncker, Barnier December 4, EU confirms","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May will meet European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and his chief Brexit negotiator in Brussels on Monday, Dec. 4, the EU executive confirmed on Thursday. EU officials hope that May will make new offers to unblock negotiations on a treaty on Britain s 2019 withdrawal from the Union. They say any British move needs to come by around Dec. 4 if leaders meeting at a Dec. 14-15 are to be able to endorse a move to a new phase of talks, to include future trade relations.  On Friday, May will meet European Council President Donald Tusk in Brussels as part of what EU officials describe as a bid to agree the  choreography  of a deal in December. Confirming the Juncker-May meeting, the Commission s chief spokesman told reporters they would discuss Brexit but declined to comment further on the state of negotiations.  Everyone is talking to everyone, already, at all levels,  he said. No comment was immediately available from May s office. Envoys from the 27 other member states agreed on Wednesday to delay by a week until Wednesday, Dec. 6, a meeting to prepare the drafts of the summit conclusions, diplomats said. Those conclusions will determine whether leaders agree that Britain has made  sufficient progress  toward agreeing divorce terms for the summit to approve new talks on a post-Brexit relationship.

"U.S. ally seen clinching re-election in Honduras vote, eight years after coup","TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - Eight years after a coup sparked by a previous president s flirtation with a second term, voters in the poor Central American country of Honduras look poised on Sunday to re-elect their U.S.-friendly leader whose assault on gangs has slowed killings.  Juan Orlando Hernandez of the center-right National Party took office in 2014 vowing a militarized crackdown on endemic gang violence in one of the world s most violent countries. That effort has brought down the murder rate. The economy has also grown during his tenure. His victory would be cheered in Washington, according to two U.S. State Department officials, who noted the United States had few steadfast allies among Central America s current crop of leaders with whom it can reliably work to fight poverty, migration and gang violence. Honduras has long had close ties with the United States, which viewed the country as an ideological and military partner during the leftist guerrilla insurgencies that roiled the region throughout the Cold War era.  The U.S.-educated Hernandez has a close working relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump s chief of staff, John Kelly.  In 2009, the United States wrestled with how to respond to the removal of President Manuel Zelaya after he proposed a referendum on re-election. Nonetheless, U.S. officials now say they are not yet concerned that Hernandez is consolidating power, but want to see the passage of stalled legislation to impose a cap on presidential terms.   Open-ended re-election is not good for democracy,  said one U.S. diplomat.  We would very much like to see some sort of law that would regulate election.   Hernandez was among lawmakers who supported the ouster of Zelaya. But following a 2015 Supreme Court decision that overturned a constitutional ban on re-election, Hernandez, 49, looks likely to win a second four-year term. Opinion polls have shown him with a double-digit lead over television host Salvador Nasralla, who heads a left-right alliance of Honduran opposition groups called the Opposition Alliance Against the Dictatorship. The opposition argues Hernandez s presidential bid is illegal, and has refused to discuss term-limit legislation while coalescing to try to prevent him from clinching victory. Hernandez has won favor with the United States, working closely on U.S.-bound migration with Kelly when that official was head of U.S. Southern Command and the Department of Homeland Security. He has also led a purge of the police force and made it easier to extradite drug bosses. The United States has few ideological allies in the region. Two leftist former guerilla leaders govern El Salvador and Nicaragua, while Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales has sought to banish a U.S.-backed anti-corruption body probing his family.   There does seem to be more of a kinship in terms of how he sees governance,  one of the U.S. officials in Central America said of Hernandez. The president says he would keep soldiers on the streets to help the widely mistrusted police. He has also promised to lure foreign investment in textiles, call centers and auto manufacturing, creating 600,000 jobs and lifting growth to above 6 percent with infrastructure projects.    Hondurans applaud how Hernandez has lowered the murder rate to a projected 46 per 100,000 by the end of 2017 from 79 per 100,000 in 2013, while raising growth and lowering the deficit.  But he has not been immune to scandal.  The son of his political mentor, former President Porfirio Lobo, was recently sentenced to 24 years in prison for conspiring to import cocaine into the United States. During the trial, there were allegations that drug money was funneled to Hernandez s campaign, a charge his office denied. In 2015, Hernandez admitted his 2013 campaign took money from companies linked to one of the worst corruption scandals in the country s history, but said he and his National Party were unaware of where the money came from. Manuel Orozco, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue, said that despite the president s flaws, the United States had decided it could still do business with Hernandez, its  most important ally  in Central America.  Of all the people in that country, they realize they re best off sticking with him,  he said.  ",worldnews,"November 23, 2017 ",1

Cambodia's Hun Sen warns his party it could still lose election,"PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen has warned his party it could still lose next year s election even after the banning of the opposition and demanded that it improve its image, according to a recording leaked online on Thursday. Hun Sen s Cambodian People s Party (CPP) played down the importance of the message, in which Hun Sen tells senior officials they must stop corruption, extortion and other illegal practices and start making people happy. The opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) was banned at the government s request last week, deepening Hun Sen s fight with Western donors who accuse him of demolishing democracy in the country he has ruled for over 32 years.  It doesn t mean that now the opposition is dissolved we can be careless,  Hun Sen says in the 12-minute recording of a message to party officials, warning that his opponents could start a new party and should not be underestimated.  If we get bad results and lose it would be twice as bad after we already dissolved the opposition party... People can also dissolve us through an election.  He said the international community could try to  revive their puppets  and channel funding to Cambodia despite a five-year political ban on 118 CNRP politicians. The CNRP was banned after its leader, Kem Sokha, was arrested for allegedly plotting treason with American help. He has rejected the accusations as a ploy to let Hun Sen win next year s election. In his message, Hun Sen called on party officials to stop corruption, extortion, illegal logging and other irregularities that had pushed Cambodians to vote for the opposition.  Votes were cast because of anger due to our mistakes in the past and that cannot happen again,  Hun Sen said in the recording. CPP spokesman Sok Eysan said the message had not been secret. He did not say when the recording had been made.  There is nothing to hide,  he said.  He was doing his work as the party leader and the prime minister.  The 55 parliamentary seats that the CNRP won in the last election in 2013 were allocated to smaller parties on Thursday by the National Election Committee. The biggest winner was the royalist Funcinpec party of Prince Norodom Ranariddh, who was once Hun Sen s main rival but is now aligned with the prime minister. Funcinpec will get 41 seats in parliament - a third of all the seats - despite winning less than 4 percent of the vote in 2013. The ruling party did not get any more seats, but already had a majority with 68 seats.  The will of the people has been violated,  said Mu Sochua, a deputy to Kem Sokha who fled abroad in fear of arrest.  The National Assembly of the Kingdom of Cambodia has lost its legitimacy.

Chad rejects U.S. bribery allegations against president,"N DJAMENA (Reuters) - Chad has rejected allegations made in the United States that its President Idriss Deby was paid a $2 million bribe in exchange for providing a Chinese energy company with oil rights without international competition. The United States announced charges on Monday against former Hong Kong Home Secretary Chi Ping Patrick Ho and former Senegalese Foreign Minister Cheikh Gadio for allegedly funnelling bribes to high-level officials in Chad and Uganda.  The government is indignant and questions this fierce attack against our head of state,  Chad s government said in a statement late on Wednesday, adding that Deby had always sought transparency in the country s natural resources sectors.  The U.S. Justice Department said Gadio had received $400,000 from Ho via wire transfers through New York to act as a go-between for bribes to Deby on behalf of an unnamed energy firm headquartered in Shanghai. Neither Ho nor Gadio, who were both arrested last week, have commented publicly on the allegations against them.   Landlocked Chad pumps about 130,000 barrels of oil per day.

Greek pensioners protest against government that 'took everything',"ATHENS (Reuters) - Several hundred elderly Greeks marched through Athens on Thursday, protesting against a government they say  took everything  with a new round of cuts to pensions and crumbling health care benefits.  Greece s three bailouts since 2010 have repeatedly taken aim at the pension system. Cuts have pushed nearly half its elderly below the poverty line with incomes of less 600 euros ($710.70) a month. With nearly a quarter of the workforce unemployed, a quarter of children living in poverty and benefits slashed, parents have grown dependent on grandparents for handouts. But after the cuts to pensions, some Greeks have seen their monthly cheque fall between 40 and 50 percent in seven years. After rent, utility bills and health care, they barely make ends meet.  I have never seen the country in this state, not even during war,  said 80-year-old Nikos Georgiadis, a former hotel employee whose pension has been reduced by 40 percent.   Pensioners are impoverished, and not only can they not afford to buy medicines, some are looking for food in the trash,  he said, leaning on a tree to catch his breath.  New changes to pension regulations mean more cuts are expected in 2019. Pensioners also have to pay more out of pocket for health care. Fotini Karavidou, a 75-year-old retired accountant who joined the march in a wheelchair, said she had to  cut back on everything  to afford medicine.   It s simple - many pensioners cannot afford to eat and to buy medicine,  said Yiannis Karadimas, 67, who heads a local pensioners association. Karadimas said it was  a joke  that the government had legalised marijuana for medical purposes while cutting back on health care spending.   They re killing us and they re mocking us at the same time,  he said.  The popularity of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has waned since he first won elections in 2015. In an effort to rebuild public support, the government gave Greece s 1.3 million pensioners a one-off Christmas bonus last year, worth 300 to 500 euros each. But the handouts have failed to whip up any obvious increase in support. Pensioners have taken to the streets time and again in recent months. About 2,000 people joined Thursday s march.   Unfortunately, I voted for them, and they turned out to be the biggest liars of all,  Georgiadis, the pensioner, said.  It (the government) promised us everything, and it took everything.

"Swiss pledge more funds for EU budget, progress on treaty","BERN (Reuters) - Switzerland and the European Union, its main trading partner, made headway on Thursday on clinching a new treaty meant to cement ties, and Bern pledged fresh contributions to EU coffers. The head of the EU Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, and Swiss President Doris Leuthard gave an upbeat assessment of ties, which are on the mend after the Swiss parliament last year skirted voters  calls for curbing immigration from the bloc.  Things are going in the right direction,  Juncker told a news conference after meetings in the Swiss capital.  Shaky prospects for progress in the talks had prompted last-minute consultations on Monday to check whether the visit would even take place, a diplomat involved said. But Leuthard said Switzerland was on track to contribute another 1.3 billion Swiss francs ($1.33 billion) in  cohesion payments  to the EU budget over 10 years as a sign of solidarity. Legislation would go to parliament next year. The two sides did not achieve a breakthrough on a  framework  treaty Brussels wants to replace more than 100 bilateral accords now governing relations. This would ensure Switzerland adopts relevant EU laws in return for enhanced access to the bloc s single market, crucial for Swiss exports.  Such a pact is anathema to the anti-EU Swiss People s Party (SVP), the biggest in parliament. Many conservative politicians as well worry that any deal giving EU judges a role in settling disputes plays into the SVP s hands before 2019 elections.  They hope Britain s divorce talks with Brussels may open new avenues for Swiss-EU ties. While Britain seems set to leave the single market and to impose controls on immigration, Switzerland is keen to ensure EU citizens can continue to live and work here   the price for its  enhanced access to the EU market. Juncker said he was taking pains to ensure the Brexit issue and Swiss talks remained separate. Leuthard said the foreign judges issue remained a tricky one but added:  We found some flexibility here and will go into this in more depth in the months ahead.  She did not elaborate. Bilateral ties suffered when Swiss voters in 2014 demanded quotas on EU immigration, but thawed after parliament last year adopted instead a system giving people registered as unemployed in Switzerland first crack at open jobs. Agreements on mutual recognition of industrial standards and combining carbon trading systems followed, and Brussels is expected soon to recognize Swiss financial rules as sufficient. A new treaty could pave the way for heightened Swiss access to EU power markets, cutting costs and ensuring supplies in emergencies. It could also help open the EU market for financial services for Swiss-based banks and insurers. The EU has made clear the treaty is a precondition for such deals, which in theory could make a pact more attractive to Swiss voters in an inevitable referendum. Without accompanying perks, the treaty is  a sitting duck , one EU diplomat said. While a treaty is also a stated aim of the Swiss government, mainstream conservatives are wary of the  foreign judges  angle.  They worry this hands the SVP a stick with which to beat them. A survey this month by gfs.bern for Credit Suisse showed 60 percent of Swiss back the current web of bilateral accords, down sharply from 81 percent in 2016. Support for ending the accords rose 9 points to 28 percent. The survey reflected how contradictory Swiss wishes can be. Nearly 80 percent favor quotas to control immigration, while 85 percent want free access to foreign markets. The SVP has mounted a referendum campaign to scrap the bilateral accords and seize control of immigration to a country whose population is already a quarter foreign.

Russia sends research ship to help search for missing Argentine sub,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia s defense ministry has sent an oceanographic research ship to the South Atlantic to help with the search for an Argentine submarine which went missing more than a week ago, TASS news agency reported on Thursday. The vessel, called Yantar (Amber), is equipped with two self-propelled deep submergence vehicles allowing it to examine underwater areas up to 6,000 meters (3.75 miles) deep, TASS quoted the Russian military as saying. Dozens of planes and boats are searching for the San Juan submarine. The search entered a  critical phase  on Wednesday as the 44 crew on board could be running low on oxygen, an Argentine navy spokesman said.

Merkel looks secure for now despite coalition chaos,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives are rallying around her despite the failure of talks to form a three-way ruling coalition, buying her time in office and putting the onus on her Social Democrat rivals to break Germany s political impasse. Resolute conservative support for Merkel is significant, as some members of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) have said privately their price for a re-run of its  grand coalition  with the conservatives would be Merkel s head. The collapse late on Sunday of the coalition talks, which followed an inconclusive Sept. 24 election, has plunged Germany into the worst political crisis since the end of World War Two. President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who is trying to broker a deal, is keenly aware the source of Germany s international clout is its economic power and that businesses want a stable coalition soon to end the uncertainty and avoid another poll. SPD leader Martin Schulz, whose party is the second biggest in Germany and was the junior coalition partner to Merkel s conservative bloc in the last parliament, has insisted the SPD should rebuild in opposition after heavy losses in September. But with Merkel secure for now at the helm of her Christian Democrats (CDU), the pressure shifts to the SPD to help form a coalition after the failure of the chancellor s three-way talks with the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) and Greens. Surveys suggest going to the polls again would deliver a similar outcome to September s result. Furthermore, 58 percent of voters want Merkel to remain chancellor, an Infratest Dimap poll for broadcaster ARD showed this week. While the SPD prevaricates, Merkel looks reasonable for trying to resolve the impasse.  One thing is clear: Angela Merkel s position in the CDU is very strong. She is our Number One,  David McAllister, a CDU executive committee member, told Reuters. Her party believes she did all she could to forge a three-way coalition. Merkel s efforts also improved ties with the CDU s Bavarian allies in the conservative bloc, the Christian Social Union (CSU), which had been strained over immigration. Another senior CDU official said there was no question of sacrificing Merkel as the party had no credible alternative. A third senior CDU official, Volker Kauder, leader of the conservative parliamentary group in the lower house of parliament, said he hoped the Social Democrats would change their minds about rejecting another grand coalition.[nL8N1NT1PP] Steinmeier is due to meet Schulz on Thursday at 1400 GMT as part of his efforts to help facilitate a coalition government and avoid more elections. Asked about the possibility of the SPD supporting a Merkel-led minority government or entering a new grand coalition, an SPD spokesman pointed to Schulz s meeting with Steinmeier and said,  then we will see what comes afterwards . A former SPD leader, Steinmeier is meeting leaders from all parties in parliament this week and wants them to make agreement on a new government possible  in the near future . Only after a new government has formed is Merkel s position likely to come under pressure - and even then, not immediately. Her mentor, Helmut Kohl, and Konrad Adenauer, who led Germany s rebirth after World War Two, are the only post-war chancellors to have ruled Germany longer than her. Merkel, 63, only decided to run again last November after thinking long and hard. She said then she was seeking to stay on  if health allows . In 1998, she was quoted as saying:  I don t want to be a half-dead wreck when I leave politics.  She appears in robust health, but given she has already held power for 12 years, questions will inevitably arise about who will succeed her before she is half way through any new four-year term. Potential successors are not circling just yet.  She will have probably a year or so after a government is formed before the question of her succession becomes an overwhelming issue in German domestic politics,  said Jan Techau at the American Academy in Berlin.   The moment that starts, her power will be greatly diminished.  But first, Merkel must form a new government. If Steinmeier fails to convince the SPD to enter a new grand coalition, other options include a three-way coalition after all, a Merkel-led minority government, or new elections.  Since snap elections won t change relative strengths, my prediction is ... another grand coalition between the only two parties that have learned to compromise,  said Josef Joffe, publisher-editor of weekly Die Zeit. Bild newspaper reported on Wednesday that some SPD deputies were now questioning their party s rejection of a renewed grand coalition. [nL8N1NS1PN] Changing course and teaming up with Merkel again may require a change of leadership at the SPD and there could yet be a shake out at a party conference in early December.  The pressure needs to build up within the Social Democratic party,  said Techau.  He said Merkel should focus on being a responsible caretaker chancellor until a new government forms.  She just needs to play her own game well and then she can survive.  ",worldnews,"November 23, 2017 ",1
"U.S. strikes on Taliban opium labs won't work, say Afghan farmers","LASHKAR GAH, Afghanistan/KABUL (Reuters) - As U.S. and Afghan forces pound Taliban drug factories this week, farmers in the country s largest opium producing-province and narcotics experts say the strategy just repeats previous failed efforts to stamp out the trade. U.S. Army General John Nicholson, who heads NATO-led forces in Afghanistan, announced on Monday a new strategy of attacking opium factories, saying he wanted to hit the Taliban  where it hurts, in their narcotics financing . Critics say the policy risks further civilian casualties and turning large swathes of the population dependent on poppy cultivation against the Afghan government.  The Taliban will not be affected by this as much as ordinary people,  said Mohammad Nabi, a poppy farmer in Nad Ali district in the southern province of Helmand, the heartland of opium production.  Farmers are not growing poppies for fun. If factories are closed and businesses are gone, then how will they provide food for their families?  Opium production in Afghanistan reached record highs this year, up 87 percent, according to the United Nations. The U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said last week that output of opium from poppy seeds in Afghanistan, the world s main source of heroin, stood at around 9,000 metric tons in 2017, worth an estimated $1.4 billion on leaving the farms. In Helmand, cultivation area increased 79 percent. Publicizing the new strategy, which he said was open-ended, Nicholson showed one video of an F-22 fighter jet dropping 250-pound bombs on two buildings, emphasizing that a nearby third building was left unscathed. U.S. troops have long been accused of causing unnecessary collateral damage and civilian deaths. The United States says it takes every precaution to avoid civilian casualties. The four-star general emphasized that farmers were not the targets.  They are largely compelled to grow the poppy and this is kind of a tragic part of the story,  said Nicholson.  WHACK-A-MOLE  Experts, however, question whether the new strategy will have an impact on Taliban financing.  All these things have been tried before and not produced effective results. If they had, we wouldn t be where we are now,  said Orzala Nemat, director of the Kabul-based Afghanistan Research and Evaluation Unit, which has been researching the country s drug trade for a decade and a half.     Another analyst said it was simply a futile game of  whack-a-mole.  Those familiar with the drug industry in Afghanistan said it would only take three or four days to replace a lab, which generally has a low sunk-cost. They also say it was not just the Taliban involved in Afghanistan s drug trade.  Drugs are elemental to the political economy of Afghanistan, to those who rule and to those who oppose that rule,  said one analyst, asking not to be named. Prior to being ousted by U.S.-led forces in 2001, the Taliban virtually eliminated the trade, saying it was forbidden by Islam. The United States and its Western allies, the Afghan government and United Nations have made repeated efforts since to eradicate poppy cultivation, including encouraging farmers to cultivate alternatives such as saffron, spraying poppy fields with herbicide, and destroying labs. However, they have not made any serious headway in stemming the rise in drug production.     The issue underlines problems faced by the Afghan government and its allies, as they seek to cut off a major source of financing for the Taliban and stem the flow of drugs to Europe. The Taliban said that U.S. forces were mistaken in their targeting and were hitting civilians.  There are no drug producing factories in these areas. Invading Americans are carrying out these attacks based on false information and to make propaganda, which most of its victims are civilians,  said Taliban spokesman Qari Yousuf Ahmadi on Wednesday. Although World Bank projections show Afghanistan s economy picking up modestly, the improvement is more than offset by population growth, leaving many in rural areas saying they have no alternative to growing poppies.  The government must provide jobs so people can feed their families and survive,  said poppy farmer Haji Daoud in Sangin, Helmand.  It should provide security and infrastructure.

Israeli official under fire for comments on American Jews' military service,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - A top Israeli diplomat was rebuked by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday for suggesting that American Jews have a poor commitment to service in the U.S. military. Asked in an English-language television interview about criticism of Israeli policies by some U.S. Jews, Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely questioned whether  people that never send their children to fight for their country  could understand the  complexity  of the Middle east.  Most of the Jews don t have children serving as soldiers, going to the Marines, going to Afghanistan or to Iraq,  she said on i24 TV news on Wednesday.  They don t feel how it feels to be attacked by rockets, and I think part of it is to actually experience what Israel is dealing with on a daily basis,  said Hotovely, a member of Netanyahu s right-wing Likud party. While Israel has often quarreled with American Jews over their right to advise it from afar, Hotovely s remarks went further by appearing to insinuate they are not fully committed to their native country, a notion U.S. Jewish organizations have long fought against in their battle against anti-Semitism. In a statement, Netanyahu, who also serves as Israel s foreign minister, denounced Hotovely s comments as  hurtful .  There is no place for such a harangue and her remarks do not reflect the State of Israel s position,  the statement said. According to a 2009 survey published by the congressionally-mandated Military Leadership Diversity Commission, an estimated 1.09 percent of the members of the U.S. armed forces are Jewish. The Pew Research Center estimated in 2013 that Jews make up about 2 percent of the U.S. adult population. The website of the National Museum of American Jewish Military History in Washington lists more than 50 Jewish service members killed in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2001.

Iran sets December 10 court date for jailed Iranian-British aid worker,"LONDON (Reuters) - Iran has told jailed Iranian-British aid worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe that she will appear in court next month accused of spreading propaganda, her husband, Richard, said on Thursday.  She s been told she will appear in court on Dec. 10,  he told Reuters. He said that he understood she would appear in court charged with spreading propaganda. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, was sentenced to five years after being convicted by an Iranian court of plotting to overthrow the clerical establishment. She denies the charges. Zaghari-Ratcliffe s fate become a major political issue in Britain after Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson made remarks on Nov. 1 that appeared to cast doubt on statements from her employer about what she had been doing in Iran.  The Thomson Reuters Foundation, a charity organization that is independent of Thomson Reuters and operates independently of Reuters News, said she had been on holiday. Johnson told a parliamentary committee he understood she had been teaching people journalism before her arrest in April 2016. He later apologized for his remarks. The Thomson Reuters Foundation said she had not been training journalists in Iran. Iranian state television has said Johnson s comments showed Zaghari-Ratcliffe s guilt and that she was involved in spying. ",worldnews,"November 23, 2017 ",1
Assad adviser says rebels must lay down arms: Syrian state media,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Russia s planned peace talks among Syrian groups will only succeed if the opposition ends its fight against the government, a senior adviser to President Bashar al-Assad said on Thursday.   The success of the congress depends on the various opposition groups realizing that the time has come to stop the violence, lay down their weapons and engage in a national dialogue,  said Bouthaina Shaaban in comments to a Russian news agency carried by Syrian state media.     Russian President Vladimir Putin met Assad as well as the leaders of Iran and Turkey in the Black Sea resort of Sochi this week in a diplomatic push to prepare for a congress between Syria s government and opposition. For years, Western and Arab countries backed the opposition demand that Assad quit power, but since Russia s 2015 entry into the war, his government has won back major cities and now looks militarily unassailable. Large parts of northwest and southwest Syria remain in rebel hands as well as a pocket near Damascus, and Kurdish-led groups hold much of the northeast.  Opposition groups who met in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday will stick to their demand that Assad leave power as part of any political transition, the Saudi-owned al-Arabiya channel reported.  But after the Syrian army and its allies recaptured Albu Kamal, Islamic State s last Syrian town, Putin said the military campaign in Syria was winding down.  Russia has not said when the Syrian congress, also planned to take place in Sochi, will take place or who will be invited. The congress will involve drawing up a framework for the future structure of the Syrian state, adopting a new constitution and holding elections under United Nations supervision, Putin said.      After their meeting on Wednesday, Putin, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani called on the Syrian government and moderate opposition to  participate constructively . Shaaban said the government is ready for dialogue with those who believe in a political solution, adding that the opposition s desire - or even ability - to engage in a real political operation has not yet been made clear. Syria s six-year-old civil war has killed hundreds of thousands, pushed millions to flee in the worst refugee crisis since World War Two and embroiled regional and world powers.

Trading inside the Rohingya camps,"PALONG KHALI, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Mohammad Ayas, a 12-year-old Rohingya refugee in the sprawling Palong Khali camp, is busy hawking piazu, a fried mixture of onions, lentils and spices. The 150 portions of piazu, made by his mother from the aid package the family received after fleeing violence in Myanmar, sell for 1 taka each, or a little more than 1 U.S. cent.  I started my trading here with the relief I got,  Mohammad told Reuters.  I did not buy anything. I got this relief package five days ago and my mum made this piazu this morning.  Myanmar s Rohingya Muslims have endured killings, arson and rape by Myanmar troops and ethnic Rakhine Buddhist vigilantes since Aug. 25, in response to Rohingya insurgent attacks on security posts, the United Nations says. It says problems like children trafficking existed in Bangladesh s camps, even before they were overwhelmed by the more than 600,000 new arrivals. Now, driven by a need for food and other essentials, trade is starting to thrive in the Palong Khali camp, located about 4 km (2.5 miles) from the Naf River that marks the border between Bangladesh and Myanmar. For the photo essay on trading inside the camps click on: reut.rs/2A5Sg7v Some refugees are returning to their previous occupations to eke out a living. Abul Fayaj, a 50-year-old vegetable seller from Buthidaung township in Rakhine, now sells green chilies to residents of the camp. He said a Bangladeshi lent him money for the chilies, which he sells for 200 taka ($2.39) per kg, higher than the local market price of 130 taka per kg.  I don t have the money to take lots of food, that s why I have to take a loan,  he said.  I have to pay more to the lender who gave me the money to buy the vegetables, so there is only a small profit,  said Fayaj, adding he takes home 100 taka a day. Obaidul Mannan, 40, with five daughters and two sons, traded clocks in Myanmar until the military came to his village, arresting people and burning homes.      He now sells betel nut that he bought with 9 grams (0.3 ounces) of gold that belonged to his wife. His complaints are common to shopkeepers everywhere.  The problem I m facing here is that I m selling next door to traders who are also selling the same items,  he said. Some Bangladeshi shopkeepers have hired Rohingya to run shops within the camp. Kalim Ullah, 42, fled from the Buthidaung area with his wife, six sons and a daughter. He used to transport goods in Myanmar, but was told that Rohingya could not own a business in Bangladesh. Ullah joined up with a local business owner and now sells snacks and red chilies in the camp for a daily wage of 100 taka. Two Bangladesh government officials confirmed that the refugees are not legally allowed to own businesses in the country since they are not citizens.  We are giving all kind of humanitarian assistance. They are not our citizens,  said a senior home ministry official.  The Myanmar government will have to take them back.  Bangladeshis are aware of the opportunities that the Rohingya exodus provides for trade and a number of them have moved closer to the camps. Abdur Razzak, 26, sells knives, pots and water buckets in the Palong Khali camp where he set up shop three months ago. After paying rent on his shop, wages for two assistants and transporting goods from the town of Ukhia, about 9 km (5.4 miles) north of the camp, Razzak earns about 500 taka profit on sales of 2,000 taka.   I m not making a lot of money. I just profit a little,  he said. ($1 = 83.7000 taka) ",worldnews,"November 23, 2017 ",1
"Myanmar, Bangladesh ink Rohingya return deal amid concern over army's role","NAYPYITAW (Reuters) - Myanmar and Bangladesh signed an accord on Thursday over terms for the return of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims who have fled to Bangladesh, both governments said, amid concern that Myanmar s powerful army could prove obstructive. Rights groups have accused the military in mostly Buddhist Myanmar of carrying out mass rape and other atrocities during a counter-insurgency operation launched in late August in retaliation for attacks by Rohingya militants in Rakhine State. On Wednesday, the United States said the military operation that drove 620,000 Rohingya to seek sanctuary in neighboring, largely Muslim Bangladesh, amounted to  ethnic cleansing , echoing an accusation first leveled by top U.N. officials in the early days of the humanitarian crisis. Myanmar is seeking to ease international pressure by striking an initial agreement on returns, while Dhaka wants to ensure overstretched refugee camps that have mushroomed in the Cox s Bazar region don t become permanent. The return of the refugees should start in two months, the pact says. A joint working group will be set up in three weeks and a specific bilateral arrangement for repatriation  will be concluded in a speedy manner,  the Bangladesh foreign affairs ministry said in a statement.  We are ready to take them back as soon as possible after Bangladesh sends the forms back to us,  Myint Kyaing, a permanent secretary at Myanmar s ministry of labor, immigration and population, told Reuters, referring to forms the Rohingya must complete with personal details before repatriation. The signing took place after a meeting between Myanmar s civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi and Bangladesh foreign minister Abul Hassan Mahmood Ali in Naypyitaw. In its statement, Myanmar said the deal was based on the 1992-1993 repatriation pact between the two countries that followed a previous spasm of violence in Myanmar. Although Western countries and the world Muslim body, the Organisation for Islamic Cooperation, portrayed the matter as an international issue, Myanmar said it was resolved via two-way talks based on  friendly and good neighborly relations .  Issues that emerge between neighboring countries must be resolved amicably through bilateral negotiations,  Suu Kyi s office said. On the basis of the 1992-1993 agreement, Myanmar would accept those who could present identity documents issued to the Rohingya by governments in the past, Myint Kyaing said. Acceptable identity documents include the currently distributed national verification cards, the now-withdrawn  white cards , and receipts the Rohingya received for the return of  white cards , he said. The refugees have to provide names of family members, previous addresses in Myanmar, birthdates and a statement of voluntary return in the forms they fill out, he added.  Diplomats have said key deal elements will be the criteria of return and the participation of the United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR. Other important points include safeguards for the Rohingya against further violence, a path to resolving their legal status and whether they would be allowed to return to their own homes and farms. Myint Kyaing declined to elaborate on those points. Speaking at a military event in Dhaka, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said she was calling on Myanmar  to start taking back soon their nationals from Bangladesh .  However, there was little enthusiasm for the deal among Rohingya refugees in the camps in Bangladesh s Cox s Bazar area near the Myanmar border.    We will go back to our country if our demands are met,   said one of them, Salimullah, who arrived in Bangladesh 15 days ago.  Our demands are that we are given citizenship. They also have to give us back our land,  he told Reuters Television. Suu Kyi, whose stature as a Nobel peace prize winner was tarnished by the crisis, has said repatriation of the largely stateless Muslim minority would be based on residency and that it will be  safe and voluntary . But her civilian administration, which is less than two years old, has to share power with the military that ruled Myanmar for decades, and the generals have appeared less enthusiastic about the prospect of Rohingya returning. Russia s ambassador to Myanmar criticized the U.S. stance, saying that using the term  ethnic cleansing  was unhelpful and could aggravate the situation. On a visit to Beijing on Wednesday, Myanmar s commander in chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, was told by a senior Chinese general that China wanted stronger ties with Myanmar s military. Humanitarian workers told Reuters they were particularly concerned about a statement by Min Aung Hlaing last week.  The situation must be acceptable for both local Rakhine ethnic people and Bengalis, and emphasis must be placed on wish of local Rakhine ethnic people who are real Myanmar citizens,  Min Aung Hlaing said. His use of the term Bengali for the Rohingya implies they are from Bangladesh, and Buddhists in Rakhine are largely opposed to their presence. Min Aung Hlaing, over whom Suu Kyi has no control, also said the returnees would be  scrutinized and re-accepted under the 1982 Citizenship Law and the 1992 Myanmar-Bangladesh bilateral agreement . The 1982 law, passed during the junta s long rule, ties Myanmar citizenship to membership of recognized ethnic groups, an official list that excludes the Rohingya. Senior U.N. officials based in Myanmar told Reuters they feared that security personnel in key positions may not cooperate over the return of Rohingya. ",worldnews,"November 23, 2017 ",1

"China air force again flies round Taiwan, over South China Sea","BEIJING (Reuters) - China s air force has again flown bombers and other warplanes through two strategic channels near Taiwan and also over the disputed South China Sea during training drills, state media said on Thursday. Numerous H-6K bombers and other jets recently flew through the Bashi Channel between Taiwan and the Philippines and the Miyako Strait in Japan s south, and also over the South China Sea on a  combat patrol , the official Xinhua news agency said, citing Air Force spokesman Shen Jinke. Shen did not say when the drills began but said all planes had finished their patrols on Thursday, which were intended to  improve maritime real combat capabilities and forge the forces  battle methods . China has been increasingly asserting itself in territorial disputes in the South and East China Seas. It is also worried about Taiwan, run by a government China fears is intent on independence. Beijing has never ruled out the use of force to bring proudly democratic Taiwan under its control, and has warned that any moves towards formal independence could prompt an armed response. China is in the midst of an ambitious military modernization program that includes building aircraft carriers and developing stealth fighters to give it the ability to project power far from its shores. Taiwan is well armed, mostly with U.S. weaponry, but has been pressing Washington to sell it more high-tech equipment to better deter China. ",worldnews,"November 23, 2017 ",1
"China grants economic aid to Djibouti, site of overseas military base","BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Thursday offered loans to Djibouti, the site of its first overseas military base, as the Horn of Africa state s leader told President Xi Jinping he considered himself a great friend of the Asian giant.  With a population of less than one million, Djibouti has long punched above its weight, thanks to a strategic location on the Gulf of Aden, one of the world s busiest shipping routes linking Europe to Asia and the Middle East. China formally opened the base, which it calls a logistics facility, on Aug. 1, the 90th birthday of the People s Liberation Army. Djibouti also hosts large U.S. and French bases.  Djibouti was politically stable, Xi told its president, Ismail Omar Guelleh, at a meeting in Beijing s Great Hall of the People.     China sets great store by its relations with Djibouti,  he added.  Guelleh, who has been in power since 1999, said he considered himself a  great friend of China s  and could not count the number of times he had visited.  Djibouti is known for being a country of peace, exchanges and meetings,  Guelleh said.  I would like to recall the geostrategic position of Djibouti and its importance in this part of the world as an island of stability for Asia, Africa and the Middle East.   The two, who did not mention the military base in comments to reporters, later oversaw the signing of a framework pact for preferential loans. Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister Chen Xiaodong declined to reveal the amount of loans offered, saying he could not remember.  In this area both countries have always had good cooperation,  Chen told reporters. Xi and Guelleh did discuss the military base, Chen added.  What I want to stress is that China building a logistics base in Djibouti benefits China to even better fulfill its naval protection, peace-keeping, disaster relief and other international work,  he said. The base will be used to resupply navy ships participating in peacekeeping, humanitarian and anti-piracy missions off the coasts of Yemen and Somalia, in particular. China also has deep economic interests in Djibouti.     Last week, China s POLY-GCL Petroleum Group Holdings Ltd signed a memorandum of understanding to invest $4 billion in a natural gas project in Djibouti. In January, the government launched construction of a project billed as Africa s largest free trade zone, as part of China s massive Belt and Road infrastructure initiative stretching to Asia, Europe and beyond.

Czech president plans to appoint Babis's cabinet by mid-December,"PRAGUE (Reuters) - Czech President Milos Zeman plans to appoint Andrej Babis as prime minister in early December and the full cabinet around the middle of the month, Zeman s spokesman said on Thursday. Babis s ANO party came first by a wide margin in a parliamentary election last month but fell short of a majority and has not found any coalition partners nor votes to support a minority cabinet that Babis is now trying to form. Czech public television reported on Thursday that Zeman wanted to appoint Babis on Dec. 6 and his full cabinet on Dec. 15. The president s spokesman said those were provisional dates. Zeman spoke on Thursday with journalists traveling with him during a state visit in Russia. The eight other parties in parliament have so far been unwilling to join a coalition with ANO, mainly due to an investigation into allegations that Babis hid ownership of an farm and convention center almost a decade ago to get European Union subsidies. Babis denies any wrongdoing and says the case is politically motivated.     The new government will take power from the date of the appointment. If it loses a mandatory confidence vote, it will stay in office until another administration is formed, which can take months. Babis  appointment will be possible only after the current government of Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka resigns, which is expected to happen next week at the earliest. So far, only the Communists have said they may help ANO s minority government in the confidence vote, but their votes alone would not be enough. ",worldnews,"November 23, 2017 ",1
"Iran Guards ready to help rebuild Syria, Hezbollah will not disarm: TV","ANKARA (Reuters) - Iran s Revolutionary Guards are ready to help rebuild Syria and bring about a lasting  ceasefire  there, chief commander Mohammad Ali Jafari said, adding that disarming Lebanon s Hezbollah is out of the question, state TV reported on Thursday. Regional tensions have risen in recent weeks between Sunni Muslim monarchy Saudi Arabia and Shi ite Iran, whose rivalry has wrought upheaval in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Bahrain. Saudi Arabia has accused the heavily armed Iran-backed Hezbollah of helping Houthi forces in Yemen and playing a role in a ballistic missile attack on the kingdom earlier this month. Iran and Hezbollah both denied the claims. Iranian state television quoted Jafari as saying:  Hezbollah must be armed to fight against the enemy of the Lebanese nation which is Israel. Naturally they should have the best weapons to protect Lebanon s security. This issue is non-negotiable.  Iran denies giving financial and military support to the Houthis in the struggle for Yemen, blaming the deepening crisis on Riyadh.  Iran only provides advisory and spiritual assistances to Yemen ... and this help will continue,  he said. Jafari also praised the success of Iranian allies across the region, hailing a  resistance front  from Tehran to Beirut and calling on Riyadh to avoid confronting this grouping.  We directly deal with global arrogance and Israel not with their emissaries... That is why we do not want to have direct confrontation with Saudi Arabia,  he said. The term global arrogance refers to the United States. Leaders of Russia, Turkey and Iran agreed on Wednesday to help support a full-scale political process in Syria and announced an agreement to sponsor a conference in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi to try to end Syria s civil war.   The guards are ready to play an active role in  establishing a lasting ceasefire in Syria ... and reconstruction of the country,  Jafari said.  Iran has signed large economic contracts with Syria, reaping what appear to be lucrative rewards for helping Tehran s main regional ally President Bashar al-Assad in his fight against rebel groups and Islamic State militants.   In meetings with the (Iran) government, it was agreed that the Guards were in a better position to help Syria s reconstruction ... the preliminary talks already have been held with the Syrian government over the issue,  Jafari said Jafari repeated Iran s stance on its disputed ballistic missile work, saying the Islamic Republic s missile program is for defensive purposes and not up for negotiation.  The program was not part of the 2015 nuclear deal with Western powers under which Iran agreed to curb its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of some sanctions.  Iran will not negotiate its defensive program ... there will be no talks about it,  he said.  (French president Emmanuel) Macron s remarks over our missile work is because he is young and inexperienced.  Macron said earlier this month that Tehran should be less aggressive in the region and should clarify the strategy around its ballistic missile program. ",worldnews,"November 23, 2017 ",1

Detained Venezuelan-U.S. Citgo executives to be tried as 'traitors': Maduro,"WASHINGTON/CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said on Wednesday that Venezuelan-American executives at refiner Citgo who were arrested in a corruption sweep this week would be tried as  corrupt, thieving traitors  despite a request by the United States to free them.  Five of six executives of U.S.-based refiner Citgo [PDVSAC.UL] who were arrested in Caracas this week are U.S. citizens, according to a source familiar with the matter, possibly complicating Venezuela s corruption sweep of the oil industry.  The six executives included acting Citgo President Jose Pereira, who has Venezuelan citizenship and U.S. permanent residency, the source said. Citgo did not respond to requests for comment.   Late on Wednesday, Maduro tapped Asdrubal Chavez, a former oil minister and cousin of the late president Hugo Chavez, to replace Pereira.      Military intelligence agents detained the Texas-based executives during an event at state oil company PDVSA s headquarters in Caracas on Tuesday, two sources told Reuters. U.S.-based Citgo Petroleum Corp (Citgo) is a Venezuelan-owned refiner and marketer of oil and petrochemical products.  Maduro said the U.S. embassy had requested that its nationals be freed. He mocked the demand and vowed that the men, who are also Venezuelan, would pay for alleged wrongdoing in a financial deal.   These are people born in Venezuela, they re Venezuelan and they re going to be judged for being corrupt, thieving traitors,  Maduro said in a televised broadcast during which he also sang and danced salsa.   They re properly behind bars, and they should go to the worst prison in Venezuela.  Relations between Caracas and Washington have long been tense. They have further soured under President Donald Trump since his administration imposed sanctions on Venezuelan officials including Maduro, and economic sanctions that have impeded the OPEC nation s access to international banks.  Venezuela has defaulted on sovereign debt and bonds issued by PDVSA after failing to make timely payments, a New York-based derivatives group ruled on Thursday. Late on Wednesday, a U.S. State Department official said,  We have seen media reports of the arrest of U.S. citizens in Venezuela. Venezuela is required under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations to provide consular notification to the U.S. upon request of a detained U.S. citizen, and to provide consular access.   When a U.S. citizen is arrested overseas, we immediately request permission to visit him or her. We have no additional information to offer at this time.      Venezuelan state Prosecutor Tarek Saab has declared a  crusade  against  organized crime  in Venezuela s oil industry. Saab told a news conference on Tuesday that his office had uncovered a roughly $4 billion planned deal with foreign companies, offering the refiner as guarantee in a detrimental deal for Venezuela. According to Saab, the deal was with U.S. investment fund Apollo Global Management LLC and Dubai-based Frontier Management Group LTD, and also included a Swiss-based intermediary, Mangore Sarl. He added there was a  presumed  link between Mangore Sarl and the Citgo executives. Opposition leaders have attributed the arrests to in-fighting among government factions and the cash-strapped government s desire to gain control of money-making companies rather than a genuine desire to root out corruption.  Venezuela has whipped out much of Citgo s top brass at a delicate time for the OPEC nation, which has been declared in selective default after some late payments. But as Venezuela is making efforts to pay, bondholders of some of the world s highest yielding debt have so far been tolerant of the delays.   The five other arrested executives are: Tomeu Vadell, vice president of refining operations; Alirio Zambrano, vice president and general manager of Corpus Christi refinery; Jose Luis Zambrano, vice president of shared services; Gustavo Cardenas, vice president of strategic shareholder relations, government and public affairs; Jorge Toledo, vice president of supply and marketing.

Pakistan court orders release of Islamist blamed for Mumbai attacks,"LAHORE, Pakistan (Reuters) - A Pakistani court on Wednesday ordered the release from house arrest of an Islamist leader accused by the United States and India of masterminding attacks on Mumbai in 2008 in which 166 people were killed, a prosecutor said. Hafiz Saeed was put under house arrest in January after years of living freely in Pakistan, one of the sore points in its fraying relationship with the United States. His freedom had also infuriated its arch-foe India. Saeed, who is expected to be freed on Thursday, thanked the court judges in a video message released by his Islamist charity.  Thanks to God, this is a victory of Pakistan s independence,  he said. The government of Pakistan s Punjab province had asked for a 60-day extension to Saeed s detention but the request was turned down by the court, prosecutor Sattar Sahil told Reuters.     His previous detention for 30 days is over, which means he would be released tomorrow,  said Sahil.  Saeed has repeatedly denied involvement in the Mumbai attacks in which 10 gunmen attacked targets in India s largest city, including two luxury hotels, a Jewish center and a train station in a rampage that lasted several days. The violence brought nuclear-armed neighbors Pakistan and India to the brink of war. The United States had offered a $10 million bounty for information leading to the arrest and conviction of Saeed, who heads the Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD). Members say the Jamaat-ud-Dawa is an charity but the United States says it is a front for the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) militant group.  The review board of the Lahore High Court asked the Punjab government to produce evidence against Hafiz Saeed for keeping him detained but the government failed,  Saeed s lawyer A.K. Dogar told Reuters.  The court today said that there is nothing against Saeed, therefore he should be released,  he added. A spokesman for India s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. India accused Pakistan of sponsoring the attacks through the LeT, which Saeed founded in the 1990s. Pakistan has denied any state involvement in the attack. It placed the LeT on a list of banned organizations in 2002.

Turkey to detain 99 suspects in widening post-coup probe: Anadolu,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish authorities issued detention warrants for 99 suspects including doctors and lawyers and have so far detained 78 of them, the state-run Anadolu agency said on Thursday, as part of a widening crackdown since last year s failed coup attempt. The suspects were believed to be users of ByLock, an encrypted messaging app which the government says was used by the network of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, accused by Ankara of orchestrating last July s abortive putsch. Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since 1999, denies involvement. Anadolu said security forces were seeking the remaining suspects in southern Turkish province of Antalya. Turkey has identified 215,092 users of ByLock and has launched investigations on 23,171 of them, the interior minister said earlier this week. More than 50,000 people, including soldiers, teachers and journalists, have been jailed pending trial in a sweeping crackdown following last year s coup attempt.  In the judiciary alone, 5,920 people have been sacked from their jobs due to suspected links to the 2016 coup attempt, Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul said on Thursday.     Rights groups and some of Turkey s Western allies have voiced concern about the crackdown, fearing the government is using the coup as a pretext to quash dissent. The government says only such a purge could neutralize the threat represented by Gulen s network, which it says deeply infiltrated institutions such as the army, schools and courts.

U.S. calling Rohingya operation 'ethnic cleansing' unhelpful: Russian envoy,"YANGON (Reuters) - The U.S. labeling of a Myanmar army crackdown on Rohingya Muslims as  ethnic cleansing  is unhelpful and could aggravate the situation, Russia s ambassador to the southeast Asian nation said on Thursday, criticizing  excessive external intervention . Rights groups have accused the military in mostly Buddhist Myanmar of carrying out mass rape and other atrocities during a ferocious military sweep launched in late August in retaliation for attacks by Rohingya Muslim militants in Rakhine State. That drove 620,000 Rohingya refugees, many traumatized with gunshot wounds and burns, to flee to Bangladesh, joining hundreds of thousands who have sheltered there for years after previous spasms of violence in the former Burma. The military operation  amounted to  ethnic cleansing , the United States said on Wednesday, echoing an accusation first made by top U.N. officials in the early days of the humanitarian crisis.  I don t think that it will help to solve this problem,  Russian ambassador Nikolay Listopadov told Reuters in an interview in Yangon, when asked about the U.S. move.  On the contrary, it can aggravate the situation, throw more fuel,  he said in English, citing concern over how the Buddhist community in Rakhine would react to such a designation. This month, Russia and China agreed to a UN Security Council statement urging Myanmar to  ensure no further excessive use of military force  and expressing  grave concern over reports of human rights violations , but they have opposed tougher steps and further pressure on Myanmar.  We are against excessive external intervention, because it won t lead to any constructive results,  Listopadov said.  Just pressure and blaming and accusing - it simply won t work.  On a visit to Myanmar last week, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson urged the government of Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi to lead a credible and impartial inquiry, saying those who committed abuses should be held responsible. But prospects for such an inquiry remain dim and Suu Kyi s government refused to cooperate with a mission launched by the United Nations Human Rights Council in March after a less intense bout of violence in Rakhine. The  so-called independent investigation  demanded by Tillerson was  absolutely  out of the question for Myanmar, Listopadov said.  It s absolutely not acceptable for the Myanmar side - it will never accept it...it won t work - it s counterproductive,  said Listopadov.  Independent investigation means international (investigation) - no, it s not acceptable.  Moscow s approach was for the Rakhine issue to be solved by  political means, political dialogue,  he added, without elaborating. He welcomed talks being held in Myanmar s capital of Naypyitaw between Myanmar and Bangladesh on the repatriation of Rohingya refugees, stressing it was  important to start this process.   We wish them success,  said Listopadov,  this complicated Rakhine issue can be solved mostly only by negotiations and agreements between the two sides, because they re the most involved,  he said, referring to Bangladesh and Myanmar. China wants closer ties with Myanmar s military to help protect regional peace and security, a senior Chinese general told the visiting head of the southeast Asian country s army this week.

"Australia urges strong, sustained U.S. engagement in Asia, warns on China","SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia called on Thursday on the United States to build a strong presence in Asia and bolster ties with  like-minded  partners while warning against China s rising influence. A more insular United States would be detrimental to the liberal nature of the world s  rules-based order , the government said in a 115-page foreign policy white paper.  Australia believes that international challenges can only be tackled effectively when the world s wealthiest, most innovative and most powerful country is engaged in solving them,  the government said. The white paper is a guide for Australian diplomacy and provides a roadmap for advancing its interests. The election of President Donald Trump represented a step towards a more isolationist world, which could be negative for Australia s export-dependent economy, commentators have said. Trump withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership regional trade agreement in January, shortly after he took office.  Strong and sustained U.S. engagement in the international system remains fundamental to international stability and prosperity,  the government said in the paper.  Without such engagement, the effectiveness and liberal character of the international order would erode.  Australia is one of the staunchest U.S. allies and troops from the two countries have fought alongside each other in all major conflicts for generations. But the economic growth and power that the United States has enjoyed since the end of the World War Two is now being challenged by China, Australia said. Australia and China have close economic ties but China is suspicious of Australia s close military relationship with the United States. Australia warned in the paper of risks it faces, particularly in the  Indo-Pacific region  due to a shift in the balance of power. It highlighted the South China Sea as a  major fault line in the regional order , and said it was  particularly concerned by the unprecedented pace and scale  of China s land reclamation and construction activities in the disputed waters.      China s Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang told a regular briefing that the paper was on whole a positive assessment of China s development, which he said adhered to the global rules-based order, and of relations between China and Australia. But Lu said the paper did make  irresponsible remarks  on the South China Sea for which China expressed its concerns.  While the government recognized the economic benefits from China s rise, it was also trying to  wish China away , said Jane Golley, deputy director at the Australian Center on China in the World, Australian National University.   To actually drop the word  Asia  from  Asia-Pacific  undoes three decades of diplomatic effort,  Golley said, referring to the use of the phrase  Indo-Pacific  which came up 120 times in the paper.  Asia-Pacific  was not used once. The United States and some of its allies have recently been talking up their vision of the  Indo-Pacific , instead of the  Asia-Pacific , in a play on words aimed at undermining the influence of China.  There is a small reference to China s geo-economic strategy in the paper but the emphasis is on the tensions that could create, rather than the economic benefits,  Golley said.   We ll have to see how China reacts to this but they re not going to like this policy.  Relations between Australia and China sank to a low point this year after Australia rejected high-profile Chinese investments, citing  national interest . Australia has also shown little enthusiasm for China s  ambitious Belt and Road initiative, which aims to connect China to Europe and beyond with infrastructure projects. The initiative was mentioned just once in the paper.   We are not embracing the future,  Golley said.  We are holding on to the past and reaching on to the life jacket rather than thinking of building a whole new ship.  ",worldnews,"November 23, 2017 ",1
No joke: China government warns northern cities to get serious in war on smog,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Some northern Chinese cities failed to improve air quality by much last month, hitting the smog-prone region s overall results in a drive against pollution, the government said as it warned provincial officials to comply with stringent steps to clear the skies.  Some cities did not improve air quality by much or even experienced some volatility, and in a way, they have dragged down the regional air quality level,  Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP) spokesperson, Liu Youbin, said at a regular briefing on Thursday. He did not identify the underperforming cities, but the comment comes amid concerns about the country s ability to reduce pollution in winter as it battles to avoid a repeat of the near-record levels of choking smog that enveloped key northern areas at the start of the year.  There is no jesting in war. For those local officials who do not enforce the measures of the campaign effectively and could not improve air quality in time, we will hold them accountable,  Liu added. Data earlier this month showed only four of 28 northern Chinese cities met their air quality targets in October and air quality in 338 Chinese cities worsened in October, with levels of hazardous breathable particles, known as PM 2.5, up 5.6 percent on the year to an average of 38 micrograms per cubic meter.      Beijing is under huge pressure to meet politically crucial air quality targets and clear the skies of toxic smog that blankets the north of the country as homes turn up the heat which is powered by coal. Liu said overall air quality in the northern cities was improving compared with September. Average PM 2.5 levels in the region dropped 15.8 percent in October from the month before, he said.   It shows that our measures are working. As long as we are persistent, and diligently enforce existing measures, regional air quality will definitely improve,  he said.  Under the six-month campaign, 28 northern Chinese cities were ordered to thin traffic and cut industrial output. Thousands of pollution sources including steel mills, coal-fired boilers, cement and ceramic plants, mines and building sites will be shut. These measures, part of Beijing s years-long time war on smog, have already roiled commodities market, fuelling worries that the tough inspections are hurting the already slowing economy.

Philippines president likely to return police to drugs war soon: spokesman,"MANILA (Reuters) - There is a  strong likelihood  Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte will lift a suspension on police from his war on drugs, his spokesman said on Thursday, a move likely to alarm activists who accuse police of committing murder under the guise of drug busts. Amid international concern over the staggering death toll and several killings of youngsters, President Rodrigo Duterte last month suspended police anti-narcotics operations for a second time and put the country s undermanned drugs enforcement agency, PDEA, in charge. Presidential spokesman Harry Roque reiterated Duterte s concern expressed last week that the drugs problem could intensify and gains might be lost with the Philippine National Police (PNP) sidelined.  A decision will soon be made,  Roque told a regular briefing.  That s the president s call. If he thinks it (the war on drugs) must be returned (to the PNP) then it must be, the PDEA has been given enough time.  He added:  Effectively he has manifested already a decision to return it to the PNP.  Close to 4,000 mostly urban poor Filipinos have been killed in what police say are anti-drug operations. Human rights groups and political opponents say executions of drug users and small-time peddlers have been widespread, but police insist those killed were all dealers who put up violent resistance. Police have rebuffed criticism and cite 117,000 arrests as proof that their policy is to preserve life. They also deny links to at least 2,000 mysterious street killings of drug users. Roque said Duterte knew the police had flaws and would not tolerate abuses, but he still believed in them.  He suspended police in January and reinstated them five weeks later, arguing that drugs were pouring back to the streets. It is unclear why he removed them again on Oct. 11. His directive was to  bring order  to the campaign, but in angry, at times incoherent speeches, he suggested he was trying to appease the international community. Duterte last week oversaw his biggest international summit yet but there was no known challenge from other leaders to his war on drugs, including from U.S. President Donald Trump. The volatile Duterte did, however, lash out afterwards about Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, calling it an  insult  that he should express his concern to him. Phelim Kine, deputy director of Human Rights Watch in Asia, said people should  brace for more bloodshed  and called again for a United Nations-led international investigation.  Until that happens, the number of victims denied justice and accountability will likely only continue to grow,  he wrote in a web posting. ",worldnews,"November 23, 2017 ",1

"Cuba, North Korea reject 'unilateral and arbitrary' U.S. demands","HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba s foreign minister and his North Korean counterpart rejected the United States   unilateral and arbitrary  demands on Wednesday while expressing concern about escalating tensions on the Korean peninsula, the ministry said. North Korea is searching for support amid unprecedented pressure from the United States and the international community to cease its nuclear weapons and missile programs, which it carries out in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions. The country, which has made no secret of its plans to develop a missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland, has maintained warm political relations with Cuba since 1960, despite the island s opposition to nuclear weapons. Some diplomats said Cuba was also one of the few countries that might be able to convince North Korea to move away from the current showdown with the United States that threatens war. The ministers, meeting in Havana, called for  respect for peoples  sovereignty  and  the peaceful settlement of disputes,  according to a statement released by the Cuban foreign ministry.  They strongly rejected the unilateral and arbitrary lists and designations established by the U.S. government which serve as a basis for the implementation of coercive measures which are contrary to international law,  the statement said. U.S. President Donald Trump has also increased pressure on Cuba since taking office, rolling back a fragile detente begun by predecessor Barack Obama and returning to the hostile rhetoric of the Cold War. A U.S. State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the United States had made clear it wanted a peaceful resolution to the North Korean nuclear issue.  The DPRK s belligerent and provocative behavior demonstrates it has no interest in working toward a peaceful solution,  the official said. DPRK stands for North Korea s official name, the Democratic People s Republic of Korea. Cuba said in the statement the Cuban and North Korean foreign ministers had  expressed concern about the escalation of tensions  on the Korean peninsula.  The ministers discussed the respective efforts carried out in the construction of socialism according to the realities inherent to their respective countries.  Cuba and North Korea are the last in the world to maintain Soviet-style command economies, though under President Raul Castro, the Caribbean nation has taken some small steps toward the more market-oriented communism of China and Vietnam. Cuba maintains an embassy in North Korea, but publicly trades almost exclusively with the South. Last year, trade with the latter was $67 million and with the North just $9 million, according to the Cuban government. North Korea defends its weapons programs as a necessary defense against U.S. plans to invade. The United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean war, denies any such intentions. ",worldnews,"November 23, 2017 ",1
Exclusive: India pares back planned funding for crucial public health scheme,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has approved a three-year budget for its flagship public health program almost 20 percent lower than what the health ministry said was needed, according to sources and previously unreported government documents reviewed by Reuters.  The federal finance ministry in August renewed the National Health Mission with $20 billion of funding between 2017-20, against the health ministry s estimated requirement of $25 billion, the documents showed.  Officials familiar with the plan said the finance ministry reduced planned funding because of other spending priorities and because of state governments  poor track record of spending the health budgets they ve been allotted in the past. The finance and health ministries did not respond to several requests for comment.  The National Health Mission is one of the world s largest health programs and forms the backbone of public services in India. It provides everything from free drugs to immunization services to millions of rural poor. Prime Minister Narendra Modi s government has hiked federal funding for the overall health budget this year as part of a plan to improve care and meet a 2025 goal of raising health expenditure to 2.5 percent of GDP from the current 1.15 percent.  The National Health Mission typically accounts for about half of the federal health budget and officials said the lower spending approval would make achieving the government s 2025 target more difficult.  NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES  After focusing on maternal and child health for years, the program had planned to broaden its priorities to tackle the rising threat of non-communicable diseases (NCDs).  Faced with the lower funding, the health ministry has reduced its three-year allocation to tackle NCDs such as cancer and diabetes to $1.4 billion, close to half of the estimated need of $2.4 billion, the documents showed.  The Lancet, a British medical journal, last week said NCDs caused a disease burden in India  like never before . More than 60 percent of deaths in the country during 2016 were due to non-communicable diseases, up from about 38 percent in 1990, according to the publication.  While funding for such diseases up to 2020 will be higher than in recent years, the lower-than-planned approved funding will slow government efforts to tackle these diseases, two government officials said.  The cutbacks in NCDs (spending) are dangerous ... this can potentially stall the NCD screening and management plan,  said Oommen C. Kurian, a health researcher at the New Delhi-based think-tank Observer Research Foundation. India this year introduced free NCD screening for patients in 100 districts, with plans to eventually cover the country. Beyond non-communicable diseases, spending on strengthening the health system - such as improving district hospitals and patient transport services - will be an estimated $4.3 billion between 2017-20, a third lower than the ministry s request. Planned funding for immunization will be $2.9 billion versus $3.2 billion requested. The spending breakdown for different schemes will be finalised once the health ministry is allocated funding in India s annual budget.      Modi s government has taken steps to improve public healthcare including a 27 percent budget hike this year to $7 billion, accompanied by cuts to prices of critical medical devices and drugs. Shamika Ravi, a health expert at Brookings India, said Modi s government was also pursuing  fundamental structural reforms  to improve healthcare, such as the ranking of district hospitals and empowering state medical officers.  There is a lot of background work happening,  said Ravi, who is also on Modi s economic advisory council.  However, critics say more needs to be done to address the underfunded and overburdened public health system. Some 900,000 children in India died before turning five in 2016, the highest in the world, The Lancet estimates. In March, health officials faced criticism from other government departments for the National Health Mission s inefficiencies and were asked to rework the renewal proposal for 2017-20 after they drew up spending estimates of $33 billion.  The health ministry revised the cost to nearly $25 billion, but the finance ministry reduced estimates by another $5 billion while approving the plan, the documents showed. The estimates were pared back because Modi s government has other priorities and because the finance ministry wants to control spending as it seeks to balance fiscal deficit targets while boosting growth, several government officials aware of the process said.  It s about political priorities - you have programs on roads, on infrastructure, on ports,  said one of the officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The government is also concerned states do not have the governance capacity to spend large health budgets efficiently, officials said. A shortage of workers, bureaucratic bungling and slow procurement processes have plagued the states  health systems. More than $1.4 billion in health budgets was unspent by states by 2015-16, India s federal auditor said earlier this year. ",worldnews,"November 23, 2017 ",1
China's internet regulator denounces its former chief now under investigation,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China s internet regulator had said it will purge the  evil influence  of its former top official who the ruling Communist Party has put under investigation for suspected corruption. The official, Lu Wei, was suspected of serious discipline breaches, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) announced on Tuesday.  Lu, a colorful and often brash official by Chinese standards, was at the height of his power seen as emblematic of China s increasingly pervasive internet controls. The Communist Party referred to him as the  first tiger  taken down after a congress in October, when President Xi Jinping pledged that his anti-graft campaign would continue to target both  tigers  and  flies , a reference to elite officials and ordinary bureaucrats. Lu s former agency, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), held a meeting on Wednesday in which it called its former chief  a typical two-faced person  who had  seriously polluted  its political environment.  Lu Wei cannot represent CAC s image. He precisely undermined CAC s image,  the agency said in statement published late on Wednesday. The CAC would  draw profound lessons  from Lu s breaches and  thoroughly purge Lu s evil influence , it said. The CCDI said in a separate commentary on its website on Thursday that the investigation of Lu was a potent sign that the party would not let up on its fight against wayward officials.  One must not think that no one will ask today about yesterday s crimes,  the CCDI said. It was  nonsense  to think the party would  let bygones be bygones , it said. Xi has waged war against deep-rooted corruption since taking office five years ago, punishing hundreds of thousands of officials. Lu worked his way up though China s official Xinhua news agency before becoming head of propaganda in Beijing and then moving to internet work in 2013. He later became a deputy propaganda minister. But his downfall, foreshadowed by his June 2016 replacement as head of the internet regulator and the loss of his other posts, is unlikely to signal a reversal of internet control policies, which have been tightened under his successor, Xu Lin. The government has blocked sites it thinks could challenge party rule or threaten stability, including sites such as Facebook and Google s main search engine and Gmail service.

China tells Myanmar military it wants closer ties,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China wants closer ties with Myanmar s military to help protect regional peace and security, a senior Chinese general told the visiting head of the southeast Asian country s army. China and Myanmar have had close diplomatic and economic ties for years, including increasingly in the strategically important oil and gas sectors, and China has offered its support to its southern neighbor, also known as Burma, throughout a crisis over its treatment of its Rohingya Muslim minority. More than 600,000 Rohingya have fled from Buddhist-majority Myanmar s Rakhine State, most to neighboring Bangladesh, since a Myanmar military crackdown in response to attacks on the security forces by Rohingya insurgents in August. The United States on Wednesday for the first time called the Myanmar military operation against the Rohingya  ethnic cleansing  and threatened targeted sanctions against those responsible for  horrendous atrocities . Meeting in Beijing, Li Zuocheng, who sits on China s Central Military Commission, which runs its armed forces, told Senior General Min Aung Hlaing that China s development and prosperity were an important opportunity for Myanmar s development, China s Defense Ministry said in a statement.  In the face of a complex and changeable regional security situation, China is willing to maintain strategic communication between the two countries  militaries,  Li was cited as saying in the statement issued late on Wednesday. China wanted greater contacts between the two armed forces and deeper training and technical exchanges and to promote border defense cooperation to ensure peace and stability along their common border, Li added. China has been angered by fighting between Myanmar s military and autonomy-seeking ethnic minority rebels close to the Chinese border in recent years, which has at times forced thousands of villagers to flee into China. The Chinese ministry made no direct mention of the Rohingya issue in the statement. China built close ties with Myanmar s generals during years of military rule, when Western countries imposed sanctions on Myanmar for its suppression of the democracy movement. More recently, their ties have included oil and gas as Myanmar pumps natural gas from the Bay of Bengal to China. A new oil pipeline, opened this year, also feeds Middle East crude through Myanmar to a new refinery in Yunnan, southwest China. This has opened a new oil supply route to China, avoiding the Strait of Malacca and Singapore. The United States and other Western countries have stepped up engagement with Myanmar since the military began handing power to civilians in 2011, and especially since former democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi won a 2015 election. But an international outcry over Myanmar s violations of the rights of the Rohingya has raised questions in Western countries about that engagement. Rights group Amnesty International has called for a comprehensive arms embargo against Myanmar as well as targeted financial sanctions against senior Myanmar military officials. China s Defense Ministry cited Min Aung Hlaing as thanking China for its support in helping Myanmar ensure domestic stability. ",worldnews,"November 23, 2017 ",1
China must enhance protection of intellectual property rights: Premier Li,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - It is strategically important for China s economy that the country enhances protection of intellectual property rights, the state news agency Xinhua quoted Premier Li Keqiang as saying, as the cabinet promised to improve regulations. Inadequate protection of intellectual property had contributed to the decline in private investment, he added. Companies and foreign business lobbies have often accused China of doing too little to rein in risks related to intellectual property rights, despite having anti-piracy laws. To protect these rights better, the State Council, or cabinet, said the government would look into punitive fines for infringements.  The cabinet plans to increase costs for those caught infringing on intellectual property rights, and will make rights protection more affordable, Xinhua said. Private businesses will enjoy equal rights similar to public sector companies, it quoted a statement following a cabinet meeting chaired by Li as saying.  Enhancing the protection of intellectual property rights is a matter of overall strategic significance, and it is vital for the development of the socialist market economy,  Li said.  Deficiency in (property rights protection) is a main cause for the slide in private investment... The wider opening up of the country calls for enhancing IPR protection.  The cabinet vowed to  clear, revise or abolish  regulations or documents that were contradictory to the 2007 Property Rights Law and 2016 guidelines on improving property rights protection.  Wayward and arbitrary  law enforcement would be strictly prevented, it added.IPR law enforcement will be channeled towards cases related to the internet, exports and imports, as well as rural and urban areas, where counterfeiting is rampant.

South Korea considers scrapping exercise with U.S. for Olympics: Yonhap,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea is considering scrapping a regular military exercise with U.S. forces next year to minimize the risk of an aggressive North Korean reaction during the Winter Olympics in the South, the Yonhap news agency reported on Thursday. North Korea denounces regular military exercises between South Korean and U.S. forces as preparations to invade it, and it has at times conducted missile tests or taken other aggressive action in response. The Winter Olympics will be held in South Korea from Feb. 9 to Feb. 25, with the Paralympics on March 8-18. The South s Yonhap news agency, citing an unidentified South Korean presidential office official, said the option of scrapping the exercise had been considered for  a very long time . The Blue House presidential office said in a statement no decision has been made on the exercise. Officials at the defense ministry declined to comment.  The South Korean and U.S. militaries usually hold a military exercise in March and April called Key Resolve and Foal Eagle, which involves about 17,000 U.S. troops and more than 300,000 South Koreans. South Korea is hopeful that North Korean participation in the games could help improve their fraught relations. The South has said any North Korean athletes who are eligible for the competition would be welcome. A North Korean figure skating pair has qualified to compete but their participation has not been confirmed. Tension on the Korean peninsula has been high for the past year with North Korea developing its nuclear weapons and missiles in defiance of international condemnation and U.N. sanctions. While North Korea has not conducted any tests over the past two months, it has repeatedly vowed to never give up the weapons it deems it needs to protect itself against what it sees as U.S. aggression.

Canada data shows 10 percent of Haitian border crossers get refugee status,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada has granted refugee status to about 10 percent of the 298 Haitian border crossers whose applications have been processed this year, according to government data released on Wednesday.  That could bode ill for the 6,000 Haitians still in the refugee queue who illegally crossed the Canada-U.S. border by foot fearing that U.S. President Donald Trump would revoke their Temporary Protected Status.  And it may discourage more from illegally crossing into Canada after the U.S. government on Monday said it would end protected status for nearly 60,000 Haitians living in the United States in July 2019. Of the 298 Haitian applications processed so far this year, 68 were abandoned by the asylum seekers, which means they did not turn up for their hearings, the data released from the Immigration and Refugee Board showed. Another 62 withdrew their applications, according to the data from the quasi-judicial body whose tribunals determine refugee claims.  Montreal-based refugee lawyer Eric Taillefer said he thinks the Haitians who already made the border crossing did not understand Canadian laws on granting asylum.  They don t understand the evidence threshold, they don t understand, maybe, the definition of a refugee,  he said. The Canadian government has dispatched parliamentarians to talk to U.S. diaspora communities and dispel myths around Canada s immigration and refugee systems. Haiti-born politician Emmanuel Dubourg was in New York City this week. The high rates of abandoned claims could be because asylum seekers had trouble navigating the system and were not aware they needed to show up at a hearing, Taillefer said. Haitians are among some 17,000 asylum seekers who have walked across the border into Canada so far this year. Border crossers from other countries fared better, with 46 percent of Nigerian claims accepted, and 94 percent of Turkish people and 88 percent of Syrians approved. The stream of people crossing the border has eased since August, when there were hundreds each day, but Canadian authorities are planning for more people in the winter months.  The federal government is paying a Quebec company C$1.2 million to set up heated trailers to accommodate up to 200 people at a temporary encampment where asylum seekers have been staying while they await processing by the Canada Border Services Agency.

"Waiting for May, Brussels eyes December Brexit deal","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - When Theresa May visits Brussels on Friday, EU negotiators will be listening intently for signs the British prime minister is preparing to risk a domestic backlash and raise her offer to secure a Brexit deal in December.

I don t know what room for maneuver May has, but what we can see is a willingness to act,  one senior EU official told Reuters. Another spoke of efforts to arrange the  choreography  of a deal over the next three weeks, including a possible EU-UK  joint report  on interim accords to unlock talks on trade.  I feel the tectonic plates moving now,  a diplomat handling Brexit for an EU government said.  Time is running out and a failure in the December Council would serve nobody s purpose.  There has been only a day of top-level talks between the two lead negotiators since a mid-October summit that dismissed May s call for immediate talks on a future trade agreement.  But talks are continuing apace behind the scenes, participants say, ahead of a deadline of early December to strike a deal which can then be fully formalized by the 27 government leaders at the summit. Hopes have been raised by reports in British media that May has secured backing from pro-Brexit hardliners in her cabinet to increase the amount of a financial settlement of what Britain owes to the Union when it leaves in March 2019.   If there is a political willingness in Britain, we should be ready,  a senior EU official said, while warning that nothing was being taken for granted.  May s room for maneuver to cut a deal that would please business while irritating Britons who want a sharper break with Brussels is limited. And Germany and France, the Union s lead powers have taken a tough line so far. With German Chancellor Angela Merkel distracted at home by a search for a new coalition, May can expect little focus from her to help smooth a deal, several diplomats said, leaving it quite possible that December will not see an end to deadlock.   That would create some kind of crisis in negotiations,  the second EU official said, noting that time was already short to complete a treaty by late next year to ensure an orderly Brexit.  But maybe that is necessary.  EU negotiator Michel Barnier, who met Tusk on Wednesday to prepare Tusk s Friday meeting with May, had been expected to hold a formal round of talks with British Brexit Secretary David Davis in the week starting Dec. 4.  But EU officials say planning is all still up in the air. There could be a high-level meeting as soon as next week, possibly on Friday, Dec. 1, one said. The sides already believe they are quite close on agreeing the scope of rights for expatriate citizens in Britain and on the continent, though the EU will be particularly looking to pin Britain down to accepting its demands that any agreement be subject to enforcement through the Union s legal system. The third key criterion for moving to Phase Two, an outline agreement on how to avoid the new EU-UK land border disrupting the peace in Northern Ireland, remains a potential stumbling block. Differences of opinion between London and Dublin have been marked this month, worrying EU officials. However, it is the financial settlement that has been the most concern for the past few months and that, they believe, could be resolved by a combination of May stating clearly that Britain will pay a share after leaving of two major EU budget lines, staff pensions and agreed but undisbursed spending. British press reports, seen in Brussels as planted leaks from May s team, suggesting she might offer to pay something like 40 billion pounds ($53 billion) have encouraged EU negotiators.  While that is well short of the 60 billion euros ($71 billion) the European Commission has mentioned, that was always seen by EU officials as a maximum demand. And they are willing, they say, to help May massage the public messaging of the amount in order to limit the political flak she takes at home.  On presentational issues, Barnier is ready to help, not to call things by their real name,  an EU official said. ",worldnews,"November 22, 2017 ",1
British urged to map out post-Brexit future for lawyers,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain needs to set out plans to make sure its lawyers can keep working across Europe after Brexit, a lobby group said on Thursday. TheCityUK said Britain s withdrawal from the European Union should also not threaten the international dominance of English law and the prospects of an industry that generated 31.5 billion pounds ($42 billion) in revenue last year. The group, which lobbies for financial and legal services firms, said it was urging the government  to do everything it can to make sure Brexit does not act as a barrier to future growth opportunities but as a stimulant.   This includes the need to secure mutual market access to enable UK-based practitioners to continue to represent clients in EU jurisdictions.  The government needed to give details on how it planned to convert EU rules governing the industry into domestic law, and the process for signing up to international conventions. Legal services make up 1.5 percent of the UK economy and employ more than 311,000 people, TheCityUK said in a report on the industry.  More than 200 foreign law firms have set up shop in London and English law is used in 40 percent of global corporate arbitrations, it added.  The choice of English law for global commercial contracts is in part driven by the UK s reputation as the leading center for international dispute resolution,  the report said.  But others are waiting in the wings. The German Federal State of Hesse promoted a conference earlier this year that looked at how Brexit provided an opportunity for Frankfurt to become a new litigation hub in Europe.

Kremlin pledges to stand up for Russian billionaire arrested in France,"MOSCOW/PARIS (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Wednesday it will spare no effort to defend the rights of Suleiman Kerimov, a Russian businessman and lawmaker who was arrested in the French Riviera resort of Nice in connection with a French tax evasion case. Shares in Polyus, Russia s biggest gold producer which is controlled by Kerimov s family, were down on the news of his detention.  The 51-year-old billionaire would be presented to a judge with a view to formally placing him under judicial investigation, a French public prosecutor said in Nice on Wednesday. Under France s legal system, being formally placed under investigation often, but not always, leads to a person being sent to trial.   We will do everything in our power to protect his lawful interests,  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a conference call with reporters.  Intensive work is now being undertaken by the foreign ministry.      A representative for Kerimov in the upper house of parliament, where he sits as a lawmaker, declined to comment on the case on Wednesday when contacted by Reuters. Polyus declined to comment. Russia s state-run Rossiya 24 TV station, citing an unnamed source, reported that Kerimov had denied any guilt. In the lower house of parliament, lawmaker Rizvan Kurbanov asked the Russian foreign ministry to make representations on Kerimov s behalf with the French authorities.  We have still not received from the French authorities any explanation of the reasons for the detention of our colleague,  Kurbanov told parliament.  All this testifies to an unprecedented demarche by the French,  he said, adding that he hoped the Russian foreign ministry would issue a formal protest. Shares in Polyus were down by more than 3 percent in early trade in Moscow but since then recovered some ground to trade at minus 2.3 percent by 1342 GMT. Originally from the mainly Muslim Russian region of Dagestan, Kerimov built his multi-billion natural resources business through a combination of debt, an appetite for risk, and political connections. He owned top flight soccer club Anzhi Makhachkala until he sold it in 2016. Kerimov s fortune peaked at $17.5 billion in 2008 before slumping to just $3 billion in 2009, according to Forbes magazine, due to so-called margin-calls on his assets triggered by the 2008 global financial crisis. In March this year, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree giving Kerimov the state award  For Services to the Fatherland, second class  for his contribution to Russian parliamentary life. French police arrested Kerimov at Nice airport on Monday evening. A French judicial source said the investigation centered on the purchase of several luxury residences on the French Riviera via shell companies, something that would have enabled Kerimov to reduce taxes owed to the French state.

Russian billionaire under investigation in France,"NICE/MOSCOW (Reuters) - A French judge put Russian businessman and lawmaker Suleiman Kerimov, whose interests the Kremlin has pledged to defend, under formal investigation on Wednesday after his arrest linked to a French tax evasion case, the prosecutor said. The investigation, a step that often but not always leads to a trial in the French legal system, was opened on suspicion of aggravated laundering of tax fraud proceeds, a crime that carries a prison sentence of up to 10 years. The judge decided that Kerimov could be released from detention but had to turn in his passport and could not leave the Alpes-Maritime county Nice is in. He was also ordered to post a bail of five million euros ($5.9 million) and to check in with police several times per week. The Kremlin said earlier that it would spare no effort to defend the rights of Kerimov, a 51-year-old billionaire who was arrested Monday night in the French Riviera resort city of Nice. Shares in Polyus, Russia s biggest gold producer which is controlled by Kerimov s family, fell on the news of his detention.  We will do everything in our power to protect his lawful interests,  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a conference call with reporters.  Intensive work is now being undertaken by the foreign ministry.  The prosecution requested that Kerimov be kept in custody and a decision by a judge was expected soon. A second person was also put under formal investigation. A representative for Kerimov in the upper house of Russia s parliament, where he sits as a lawmaker, declined to comment on the case on Wednesday when contacted by Reuters. Polyus also declined to comment. Russia s state-run Rossiya 24 TV station, citing an unnamed source, reported that Kerimov had denied any guilt. It was not immediately clear if a lawyer had been hired to represent Kerimov in France. In the lower house of parliament, lawmaker Rizvan Kurbanov asked the Russian foreign ministry to make representations on Kerimov s behalf with the French authorities.  We have still not received from the French authorities any explanation of the reasons for the detention of our colleague,  Kurbanov told parliament.  All this testifies to an unprecedented demarche by the French,  he said, adding that he hoped the Russian foreign ministry would issue a formal protest. Shares in Polyus fell more than 3 percent in early trade in Moscow on Wednesday but then recovered some ground to close down 1.25 percent.

Missing Argentine submarine highlights years of military underfunding,"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - The search for an Argentine submarine missing in the South Atlantic for more than a week has highlighted the dwindling resources and lack of training faced by the armed forces since the end of a military dictatorship in the early 1980s.  As South America s second-largest economy has lurched from one crisis to the next in recent decades, military funding has not been a priority for cash-strapped governments, and an incident like the disappearance of the ARA San Juan was a problem in the making, military and political analysts said.    Human rights violations perpetrated by the dictatorship broke the bond between society and the armed forces,  said Andrei Serbin Pont, research director at the CRIES think tank in Buenos Aires. He said a rethinking of the military s role in society was long overdue.   The majority of Argentines don t really care about the armed forces, therefore politicians aren t particularly interested in maintaining any sort of military policy or defense policy,  he said. Since the loss of the Falklands War to Britain in 1982 and the fall of the dictatorship the following year, military spending has fallen from 2.16 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) to a low of 0.87 percent in 2011, according to World Bank data.  While it inched up to 0.96 percent of GDP last year, spending remains well behind neighboring Brazil and Chile, which spent 1.3 percent and 1.9 percent of GDP on their militaries, respectively, the data show. It is too early to determine the cause of the disappearance of the ARA San Juan, and an intense search and rescue effort continued on Wednesday. But Argentina s submarine fleet has been among the areas of the military most plagued by a lack of funds.  In 2014, the fleet spent a total of just 19 hours submerged, versus the 190 days needed  for the fulfillment of operational and training needs,  according to a May 2016 report by specialist publication Jane s Sentinel.   The fact that you had so little use of the submarines was an indication that clearly they were a problem waiting to happen,  said Evan Ellis, a research professor focusing on Latin America at the U.S. Army War College Strategic Studies Institute. President Mauricio Macri pledged to improve the 26,000-strong armed forces  capabilities during his campaign in 2015. His administration s 2016  State of the State  report noted that 70 percent of the Defense Ministry s budget was spent on wages and pensions, rather than investment.  The conditions in which they work are practically impossible. I m talking about all the armed forces,  Elisa Carrio, a key member of Macri s Let s Change coalition, said in a recent television interview.  But since taking office in December 2015, Macri has not markedly improved the financing situation. The 2018 budget calls for a 14 percent increase in funding for the Defense Ministry, below inflation expected at 15.7 percent. In March, then-Defense Minister Julio Martinez told Reuters Argentina lacked money to buy aircraft or replace an aging fleet. The German-built ARA San Juan was launched in 1983 and underwent a local upgrade beginning in 2008 which included the replacement of its four diesel engines and its electric propeller engines, according to Jane s Sentinel. Shortly before giving its last location on Nov. 15, the submarine reported an electrical outage. Concerns about the state of the vessel surfaced when video was published by newspaper Perfil of a tense meeting between Macri and relatives of some of the 44 crew members.  Does someone have to die for things to change? Could you not have invested in this before?  one sailor s wife was recorded telling Macri. Macri said the ship s level of maintenance, not its age, was what mattered, and that authorities were convinced the submarine was in good condition. Argentine news media have reported that the search has sparked friction between the navy and the defense ministry, with civilian authorities concerned that the military has not been forthcoming with information. Navy officials have denied this. A ministry source, who was not authorized to speak publicly,  told Reuters the ministry has opened an investigation into the incident and has not ruled out criminal charges once the search operation is complete.

Russia-hosted summit could be decisive for Syria peace: Erdogan,"SOCHI, Russia (Reuters) - A three-way summit on Wednesday between the leaders of Russia, Iran and Turkey could produce decisive steps toward ending the bloodshed in Syria, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said at the start of their talks. The summit, hosted by Russian President Vladimir Putin, is a rare occasion bringing together the leaders of Russia and Iran   who back Syria s President Bashar al-Assad   around a table with Erdogan, who has supported Assad s opponents. In opening remarks at the summit in the southern Russian resort of Sochi, Putin, Erdogan and Iran s President Hassan Rouhani spoke of an opening for peace in Syria now that Islamic State has been pushed out of its last major stronghold there.  The point we have reached is important, but not enough,  Erdogan told the gathering, also attended by military commanders and foreign ministers from the three countries.  It is critical for all parties to contribute to a permanent and acceptable political solution for the people of Syria,  he said.  This summit is aimed at results, I believe critical decisions will be taken.  As a prelude to the summit, Putin earlier this week hosted Assad at his residence in Sochi. It was the only time the Syrian leader is known to have left Syria since his last visit to Russia, two years ago. Putin also made telephone calls in the past 24 hours to other leaders with influence in Syria, including U.S. President Donald Trump and Saudi Arabia s King Salman, as part of Moscow s drive to build an international consensus over a peace deal to end the six-year conflict.  We can say with certainty that we have reached a new stage, opening up the possibility to launch a real political process towards a peace deal,  Putin told the gathering.  Compromises and concessions will be needed on all sides ... including (from) the Syrian government,  Putin said. He said the focus of peace efforts should be the convocation of a congress bringing together all of Syria s ethnic groups. Russia has offered to host such a congress in Sochi, but attempts to agree a date have so far foundered, in part because Turkey raised objections to the presence of some Kurdish groups. Iran s Rouhani used his remarks at the summit to rail against the presence of foreign forces in Syria, an apparent reference to the United States and Tehran s arch regional rival Saudi Arabia, which alongside Turkey have backed Assad s foes.  There is no excuse for the presence of foreign troops in Syria without the approval of its legitimate government,  Rouhani said.  The Syrian nation will not allow any interference of foreigners in their state affairs and will confront any move that harms Syria s integrity, independence and unity,  he said. Iran s military is also present in Syria, alongside Russian troops and Hezbollah, the pro-Iran Lebanese militia. They say that does not amount to foreign interference because they are in Syria at Assad s invitation.      ",worldnews,"November 22, 2017 ",1
"Arab states blacklist Islamist groups, individuals in Qatar boycott","DUBAI (Reuters) - The four Arab countries boycotting Qatar added 11 more individuals and two other entities, including a major group of Islamist scholars, to their  terrorist  blacklists for the Gulf state, Saudi state news agency SPA reported on Thursday. The lists now include the Qatar-based International Union of Muslim Scholars (IUMS) which was formed in 2004 mostly by clerics belonging to the Muslim Brotherhood and is chaired by the influential Sheikh Youssef al-Qaradawi.  A statement issued by Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain said they also blacklisted the International Islamic Council (IIC).   The two entities listed are two terrorist organizations that promote terrorism by using Islamic rhetoric as a cover to facilitate terrorist activities,  the statement said. The move deepened the rift between the four countries and Qatar, the world s top gas exporter and host to the biggest U.S. military base in the Middle East. The countries cut ties with Qatar in June, accusing it of financing militants in Syria and allying with Iran, their regional foe. The Saudi-led quartet also added 11 individuals to their lists, including the acting Brotherhood leader Mahmoud Ezzat Ibrahim. The Muslim Brotherhood movement led the Arab Spring protests in 2011 that toppled some autocrats in the Middle East and North Africa. The Gulf States  rulers see the group, whose political ideology challenges the principle of dynastic rule, as a security threat. The IUMS membership includes the Saudi cleric Salman al-Awdah, who was arrested by Saudi authorities in September, the Tunisian Rached Ghannouchi, head of the Ennahda party, and Moroccan scholar Ahmed Raissouni. Mediation efforts of the Qatar crisis led by Kuwait and shuttle diplomacy by Western officials, including U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, have failed to end what has become the worst rift between Gulf Arab states in years.

U.S. pressed Saudis to ease Yemen blockade: sources,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson asked Saudi Arabia to ease its blockade of Yemen, two sources said, just days before the Saudi-led military coalition announced on Wednesday it would let aid flow through the Yemeni port of Hodeidah and allow U.N. flights to the capital.  It was not clear if pressure from Washington was the direct cause of the Saudi change of heart but the request from Tillerson to Saudi Arabia s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, was one of several U.S. attempts this month to have Riyadh soften its hawkish foreign policy.  Tillerson asked for a loosening of the blockade on Yemen during a roughly 45-minute phone call at the beginning of this week, according to a source familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity. R.C. Hammond, a top adviser to Tillerson, confirmed the exchange with Prince Mohammed. The secretary of state  has brought the request to (the) Saudis  attention several times over the past months,  he added.      The Trump administration, according to U.S. officials and a European diplomat, also pressed the Saudis to allow Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri to return to Beirut after he flew to Riyadh on Nov.4 and abruptly announced his resignation. The efforts to take the edge off Saudi Arabia s foreign policy reflect growing U.S. concern about Riyadh s direction despite high-profile attempts by President Donald Trump to improve relations with the longtime U.S. ally.              Publicly, Trump, his top aides and senior Saudi officials have hailed what they say is a major improvement in U.S.-Saudi ties compared with relations under former President Barack Obama, who upset the Saudis by sealing a nuclear deal with their arch-foe Iran. Privately, however, U.S. diplomats and intelligence analysts   express growing dismay over Riyadh s foreign policy, especially toward Yemen and Lebanon, as Saudi Arabia aims to contain Iranian influence.      It is my understanding that the administration is frustrated. There has been of course varying degrees of frustration from different members of the administration,  U.S. Senator Todd Young said of the situation in Yemen.  Young, a Republican member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, spoke before the Saudi-led military coalition s decision was announced on Wednesday.         The coalition, which is fighting Houthi rebels, said it would allow humanitarian aid access through Hodeidah and U. N. flights to the capital Sanaa, more than two weeks after blockading the country to stop the flow of arms from Iran. Yemen, in civil war and under bombardment by a Saudi-led coalition, faces a deep humanitarian crisis and aid workers warn of famine if the blockade were not lifted.                   A senior Saudi official told Reuters that even before Tillerson and Prince Mohammed spoke recently, senior White House officials had communicated to the Saudi ambassador in Washington the importance of taking those two steps.  They stressed the importance of addressing the humanitarian situation in Yemen and we said that we understood and that the closures were temporary while we work on a comprehensive aid and access plan,  the official said. An administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that White House and National Security Council officials worked on easing the blockade with senior Saudi officials, including Prince Mohammed and his younger brother Khalid, the Saudi ambassador to the United States.    Much of the U.S.-Saudi relationship, multiple U.S. officials say, is conducted in a tight circle and led by Trump s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, who has established a direct channel with Prince Mohammed. Kushner  did not oppose  the pressure on the Saudis and United Arab Emirates to ease humanitarian suffering in Yemen, said one U.S. official. But the official added:  In no way does this change the position that Jared and the Crown Prince evidently share that the main objective is reversing Iranian influence in Yemen and elsewhere.         On Lebanon, the U.S. message to Saudi Arabia about Hariri was conveyed in statements by Tillerson and in private conversations between U.S. and Saudi officials. Those officials included the Saudi state minister for Gulf affairs, Thamer al-Sabhan, who was in Washington recently, a senior administration official said.  We ve encouraged...the Saudis that it will be good for Lebanon s political stability for Hariri to return back to Beirut as soon as is practical,  the official said last week.     Hariri has since returned to Lebanon and shelved his decision to resign as prime minister, easing a crisis that had deepened tensions in the Middle East. Top Lebanese officials have said Saudi Arabia forced Hariri to quit and held him in the kingdom. Riyadh and Hariri deny this. ",worldnews,"November 22, 2017 ",1
Palestinian factions agree to hold general election by end-2018,"GAZA/CAIRO (Reuters) - Palestinian factions, including rival groups Hamas and Fatah, have agreed to hold a general election by the end of 2018, a joint statement by several groups said on Wednesday following talks in Cairo. Hamas and Fatah signed a reconciliation deal in October in Cairo-backed talks after Hamas agreed to hand over administrative control of Gaza, including the key Rafah border crossing, a decade after seizing the enclave in a civil war. The Palestinian groups in Cairo said they would defer the choice of a final date for the general election to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. The Western-backed mainstream Fatah party lost control of Gaza to Hamas, considered a terrorist group by many in the West and by Israel, in fighting in 2007. But last month Hamas agreed to cede powers in Gaza to Abbas  Fatah-backed government in a deal mediated by Egypt. Salah Al-Bardaweel, a Hamas official involved in the talks, called Wednesday s agreement  vague  and expressed concern that it was unable to progress on key issues such as lifting sanctions imposed by Abbas and secure full opening of the crossing between Gaza and Egypt.  The talks also failed to address security responsibilities in Gaza, which have so far remained in the hands of Hamas-backed security services. Abbas has said previously that upon assuming control of Gaza he would move to lift sanctions imposed on the impoverished enclave that have included power cuts and salary reductions of 30 percent to some 60,000 Gazans employed by his Palestinian Authority.  We worked hard to reach practical results ... such as opening crossings and lifting the sanctions and advancing the issue of reconciliation but unfortunately it did not happen,  said Bardaweel. Azzam Al-Ahmed, head of Fatah s delegation to the Cairo talks, said his group insisted Hamas completes full handover of Gaza control to the government by Dec 1. He added that another meeting with Hamas will be held later in December to evaluate further reconciliation steps.  Palestinian officials said Egypt is expected to send a security delegation to Gaza in the coming days to oversee the implementation of the agreement. ",worldnews,"November 22, 2017 ",1
"Lebanon's PM Hariri shelves resignation, easing crisis","BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon s Saad al-Hariri on Wednesday shelved his decision to resign as prime minister at the request of President Michel Aoun, easing a crisis that had deepened tensions in the Middle East. Hariri made his announcement after returning to Beirut for the first time since he quit abruptly on Nov. 4 in a broadcast from Saudi Arabia. Top Lebanese officials have said Riyadh forced him to quit and held him in the kingdom. Riyadh and Hariri deny this. At the presidential palace near Beirut, Hariri said he hoped his move would lead to  a responsible dialogue...that deals with divisive issues and their repercussions on Lebanon s relations with Arab brothers.  Hariri said all Lebanese sides must commit to keeping the country out of regional conflicts, a reference to the Iran-backed Hezbollah political and military movement. Hezbollah s regional military role has greatly alarmed Saudi Arabia, Hariri s long-time ally.  I presented today my resignation to President Aoun and he urged me to wait before offering it and to hold onto it for more dialogue about its reasons and political background, and I showed responsiveness,  he said in a televised statement. The resignation had shocked even Hariri s aides. He returned to Lebanon late on Tuesday night after French intervention. Aoun, a political ally of Hezbollah, had refused to accept the resignation because it happened in  mysterious circumstances  abroad. He had called Hariri a hostage in Riyadh. Hariri appeared to express relief that Aoun had not accepted the resignation right away. He thanked Aoun on Wednesday for respecting constitutional norms and  his rejection of departing from them under any circumstances .    The resignation pitched Lebanon to the forefront of the regional rivalry between Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia and Shi ite Islamist Iran, which backs Lebanon s Hezbollah, and raised concerns of a protracted crisis. In his resignation speech, Hariri had cited fear of assassination, and attacked Iran along with Hezbollah for sowing strife in the Arab world. Hundreds of Hariri supporters packed the streets near his house in central Beirut, waving the blue flag of his Future Movement political party. The Sunni leader told them he would  stay with (them)... to be a line of defense for Lebanon, Lebanon s stability and Lebanon s Arabism .  His presence in the country alone brings stability,  said Manar Akoum, 26, as she stood with the celebrating crowd. Hariri s resignation was followed by a steep escalation in Saudi statements against the Lebanese government, which includes Shi ite Hezbollah. Riyadh said the government as a whole - not just Hezbollah - had declared war against it. Western governments including the United States struck a different tone, affirming their support for Hariri and the stability of Lebanon, which hosts 1.5 million Syrian refugees - nearly one-in-four of the population. Ahead of his return to Beirut, Hariri had stressed the importance of the Lebanese state policy of staying out of regional conflicts, notably Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition is battling Iran-backed Houthi fighters. Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, who had also called for Hariri s return, said on Monday his group was open to  any dialogue and any discussion . Nasrallah also issued his clearest denial yet of any Hezbollah role in Yemen. A senior source in a political alliance that includes Hezbollah said Hariri s move on Wednesday would start a breakthrough in the crisis.  This step is not detached from the framework of a complete solution whose features will appear in the coming days,  the source told Reuters. Lebanese dollar bonds, which had fallen in response to Hariri s resignation, gained following Wednesday s announcement. A government minister from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a close ally of Saudi Arabia, said Lebanon must implement its policy of keeping out of Middle East conflicts in order to get out of its own crisis as well as regional troubles.   The main problem facing that is the selective implementation of (this) principle and the functional Iranian role of Hezbollah outside the Lebanese framework,  Anwar Gargash, UAE minister of state for foreign affairs, wrote on Twitter. Cyprus, where Hariri had briefly stopped on his journey home, said it would attempt to help defuse the crisis.  Our common objective is stability in Lebanon, stability in our area. Within this context... the President of the Republic will undertake some initiatives precisely to promote this objective; stability in Lebanon,  Cypriot government spokesman Nikos Christodoulides said.     Hariri took office last year in a power-sharing deal that made Aoun head of state. He arrived in Beirut in time for independence day celebrations on Wednesday morning, taking the premier s seat alongside Aoun and Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri.  Hariri said he looked forward to  real partnership with all the political powers, in placing Lebanon s interests high above any other interests  and preserving coexistence among Lebanese.

U.S. calls Myanmar moves against Rohingya 'ethnic cleansing',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday called the Myanmar military operation against the Rohingya population  ethnic cleansing  and  threatened targeted sanctions against those responsible for what it called  horrendous atrocities.   The situation in northern Rakhine state constitutes ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya,  U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in a statement, using a term he avoided when visiting Myanmar, also known as Burma, last week.  The United States will also pursue accountability through U.S. law, including possible targeted sanctions  against those responsible for the alleged abuses, which have driven hundreds of thousands of Rohingya into neighboring Bangladesh, he said. The United States shifted its stance in part to raise pressure on Myanmar s military and civilian leaders, who have shared power for the past two years under an uneasy arrangement after decades of military rule, to address the crisis. Rights monitors accused Myanmar s military of atrocities, including killings, mass rape and arson, against the stateless Rohingya during so-called clearance operations after Rohingya militants  Aug. 25 attacks on 30 police posts and an army base. More than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled Rakhine state in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, mostly to neighboring Bangladesh, since the crackdown, which followed the insurgent attacks.      These abuses by some among the Burmese military, security forces, and local vigilantes have caused tremendous suffering and forced hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children to flee their homes,  Tillerson said. While repeating U.S. condemnation of the insurgent attacks, he added:  No provocation can justify the horrendous atrocities that have ensued.  Myanmar s 2-year-old government, led by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, has faced heavy international criticism for its response to the crisis, though it has no control over the generals with whom it shares power.  It s not a situation that is completely under her authority, but certainly we are counting on her to show leadership and also to work through the civilian government with the military to address the crisis,  a senior U.S. official told reporters in a conference call. The term  ethnic cleansing  is not defined in international or U.S. law and does not inherently carry specific consequences, a second senior U.S. official said on the call. Murray Hiebert, a Southeast Asia analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington, said the State Department s use of the term and threat of sanctions  will likely have limited to no impact on the ground.   It is likely to create more distrust between the United States and Myanmar s military and government and push them closer to China, Russia, and its more authoritarian neighbors in Southeast Asia,  he added.  The U.S. move came the same day as a U.N. tribunal convicted former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic of genocide and crimes against humanity for massacres of Bosnian Muslims and ethnic cleansing campaigns, and imprisoned him for life. The second U.S. official said Washington was analyzing whether genocide or crimes against humanity had occurred in Myanmar, which would violate international law, but has made no determination on either and that this would take time to assess.  In the end it s a court that has to decide that, as we ve just seen with the verdict against Mladic,  he said. A top U.N. official in September described the military actions as a textbook case of  ethnic cleansing,  but the United States until Wednesday had avoided the term.  Washington has sought to balance its wish to nurture the civilian government in Myanmar, where it competes for influence with China, with its desire to hold the military accountable for the abuses. U.S. officials also worry that the mistreatment of the Rohingya Muslim minority may fuel radicalism. The first U.S. official said Washington would work with Bangladesh and Myanmar to encourage the voluntary repatriation of Rohingya.  We have focused on the issue of voluntary returns,  the official said.  We don t want people to be forced to return to a situation in which they feel uncomfortable.   Congressional pressure for a tougher U.S. response to the Rohingya crisis mounted before President Donald Trump s first visit to Asia this month to attend a summit of Southeast Asian countries, including Myanmar, in Manila. U.S. government sources told Reuters in October that officials were preparing a recommendation for Tillerson that would define the military-led campaign against the Rohingya as ethnic cleansing, which could spur new sanctions. In early November, U.S. lawmakers proposed targeted sanctions and travel restrictions on Myanmar military officials. Rights group Amnesty International called for a comprehensive arms embargo against Myanmar as well as targeted financial sanctions against senior Myanmar military officials.

"Facing graft probe, Pakistan Finance Minister relieved of duties","ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan s Finance Minister Ishaq Dar has been relieved of his duties, local media said on Wednesday, following speculation about his future after he failed to appear in court to answer corruption charges. Documents seen by Reuters show Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi granted Dar sick leave on Wednesday, while local TV channels Geo and Samaa said he had been relieved of his portfolio. Dar would keep his status as a minister for the time being, Geo reported. Dar, who is receiving medical treatment in London for a heart condition, has an arrest warrant issued against him after he missed multiple court appearances on charges that he had amassed wealth beyond his known sources of income.  The case had, along with Pakistan s worsening economic outlook, led to mounting calls for him to resign. The country is battling to stave off balance of payments pressures due to a dwindling foreign currency reserve and a widening current account deficit. A spokesman for the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz could not immediately be reached for comment, nor could Dar. He has missed more than three weeks of court hearings conducted by the anti-graft agency, the National Accountability Bureau.  Dar s absence had come at an awkward time for Pakistan, which has been trying to woo international investors as it looks to raise in excess of $1 billion on debt markets through a Sukuk and a Eurobond in coming months.

Italian magistrates investigate whether ex-Treasury official sold secrets,"ROME (Reuters) - Italian magistrates are investigating whether a Treasury official sold confidential government information to her previous employers, Ernst & Young, two judicial sources involved in the case said on Wednesday. Magistrates suspect that Susanna Masi was paid some 220,000 euros ( 195,290.33) between 2013-2015 in return for sensitive material, including on planned tax reforms which could have given the professional services firm an unfair advantage over its rivals, the sources said. Masi s lawyer, Giorgio Perroni, confirmed his client was being investigated but denied she had done anything wrong. Neither Ernst & Young s Italian office, nor lawyers representing the company, responded to requests for comment. The judicial sources told Reuters that magistrates had emails and wiretaps to back up their case. Perroni said he was still waiting to see the case files after which his client would request to meet the investigators.  We are certain that we will be able to demonstrate the correct behaviour of my client and the total lack of foundation of the accusations,  Perroni told Reuters. Masi joined the Treasury in 2012, becoming a tax adviser for the government in 2013. In 2015, she was appointed to the board of Equitalia   a state-owned tax collection agency   while retaining her position within the Treasury, her lawyer said. Corriere della Sera newspaper, which first reported the story on Wednesday, said besides leaking confidential information, Masi was also suspected of lobbying on behalf of Ernst & Young for modifications to the tax code. Corriere said Masi worked for Ernst & Young before joining the Treasury. Perroni confirmed she used to work for the company in Italy, but did not know the exact dates. The Treasury declined to comment on the case.  ",worldnews,"November 22, 2017 ",1
"Besieged Syrians eating trash, fainting from hunger: U.N. survey","GENEVA (Reuters) - Syrians in the besieged enclave of Eastern Ghouta are so short of food that they are eating trash, fainting from hunger and forcing their children to eat on alternate days, the U.N. World Food Programme said in a report on Wednesday. Since September, approximately 174,500 people in the town of Douma in the besieged zone have been forced to adopt emergency  coping strategies , the WFP report said.   This includes consuming expired food, animal fodder and refuse, spending days without eating, begging and engaging in high risk activities to get food. Moreover, many hunger-induced fainting episodes have been reported among school children and teachers.   At least four people have died from hunger, including a child in Douma who took his own life due to hunger, said the report, which was based on a mobile phone survey and information from contacts on the ground. Forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad have besieged rebel-held Eastern Ghouta since 2012 and Douma has not had a food aid convoy since receiving wheat flour rations in August. Although the area is traditionally agricultural, arable land on the outskirts of Eastern Ghouta is either on the frontline of the conflict or targeted by snipers, the report said.  Last week fighting destroyed recently distributed rations in a storehouse, exacerbating shortages. Although Damascus is only 15 km (10 miles) away, 700-grams (25 ounces) of bread is 85 times more expensive in Eastern Ghouta, the report said.   The situation is anticipated to deteriorate further in the coming weeks when food stock is expected to be totally depleted and household coping strategies will be highly eroded as a result.  Government restrictions meant WFP could only provide a fraction of the food needed. Family food baskets were being shared among six families and were reportedly the only source of food for many female-headed and destitute households, it said.   Some households are even resorting to rotation strategies whereby the children who ate yesterday would not eat today and vice-versa.  The report quoted a female head of household in Douma as saying she was forced to rotate rations between her 13-year-old daughter and her two- and three-year-old orphaned grandchildren.  My daughter cries every time I lock her door cause she knows today is not her turn and will sleep with an empty stomach,  she said.    ",worldnews,"November 22, 2017 ",1
"Ex-Bosnian Serb commander Mladic convicted of genocide, gets life in prison","THE HAGUE (Reuters) - A U.N. tribunal on Wednesday convicted ex-Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic of genocide and crimes against humanity for massacres of Bosnian Muslims and ethnic cleansing campaigns to forge a  Greater Serbia , and jailed him for life. Mladic was hustled out of the court minutes before the verdict for angrily shouting,  This is all lies, you are all liars!  The outburst occurred after Mladic returned to the courtroom from what his lawyers described as a visit to the bathroom, then a blood pressure test which held up proceedings. The U.N. Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) found Mladic guilty of 10 of 11 charges, including the slaughter of 8,000 Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica and the 43-month siege of the Bosnian capital Sarajevo, in which more than 10,000 civilians were killed by shelling, mortar and sniper fire. The killings in Srebrenica of men and boys after they were separated from women and taken away in buses or marched off to be shot amounted to Europe s worst atrocity since World War Two.   The crimes committed rank among the most heinous known to humankind, and include genocide and extermination as a crime against humanity,  Presiding Judge Alphons Orie said in reading out a summary of the judgment.  Many of these men and boys were cursed, insulted, threatened, forced to sing Serb songs and beaten while awaiting their execution,  he said. Mladic had pleaded not guilty to all charges. His legal team said he would appeal against the verdict. Called the  Butcher of Bosnia  by survivors of his actions, Mladic was the most notorious of 163 ICTY indictees together with Radovan Karadzic, the former Bosnian Serb nationalist leader and political mastermind of ethnic cleansing, and their patron, then-Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. The tribunal found Mladic  significantly contributed  to genocide committed in Srebrenica with the goal of destroying its Muslim population,  personally directed  the bombardment of Sarajevo and was part of a  joint criminal enterprise  aimed at purging Bosnian Muslims and Catholic Croats from Bosnia.  Prosecutors said the ultimate agenda of Mladic, Karadzic and Milosevic was what came to be known worldwide as ethnic cleansing, to carve out an Orthodox  Greater Serbia  in the ashes of multinational federal Yugoslavia. ICTY Chief Prosecutor Serge Brammertz called the verdict  a milestone  in holding Mladic accountable not just for massacres but the detention of tens of thousands of non-Serbs in camps where many were beaten and raped, and the forced displacement of over one million to remake Bosnia s demographic map. The Mladic case is the last major decision by the ICTY, which plans to close its doors soon after sentencing 83 Balkan war criminals since opening in 1993. In Geneva, U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra ad al-Hussein called Mladic the  epitome of evil  and said his conviction after 16 years as an indicted fugitive and five years of trial was a  momentous victory for justice .   Today s verdict is a warning to the perpetrators of such crimes that they will not escape justice, no matter how powerful they may be nor how long it may take,  Zeid said in a statement.  RESPECT THE VICTIMS, LOOK TO THE FUTURE  -SERBIA President Aleksandar Vucic of Serbia, whose 1990s strongman leader Milosevic died in a tribunal prison in 2006 before the end of his genocide trial, said Serbia  respects the victims .   I would like to call on everyone (in the region) to start looking into the future and not to drown in tears of the past... We need to look to the future...so we finally have a stable country,  Vucic told reporters when asked about the verdict. Serbia, once the most powerful Yugoslav republic, is now democratic and seeking ties to the European Union. Bosnian Prime Minister Denis Zvizdic said he hoped that  those who still call for new divisions and conflicts will carefully read the verdict rendered today ...in case that they are still no ready to face their past . He was alluding to enduring separatism in post-war federal Bosnia s autonomous Serb region. Srebrenica, near Bosnia s eastern border with Serbia, had been designated a  safe area  by the United Nations and was defended by lightly armed U.N. peacekeepers. But they quickly surrendered when Mladic s forces stormed it on July 11, 1995. A bronzed and beefy Mladic was filmed visiting a refugee camp in Srebrenica on July 12.  He was giving away chocolate and sweets to the children while the cameras were rolling, telling us nothing will happen and that we have no reason to be afraid,  recalled Munira Subasic of the Mothers of Srebrenica group. Serbian TV footage showed Mladic approaching a blond boy in a friendly way and asking him his name and how old he was, then turning to fearful Muslim women and children and assuring them:  All who would like to stay can stay. Just take it easy.   Subasic said:  After the cameras left he gave an order to kill whoever could be killed, rape whoever could be raped and finally he ordered us all to be banished and chased out of Srebrenica, so he could make an  ethnically clean  town.  Dutch peacekeepers looked on helplessly as Bosnian Serb officers separated men and boys from women, then sent them out of sight on buses or marched them away to be shot. The remains of Subasic s son and husband were both found in mass graves by International Commission of Missing Persons (ICMP) workers. The ICMP have identified some 6,900 remains of Srebrenica victims through DNA analysis. The siege of Sarajevo terrorised its people. It involved both heavy shelling that sometimes slaughtered residents queueing outside for scarce supplies, and random sniper fire that picked off people who dared to venture into the streets, or even as they stood indoors by exposed windows. In May 1992, as artillery barrages from surrounding hillsides were setting Sarajevo ablaze, Bosnian intelligence intercepted a Mladic phone call in which he was giving orders about targets:  Fire on the parliament, presidency, the Old Town. Fire so that they cannot sleep, burn their brains!  That phone call was entered as evidence in his trial. Mladic is still seen as a national hero by some compatriots for the swift capture of much of Bosnia after its Serbs rose up against an early 1992 referendum vote by Muslims and Croats for independence from Serbian-dominated Yugoslavia.  His lawyers will argue in their appeal that Bosnian Serbs were  victims  of the referendum and fought in  self-defence . Mladic s lawyers contended that Sarajevo was a legitimate military target as it was the main bastion of Muslim-led Bosnian government forces. They also asserted that Mladic left Srebrenica shortly before Serb fighters began executing Muslim detainees and was later shocked to find out they had occurred. But Wednesday s verdict was never much in doubt, given the mountain of evidence of Serb atrocities produced at previous trials. Four of Mladic s subordinates received life sentences. Karadzic, 72, was convicted of genocide in 2016 and sentenced to 40 years. He is appealing. Mladic was indicted along with Karadzic in 1995, shortly after the Srebrenica killings. But he evaded capture until 2011, three years after a heavily disguised Karadzic was arrested. Mladic s trial in The Hague took five years in part because of delays due to his poor health. He has suffered several strokes, but the ICTY rejected a flurry of last-minute attempts by his lawyers to put off the verdict on medical grounds. The ICTY indicted 161 people in all from Bosnia, Croatia, Serbia, Montenegro and Kosovo. Of the 83 convicted, more than 60 of them were ethnic Serbs.  ",worldnews,"November 21, 2017 ",1
Srebrenica survivors: No punishment enough for Mladic despite conviction,"SREBRENICA, Bosnia (Reuters) - Bosnian Muslims who lost loved ones in the 1995 Srebrenica massacre said on Wednesday that no punishment was enough for Ratko Mladic, the ex-Bosnian Serb wartime commander jailed for life for genocide.  Mladic, dubbed the  Butcher of Bosnia , was convicted by a U.N. tribunal on 10 counts of war crimes including the siege of Sarajevo in which over 10,000 civilians died from shelling and sniper attacks, and the expulsion of hundred of thousands of non-Serbs during the 1992-95 conflict.  Can there ever be adequate punishment for someone who committed so many crimes? It would be too many even for 300 years, let alone three days,  said Vasva Smajlovic, 74, referring to the Srebrenica slaughter in July 1995. Her husband, son-in-law and other relatives were among the 8,000 Muslim men and boys taken away and shot dead execution-style after Mladic assured U.N. peacekeepers and local residents that no harm would befall them after his forces seized the town.  I try to count my dead all the time. I count to 50 and then I m not able to count anymore,  Smajlovic said tearfully while watching a live telecast of the Mladic verdict.  No words can describe how I feel. I am angry. All this comes too late.   Her sister-in-law felt, however, justice was served with Mladic s conviction, even if it came 22 years after the war.  Nothing can compensate for our pain but it is important that justice is done,  said Bida Smajlovic, who last saw her husband when he tried to flee Srebrenica through woods in July 1995. His remains were later found in a mass grave. On July 11, 1995, Mladic s ultra-nationalist forces separated men and boys from women and took them away in buses or on foot to be shot within days. It was Europe s worst single atrocity since World War Two. Wednesday s verdict, the last major case before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) after 24 years of work, stirred tension in a region still scarred by the 1990s Balkans conflagration.  Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik, who frequently threatens the secession of the Serb region from Bosnia, said the tribunal s judgment of Mladic only proved its bias against the Serbs. But Bakir Izetbegovic, the Muslim Bosniak member of Bosnia s tripartite presidency, said:  No people, including Serbs, should call Mladic a hero, ..., glorify criminals and decorate war criminals.    I hope this verdict will bring about such kind of sobering in Bosnia.  The opinions underscored the stillborn reconciliation process in the federal state, now divided into an autonomous Serb Republic and Muslim-Croat federation.   Placards with a portrait of the once beefy and brash Mladic bearing a slogan  You Are Our Hero  plastered the sides of buildings in Srebrenica, now a largely ethnic Serb town, and nearby Bratunac on Wednesday.  The general will become a legend, and we shall continue to live as we have lived,  said Milena Komlenovic, the Serb mayor of the  eastern town of Kalinovik, where Mladic went to school. She added that the international court s decisions - over 60 of 83 defendants convicted have been Serbs - had aggravated rather than healed divisions in Bosnia.  Politicians in neighboring Serbia, whose 1990s nationalist president, Slobodan Milosevic, armed and funded Mladic s forces, appealed for calm and urged all to look to the future when a now democratic Belgrade hopes to join the European Union.   Our hearts are also with the victims, the victims on all sides. I do honestly feel...for all victims, but let s look towards the future,  Serbian Prime Minister Ana Brnabic said. Zdravka Gvozdjar, whose nine-year-old son Eldin was killed in the Bosnian Serb bombardment of besieged Sarajevo, said the verdict was no surprise and partially satisfactory.  He deserved a much worse punishment but I was so excited and satisfied that he was handed down a life sentence because it is the most he could get. There is no comfort for me or any other mother (but) we have learned to live with the pain.    ",worldnews,"November 22, 2017 ",1
"U.S. Navy plane crashes in Philippine Sea, three missing","TOKYO (Reuters) - A U.S. Navy transport plane carrying 11 people crashed in the Philippine Sea south of Japan on Wednesday as it flew to the  aircraft carrier Ronald Reagan and three people were missing, in the latest Navy accident in the region. Eight other people were rescued and transferred to the carrier where they were in good condition, the U.S. Seventh Fleet said.   Search and rescue efforts for three personnel continue with U.S. Navy and Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) ships and aircraft on scene,  the U.S. Seventh Fleet said in a news  release.  The incident will be investigated,  it added. The plane was conducting a routine transport flight carrying passengers and cargo from Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni to the carrier, which was operating in the Philippine Sea as part of an exercise with Japanese forces, it said. U.S. President Donald Trump was briefed on the crash at his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida, where he is spending the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, said White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters.  The @USNavy is conducting search and rescue following aircraft crash. We are monitoring the situation. Prayers for all involved,  Trump wrote in a Twitter post. Japanese Minister of Defence Itsunori Onodera told reporters the U.S. Navy informed him that the crash may have been a result of engine trouble.  The propeller-powered transport plane, a C-2 Greyhound, carries personnel, mail and other cargo from mainland bases to carriers operating at sea.  C-2 aircraft have been in operation for more than five decades and are due to be replaced by the long-range tilt-rotor Osprey aircraft. Two crashes in the Asia Pacific region involving U.S. Navy warships and commercial vessels this year have raised questions about Navy training and the pace of operations in the region, prompted a Congressional hearing and the removal of a number of officers. The guided missile destroyer Fitzgerald almost sank off the coast of Japan after colliding with a Philippine container ship on June 17. The bodies of seven U.S. sailors were found in a flooded berthing area after that collision. In a separate incident in August, 10 sailors were killed when the guided missile destroyer John S. McCain collided with an oil tanker. The Navy has dismissed a number of officers, including the commander of the Seventh Fleet, as a result of the collisions involving its warships in Asia.

"Saudi-led coalition to reopen Yemen's Hodeidah port, Sanaa airport for aid","DUBAI (Reuters) - The Saudi-led military coalition fighting Houthi rebels in Yemen said on Wednesday it would allow humanitarian aid access through Yemen s port of Hodeidah and United Nations flights to the capital Sanaa, more than two weeks after blockading the country. The coalition closed air, land and sea access to the Arabian Peninsula country on Nov. 6 to stop the flow of arms to the Houthis from Iran. The action came after Saudi Arabia intercepted a missile fired toward its capital Riyadh. Iran has denied supplying the Houthis with weapons. Soon after the closure, U.N. aid chief Mark Lowcock warned that the blockade could spark  the largest famine the world has seen for many decades with millions of victims  unless the coalition gave access to humanitarian aid.  The Saudi-led coalition said in a statement on Wednesday that from Nov. 23 the Red Sea port of Hodeidah would be reopened to receive food aid and humanitarian relief, and Sanaa airport would be open for UN flights with humanitarian relief.   We re monitoring these developments,  U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters in New York.  If that were to happen that would be a very welcome and critically important development.   We made clear the tremendous amount of needs on the ground,  Haq said.  Earlier this month the coalition said it would allow aid deliveries through the government-held port of Aden. However, around 80 percent of Yemen s food imports arrive through Hodeidah. The United Nations has said some seven million people in Yemen are on the brink of famine and nearly 900,000 have been infected with cholera, a waterborne disease that causes acute diarrhea and dehydration. Aid groups said there also needed to be commercial access to Yemen for food and fuel shipments.  Humanitarian aid alone cannot meet the needs of Yemenis who are unjustly bearing the brunt of this war,  Paolo Cernuschi, Yemen country director at the International Rescue Committee, said in a statement.  Jan Egeland, secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council and a former U.N. aid chief, posted on Twitter,  We need all ports to open and access for commercial food and supplies to large civilian population. Humanitarian aid alone cannot avert hunger.   The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said on Wednesday that it had evacuated from Sanaa five staff members in need of urgent medical assistance. The Saudi-led coalition has been targeting the Houthis since they seized parts of Yemen in 2015, including the capital Sanaa, forcing President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to flee. The Houthis, drawn mainly from Yemen s Zaidi Shi ite minority and allied with long-serving former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, control much of the country. ",worldnews,"November 22, 2017 ",1
"Putin wins backing from Iran, Turkey for new Syria peace push","SOCHI, Russia/RIYADH (Reuters) - Russia s Vladimir Putin won the backing of Turkey and Iran on Wednesday to host a Syrian peace congress, taking the central role in a major diplomatic push to finally end a civil war all but won by Moscow s ally, President Bashar al-Assad. Syrian opposition groups, meeting in Saudi Arabia to seek a unified position ahead of peace talks, decided to stick to their demand that Assad leave power, Al Arabiya television reported, following speculation they might soften their stance after their hardline leader quit. Two days after being visited by Assad in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, President Putin hosted his counterparts Tayyip Erdogan and Hassan Rouhani there.  In a joint statement, the three leaders called on the Syrian government and moderate opposition to  participate constructively  in the planned congress, to be held in the same city on a date they did not specify.  The congress will look at the key questions on Syria s national agenda,  Putin told reporters at the summit, sitting alongside Rouhani and Erdogan.  First of all that is the drawing-up of a framework for the future structure of the state, the adoption of a new constitution, and, on the basis of that, the holding of elections under United Nations supervision.  There was no word from the leaders on who would be invited. The list of invitees has been a sticking point, with Turkey objecting to some Syrian Kurdish groups attending. Syria s civil war, in its seventh year, has killed hundreds of thousands of people and created the world s worst refugee crisis, driving more than 11 million people from their homes. All previous efforts to achieve a diplomatic solution have swiftly collapsed, with the opposition demanding Assad leave power, the government insisting he stay on, and neither side able to force the issue by achieving a military victory. But since Russia joined the war on behalf of Assad in 2015, the balance of power has turned decisively in his government s favor. A year ago, the army forced rebels out of their last urban stronghold, the eastern half of Aleppo. In recent weeks, the self-proclaimed caliphate of jihadist group Islamic State has collapsed. Government forces now effectively control all of Syria apart from a few shrinking rebel pockets and a swathe in the north held by mainly Kurdish forces backed by the United States. Opposition groups held their meeting on Wednesday at a luxury hotel in Riyadh, two days after the leader of the High Negotiations Committee (HNC) that has represented them at previous peace talks quit abruptly. HNC chief Riyad Hijab had been known as an uncompromising defender of the position that Assad must have no role in any political transition for Syria, and his resignation had led to speculation the opposition could soften its stance. However, a draft of the meeting s final statement still included the demand Assad leave office at the start of any transition, Saudi-owned Al Arabiya television reported. Having helped Assad s government reach the cusp of victory, Putin now appears to be playing the leading role in international efforts to end the war on Assad s terms.  In addition to hosting Assad, Rouhani and Erdogan, the Russian leader has also phoned U.S. President Donald Trump and Saudi King Salman in the past 24 hours. Iran has long supported Assad.  Saudi Arabia, Iran s arch rival in the Middle East and long a backer of rebel groups in Syria and advocate of the position that Assad must leave, has been the main supporter of the HNC. But after King Salman made an historic visit to Moscow a few months ago, Riyadh appears to have come around to Russia s dominant role in Syria. Similarly Turkey, traditionally one of the Syrian leader s implacable foes, has increasingly shown willingness to work with Russia to resolve the crisis.  This summit is aimed at results. I believe critical decisions will be reached,  Turkey s Erdogan said in Sochi before his meeting with Putin and Rouhani. The Syrian government welcomed the final statement from the three-way Iran summit, Syrian state media said on Wednesday, quoting an official source in the Foreign Ministry. It described it as the culmination of Assad s summit with Putin. The other major power with troops in Syria, the United States, has so far kept its distance. Washington has been arming, training and sending special forces to assist a Kurdish group fighting against Islamic State, angering Turkey which is fighting its own Kurdish insurgency. Still, any final settlement that keeps Assad in power will probably require the participation of some kind of opposition delegation willing to negotiate over the demand that he go. U.N. peace talks mediator Staffan de Mistura, host of the formal peace process in Geneva, told the opposition groups at the Riyadh meeting they needed to have the  hard discussions  necessary to reach a  common line .  A strong, unified team is a creative partner in Geneva and we need that, one who can actually explore more than one way to arrive to the goals that we need to have,  he said. De Mistura will meet Russia s defense and foreign ministers on Thursday to discuss preparations for a new round of Geneva talks, Russian news agency RIA reported. Russia said on Tuesday that the resignation of such  radically minded  Syrian opposition figures as HNC chief Hijab would help unite the disparate opposition factions around a more  realistic  platform.

Rights groups urge end to Poland's overhaul of judiciary,"WARSAW (Reuters) - Plans to overhaul Poland s judiciary would end the country s status as a democratic state based on the rule of law and should be scrapped, more than two dozen rights groups and non-governmental organizations said in a petition on Wednesday. The petition, backed by Amnesty International and the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights among others, came as parliament started debating amendments agreed by President Andrzej Duda and the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS). The proposals give the parliament a virtually free hand in deciding the composition of the Supreme Court and how judges are selected and are  in gross conflict  with the constitution, the signatories said in their petition.  The introduction of these amendments will mean that Poland will definitely cease to be a democratic state of law,  it said.  We request the immediate stoppage of parliamentary work on (the bills) and demand the start of extensive public consultations on this.  The nationalist, eurosceptic PiS,  which has a parliamentary majority, says reform of the judicial system is needed because the courts are slow, inefficient and steeped in a communist-era mentality.  Duda had raised hopes among critics of the plans that they could be halted when he vetoed the original PiS proposals in July, following nationwide protests and warnings from the European Union.  The president, an ally of PiS, said then that the proposals gave too much power to one party and to the justice minister. But subsequent work on the amendments has been conducted in secrecy, spurring criticism from the United Nations and the European Commission that they could further damage Poland s judicial system. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of PiS and Poland s paramount politician, has met privately with Duda several times for talks. Details of those meetings have not been made public and it is not known what consensus has been reached.  The president gave us some hope that the constitution would not be so continually abused,  said Irena Kaminska, a judge and a member of the Themis association of judges.  For a moment I had hoped there would be a breakthrough, but that has not happened.  Stanislaw Piotrowicz, head of parliament s justice committee, told the PAP state news agency that lawmakers could complete work on the bills at the next session, planned for Dec. 6-8.  If the bills pass they could potentially allow PiS to tighten its control of the political system, its critics said. Marcin Matczak of the Batory Foundation in Warsaw, one of the NGO signatories to the petition, said PiS would be able to change the electoral system to its own advantage because the judges would no longer challenge them.

"France tells Libya to act over migrant ""crimes against humanity""","PARIS (Reuters) - France demanded on Wednesday an urgent U.N. Security Council session on human trafficking in Libya and raised the possibility of sanctions on the country after a video appearing to show African migrants sold as slaves there sparked global outrage. Convened by Italy, which struck a deal with Libya to slash the number of migrants reaching its shores, the Council on Tuesday unanimously backed a resolution urging tougher action to crack down on human trafficking and modern slavery worldwide. Speaking to lawmakers, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian suggested Paris wanted to take things further and called for an urgent session of the Council to specifically discuss the situation in Libya.  Libyan authorities, who have been alerted several times, including by myself because I was there in September, have decided to open an investigation into the facts,  Le Drian said.  We want it to go fast and if the Libyan justice system can not carry this procedure through then we should open international sanctions,  Le Drian said. Footage appearing to show African migrants sold as slaves in Libya has sparked an international outcry with protests erupting across Europe and Africa, while artists to soccer stars to U.N. officials have made pleas for the abuse to end. The video broadcast by CNN showed what it said was an auction of men offered to Libyan buyers as farmhands and sold for $400, a chilling echo of the trans-Saharan slave trade of centuries past.  What has been revealed is indeed trafficking of human beings, it s a crime against humanity,  Macron said during a news conference with African Union President Alpha Conde.  Macron said he wanted the U.N. Security Council to discuss what concrete steps could be taken to tackle the issue. A French diplomat said the U.N. session would likely be in coming days, probably next week, and would see what concrete measures could be taken to improve the situation.  Despite events in Libya, Conde put the blame firmly on the European Union, accusing it of encouraging the Libyans to keep migrants in the North African country despite there being no government.   What happened in Libya is shocking, scandalous, but we must establish the responsibilities,  said Conde.  In Libya there is no government, so the European Union can not choose a developing country and ask that country to detain refugees (...) when it doesn t have the means to do so,  he added.  The refugees are in terrible conditions ... so our European friends were not right to ask Libya to keep the migrants. The European Union is responsible.         Le Drian said he wanted the International Organization for Migration and the U.N. Refugee Agency to publish details about the trafficking of migrants in the country.  Libya splintered along political, ideological and tribal lines during and after a 2011 NATO-backed uprising that unseated former leader Muammar Gaddafi. In 2014 a battle for the capital led to rival parliaments and governments being set up in Tripoli and the east. ",worldnews,"November 22, 2017 ",1
Mladic verdict carries message for Syria and beyond: U.N.'s Zeid,"GENEVA (Reuters) - The conviction of former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic for genocide and crimes against humanity serves as a warning to others such as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, the United Nations  human rights chief said on Wednesday. Earlier on Wednesday the U.N. Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) found Mladic guilty of the slaughter of 8,000 Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica and for the siege of the Bosnian capital Sarajevo, in which more than 10,000 civilians were killed by shelling and snipers over 43 months. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra ad al-Hussein, who worked for the United Nations in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s, told Reuters he had waited a long time for the life sentence handed down against Mladic.  Mladic is the epitome of evil and the prosecution of Mladic is the epitome of international justice,  Zeid said in an interview in his Geneva office. Noting that Mladic is now 74 but was in his 50s at the time of his crimes, Zeid said the case showed justice would catch up with other leaders who trampled over human rights.  The passage of time is no protection. Eventually I hope all those who have authored these appalling atrocities across the world will be held accountable before a court of law and there will be justice for the victims of those particular crimes.  Pressed on whether that would include Assad, he said:  Yes. It s very clear to us that what happened in Syria recently and not limited to Syria, in many parts of the world, were so grotesque that if a court of law on the basis of evidence were to prosecute senior leaders then you would expect that some of them would be held responsible.  Assad and his government deny committing rights abuses and say they are engaged in a legitimate struggle against terrorist groups including Islamic State. Trials are led by evidence, Zeid said.  And so whatever trials are mounted in the future, if the evidence leads to the very senior rungs of leadership, then you would indeed hope this takes place.   In the end there is justice,  he added. U.N. war crimes investigators documenting massacres and other atrocities in Syria have accused all sides of grave crimes including the government s use of chemical weapons against civilians more than two dozen times, as well as executions, torture and rapes. Paulo Pinheiro, chairman of the U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Syria, said last year that the scale of deaths in prisons indicated that the Assad government was responsible for  extermination as a crime against humanity . Syria s civil war, now in its seventh year, has killed hundreds of thousands of people and created the world s worst refugee crisis, driving more than 11 million people from their homes.

Uganda denies corruption allegations against its foreign minister,"KAMPALA (Reuters) - Uganda on Wednesday denied its foreign minister had engaged in corrupt activities with a Hong Kong man who has been charged with bribery and other violations by U.S. authorities. Chi Ping Patrick Ho, 68, who heads the China Energy Fund Committee (CEFC), a charity based in Hong Kong and the U.S. state of Virginia, was charged with violating the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Ho was accused of among other issues of being involved with bribes and promises of other benefits to Sam Kutesa, Uganda s foreign affairs minister, in exchange for promises of business contracts for an unnamed Chinese firm.  Kutesa is also a former president of the U.N. General Assembly. The Ugandan foreign ministry said the  interaction and engagement  that Kutesa had with Ho was  in fulfilment of his official functions as president of the U.N. General Assembly .   It is therefore erroneous to insinuate or infer that Hon. Sam Kutesa, from references made to him and CEFC...is linked to the bribery allegations,  a statement said. Ho s attorney has declined to comment to Reuters on the charges.  ",worldnews,"November 22, 2017 ",1
"Georgian policeman, three terrorism suspects killed in police operation: state security","TBILISI (Reuters) - One Georgian special forces serviceman and three members of an armed group suspected of terrorism were killed on Wednesday in a police operation against the group on the outskirts of the capital Tbilisi, state security said. Four other police were wounded and one member of the criminal group was arrested during the 20-hour operation at a residential block where the group was thought to be hiding. The operation was launched late on Tuesday and went on through the night into Wednesday. Heavy shooting and explosions were heard throughout Wednesday. Residents of nearby buildings were evacuated.  The members of the group are not Georgian citizens and it is assumed they are members of a terrorist organization,  state security administration deputy chief Nino Giorgobiani told reporters.

German Social Democrats face pressure over coalition talks,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany s Social Democrats (SPD) faced pressure on Wednesday to consider offering coalition talks to Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives to settle the worst political crisis in modern German history. A leader of the smaller Free Democrats (FDP) also raised the possibility of reviving coalition talks with the conservatives and Greens that collapsed at the weekend raising fears across Europe of stalemate in the EU s economic and political powerhouse. But the party chief later appeared to ruled it out.  The signs of possible flexibility came after President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, in a move unprecedented for a largely ceremonial position, intervened to promote talks that could avert a disruptive early repeat election. SPD leader Martin Schulz, whose party had governed in coalition under Merkel since 2013, wants to go into opposition after September polls that knocked its support to the lowest levels since formation of the modern German republic in 1949. But the mass-circulation Bild newspaper said 30 members of the SPD s 153-strong parliamentary group questioned that position this week at a meeting of the parliamentary party. SPD lawmaker Johannes Kahrs, spokesman for the Seeheimer Circle, a conservative wing in the party, urged Schulz to keep an open mind when he meets on Thursday with Steinmeier. Kahrs told the Passauer Neue Presse newspaper that the collapse of the coalition talks had changed the situation.  We cannot just tell the German president,  Sorry, that s it.  Bild said German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, who handed leadership of the SPD to Schulz and became foreign minister earlier this year, also favors a resumed grand coalition. Germany, traditionally a bastion of stability in the EU, could face months of political stagnation, further complicating agreement on reforms of euro zone governance and EU defense and asylum policies. Merkel, who remains acting chancellor until a government is agreed, has said she would prefer to work with the SPD. If that failed, she would favor new elections over an unstable minority government. Merkel s 12-year hold on power was shaken at the September elections partly by the arrival of the anti-immigration AfD party in parliament. Guenther Oettinger, an EU commissioner and member of Merkel s Christian Democratic Union (CDU), urged the SPD to think again about its rejection of coalition talks.  The long process of forming a government is weakening Germany s influence in Brussels,  Oettinger told Der Spiegel newsmagazine in an interview to be published on Thursday. Axel Schaefer, deputy head of the SPD s parliamentary group, urged the three political blocs to try again to reach agreement. But he said his party would also talk with conservatives if asked to do so by Steinmeier, who is meeting with possible coalition partners this week. A top official of the pro-business FDP told broadcaster ntv her party would not rule out reviving the three-way coalition talks if Merkel s conservatives and the Greens offered a  completely new package  of proposals.  If it really was possible to build a modern republic in the coming years, then we are the last ones who would refuse to talk,  FDP Secretary General Nicola Beer said. But FDP chief Christian Lindner told Spiegel magazine:  For the foreseeable future, it is impossible to imagine cooperation with the Greens at the federal level.  Stephan Weil, the SPD premier of Lower Saxony who just completed a coalition agreement with conservatives in his state, has said a new election could leave few options other than a grand coalition anyway, the Sueddeutsche newspaper reported. Joe Kaeser, chief executive of Siemens, told Die Welt newspaper that he hoped new elections could be avoided since the results would likely be little changed from Sept. 24. A new poll released Wednesday showed that half of Germans favor a new election, while a fifth support a minority government. Only 18 percent want a renewal of the SPD-conservative coalition that ruled the past four years.  ",worldnews,"November 22, 2017 ",1
South Africa's Ramaphosa leads in nominations for ANC leader: poll,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa s Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa has taken a lead in party nominations for the next leader of the ruling African National Congress (ANC), securing the support of 65 percent of branches tallied so far, a poll showed. Hundreds of ANC branches across South Africa are nominating their choice for party president and other senior positions ahead of a December conference where about 5,000 delegates sent by the branches will cast their votes. The ANC s next leader will probably become president of the country at a national election in 2019 given the party s electoral dominance. Early indications are that party members are split between Ramaphosa, a former union leader and one of the country s richest people, and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, a former minister and ex-wife of President Jacob Zuma, for the party s top job. The poll by the Institute of Race Relations (IRR) found that Dlamini-Zuma had secured 30 percent of nominations and that ANC Treasurer General Zweli Mkhize received most of the remaining 5 percent of nominations. The IRR said its data suggested 74 percent of ANC branches had made nominations and cautioned that it had not been able to corroborate its findings. The ANC does not make the nomination tallies public. A Ramaphosa win in December has tended to be viewed as the more positive outcome by investors, some of whom have been spooked by Dlamini-Zuma s campaign message of radical wealth redistribution. Nominations do not necessarily translate into votes at the ANC s elective conference because delegates could vote for a different candidate than the one nominated by their branch. Dlamini-Zuma s campaign says that many branches sympathetic to her are yet to submit their nominations, which could reduce Ramaphosa s lead or swing the outcome in December in her favor. Dlamini-Zuma is backed by the ANC s women s and youth leagues, which also vote in December. ",worldnews,"November 22, 2017 ",1
South Africa's Zuma appoints permanent police commissioner,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African President Jacob Zuma appointed General Khehla Sitole as national police commissioner on Wednesday, filling the position on a permanent basis for the first time in nearly three years. South Africa has been without a permanent head of police since Zuma suspended Riah Phiyega in 2015 pending an investigation into her role in the killing of 34 platinum miners by officers during a violent strike over pay in 2012. South Africa has one of the highest murder rates in the world, while burglary and car theft are common. Tackling violent crime is a top political priority for much of the public. Zuma has been criticized by opposition parties and civil society for previously appointing civilians rather career police officers to the top posts in the service. Sitole had  grown through the ranks of the police having joined the service as a constable until his promotion as a Lieutenant General in 2011,  Zuma s office said in a statement.   General Sitole brings a wealth of operational as well as management experience to the SA Police Service.  Zuma appointed his third police minister in under three years in March, drawing further criticism that he has failed to build a stable team to tackle crime. ",worldnews,"November 22, 2017 ",1

Summit on euro zone future in December still on despite no German government: Tusk,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A summit of euro zone leaders will go ahead as planned in the middle of December, the chairman of European Union leaders said on Wednesday, dispelling speculation it might be postponed because of the collapse of German coalition talks.  Just to be clear: The December Euro Summit is on. As part of the Leaders  Agenda we need to discuss what, how and when to move forward on the EMU (European Monetary Union) and the Banking Union,  Tusk said on Twitter. He said he discussed the agenda of the meeting over the phone on Wednesday with the chairman of euro zone finance ministers Jeroen Dijsselbloem. German government coalition talks collapsed on Sunday night as the liberal FDP party pulled out after weeks of  exploratory  talks, plunging the euro zone s most important economy into political uncertainty and raising the prospect of new elections. Euro zone leaders are to set a direction for deeper euro zone economic integration at a summit in the middle of December, at which Germany s input is crucial. The summit is to launch six months of work that would lead decisions in June 2018 on whether or not the single currency area should have a budget, a finance minister and a separate euro zone assembly within the European Parliament. The deeper integration push, championed by French President Emmanuel Macron, also includes the transformation of the euro zone bailout fund into a European Monetary Fund and the creation of a sovereign insolvency mechanism.

Police find similarities in body parts found Copenhagen waters,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - An arm found by divers near Copenhagen was weighed down with pieces of metal similar to those attached to the legs of Swedish journalist Kim Wall who died in August on board a submarine owned by a Danish inventor, local police said on Wednesday. The arm was found about 1 km (half a mile) from the spot where Wall s head and legs had been found in October. Wall, a freelance journalist who was researching a story on entrepreneur and aerospace engineer Peter Madsen, went missing after he took her out to sea in his homebuilt 17-metre (56-foot) submarine in August. On Aug. 23, police identified a torso that washed ashore in Copenhagen as Wall s. Coroners examined what turned out to be a left arm after it was found in Koge Bay just outside of Copenhagen - near the route that had been searched in connection with the submarine case. Divers and police will continue the search for the right arm along with further evidence on Thursday. Madsen admitted to dismembering Wall on board his submarine and dumping her body parts in the sea, but he still denies murdering her and a charge of sexual assault without intercourse. The trial has been set to take place in Copenhagen next March. (The story adds distance in miles in second paragraph) ",worldnews,"November 22, 2017 ",1
"Rosneft's Sechin a no-show as witness in bribery trial again, ordered to appear next week","MOSCOW (Reuters) - Rosneft Chief Executive Igor Sechin again failed to show up as a witness at the bribery trial of a former Russian economy minister on Wednesday, prompting the judge to order him to appear next week. Sechin, boss of Russia s biggest oil company and a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, had told the court he would be unavailable for the rest of the year. He is a key witness in the trial of Alexei Ulyukayev, who was arrested last year after a late night meeting in Sechin s office. Ulyukayev faces up to 15 years in prison, accused of accepting $2 million from Sechin in return for approving the sale of a state-controlled oil company to Rosneft. Police detained him inside Rosneft headquarters shortly after Sechin handed him the cash. Ulyukayev denies the accusations and says he was framed by Sechin. His lawyers say their client cannot testify in court prior to Sechin s testimony as a witness.  All of us are here thanks to witness Sechin,  Ulyukayev s lawyer Timofei Gridnev told the court after Sechin failed to appear on Wednesday. Gridnev said it was the third time Sechin had ignored a summons to appear. Judge Larisa Semyonova read out a letter from Sechin s lawyers saying he would be unable to attend for the rest of the year due to his tight schedule, but she nevertheless summoned him for next Monday. Rosneft made clear later on Wednesday that chances its boss would appear in court on Monday were rather slim.  This hunt for Sechin discredits the court. Sechin is not the accused one,  Rosneft spokesman Mikhail Leontyev told Reuters.  All this shouting of Sechin s name in court and these dates are trash.  Before his arrest, Ulyukayev was one of the leading figures in a faction of economic liberals who argued for less state control over the economy. Sechin is widely seen as the main champion of the opposite view, that the state should consolidate its grip, particularly over the energy sector that provides a large share of Russia s state revenue through its two biggest companies, Rosneft and Gazprom. Ulyukayev had opposed last year s sale of the medium-sized oil company Bashneft to Rosneft. But prosecutors say he signed off on the deal and then took the cash from Sechin. Sechin missed Wednesday s hearings because he is on a business trip to western Siberia, where on Tuesday he attended the opening of a new Rosneft oil field. On Wednesday, he met a regional governor and chaired a meeting with Rosneft s management in the Siberian city of Khanty-Mansiisk, Rosneft said. ",worldnews,"November 22, 2017 ",1
German police detain suspect in global online drug ring,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German police detained a 29-year-old man suspected of trading narcotic drugs internationally over the internet through anonymous websites and sending them by mail to customers in Germany, police said on Wednesday. In cooperation with Dutch authorities, police seized 400,000 euros ($470,840) and 75 kg (165 lb) of ecstasy, marijuana, cocaine, amphetamine and heroin at the apartments of the suspect and at his mother in the Netherlands. The dealer and his partners, using the pseudonyms  Mr. Drug Commander  and  Drugs Squad , were receiving orders mostly from German customers on black market websites such as  Hansa Market  and  Dream Market , federal criminal police said. The man, who was not identified, was arrested on Nov. 9 while entering Germany to mail 34 shipments of drugs. A day earlier, in Ingolstadt in Bavaria, police had arrested a man who had ordered marijuana and amphetamines.  Dutch authorities are still looking for other gang members. Police said online drug shops are boosting drug consumption and trafficking, requiring a shift in approach by German authorities.  The supposedly anonymous ordering on the Internet motivates more young people to buy, consume or even sell drugs for profit,  said federal criminal police in a statement. Police said the investigation began in August, leading to the initial arrest in October of six people in the Bavarian town of Coburg, which in turn helped identified 12 other buyers. German customs police in July said they expected far more cocaine to flood into Europe in the future, and had seized nearly five tonnes of the drug in northern sea ports so far this year, more than three times their total in 2016.

"Pope to meet head of Myanmar army, Rohingya refugees: Vatican","VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis will meet the head of Myanmar s army and Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, both late additions to a tour of the two countries next week. Human rights monitors and U.N. officials have accused Myanmar s military of atrocities, including mass rape, against the stateless Rohingya during operations that followed insurgent attacks on 30 police posts and an army base. Vatican spokesman Greg Burke said on Wednesday that the pope would meet army head Senior General Min Aung Hlaing on Nov. 30 in a church residence in Yangon. Myanmar Cardinal Charles Maung Bo had talks with the pope in Rome on Saturday and suggested that he add a meeting with the general to the schedule for a trip that is proving to be one of the most politically sensitive since Francis was elected in 2013. Both the pope and the general agreed. Some 600,000 Rohingya refugees, most of them Muslim and from Myanmar s northern Rakhine state, have fled to Bangladesh. Burke said a small group of Rohingya refugees would be present at an inter-religious meeting for peace in the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka on Dec 1. Myanmar s government has denied most of the claims of atrocities against the Rohingya, and the army last week said its own investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing by troops. The pope will separately meet the country s leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, in the capital Naypyitaw, on Nov. 28 in an encounter that was already on the schedule. Briefing reporters on the trip, Burke gave no details of how the Rohingya who will meet the pope would be chosen. A source in Dhaka said the refugees would be able to tell the pope about their experiences. Both events were not on the original schedule of the Nov. 26-Dec. 2 trip. Bo, the cardinal from Myanmar, has advised the pope not to use the word Rohingya while in Myanmar because it is incendiary in the country where they are not recognized as an ethnic group. Burke said the pope took the advice seriously but added:  We will find out together during the trip ... it is not a forbidden word . ",worldnews,"November 22, 2017 ",1

"Israeli veteran, government clash over alleged abuse of Palestinian","JERUSALEM (Reuters) - An Israeli ex-soldier who serves as a spokesman for a group that documents alleged abuses of Palestinians has set off a legal tussle with the Israeli authorities by saying he himself beat a detainee. After Dean Issacharoff, a former army lieutenant, spoke of the incident in a speech uploaded to YouTube in April, the Israeli Justice Ministry took the unusual move of launching an investigation, with him as a suspect. Issacharoff, the son of a senior diplomat, belongs to Breaking the Silence, a circle of army veterans that has long angered Israeli leaders by publicising abroad what it says are   confessions of war crimes in occupied Palestinian territory. The group portrayed as another example of Israeli military excess Issacharoff s account of what he said was his own beating of a Palestinian stone-thrower in the West Bank town of Hebron while trying to handcuff him in 2014. But the Justice Ministry last week declared the case closed, saying questioning of the alleged Palestinian victim showed the event had never happened and that Issacharoff had made a  mendacious claim . On Twitter, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu celebrated the decision as  further proof Breaking the Silence lies and slanders our soldiers . Issacharoff retorted on social media that the ministry had questioned the wrong Palestinian - a man he had detained separately in Hebron around the same time. Breaking the Silence issued what it said was video of the right incident, showing Issacharoff frog-marching a handcuffed man. The Palestinian appears to have dark patches on his cheeks, which the group said were bruises from Issacharoff having kneed him. Issacharoff said he bloodied the Palestinian, though no blood is seen on the detainee in the footage. Achiya Schatz, another Breaking the Silence spokesman,  accused the Justice Ministry of clearing Issacharoff in order to discredit the group.  This was a politicised investigation, made-to-order for the elimination of opposition (voices),  Schatz said. Prosecutor Nurit Littman denied any bias and said  Issacharoff s testimony had been too sketchy to produce corroboration.  We do not dabble in politics. We deal in evidence,  she told Army Radio, leaving open the possibility of a new investigation taking into consideration the new video.  Interviewed on Israeli television, the Palestinian, Faisal al-Natsheh, said he had been detained though he had not thrown stones, and had been beaten by troops. He could not confirm Issacharoff was among them.  They didn t let me look at them, not even once,  he said. ",worldnews,"November 22, 2017 ",1

France's Le Pen says victim of 'banking fatwa' over account closures,"PARIS/NANTERRE (Reuters) - French far-right leader Marine Le Pen accused two banks on Wednesday of launching a  banking fatwa  to silence her National Front party by closing bank accounts of hers and her party s. The banks said they had acted within regulatory requirements but declined to offer fuller explanations. Le Pen is smarting from defeat in this year s presidential and parliamentary elections, during which she accused French banks of being politically biased for not lending to her campaigns.  This is an attempt to suffocate an opposition party, and no democrat should accept that,  Le Pen told a news conference, calling on President Emmanuel Macron and other political parties to back her National Front (FN). Le Pen said the FN would file a complaint against Societe Generale and its subsidiary, Credit du Nord. She also plans a complaint against HSBC for closing a personal account of hers. The FN says Societe Generale closed its accounts earlier this month, and when the central bank ordered a subsidiary, Credit du Nord, to manage an account for the party, the bank refused to process cheque and credit card payments. Societe Generale rejected the accusations.  Decisions to open or close a bank account depend purely on banking reasons ... without taking into account any political consideration,  it said in a statement. It added that Credit du Nord offered an FN representative banking services required by law but gave no more details. HSBC said it complied with all necessary regulations and could not publicly discuss client relationships.  In France, banks are allowed to close accounts with advance notice and do not have to say why.  Holding an account is a right, however, and a customer can ask the Bank of France to designate a bank that would be forced to open one. But the designated bank can choose to limit the use of the account to basic banking services.     The Bank of France would not comment. The FN has long said it struggled with financing. It came under scrutiny for a 9 million-euro loan it got in 2014 from a now-defunct Russian bank. It spent 12.5 million euros ($14.70 million) on the presidential election alone this year. Party supporters have since been asked to lend it money directly. At her news conference, Le Pen asked party supporters to react to the account closures. Hours later, the hashtag  JeQuitteLaSG , or  I Leave Societe Generale , was the top trending topic on Twitter in France.  Government spokesman Christophe Castaner said the FN should be allowed to have a bank account and use it normally.  But I do not know why the bank told its client, the National Front,  Thank you and goodbye , so I cannot comment on the substance of the case,  he told a weekly news conference.

Somalia says it requested U.S. air strike that killed 100 militants,"MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Somalia s government said on Wednesday it had requested a U.S. air strike that killed scores of suspected militants to help pave the way for an upcoming ground offensive against Islamist group al Shabaab. The U.S. military s Africa Command (Africom) said on Tuesday it had killed more than 100 of the al Qaeda-linked insurgents in the strike on a camp 125 miles (200 km) northwest of the capital Mogadishu.  Those militants were preparing explosives and attacks. Operations against al Shabaab have been stepped up,          Somali Information Minister Abdirahman Omar Osman told Reuters.  We have asked the U.S. to help us from the air to make our readied ground offensive more successful.  Al Shabaab spokesman Abdiasis Abu Musab denied the air strike had taken place.  It is just... propaganda,  he told Reuters.  The United States has ramped up operations in Somalia this year after President Donald Trump loosened the rules of engagement in March. Africom reported eight U.S. air strikes from May to August, compared to 13 for the whole of 2016. Including Tuesday s strike, it has reported five this month alone. The Pentagon said the U.S. military would continue to target militants in strikes in coordination with the Somali government. Al Shabaab has lost control of most of Somalia s cities and towns since African Union peacekeepers supporting Somali troops pushed the insurgency out of the capital Mogadishu in 2011. But it retains a strong presence in parts of the south and center. Somali president Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, a dual U.S.-Somali citizen, has taken a harder line than his predecessors against the insurgency since he was sworn in earlier this year. But his plans have been undermined by the poor state of the Somali military and political infighting.  He has also had to try to mend fences with the powerful Habar Gidir clan, following a raid involving U.S. forces on the town of Bariire in August in which 10 people were killed including three children.

Italian left's efforts to stop migrants may backfire at election,"ROME (Reuters) - A deal with Libya that has slashed the number of migrants reaching Italy could scupper the ruling center Democratic Party s (PD) already dwindling hopes of staying in power next year as it is opposed by the PD s potential coalition partners. The deal, struck in February, is popular with the Italian public and with right-wing and anti-establishment parties now ahead in opinion polls, but it has drawn criticism from the United Nations, rights groups and many on Italy s left. Under the accord, Italy and the European Union pledged to finance migrant camps in Libya, and Rome also agreed to train the Libyan coastguard, part of a crackdown on migrants attempting the hazardous sea crossing to Europe. But the deal has also led to tens of thousands of migrants being trapped in Libya, where humanitarian groups say they are locked up in appalling conditions, bought and sold, and subjected to crimes on a daily basis. One politician who wants changes to the agreement is Emma Bonino, a former foreign minister in a center government.  I ve always criticized this agreement with Libya. It s a cork in a bottle that cannot hold,  Bonino told Reuters.  Italians have the perception that they are being invaded by Muslim foreigners. It s not true. Fear is fantastic for winning elections, but it s simply useless for controlling migration.   Bonino is considering forming a pro-EU party with other left-leaning figures that could support the PD ahead of next year s national election, which must be held by May. In other criticism of the Libya deal, Giulio Marcon, the top lawmaker in the lower house for the Italian Left party, said:  We cannot be complicit in migrant push backs.  Left-wing voters hold humanitarian values dear, said Marcon, whose party has so far refused an alliance with the PD.  ANTI-IMMIGRANT PARTIES GAINING The PD needs the support of other parties, on the left in particular. It trailed the populist 5-Star Movement in a recent poll with 24 percent to 29 percent, while a center coalition that includes the anti-immigrant Northern League, Silvio Berlusconi s Forza Italia (Go Italy!) and the far-right Brothers of Italy has combined support totaling about 36 percent.   The deal with Libya, modeled on a similar one struck between the EU and Turkey, has been successful in reducing the flow of migrants into Italy, with arrivals down by about a third so far this year compared to the same period in 2016. In October alone arrivals were down about 80 percent from a year earlier. Ordinary Italians, alarmed by the arrival of some 600,000 migrants in the past four years, have welcomed the trend. An SWG poll this month showed two thirds of Italians do not want more immigrants, fearing they will take away jobs and increase crime. The Northern League, tapping into the anti-immigrant mood, has seen its popularity more than double to about 15 percent in three years. Its leader, Matteo Salvini, has accused  fake refugees  of  invading  Italy and bringing crime with them.  Not to be outdone, the 5-Star Movement s candidate for prime minister, Luigi Di Maio, this summer accused charity ships rescuing migrants piled onto overcrowded and unseaworthy boats of being a  taxi service . Under the February deal, Libya s coastguard has so far picked up about 20,000 migrants, including refugees. They are then forced into detention centers where they can be held indefinitely. Last week the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights condemned the EU s support for the Libyan coastguard as  inhuman  because intercepted migrants were imprisoned and subjected to  unimaginable horrors . Former U.N. secretary-general and Nobel Peace Prize winner Kofi Annan said the Libya deal suggested Italy was complicit in a breach of the Geneva Convention, which says refugees cannot be returned to a place where they may be persecuted.  Under the Convention, you cannot push them (refugees) back. But if you make an arrangement with somebody else to keep them from moving, in a way you are complicit,  Annan said during a trip to Rome this month. ",worldnews,"November 22, 2017 ",1

Once triumphant Bosnian Serb commander Mladic reduced to frail genocide defendant,"SARAJEVO (Reuters) - In the 1990s he was the burly, brash general leading nationalist Bosnian Serbs towards a seemingly sweeping victory in Bosnia s war. Two decades later, he was reduced to an ailing old man trying in vain to delay judgment for genocide in a U.N. court. On Wednesday, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) convicted Ratko Mladic, 74, in one of the highest profile war crimes cases since the post-World War Two Nuremberg trials of Germany s Nazi leadership.  Radovan Karadzic, political leader of Bosnia s Serbs in the 1992-95 war, and Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, who armed and funded Bosnian Serb forces, were tried on the same charges. The ICTY convicted Karadzic in 2016 and jailed him for 40 years. Milosevic died in his cell in 2006 before his trial ended.  Defiant until the close of his five-year trial, Mladic  desperately tried to postpone the verdict. His lawyers persistently accused the ICTY of denying him proper medical care. They asked for him to be treated in Serbia or Russia, but were rebuffed. Prosecutors demanded a life sentence for the man who critics called the  Butcher of Bosnia . His lawyers called for his acquittal and release, arguing he never approved mass killings of Muslim or Croat civilians in Bosnia s vicious, often neighbourhood war and was a victim of Western anti-Serb bias.  Mladic said he wanted to be remembered as a defender of Serbs in a struggle for survival against Muslims dating back centuries, and made urgent by a Muslim-Croat vote for Bosnia s independence from Serbian-led Yugoslavia in 1992.  I am General Ratko Mladic. The whole world knows who I am,  he told a pre-trial hearing in 2011.  I am here defending my country and people, not Ratko Mladic.     Mladic was charged with genocide for the slaughter of 8,000 unarmed Bosnian Muslim men and boys rounded up in the town of Srebrenica, and his forces  43-month-long siege of Sarajevo in which thousands of civilians were killed by artillery, mortar, tank and sniper fire from the rugged hills ringing the capital. From the time of his ICTY indictment in mid-1995, before the war ended, it took 17 years to bring him to trial in The Hague - a testament to the loyalty he inspired among Serbs who helped conceal him and to the resilience of their nationalist cause. But as Serbia evolved after Bosnia s war from authoritarian rule to democracy seeking integration with the European Union, Mladic lost his sanctuary. When Serbian police acting on an ICTY arrest warrant finally traced Mladic to a cousin s farmhouse in May 2011, they found a penniless, shambling and ill old man. The son of a World War Two Yugoslav partisan killed in 1945, Mladic was a general in the old communist Yugoslav People s Army (JNA) when the multinational Balkan republic began to disintegrate in 1991 with the secession of Slovenia and Croatia. When Bosnia s Serbs rose up in response to a referendum for independence by Muslims and Croats, Mladic took over Belgrade s forces in Bosnia which swiftly overran 70 percent of the country with a combination of daring, ruthlessness and brutality. Serb paramilitaries entered the conflict with a campaign of murder, rape, mutilation and expulsion mainly against Bosnian Muslims. Dozens of towns were besieged with heavy weapons and villages were burned down as 22,000 U.N. peacekeeping troops stood by more or less helplessly, with orders not to take sides. Mladic had a cameraman film the blitz of the Muslim enclave of Srebrenica, showing him bronzed and fit at 53, extolling his  lads  and haranguing hapless Dutch U.N. peacekeepers who took his soldier s word that the inhabitants would be safe. Instead, 8,000 of them were systematically executed in a massacre that took several days in July 1995. TV footage showed Mladic asserting that he had  liberated  Srebrenica and gifted it to Serbs as revenge against  Turks  who ruled the region when it was part of the Ottoman Empire.   Muslim men and boys were separated from women, stripped of identification then shot. The dead were bulldozed into mass graves. The remains were later dug up and hauled away in trucks to be better hidden from the world in more remote mass graves. Over 6,900 victims have since been identified by DNA tests. The massacre was the grim culmination of a 3-1/2-year conflict in which the beefy general had pounded Sarajevo daily with the entire Bosnian Serb arsenal, killing over 11,000 people, until local sports fields were overflowing with graves. His goal, ICTY prosecutors said, was ethnic cleansing - the forcible extermination or expulsion of Muslims, Croats and other non-Serbs to clear Bosnian lands for a  Greater Serbia . Prosecutors said it was a conspiracy in which Mladic and Karadzic were aided, armed and abetted by Milosevic. Only a combination of Western pressure and covert American arms and training for Croats and Muslims turned the tide in 1995 against Mladic s army, ultimately depriving it of equipment and fuel supplies from Serbia. NATO air strikes did the rest. He spent only half his time at large as a hunted fugitive. Even after Milosevic fell to a pro-democracy uprising in 2000, Mladic remained well protected in various Belgrade apartments until 2005. He received treatment at a top military hospital. Sporadic sightings put him at a Belgrade horse race or soccer match.  When finally arrested in the shabby rural farmhouse, he put up no resistance. His right arm was lame, the apparent result of an untreated stroke.  His trial had to be delayed over and over because of his shaky health. Yet in court, Mladic grinned as a judge read out the charges of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. Srebrenica massacre survivors attending one hearing were shocked when he made a throat-slitting gesture towards a Muslim woman who had lost her husband, son and several brothers. In 2014, he refused to give evidence in support of old ally Karadzic, calling the tribunal a  satanic court .  When the time finally came on Wednesday to face judgment, Mladic delayed proceedings, first by taking a bathroom break and undergoing a blood pressure test at his request, then screaming  This is all lies, you are all liars  on returning to the court. He was hustled out of the chamber, and the tribunal announced he had been convicted of genocide and crimes against humanity. Mladic will appeal against the verdict, his lawyer said. Even with his conviction on Wednesday, Mladic s trial is unlikely to further post-war reconciliation in Bosnia. The U.S.-brokered Dayton Accords of 1995 halted the bloodshed by dividing Bosnia into a semi-autonomous Serb Republic entity and a Bosniak-Croat Federation. This did not heal ethnic splits or prevent a resurgence of Serb separatism. Most Bosnian Serbs remain convinced that Mladic is innocent, and that the tribunal is utterly biased against them. Of the 83 defendants the ICTY has convicted, over 60 of them are Serbs.  I am a very old man ... and I am not important,  Mladic  told the tribunal.  It matters what kind of legacy I will leave behind, among my people.  ",worldnews,"November 21, 2017 ",1

US renews grant for clearing bombs in Cambodia,"PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday opened a $2 million tender to help clear unexploded bombs in Cambodia weeks after the government s mine clearance agency said its U.S. funding had been stopped. Relations between Cambodia and the United States have spiraled downwards this year with the government accusing Americans of involvement in a plan by detained opposition leader Kem Sokha to bring down Prime Minister Hun Sen. Washington has rejected the accusations as baseless. Last week, it said it was cutting aid for next year s election and would take further steps after the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) was dissolved by the Supreme Court at the government s request. The U.S. embassy said it was accepting applications for a $2 million one-year grant to survey and clear unexploded ordnance in eastern Cambodia, which suffered heavy U.S. bombing during the war in neighboring Vietnam.  The United States has supported humanitarian demining in Cambodia for over 20 years and is committed to addressing our war-time legacy,  Ambassador William Heidt said in a statement.  We are looking for the best national and international experts.  The size of the contract matches the amount which the government s Cambodian Mine Action Centre said earlier this month had been cut from funding it received from the United States through Norwegian People s Aid.  We welcome the commitment in taking part in addressing the legacy of the war,  said Huy Vannak, undersecretary of state at the Interior Ministry. China, now Cambodia s closest ally, was quick to step in with an offer of help for demining soon afterwards. China is Cambodia s biggest donor and investor and has played an ever more prominent role as Western countries have criticized a crackdown on the opposition, civil society groups and media ahead of next year s election. Although it has not taken action, the European Union pointed out last week that Cambodia s access to duty free access vital to its garment industry depended on respect for human rights. Hun Sen told garment workers on Wednesday that they would be the ones to suffer - not him - if the access was withdrawn. European Union countries accounted for about 40 percent of Cambodia s exports in 2016. Most of that was clothing.  You must remember clearly that if there is any cut of buying orders, it s all the fault of a group of people of the opposition party,  Hun Sen told garment workers in Phnom Penh.  Hun Sen won t die but workers, you will die,  he said. The prime minister accused exiled opposition leaders of trying to get sanctions imposed. They have so far said they would not call for measures to curb trade because of the impact it could have on the livelihoods of an estimated 700,000 garment workers. Cambodia s economy has proved largely immune to political turbulence. The World Bank said on Wednesday it expected the economy to grow 6.9 percent next year, compared with a projected 6.8 percent pace in 2017, despite risks including uncertainty over the election.

"Uganda police say raid newspaper, detain staff over article about president","KAMPALA (Reuters) - Ugandan police raided the office of a local newspaper, detaining staff and confiscating equipment on allegations it had published an inaccurate story, the paper s lawyer and police said on Wednesday.  The day before the Tuesday evening raid, Red Pepper, Uganda s leading tabloid, published a story alleging that Rwanda believed President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda was plotting to oust President Paul Kagame. The article cited unnamed sources. The government said there were no tensions between Uganda and Rwanda. Police spokesman Emirian Kayima said eight managers and editors at the newspaper s Kampala head office were detained after police searched the paper s Kampala office and confiscated computers and mobile phones.  Kayima said the eight staff were being held at a detention facility in eastern Uganda and would appear in court when investigations were complete.  He said the story contained  serious statements and insinuations...that have grave implications on national and regional security and stability.     The paper s lawyer Maxma Mutabingwa said uniformed police told Red Pepper staff during the search that they wanted  material and information on a story published on Monday . He said some managers  homes were also searched but gave no details.  Red Pepper was not published on Wednesday and staff had not been allowed to access the offices since the raid, Mutabingwa said.  Human rights groups say harassment of independent media by security personnel has been escalating in the East African country where Museveni, 73, has ruled for 31 years. Local media including Red Pepper have reported this month on tensions between Uganda and neighboring Rwanda over a range of economic and security disputes.   There s no tension between Uganda and Rwanda...we have no problem at all (with Rwanda),  Uganda s foreign affairs ministry spokeswoman, Margaret Kafeero, told Reuters.  She said Uganda had not received any official complaint from Rwanda regarding any allegations of a plot against Kagame and that the reports in Ugandan media were  rumors . Relations between the two countries are often complicated by a shared history which has by turns been a source of mutual suspicion and amity.  Kagame, the Rwandan leader, grew up as a refugee in Uganda and also occupied a top position in the Ugandan army after serving in the guerrilla movement that helped Museveni take power in 1986.  The Rwandan leader launched his own rebellion from Uganda that ushered him into power and halted a genocide in Rwanda in which an estimated 800,000 people were killed.

Italy's Berlusconi takes fight against ban from office to European court,"STRASBOURG, France (Reuters) - Lawyers for Silvio Berlusconi argued on Wednesday at the European Court of Human Rights against his ban from holding public office, hoping for a green light that will allow him to run for prime minister at Italy s election early next year. In a hearing before the Strasbourg court, the four-times prime minister appealed against his banishment from holding public office that followed a 2013 tax fraud conviction. It is supposed to remain in place until 2019. The billionaire media tycoon was widely written off after he quit as prime minister in 2011 amid a sex scandal involving his  bunga bunga  parties, while Italian bond yields surged to unsustainable levels at the height of the euro zone debt crisis. However, the 81-year-old Berlusconi has made a remarkable comeback after open heart surgery last year and his Forza Italia (Go Italy!) party is now the lynchpin of a center-right coalition which leads in opinion polls ahead of the election. The  Berlusconi versus Italy  case is being heard by 17 judges who make up the court s Grand Chamber, which is used for particularly important and complex matters. Berlusconi has hired a top London law firm to represent him.  At the end of the hearing Edward Fitzgerald, a lawyer for Berlusconi, told reporters an  injustice  had taken place in the Italian courts.  Basic procedural guarantees were lacking for doing something as massive and draconian as depriving an elected official of his electoral mandate, and the people who elected him of their right to be represented by the person they chose.  The court will not issue a verdict on Wednesday, and even if it eventually decides in favor of Berlusconi the ruling may not come in time for him to run in the election, which must be held by May next year. In an interview on Wednesday with la Repubblica newspaper, Berlusconi said he would still be campaigning for his party whether he can stand for office or not.  Irrespective of whether I can stand, I ll be a player and I ll bring the center-right to power,  he said. Berlusconi was not present at the hearing. Berlusconi argues that because the tax fraud took place many years before the 2013 Italian law that bars him from running for office was passed, the legislation is being applied retroactively and is therefore illegitimate.  Berlusconi received a four-year prison sentence in August 2013 for organizing a complex scheme to illegally lower the tax bill of his Mediaset media company.  Three of the four years were immediately waived due to an amnesty to relieve prison overcrowding, and he was allowed to serve the remaining year in community service, helping out in an old people s home.  After the conviction, Berlusconi was expelled from Rome s Senate, or upper house of parliament. With or without Berlusconi, the election is expected to produce a hung parliament. The anti-establishment 5-Star Movement leads in opinion polls with around 28 percent of the vote, followed by the ruling center-left Democratic Party on about 25 percent.  The center-right bloc is made up of Forza Italia and the anti-immigrant Northern League, each on around 14 percent, and the right-wing Brothers of Italy, with around 5 percent.

Few tears in China as old friend Mugabe ousted in Zimbabwe,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China is shedding few tears over the ousting of its old friend Robert Mugabe as president of Zimbabwe, fed up with the ruinous state of its economy and confident a new government will not antagonize China or change course on policies towards it. China pointedly failed to offer any open support for Mugabe after the army took power last week, instead calling vaguely for a peaceful resolution under a legal framework and for talks to bridge differences. On Wednesday, the foreign ministry said it respected Mugabe s decision to resign as president, and that he remained a   good friend  of China s who made  historic contributions to Zimbabwe s independence and liberation . China s friendship with Mugabe dates back to Zimbabwe s independence struggle, which China supported. Mugabe has visited China numerous times, most recently in January when President Xi Jinping told him:  China will never forget its old friends.  But trade has sagged amid Zimbabwe s economic turmoil of recent years, and China does not rely on it for any crucial raw materials, unlike Zambia for its copper or Angola and oil. China s total trade with Zimbabwe in 2016 was worth $1.11 billion, down 15 percent on-year, a fraction of the $35.3 billion in trade China and South Africa did. Last year, China did more trade with Tunisia and Senegal than Zimbabwe.  It has been clear to China what has caused the problems, and China showed no desire to prop up Mugabe in his hour of need. China will not interfere and is happy to let Zimbabwe s people make their own choices, said Shen Xiaolei, an Africa expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences government think-tank.  The ruling party is fighting amongst itself, and his economic policies and national governance have had many problems,  Shen said.   Zimbabwe s regime was certainly going to get into trouble; I just didn t expect it would happen so fast.  In contrast to his elevated status on the continent, Mugabe is reviled in the West as a despot whose disastrous handling of the economy and willingness to resort to violence to maintain power destroyed one of Africa s most promising states. In 2015, Mugabe won the Confucius Peace Prize, supposed to be China s answer to the Nobel Peace Prize, but he turned it down according to Zimbabwe media after he learned it had no connection with the Chinese government. China had been an important ally on the world stage too for Mugabe. In 2008, China vetoed a proposed Western-backed U.N. resolution that would have imposed an arms embargo on Zimbabwe and financial and travel restrictions on Mugabe and 13 other officials, saying it would  complicate  conflict. China has denied that it knew anything about the army take over, despite a visit to Beijing by Zimbabwe s military chief, General Constantino Chiwenga, shortly before he moved against Mugabe. On Monday, the Chinese embassy in South Africa said it was  complete nonsense  to suggest Chiwenga had tipped off China about his plan, saying this was an attempt to smear China and that Mugabe had in any case approved Chiwenga s visit. However, the embassy also did not offer any support to Mugabe, reiterating that China believed Zimbabwe s crisis was an internal affair and that African people should resolve African problems. China s frustrations with Mugabe had begun to play out in its state media. Over the past week, Chinese media has run unfavorable articles about his wife, Grace, with online news portal Sina calling her  a wanton squanderer . On Sunday, the WeChat account of the overseas edition of the ruling Communist Party s official People s Daily carried a largely negative account of a 1985 visit by Mugabe to Beijing when he met former paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, the architect of China s reforms. Showing pictures of Zimbabweans carrying bundles of cash during its hyperinflation crisis, the paper said Zimbabwe s chaos could in large part be traced to Mugabe s extreme leftist, populist policies. Zhang Weiwei, a professor at Shanghai s Fudan University, described a conversation he interpreted between Deng and Mugabe in which Deng warned him of China s mistakes and urged him to embark on the same reforms as China. Mugabe did not seem to get the message, Zhang wrote.  This person didn t take anything in, and that will be his loss,  Zhang cited an exasperated Deng as saying after the meeting. There is confidence too for China that Mugabe s former vice president and likely successor, Emmerson Mnangagwa, whose sacking prompted the military to take power, will not upset China. State media has pointed out he is a known quantity, with frequent visits of his own to China. Whereas Beijing has worried about anti-Chinese feeling in Zambia, where some workers have accused Chinese firms of abuses and underpaying, there have been no such problems in Zimbabwe.  China and Africa are all-weather friends, and China and Zimbabwe are no exception,  said Wang Wei, an associate research fellow at the foreign ministry s China Institute of International Studies.  It does not matter what changes there are in government officials, the broader trend is still to develop friendly relations between China and Zimbabwe and China and Africa to promote joint prosperity and development.

Cyprus says it plans to help defuse Lebanese crisis,"ATHENS (Reuters) - Cyprus on Wednesday said it would try to help defuse a crisis in neighboring Lebanon after Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri made an unexpected stopover on the island on Tuesday night. Cyprus announced the move shortly after Hariri shelved a decision to resign at the request of Lebanon s President Michel Aoun, easing an impasse that had stirred tensions around the Middle East. Hariri met Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades at Larnaca airport for about 45 minutes late on Tuesday on his way back to Lebanon, his first visit home since he unexpectedly announced on Nov. 4 he would resign in a broadcast from Saudi Arabia.   Our common objective is stability in Lebanon, stability in our area. Within this context... the President of the Republic will undertake some initiatives precisely to promote this objective; stability in Lebanon,  Cypriot government spokesman Nikos Christodoulides said. Christodoulides said Anastasiades s initiatives would be directed toward European Union and neighboring states, but was not more specific.  Cyprus is uniquely placed, as a member state of the European Union which also maintains excellent relations with all its neighbors. That (position) is broadly recognized and would allow us to work to achieve stability in Lebanon,  he said. The island, perched on the edge of the Middle East, is broadly considered a neutral safe haven in an otherwise volatile region. It took in thousands of Lebanese fleeing civil war in the 1970s and successfully mediated an end to a 39-day siege of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem between Israeli forces and suspected Palestinian militants.

"Scope of Kerimov's immunity status up to judge to decide upon, says France","PARIS (Reuters) - The scope of the immunity status accorded to Russian businessman and lawmaker Suleiman Kerimov, who has been arrested in France, is up to the French judge dealing with the matter to decide upon, said the French foreign ministry.  Kerimov was arrested by French police at Nice airport on Monday evening in connection with a tax evasion case, and the Kremlin said it would do everything in its power to defend his lawful interests.  It is up to the judge, who has been called upon in this case, to clarify whether the charges that have been brought against him are related to his official roles and would therefore be protected by diplomatic immunity,  said French foreign ministry spokeswoman Agnes Romatet-Espagne. Kerimov is ranked by Forbes magazine as one of Russia s richest  businessman, with a net worth of $6.3 billion. His family controls Russia s largest gold producer Polyus.

Thailand arrests woman wanted over deadly 2015 bombing at shrine,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - Police in Thailand on Wednesday arrested a woman wanted in connection with a 2015 bombing in Bangkok that killed 20 people, 14 of them foreign tourists. The blast at a central Bangkok shrine popular with visitors from China and elsewhere in Asia raised fears of a spillover of violence from China s western Xinjiang region, where some members of the Uighur Muslim minority oppose Beijing s rule. No group claimed responsibility for the blast that killed five people from mainland China and two from Hong Kong and wounded more than 120 people. The Thai woman suspect, Wanna Suansan, 29 was arrested at Bangkok airport, said deputy national police chief Srivara Ransibrahmanakul. He declined to say where she had arrived from. Wanna faced various charges including premeditated murder and co-possession of explosives and weapons, police said. She is one of 17 people wanted in connection with the bombing.  After questioning police will send her to prosecutors,  Srivara told reporters at Bangkok s national police headquarters. Two ethnic Muslim Uighur men from China were accused of carrying out the bomb attack and are on trial in Thailand. They have denied all charges. Investigators said in 2015 Wanna rented a room in Bangkok to one of those men. She fled the country shortly after the attack. Police ruled out  terrorism , saying the bombing was prompted by a crackdown on human smuggling networks. But many analysts and diplomats said it was likely an act of revenge for Thailand s deportation to China of the more than 100 Uighurs in July that year. A relative of Wanna s told reporters at the national police headquarters that Wanna wanted to come back to Thailand to prove her innocence. ",worldnews,"November 22, 2017 ",1

Egypt detains 29 people on suspicion of espionage for Turkey,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt s public prosecutor has ordered the detention of 29 people suspected of espionage on behalf of Turkey and joining a terrorist organization, state news agency MENA reported on Wednesday. According to the results of an investigation by the General Intelligence Services, the group has been recording phone calls and passing information to Turkish intelligence as part of a plan to bring the Muslim Brotherhood back to power in Egypt, MENA said. The nationalities of the suspects were not specified. They are also accused of money laundering and trading currency without a license.  Ties between Ankara and Cairo have been strained since the army ousted President Mohamed Mursi of the Brotherhood following mass protests against his rule in 2013. The Muslim Brotherhood has close ties with Turkey s ruling AK Party and many of its members have fled to Turkey since the group s activities were banned in Egypt. Following Mursi s ouster, Egypt branded the Brotherhood, the world s oldest Islamist movement, a terrorist organisation and most of its senior members have been arrested, driven into exile or underground. The Brotherhood says it is a peaceful organization and has condemned the crackdown. ",worldnews,"November 22, 2017 ",1
North Korea calls terror relisting 'serious provocation' by Trump: state media,"SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea denounced on Wednesday U.S. President Donald Trump s decision to relist it as a state sponsor of terrorism, calling it a  serious provocation and violent infringement , North Korean state media reported.  Trump put North Korea back on a list of state sponsors of terrorism on Monday, a designation that allows the United States to impose more sanctions and risks inflaming tension over North Korea s nuclear weapons and missile programs. In North Korea s first reaction to the designation, a  spokesman for the foreign ministry denied in an interview with the state media outlet KCNA, that his government engaged in any terrorism. He called the state sponsor of terrorism label  just a tool for American style authoritarianism that can be attached or removed at any time in accordance with its interests . The U.S. designation only made North Korea more committed to retaining its nuclear arsenal, the official said.  As long as the U.S. continues with its anti-DPRK hostile policy, our deterrence will be further strengthened,  he said, referring to North Korea by the initials of its official name, the Democratic People s Republic of Korea.  The U.S. will be held entirely accountable for all the consequences to be entailed by its impudent provocation to the DPRK.  The designation came a week after Trump returned from a 12-day, five-nation trip to Asia in which he made containing North Korea s nuclear ambitions a centerpiece of his discussions. Announcing the designation, Trump told reporters at the White House:  In addition to threatening the world by nuclear devastation, North Korea has repeatedly supported acts of international terrorism, including assassinations on foreign soil.

Escape from North Korea: video shows defector under fire,"SEOUL (Reuters) - A North Korean border guard briefly crossed the border with the South in the chase for a defector last week - a violation of the ceasefire accord between North and South, a video released on Wednesday by the U.N. Command (UNC) in Seoul showed. The North Koreans were only steps behind the young man when they shot him at least four times as he made his escape on Nov. 13. The video, filmed as the defector drove an army truck through the demilitarized zone and then abandoned the vehicle, gives a dramatic insight into his escape.   The defector, identified by a surgeon as a 24-year-old with the family name Oh, was flown by a U.S. military helicopter to a hospital in Suwon, south of Seoul. Doctors said he had regained consciousness, having had two operations to extract the bullets, and his breathing was stable and unassisted.   He is fine,  lead surgeon Lee Cook-Jong said at a news conference in Suwon.  He is not going to die.  A UNC official said North Korea had been informed on Wednesday that it had violated the 1953 armistice agreement, which marked the cessation of hostilities in the Korean War. The UNC official told a news conference that a soldier from the North Korean People s Army (KPA) had crossed the Military Demarcation Line (MDL), the border between the two Koreas, for a few seconds as others fired shots at the defecting soldier.  The key findings of the special investigation team are that the KPA violated the armistice agreement by one, firing weapons across the MDL, and two, by actually crossing the MDL temporarily,  Chad Carroll, Director of Public Affairs for the UNC, told reporters.  The incident comes at a time of heightened tensions between North Korea and the international community over its nuclear weapons program, but Pyongyang has not publicly responded to the defection. The video, released by the UNC, was produced from surveillance cameras on the southern side of the the Joint Security Area (JSA) inside the demilitarized zone. When tree cover is too dense to see the wounded defector crawling across the border, it switches to infra-red. The film begins with a lone dark green army jeep speeding along empty, tree-lined roads toward the border. At one checkpoint, a North Korean guard marches impassively toward the approaching vehicle. It races by. He runs in pursuit. After passing a memorial to North Korea founder Kim Il Sung, where tourists often gather, the jeep runs into a ditch just meters from the border, which is not clearly marked. For several minutes the driver tries to free the vehicle, but the wheels spin uselessly in fallen leaves. The driver abandons the vehicle and sprints away, pushing tree branches out of his way and sending leaves flying. He scrambles up a slope to cross just seconds before more guards appear, shooting as they run.  One slides into a pile of dead leaves to open fire before running forward and appearing to briefly cross the dividing line between the two countries. He quickly turns on his heel. The video does not show the moment the defector is hit, but he is seen lying in a pile of brush next to a concrete wall in a later edited clip.  The UNC s Carroll said the position was still exposed to North Korean checkpoints across the border. Allied troops operating the cameras had by then notified their commanders and a quick reaction force had assembled on the South Korean side, according to Carroll. The video does not show this force. Infrared imagery shows two South Korean soldiers crawling through undergrowth to drag the wounded North Korean to safety, while the deputy commander of the border security unit oversees the rescue from a few meters away. Doctors have conducted a series of surgeries to remove four bullets from the critically wounded soldier, who arrived at the hospital having lost a large amount of blood.  From a medical point of view he was almost dead when he was first brought here,  said the surgeon, Lee. Hospital officials said the man remains in intensive care. The soldier showed signs of depression and possible trauma, in addition to a serious case of parasites that has complicated his treatment, the hospital said in a statement. Lee said last week one of the flesh-colored parasites he removed from the soldier s digestive tract was 27 cm (10.6 in) long. Continuing stress made the soldier hesitant to talk, but he had been cooperative, doctors said. The patient first recovered consciousness on Sunday, and asked where he was in South Korea, Lee said. He was in  agony  when he came to, the surgeon added. Since then doctors have played South Korean pop music for him, and American action movies including  The Transporter   from 2002. On average more than 1,000 North Koreans defect to the South every year, but most travel via China and numbers have fallen since Kim Jong Un came to power in 2011. It is unusual for a North Korean to cross the land border dividing the two Koreas. They  have been in a technical state of war since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. The last time a North Korean soldier had defected across the JSA was in 2007. ",worldnews,"November 22, 2017 ",1

EU preaches tough love for impatient Ukraine,"BRUSSELS/KIEV (Reuters) - Ukraine s EU membership ambitions will collide with the West s reform demands at a summit on Friday with EU leaders ready to admonish Kiev for failing to implement anti-corruption laws that would bring it closer to the West, officials say. European Union leaders gathering in Brussels for the biennial  Eastern Partnership  summit with Ukraine and five other former Soviet republics are worried Kiev has lost interest in the reforms it began with zeal after its pro-European uprising in 2014. At stake for Kiev is new funding to rebuild the corruption-ridden economy, including a possible donors  conference, more EU  financial-sector aid and a Lithuanian-led push for 10-year development fund.  We have to show some tough love because friendly advice isn t working  said a senior EU official preparing the summit with Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova, Azerbaijan, Armenia and Belarus.  Ukraine is the highest-profile test of the EU s 15-year-old policy to build an outer ring of market democracies from the Caucasus to the Sahara without offering EU membership. Backed by Washington, the strategy has so far worked by rewarding President Petro Poroshenko with attention, visa-free travel for Ukrainians and a free-trade deal with the EU.  But Ukraine remains perceived as one of the world s most corrupt countries, according to Transparency International, ranked 131 out of 176 countries in 2016.  Olena Halushka of the non-governmental Anti-Corruption Action Centre in Kiev said the political elite was now trying to  fake  the reforms agreed with Western donors, including energy, judicial and police overhauls.   We are also witnessing attempts to roll back the achievements,  she said of Poroshenko s reforms since 2014. EU leaders are expected to  acknowledge the European aspirations  of Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova in a summit statement - EU code for closer ties but not membership. Kiev wants a promise of EU membership. Washington and Brussels say Ukraine would do well to follow the reformist-minded Baltic countries, now EU members, who as outsiders in the 1990s were told they had little chance of joining the bloc.  Ukraine is at risk of taking our aid for granted,  said a second EU official involved in policymaking with Kiev.  Poroshenko, whose country is battling with a Russian-backed insurgency in eastern Ukraine, says the country has implemented more reforms in the past three years than in all of the last 24. But lately, the message from Poroshenko s government is to back off in the run-up to the 2019 presidential elections, which will be the focus now, EU officials and diplomats say.  A year ago, things were looking promising, but now vested interests are fighting back,  said a third EU official.  We can t plough more money into Ukraine on that basis.  There are achievements, including a revamped police force, a wealth declarations database for officials and modernization of the banking sector and state-owned energy firm Naftogaz.  But some proposed laws, such as to legalize agricultural land sales and set up an independent anti-corruption court, have been pushed back, while some existing reforms are under threat.  The wealth declarations register, launched in October 2016, is ineffective because authorities have not introduced software that would cross-reference data and identify malfeasance. Slow progress on the anti-corruption court and backtracking on gas pricing commitments have also stalled funding under Ukraine s $17.5 billion IMF program. Accusations that Ukrainian officials have tried to undermine anti-corruption investigators are a concern, EU officials said. With no threats other than withholding aid, the EU has few new incentives, having granted visa-free travel and market access to Ukraine.    We definitely need to look for new carrots, which would be linked to reforms,  said activist Halushka. ",worldnews,"November 22, 2017 ",1
Turkey expects S-400 defense system from Russia in 2019: minister,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey expects to receive its first Russian S-400 surface-to-air missiles in 2019, Defence Minister Nurettin Canikli said on Wednesday, the first time Ankara has given a firm timeline for a deal that has alarmed its NATO allies. Turkey has been in negotiations with Russia to buy the S-400 for more than a year, a decision seen by Washington and some of its other allies in NATO as a snub to the Western military alliance. Giving the most detail yet on the deal to parliament s budget committee, Canikli said it called for delivery of two S-400 systems, but that the second one was optional. The deal has raised concern among NATO countries in part because the weapons cannot be integrated into the alliance s defenses. Ankara has said it had no choice but to buy the Russian missiles, because NATO countries did not offer a cost-effective alternative.  Once these systems are received, our country will have secured an important air defense capability. This solution aimed at meeting an urgent need will not hinder our commitment to developing our own systems,  he said. Relations between Turkey and Russia deteriorated sharply over years during which they backed opposite sides in the war in neighboring Syria, but have improved markedly over the past year. The countries are now cooperating on Syrian peace efforts.  Canikli said Turkey was also in talks with the Franco-Italian EUROSAM consortium on developing its own missile defense systems, after signing a memorandum to strengthen cooperation between the three countries in defense projects.  With the memorandum in question, Turkish, French and Italian firms have started cooperation to identify, develop, produce and use a more advanced version of the SAMP-T (missile system) in a common consortium,  he said. Turkey aimed to bring talks with EUROSAM to a  definitive end  soon, he said, adding that Ankara aimed to finalize the deal by the end of 2017 at the latest. Turkey has been working to develop its own defense systems and equipment, and has lined up several projects for the coming years, including combat helicopters, tanks, drones and more. Canikli said Turkey received bids last Friday for the production of 500 Altay battle tanks, of which 250 are optional.  Shares of Turkish commercial and military vehicle producer Otokar rose almost 3 percent following the news about the 7 billion euro ($8.24 billion) domestic tank project.

Indian navy the odd man out in Asia's 'Quad' alliance,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The Trump administration is pushing security ties between the United States, India, Japan and Australia, but the revival of the Asian  Quad  must overcome lingering mistrust in New Delhi towards its allies that hampers genuine military cooperation. Joint naval drills have been at the heart of a relationship that analysts widely see as a move to counterbalance China s rising power by binding the region s leading democracies more closely together. But while the navies of the United States, Japan and Australia can easily operate together - based on common U.S.-designed combat systems and data links - India is the outlier.  Not only are most of its ships and warplanes Russian-made, its government and military remain deeply reluctant to share data and open up sensitive military communications systems. The United States has carried out more naval exercises with India than any other nation. But naval sources and experts say these are more about  cultural familiarization  than drills for joint combat. Because India will not sign an agreement on sharing data, naval exercises are conducted through voice and text commands with rudimentary SMS-style data exchange, Indian and Japanese military sources said.  Think of it as directing your friend to your house in the 1980s. Your left may be his right, neither of you have situational awareness,  said Abhijit Iyer-Mitra, a senior fellow at New Delhi s Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies who has tracked the military exercises.  What the Americans want is 2017 - drop a pin on Google maps and hit share. You know where your friend is and he knows where your house is and how to get to it.  The Indian defense ministry did not respond to a request for a comment. The so-called Quad to discuss and cooperate on security emerged briefly as an initiative a decade ago - much to the annoyance of China - and was revived recently, with an officials-level meeting this month on the sidelines of a regional gathering in Manila. The Trump administration has talked up cooperation with India as part of efforts for a  free, open and thriving Indo-Pacific . Describing the Indian and Pacific Oceans as a  single strategic arena , U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson described India and the United States as regional  bookends .  In concrete terms, it will lead to great co-ordination between the Indian, Japanese and American militaries including maritime domain awareness, anti-submarine warfare, amphibious warfare, and humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, and search and rescue,  he said.  To be sure, India and the United States have steadily been bringing more powerful ships into their annual  Malabar  drills that have been expanded to include Japan in recent years.  This year the USS Nimitz carrier group was deployed for the maneuvers off India s eastern coast, along with an aircraft carrier from India and a helicopter carrier from Japan. But a Japanese Maritime Self Defence Forces official said when Japan conducts drills with the Indian navy, communication is done mostly through voice transmission. There is no satellite link that would allow the two navies to access information and share monitor displays in on-board command centers. Communication is usually the most difficult aspect of any joint drill, he said. The exercises are meant to lay the ground for joint patrols that the U.S. eventually wants to conduct with India and its allies across the Indian Ocean and the Pacific.  U.S. Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesman, said better interoperability was a goal of the exercises and noted that India s enhanced role as a major U.S. defense partner would help boost the relationship.   The designation of India as a major defense partner is significant and is intended to elevate defense trade and technology sharing with India to a level commensurate with that of our closest allies and partners,  he said.  As this relationship matures so will the level of interoperability.  Last year, India signed a military logistics pact with the United States after a decade of wrangling, but two other agreements are stuck.  The United States says the Communication and Information Security Memorandum of Agreement (CISMOA) would allow it to supply India with encrypted communications equipment and systems. The Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement is the other pact that would set a framework through which the United States could share sensitive data to aid targeting and navigation with India. India is concerned that agreeing to the CISMOA would open up its military communications to the United States, and even allow it to listen in on operations where Indian and U.S. interests may not coincide - such as against arch-rival Pakistan, military officials in New Delhi say. Captain Gurpreet Khurana, executive director at the government-funded National Maritime Foundation, said India s underlying concern was having its autonomy constrained by binding its military into U.S. codes and operating procedures. Once, the Americans proposed a portable  suitcase  communications system called the CENTRIXS which could transmit full situational awareness data to Indian ships while the two navies practised together. India refused to allow it to be plugged in for the duration of the exercise, citing operational security, according to an Indian source briefed on the planning of the exercises.  Even the joint air exercises that the two countries are conducting as a follow-on to Malabar are severely restricted, the source said. India sends its Russian-acquired Sukhoi jets to the drills, but their radars and jammers are turned off.  David Shear, who served as Assistant Secretary of Defense for Asia under President Barack Obama, said U.S. forces, particularly the Navy, were well aware of the interoperability constraints to interacting with India.  They understand what the obstacles are and that this is going to be a long-term project,  he said.  ",worldnews,"November 22, 2017 ",1

Kuwait's Emir in hospital for medical checks after cold: agency,"KUWAIT (Reuters) - Kuwait s elderly ruler, Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber al-Sabah, was admitted to hospital on Wednesday for medical checks after suffering from a cold, the state news agency KUNA reported.

He was nominated ruler of the key U.S. regional ally and OPEC oil exporter in 2006, after Emir Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah died and his successor, Sheikh Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah, was appointed only to be unanimously voted out of office by parliament due to illness.

Germany's figurehead president now best hope of unlocking political crisis,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Frank-Walter Steinmeier was hardly Chancellor Angela Merkel s first choice for the largely ceremonial job of German president, but the lifelong Social Democrat may be her best hope of holding onto power amid an unprecedented political crisis. Steinmeier, 61, a two-time foreign minister, met on Tuesday with political leaders from the Greens and pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) after Merkel s bid to forge a three-way coalition with those parties collapsed. On Wednesday, he will meet with Horst Seehofer, head of the Bavarian sister party of Merkel s conservatives. On Thursday, he will meet Martin Schulz, head of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the second largest in the Bundestag lower house of parliament, to urge him to reconsider his party s rejection of another  grand coalition  with Merkel s conservatives for the good of the country. Some 30 of the SPD s 153 parliamentary members questioned the rejection of such a coalition this week, the Bild newspaper reported on Wednesday. It said Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel also favored resuming the coalition that has ruled for the past four years. Merkel favors new elections over a minority government, but Steinmeier is pressing political leaders to avoid a new poll that experts say would further strengthen the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) after it moved into parliament with nearly 13 percent of the vote on Sept. 24.  The German president, who is now as powerful as seldom seen in German constitutional history, holds the reins,  the Rheinische Post newspaper wrote on Tuesday. This is the first time a German president has had to get actively involved in trying to forge a new coalition government. The architects of the German constitution devised a complicated process to prevent the frequent elections that weakened the Weimar Republic in the 1920s and facilitated the rise of Adolf Hitler. But new elections are likely around April if Steinmeier cannot bring Merkel s conservatives, the Greens and FDP back to the negotiating table, or persuade his former SPD colleagues to return to government. The SPD wants a spell in opposition to rebuild after its worst election result since the 1930s. Steinmeier, following the tradition of all previous German presidents, gave up his party membership upon taking office. But he could wield some influence with top SPD players after years in leadership roles. His first months as president were lackluster, with some commentators skeptical that the veteran political operator could emulate the success of his predecessor Joachim Gauck, a former East German pastor, in serving as Germany s moral compass. But last month Steinmeier delivered a powerful address on the anniversary of German reunification and then went to Russia to try to repair strained ties with President Vladimir Putin - the first German head of state to visit Moscow since 2010. A carpenter s son from the west German state of North-Rhine Westphalia, Steinmeier is a long-time confidante of former chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. Steinmeier failed to win election as chancellor in 2009, but later won plaudits from the German public for donating a kidney to his seriously ill wife. He has long experience of working with Merkel after serving as foreign minister in the first  grand coalition  between the SPD and conservatives in 2005-09 and then resuming that role in 2013-17, when the two parties allied again. He and Merkel worked closely together on the Minsk peace agreement aimed at ending fighting in eastern Ukraine - a complex deal that required hours of negotiations with Putin and Ukrainian leaders.  I thought Minsk was his biggest accomplishment, but it may pale in comparison with the effort involved in building a functioning government in his own country,  said Olaf Boehnke of the Rasmussen Global consultancy.  Merkel and Steinmeier actually have a good working relationship. And now he s in the driver s seat,  Boehnke said.   ",worldnews,"November 21, 2017 ",1
German political grandees press parties to compromise for stability,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Two veteran allies of Chancellor Angela Merkel appealed to Germany s parties on Tuesday to strike a compromise and form a stable government that could drag Europe s biggest economy out of a political impasse. The collapse of talks between Merkel s conservative bloc, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and environmentalist Greens has thrown Germany into political uncertainty and raised the prospect of new elections. It has cast doubt over whether Merkel, Europe s most powerful leader after 12 years in office, will serve a fourth term after her conservatives bled support to the far-right in a Sept. 24 election, though still won the most seats. There are wider implications too for Europe since the collapse of talks means the euro zone s ambitious plans for deeper economic integration could now be put on hold, euro zone officials said in Brussels on Tuesday.  Merkel s former finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, now in the impartial role of parliamentary president, said compromise was the order of the day while chancellery chief Peter Altmaier gave parties three weeks to sort out the mess.  We must be in a situation in the next three weeks where there is clarity about whether there can be a stable government on the basis of this election result,  Altmaier, also acting finance minister, told ZDF television. Merkel has said she prefers new elections to an unstable minority government. Until a government is agreed, she continues as acting chancellor and previous ministers remain in post, while the newly-elected parliament also proceeds with business. Pressure is growing on the Social Democrats (SPD) whose leader Martin Schulz has refused to contemplate re-entering a Merkel-led government after voters punished them for sharing power with her for the last four years.  Many in the SPD fear that another four-year term with Merkel, who is herself still popular, would mean their political suicide.  Altmaier appealed to the SPD to reconsider:  Like  Made in Germany , we are known for having a stable and reliable government ... we must give the SPD a chance to think.  Andrea Nahles, head of the SPD s parliamentary group reiterated that it did not want to prop up Merkel again.   We are not an emergency stop-gap for Merkel,  she said.  However, she also said the SPD would use talks with President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who is meeting party leaders to explore possibilities to form a government, to find solutions, hinting at other possible options.  We should talk about how we form a process that leads our country into a new, stable government,  Nahles said, adding this might be a minority government or new elections. Steinmeier met FDP and Greens leaders on Tuesday, but they made no comment after the meetings. One option could be an alliance between the conservatives and Greens, who built up a certain level of trust during the exploratory talks, which could be  tolerated  by the SPD. That could guarantee some government policies get through parliament. Michael Kellner, a top Greens negotiator, said it was up to Merkel s party to propose such a minority government, but did not rule it out as an option. In a sign that compromise is still possible, Merkel s Christian Democrats, FDP and Greens voted together on a motion in parliament on Tuesday to create the conditions for Ireland to pay back debts early to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). One former SPD leader Bjoern Engholm said the SPD should rethink their  no  to a grand coalition, but he said any such alliance would only be possible without Merkel. Many commentators think the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) stand to gain most from new elections although polls show no big differences from the September results. Due to a protracted procedure designed to avoid repeated elections, a new vote would take months to organize, raising worries that European reform efforts will be held up.  Europe needs a Germany that is capable of acting,  said  Schaeuble.  The reactions from abroad show that Europe and many other countries in the world are waiting for us.  He said it was important for parties to compromise to avert a crisis, saying this did not mean parties had to ditch their principles.  The task is huge, but it s not unsolvable.

"Danish PM's party dealt blow at local election, Social Democrats gain","COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen s Liberal Party suffered losses in Denmark s local elections, a possible bellwether for the next national election, which is to be held no later than mid-2019. The center-right Liberal Party received 23.1 percent of the votes in Tuesday s election, 3.5 percentage points less than in 2013. The Social Democrats gained 3 percentage points to 32.5 percent. The Social Democrats won the leadership of four of Denmark s five regions, and in at least 40 of the 98 municipalities, including the four largest cities. Coalition talks are still ongoing in some municipalities. The results are seen as a boost for Mette Frederiksen who took over the Social Democratic leadership after former Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt failed to extend her rule at the 2015 national election.  The Danes have said that it is more important to take good care of our welfare, rather than to get tax cuts,  Social Democrat spokesman Nicolai Wammen said, alluding to the government s plans to cut taxes next year. Rasmussen was  relatively satisfied  with the result, he told broadcaster TV2. A spokesman for his party said the election results were mainly driven by local agendas rather than national level politics.       The support for government ally Danish People s Party fell 1.3 percentage points to 8.8 percent, contrary to some predictions ahead of the elections. ",worldnews,"November 22, 2017 ",1
China says it respects Mugabe's decision to resign,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Wednesday that it respects Robert Mugabe s decision to resign as Zimbabwe s president, a week after the African country s army and Mugabe s former political allies moved to end his four decades of rule. The 93-year-old Mugabe had clung on for a week after an army takeover, and finally resigned on Tuesday, moments after parliament began an impeachment process, prompting dancing in the streets of the capital, Harare.  China has close ties with Zimbabwe and traditionally also with Mugabe himself, who is reviled in the West as a despot whose disastrous handling of the economy and willingness to resort to violence to maintain power destroyed one of Africa s most promising states. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang told a regular news briefing that China was happy to see Zimbabwe peacefully and appropriately resolve the issue via talks, and that its policy toward the country would not change.  China respects Mr Mugabe s decision to resign. He remains a good friend of the Chinese people,  Lu said, adding that Mugabe had made  historic contribution to Zimbabwe s independence and liberation . Zimbabwe s army seized power after Mugabe sacked his former vice president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, who was a favorite to succeed him.  Mugabe s move was an apparent bid to smooth a path to the presidency for his wife Grace, 52, known to her critics as  Gucci Grace  for her reputed fondness for luxury shopping. Mnangagwa is expected to be sworn in within days and serve the remainder of Mugabe s term until the next election, which must be held by September 2018. Asked about a U.S. call for free elections in Zimbabwe, Lu said China believed it could handle its own affairs and China hoped other countries would not interfere.  China and Zimbabwe have a close diplomatic and economic relationship, and China had stood with Mugabe s government in the face of Western economic sanctions, investing in auto, diamond, tobacco and power-station projects. In August, Zimbabwe said a Chinese company planned to invest up to $2 billion to revive operations at Zimbabwe Iron and Steel Company (ZISCO), which ceased production in 2008 at the height of an economic meltdown.  That year, China vetoed a proposed Western-backed U.N. resolution that would have imposed an arms embargo on Zimbabwe and financial and travel restrictions on Mugabe and 13 other officials, saying it would  complicate , rather than ease, conflict.

Russian senators approve 'foreign agents' media bill: RIA,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia s upper house of parliament on Wednesday approved a bill which will allow the authorities to list foreign media operating in Russia as  foreign agents , responding to U.S. restrictions on two Russian media outlets, RIA news agency reported. Last week the  foreign agents law  was swiftly approved by the lower chamber of the legislature. It now needs President Vladimir Putin s signature to become law. The move by the compliant parliament heavily dominated by Putin s loyalists comes after his threat this month that Russia would respond in kind to what he said were Washington s measures to restrict the freedom of speech of Russian media organizations operating on U.S. soil.

U.S. sanctions 13 Chinese and North Korean organizations,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Tuesday imposed sanctions on 13 Chinese and North Korean organizations Washington accused of helping evade nuclear restrictions against Pyongyang and supporting the country through trade of commodities like coal. The U.S. Treasury announced the action one day after President Donald Trump put North Korea back on a list of state sponsors of terrorism, on its website. The new curbs show the Trump administration s focus on hurting trade between China and North Korea, which it sees as key to deterring Pyongyang from its ambition to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the United States.  This designation will impose further sanctions and penalties on North Korea and related persons, and supports our maximum pressure campaign to isolate the murderous regime,  said Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin. The latest sanctions included blacklisting three Chinese companies, Dandong Kehua Economy & Trade Co., Dandong Xianghe Trading Co., and Dandong Hongda Trade Co., which the Treasury Department said had done more than $750 million in combined trade with North Korea over almost five years until Aug. 31. It said they were involved in trade of coal, iron ore, lead, zinc and silver ore, lead metal and ferrous products as well as notebook computers. The sanctions also blacklisted Sun Sidong and his company Dandong Dongyuan Industrial Co. In a June report, Washington think tank C4ADS said the firm was part of an interconnected network of Chinese companies that account for a vast share of trade with North Korea.  U.S. authorities have repeatedly targeted companies and individuals from the Chinese city of Dandong, which borders North Korea, in a bid to cut off Pyongyang s major export revenue from selling natural resources, such as coal. In Beijing, foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang reiterated China s opposition to unilateral sanctions by other countries, adding it could investigate for itself any contravention of its laws or international obligations.   If other parties wish to have effective cooperation with China on this issue and really have a grasp of certain matters, they can totally share intelligence with China and cooperate with China to appropriately handle the issue,  Lu told a daily briefing on Wednesday.  The direct impact on listed companies may be limited as trade between China and its isolated northern neighbor has slowed substantially since the United Nations imposed a ban in September on North Korean exports of coal, iron, iron ore, lead, lead ore and seafood. In February, China also prohibited coal purchases from North Korea. China does not strictly enforce financial rules in the Dandong area, said Anthony Ruggiero, a North Korea expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. As a result, Dandong draws companies interested in making a profit by selling to North Korea, he said. The new sanctions also hit several North Korean companies that send workers to countries such as Russia, Poland, Cambodia and China. United States authorities said they are seeking to cut off the money North Korea makes from the export of labor.  Besides targeting sources of weapons technology, the curbs were the first time the United States sought to directly attack North Korea s daily consumer trade, said Peter Harrell, a sanctions expert at the Center for a New American Security.   We are sanctioning companies involved in ordinary trade,  Harrell said.  That s the logical next step.  The sanctions aim to further isolate Pyongyang, said Heather Nauert, a State Department spokeswoman, adding that she did not think targeting more Chinese firms would affect Beijing s cooperation on the North Korean issue.  I don t think it jeopardizes anything,  she said.  I think the world has come together on this issue.  We have a good relationship with China. That s not going to change.

Arrested Indonesian parliament speaker pleads to keep his job,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia s speaker of parliament, who was arrested last week over his alleged role in a $170 million graft case, has sent a letter from his cell to house leaders pleading to be allowed to keep his job while he fights the charges. Setya Novanto, who has denied wrongdoing, is being held for 20 days for questioning by Indonesia s Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK). He made the request in a letter handwritten in his holding cell that was released to the media late on Tuesday. The KPK is investigating state losses of about $170 million after allegations that sums ranging from $5,000 to $5.5 million, generated by marking up procurement costs for national electronic ID cards, were divided up among politicians in parliament.  I ask other parliament leaders to give me an opportunity to prove that I wasn t involved,  Novanto wrote.   And in the meantime do not organize an ethics council plenary session on the possibility of making me non-active either as parliament speaker or as a member of parliament.  Novanto, also chairman of Golkar, Indonesia s second-largest party and a partner in the ruling coalition, is one of the most senior politicians to be detained by the KPK, which is popular among Indonesians for targeting members of the establishment suspected of abuse of power.  His battle with the graft agency has gripped Indonesia, where newspapers have splashed the story on front pages and memes mocking him have circulated on social media. He has clung to power through several previous corruption cases and repeatedly missed summonses for questioning by the agency in recent months, saying he needed heart surgery. Novanto was named a suspect on Nov. 10 again after using a controversial legal maneuver to get earlier charges dropped last month. In another letter, addressed to Golkar, Novanto said  there has been no discussion of me temporarily or permanently stopping as chairman of Golkar . In that letter he nominated Idrus Marham to serve as acting chairman of the party. Novanto s lawyer, Fredrich Yunadi, told Reuters it was up to parliament and party officials to decide if he should keep his posts, but he was confident that his client would win his case.    We have strong proof (and) in every court we always win,  Yunadi said. Asked if he was concerned about the strength of evidence against Novanto, KPK spokesman Febri Diansyah said:  From the beginning the KPK has had strong evidence, and the two people we have put on trial already (in this case) have been found guilty even up to an appeal stage.

"Rohingya refugees 'drained' by trauma, says U.N. refugee chief","SEOUL (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims who fled to Bangladesh from violence in Myanmar have been  drained  by the trauma they suffered during the crisis and a struggle to overcome desperate want, the United Nations refugee chief said on Wednesday. More than 600,000 Rohingya have fled Buddhist-majority Myanmar since late August this year for neighboring Bangladesh, driven out by a military clearance operation in Rakhine State. The refugees  suffering has caused an international outcry, spurring appeals by aid agencies for millions of dollars in funds to tackle the crisis.  I found this was a population that had almost no response. Very passive,  said Filippo Grandi, the U.N. high commissioner for refugees, describing his visit late in September to camps where the refugees were staying.  You almost felt there was nothing left and that everything had been drained by this,  he told Reuters in an interview in his first visit to the South Korean capital. He saw the lassitude as a symptom of trauma, he added.  We haven t seen this kind of trauma for a very long, long time,  the Italian diplomat said.  Maybe I saw it in the  90s in central Africa.  Grandi coordinated UN humanitarian activities in the Democratic Republic of Congo during its 1996-97 civil war. The success of aid efforts by the United Nations and non-government bodies depends on the Myanmar government to defuse the hostility facing humanitarian workers in Rakhine, Grandi said.  It s not political work, it s not to favor one community over the other,  he said.   On the contrary, it s directed to all those who are in need. And when members of the Buddhist community are in need, they certainly qualify for that. I think it s important that they stress that, they do that more,  said Grandi. Tension had been rising between the government and aid agencies even before the spasm of violence that began in late August. Officials had accused the World Food Programme of aiding insurgents after high-energy biscuits were discovered in July at a forest encampment the authorities said belonged to a militant group, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army.  Longstanding antipathy among ethnic Rakhine Buddhists - who say the UN and nongovernment bodies favor the Rohingya with aid deliveries   spiked in August, with protesters demanding that aid agencies leave and the U.N. warning staff against rising hostility. Since the Aug. 25 militant attacks in Rakhine, the government has barred most aid agencies, except for the Red Cross organizations, from working in the state s north, and curtailed their activities elsewhere in the state. In several cases aid deliveries have been forcibly blocked by Rakhine Buddhists. The U.N. s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has said the World Food Programme resumed some food distribution in northern Rakhine this month, but limited access meant agencies still do not know how many people were internally displaced over the last three months.   Access remains restricted for most humanitarian actors in northern Rakhine, preventing them from reaching many people in need,  the agency said.  In central Rakhine, humanitarian organizations also continue to face access constraints.  ",worldnews,"November 22, 2017 ",1

Turkey orders detention of 216 people in post-coup probe: Anadolu,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish authorities have issued detention warrants for 216 people, including former finance ministry personnel, suspected of having links to last year s failed coup attempt, the state-run Anadolu news agency said on Wednesday. It said 17 former finance ministry personnel had been detained so far and another 65 were sought over alleged links to Gulen s network, Anadolu said.  Separately, authorities carried out operations across 40 provinces targeting  private imams  believed to be recruiting members to the network of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen from Turkey s armed forces. Ankara blames Gulen for orchestrating the July 15 coup attempt last year and has repeatedly demanded the United States extradite him, so far in vain. Gulen denies involvement. In the aftermath of the coup, more than 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial and some 150,000 have been sacked or suspended from their jobs in the military, public and private sector. The extent of the purges has unnerved rights groups and Turkey s Western allies, who fear President Tayyip Erdogan is using the abortive putsch as a pretext to stifle dissent. The government, however, says the measures are necessary due to the gravity of the threats it is facing following the military coup attempt, in which 240 people were killed.

Australia's Victoria state closer to legalizing assisted death,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia s second-largest state on Wednesday took another step towards adopting a law allowing voluntary assisted dying for terminally ill patients. Any resident of Victoria state over 18, with a terminal illness and with less than six months to live can request a lethal dose of medication under the new legislation. Assisted dying will remain illegal in Australia s other five states. In a vote in Victoria s upper house, 22 of 40 senators supported the legislation.  The legislation required amendments to pass the upper house, including halving the time frame for eligible patients to access the scheme, reduced from 12 months to live to six months to live.  The amendments must be approved by the lower house before becoming law. The legislation is not expected to be opposed. There will be exemptions for sufferers of conditions such as motor neurone disease and multiple sclerosis, who can request a lethal dose of medication even if they have been given up to a year to live. Many countries have legalized euthanasia, including Canada, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and some states in the United States. But Australia s federal government has opposed legalizing euthanasia even though the remote Northern Territory, which does not hold Australian statehood, became the first jurisdiction in the world to do so in 1995. The federal government enacted its own legislation to override the Northern Territory law in 1997 under rules allowed by the constitution. State law, however, can not be overridden.

World Bank sees no slowing in Cambodia's strong growth,"PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodia s economy is forecast to grow 6.9 percent next year,  compared with a projected 6.8 percent pace in 2017, despite risks including uncertainties over next year s election, the World Bank said on Wednesday. Cambodia s political turbulence has had little impact on economic growth, which has hovered around 7 percent for the past six years. The World Bank said textile exports had moderated and the construction sector showed signs of slowing, but other manufacturing exports had increased and Cambodia was also drawing more tourists - particularly from China.  The outlook remains positive,  it said in a report.  A possible slowdown of the regional economy, especially China, and potential election related uncertainties, however, pose downside risks to the outlook.  China is now Cambodia s biggest aid donor and investor, but Western donors remain important and Cambodia has been increasingly at odds with them in the run-up to the 2018 election. They have condemned the arrest of Prime Minister Hun Sen s main rival, Kem Sokha, the dissolution of the main opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) and a crackdown on civil rights groups and independent media. The government accuses Kem Sokha of plotting to take power with American help and his party of treason - charges the opposition says are politically motivated to ensure Hun Sen keeps his more than three-decade hold on power. Sweden said on Tuesday it was stopping some aid and the United States said it was ending election funding and would take further concrete steps. World Bank senior country economist Miguel Sanchez said uncertainty had affected Cambodia in previous election years, leading to postponed investment decisions and a decline in foreign currency deposits.  It was temporary,  he told a news conference. ",worldnews,"November 22, 2017 ",1
China probes former chief of internet regulator for suspected graft,"BEIJING (Reuters) - The former head of China s powerful internet regulator is under investigation for suspected corruption, the ruling Communist Party said, the latest senior official to be caught up in a sweeping campaign against graft. Lu Wei was suspected of serious discipline breaches, the party s corruption-busting Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) said in a brief statement late on Tuesday, using a euphemism for graft. Reuters was unable to reach Lu or a representative to seek comment. At the height of his influence, Lu, a colorful and often brash official by Chinese standards, was seen as emblematic of China s increasingly pervasive internet controls.  Organizers of China s first World Internet Conference in 2014, set up under Lu to promote Beijing s vision of internet governance, irked foreign tech firms by seeking their agreement on a last-minute declaration on  internet sovereignty .  Tech industry representatives ultimately declined to sign the pledge, and rights groups condemned the declaration as an attempt to undermine internet freedom. In 2015, he told reporters,  Indeed, we do not welcome those that make money off China, occupy China s market, even as they slander China s people. These kinds of websites I definitely will not allow in my house.  But courting China s powerful internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China, was a key task for companies hoping to stay in his good graces or gain access to the huge internet market. When Lu visited Facebook Inc s U.S. campus in 2014, Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of the social networking site that has long been blocked in China, greeted Lu in Mandarin, according to a Chinese government website. But Lu s downfall, foreshadowed by his June 2016 replacement as head of the internet regulator and the loss of his other posts, is unlikely to signal a reversal of internet control policies, which have tightened further under successor Xu Lin. In a separate statement on its website on Wednesday, the CCDI emphasized the significance of Lu being the first  tiger , or senior official, to be brought to heel for corruption since the key 19th Communist Party Congress held last month. It said that under Lu, the cyberspace administration did not carry out President Xi Jinping s instructions in a timely or resolute fashion.  The improper use of power occurred on occasion, and the safeguarding of political security was not strong enough,  it said, without elaborating on any of Lu s specific wrongdoings.       Lu worked his way up though China s official Xinhua news agency before becoming head of propaganda in Beijing and then moving to internet work in 2013. He became a deputy propaganda minister after being replaced at the internet regulator.  The government has blocked sites it deems could challenge Communist Party rule or threaten stability, including sites such as Facebook and Google s main search engine and Gmail service. Xi has waged war against deep-rooted corruption since taking office five years ago, punishing hundreds of thousands of officials. ",worldnews,"November 22, 2017 ",1
Small eruption at Bali volcano triggers Singapore travel advisory,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia s Mount Agung volcano in Bali has let out a puff of black smoke and ash in a small eruption, prompting Singapore to advise its citizens to be ready to evacuate the holiday island at short notice amid concern about a bigger eruption. Authorities have not changed the alert status on Agung, which remains at one level below the highest and there have been no reports of flight cancellations.  Singaporeans should defer non-essential travel to the affected areas of the island at this juncture,  Singapore s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a travel notice on Wednesday.  You should also be ready to evacuate at short notice.  Eruptions could result in ash clouds that could  severely disrupt air travel , it said. Agung looms menacingly over eastern Bali at a height of just over 3,000 meters (9,842 feet). It last erupted in 1963, killing more than 1,000 people and razing several villages. Indonesia has nearly 130 volcanoes, more than any other country. Many of them show high levels of activity but it can be months before an eruption. A spokesman for Indonesia s National Disaster Mitigation agency, said via a text message that there had been a  phreatic eruption  late on Tuesday with black smoke reaching 700 meters (2,300 ft), followed by falling ash, gravel and sand.  These types of eruptions   called phreatic   are the product of rock that already exists being shattered violently when water heated by the rising magma under Agung quickly turns to steam,  according to a blog post on the Discovermagazine.com website.  The disaster agency recommended against any activity within 6-7.5 km (3.7-4.6 miles) of the crater. It said that 29,245 people were staying in 278 evacuation camps. At one stage, after authorities put Agung s alert status at the highest level of four in September, more than 130,000 people  left their homes. The alert level was lowered to three on Oct. 29. Australia left its travel advice unchanged and told citizens to  monitor local media reports, follow the instructions of local authorities, and stay outside the existing exclusion zone . Bali, famous for its surf, beaches and temples, attracted nearly 5 million visitors last year, but business has slumped in areas around the volcano since September when Agung s volcanic tremors began to increase. Tourism, a cornerstone of Bali s economy, is Indonesia s fourth-biggest earner of foreign currency after natural resources like coal and palm oil. ",worldnews,"November 22, 2017 ",1
Singapore sees running autonomous buses on public roads from 2022,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore is hoping to deploy autonomous buses on public roads in three different districts of the city-state from 2022 to provide better connectivity, the country s Ministry of Transport said in a statement on Wednesday. Countries around the world are encouraging the development of self-driving technologies. High-density Singapore, which has manpower shortages in many sectors, is at the forefront of such efforts and is hoping to prompt its residents to use more shared vehicles and public transport.  There are at least 10 companies testing their autonomous technology on the island. Autonomous scheduled bus services will complement human-driven public buses, and will initially travel on less crowded roads, according to the statement.  Autonomous on-demand shuttles will allow commuters to hail the services via their mobile phones. The government said it was seeking inputs from the industry and research institutions on the key requirements for the successful pilot launch of these autonomous vehicles.

Japan special panel to weigh timing of emperor's abdication,"TOKYO (Reuters) - The timing of Emperor Akihito s abdication, Japan s first in nearly two centuries, is to be discussed by a special panel that will meet from Dec. 1, the top government spokesman said on Wednesday. Akihito, who turns 84 on Dec. 23 and has had heart surgery and treatment for prostate cancer, said in rare remarks last year that he feared age might make it hard to fulfill his duties. A law adopted in June that allows him to step down and be succeeded by Crown Prince Naruhito, 57, left details, such as timing, to be worked out. News the Imperial Household Council - whose 10 members include Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and the chief justice of the Supreme Court along with two royals - would convene grabbed domestic headlines after Abe called on Akihito on Tuesday, apparently to inform the emperor of the meeting. Once considered divine, Japan s emperor is defined in the post-war constitution as a  symbol of the state and of the unity of the people , and he has no political power. But Akihito, who has spent much of his time on the throne seeking to soothe the wounds of a war fought in his father Hirohito s name, and consoling people suffering from disasters or other woes, is widely respected by many average Japanese. At a special news conference to announce the meeting, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga did not comment on media reports that two options were being considered - March 31, 2019, or April 30 that year.  After hearing (the panel s) opinion, based on that, we would like to decide the date promptly,  he said. The government had proposed the emperor retire at the end of 2018 but Imperial Household Agency officials demurred, media have said, citing a cluster of rituals and other events around that time. Some in government, however, now worry an alternate proposal of March 31, 2019, would be complicated by nationwide local elections set for that spring, media said. Once Akihito steps down, a new  imperial era  will begin, replacing the current  Heisei , or  achieving peace  period, which began on Jan. 8, 1989, the day he took the throne. Japan uses the Western-style Gregorian calendar but has also preserved the ancient custom in which the reign of a new emperor ushers in a new era. ",worldnews,"November 22, 2017 ",1
Air China indefinitely suspends flights between Beijing and Pyongyang,"TAIPEI/BEIJING (Reuters) - Air China Ltd has indefinitely suspended flights between Beijing and Pyongyang, citing poor demand as North Korea faces growing sanctions from the United States over its nuclear weapons and missile programs. An official in the company s Beijing-based press office, who only gave his surname as Ding, told Reuters on Wednesday that flights were suspended because  business was not good . He declined to comment on when flights might resume. The suspension by China s national flag carrier comes shortly after a visit by a senior Chinese envoy to the city and also coincides with a U.S. decision to put North Korea back on a list of state sponsors of terrorism. Air China flights to Pyongyang, which have traditionally operated on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, began in 2008, but have frequently been canceled because of unspecified problems, state media has said.  Last year, Air China halted flights seasonally for winter but resumed them in March. So far it is not selling tickets for any 2018 flights, according to Routes Online. One staff member in the company s Pyongyang office who declined to give his name told Reuters that Air China can resume the flights whenever there is enough demand and the office will operate normally even while there are no scheduled flights between Beijing and Pyongyang.  Air China s Beijing-based press office declined to provide further comment.  The company canceled some flights in April but later said that it would increase their number in May. The United States has urged China to do more to press North Korea to stop what the United States sees as belligerent defiance of U.N. resolutions. China s foreign ministry on Tuesday said that it hoped all parties could contribute to resolving the issue on the Korean peninsula peacefully. It also said that it was not aware of the Air China situation, adding that airlines made their decisions based on market needs. ",worldnews,"November 22, 2017 ",1
Mexican leftist presidential candidate vows financial crime crackdown,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican leftist presidential frontrunner Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has pledged in his manifesto to clamp down on financial crime, and tighten money laundering, banking and tax regulations if elected next July. Lopez Obrador, the 64-year-old former mayor of Mexico City and a two-time presidential candidate, on Monday unveiled his 2018 policy platform, vowing to boost infrastructure spending while preserving economic stability. In his 415-page manifesto, published late on Monday, the founder of the National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) party said he would combat money laundering by tightening controls on the banking system, including tougher sanctions for public officials convicted of financial crimes, a new conflict-of-interest law and longer sentences for tax offenses.  Banks and financial institutions aren t victims, but rather those principally responsible for, and benefiting from, the total lack of control in money laundering,  the proposal said.  Lopez Obrador s plan also aims to ensure transparency in sworn-wealth declarations and to block the right to confidential information for people under investigation for financial crimes.    AMLO, as he is known locally, has sought to deflect accusations that he would pursue Venezuela-style socialist policies if elected, vowing instead to clean up the country s graft-stained politics. Mexico s government estimates that the drug trade, tax fraud and other crimes are worth at least 1.13 trillion pesos ($58.5 billion) a year in Mexico, with all of the funds susceptible to money laundering, according to a classified report seen by Reuters in October. The manifesto also gave details on Lopez Obrador s plan to scrap President Enrique Pena Nieto s new $13 billion Mexico City airport project, which is currently under construction.  Lopez Obrador s plan recognizes the need to ease traffic and delays at Mexico City s existing airport, but proposes preserving it while expanding a nearby military site. AMLO would add two runways and a terminal at the Saint Lucia International Airport in the State of Mexico. The expansion would cost 50 billion pesos ($2.66 billion) and take less than three years, resulting in five runways shared between Saint Lucia and the current airport, he said.  The document said this alternative would cost about one-third what will be spent on the new airport, which Lopez Obrador says would drain government coffers with maintenance costs. Pena Nieto s office said in a statement that cancelling the project would cause job losses and send a bad signal.   The macroeconomic risk for Mexico would be enormous, as it would be sending the message that Mexico doesn t respect contracts nor private investment,  the statement added.

Ninth Australian lawmaker quits as citizenship crisis widens,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - A ninth Australian lawmaker quit parliament on Wednesday after discovering she was a dual national, the latest casualty in a widening constitutional crisis that has already cost the government its majority. The resignation of Skye Kakoschke-Moore, one of three senators in the center-right Nick Xenophon Team, over the surprise revelation that she was a British citizen by descent, does not affect the government s position in the upper house.  Their advice was extremely surprising to me,  Kakoschke-Moore told reporters in Adelaide, after having learnt from  Britain s Home Office that her mother s birth in then-colonial Singapore in 1957 made her British by descent. Australia s 116-year-old constitution bans dual citizens  from holding national office, in a bid to prevent split allegiances. The crisis, which is likely to ripple even wider in coming weeks as lawmakers are required to prove their status, has already cut a swath through Australia s parliament. The ruling center-right coalition lost its one-seat majority in the lower house after Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce was found ineligible for office and expelled by the High Court. Another resignation has since weakened it further. Adherence to the dual-citizenship rule, in a country where more than half the population of 24 million were either themselves, or have a parent, born overseas, has only recently come under the spotlight, with the High Court adopting a strict interpretation of the law. In response, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull ordered all lawmakers to prove they comply with the laws by Dec. 5, and at least one lawmaker besides those who have quit has raised the possibility that she is ineligible. Senate votes from 2016 will be recounted to decide on a replacement for Kakoschke-Moore. By-elections set for Dec. 2 and Dec. 16, to replace Joyce and a lower-house government lawmaker who resigned on discovering he was British, are shaping as crucial for the government s survival. Joyce is expected to retain his seat, internal party polling published by the Australian newspaper showed, but former tennis champion John Alexander must contend with a high-profile rival in former New South Wales state Premier Kristina Keneally. The government would be reduced to minority rule if Alexander lost, forcing it to depend on a handful of independent lawmakers to retain power and pass laws. ",worldnews,"November 22, 2017 ",1

Philippines set to keep open pit mining ban as Duterte rejects call to lift it,"MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippine environment minister said on Wednesday that a ban on new open pit mining in the country would remain in place, with President Rodrigo Duterte rejecting government panel recommendations to reverse it. The ban, implemented by former environment minister Regina Lopez from April covers new projects including the $5.9-billion copper-gold Tampakan project in southern Mindanao island, the biggest stalled mining venture in the Southeast Asian nation.  The President sets the policy. The Department of Environment and Natural Resources will implement what the President deems as best for the country s interest,  Environment and Natural Resources Secretary Roy Cimatu told Reuters in a text message. Open pit mining is allowed under the laws of the Southeast Asian country, the world s top nickel ore exporter, where many mines use it to extract minerals. But Lopez said the process ruins the economic potential of places where it is carried out. Duterte said late on Tuesday that he had rejected a recommendation by the Mining Industry Coordinating Council (MICC) to lift the ban because such mining is  destroying the soil and environment and no corrective measure is immediately (being) implemented . He added that while mining brings  good profit , he  can let it go . The comments by the firebrand leader followed an announcement on Monday by his spokesman that Duterte had not reversed the ban. The MICC, an inter-agency panel that makes recommendations on mining policy, is chaired by Cimatu and Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez. Cimatu said last month that he supported the removal of the open pit ban and that his agency would strengthen regulations to prevent any excesses by miners. The ban would further halt development of the Tampakan project in the southern South Cotabato province. The project was first stopped after South Cotabato banned open-pit mining in 2010, and operator Glencore Plc quit the project five years later. Lopez, who stepped down in May after failing to win congressional confirmation after 10 months in office, has said the project would cover an area the size of 700 soccer fields in what otherwise would be agricultural land. Also covered by the ban is the $1.2 billion Silangan copper and gold mine in Mindanao by Philippine miner Philex Mining Corp. ",worldnews,"November 22, 2017 ",1
"Mexico suffers deadliest month on record, 2017 set to be worst year","MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - There were more murders in October in Mexico than in any month over at least 20 years, according to official data, in the latest grim milestone in 2017, a year on course to register the highest homicide tally since modern records began.  Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto s failure to tackle growing drug violence is seen as a major weakness ahead of next July s presidential election, where he faces an uphill battle to keep his centrist Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in power.  The data, published by Mexico s interior ministry on Monday, showed there were 2,371 murder investigations opened in October.      With 20,878 murders nationwide in the first 10 months of 2017, this year is on track to overtake 2011 as the most violent since the government began publishing such data in 1997. There were an average of 69 murders a day so far this year, putting Mexico on track to overtake the 2011 homicide tally before the end of November. In 2011, there were an average of 63 murders per day, according to Reuters calculations.   In a speech earlier this month, Pena Nieto acknowledged that crime and violence had been rising.  It has to be said, we re still not satisfied, and we still have lots more to achieve,  he said.  Security needs to remain an utmost priority for the government.  However, he also added that certain sectors of society are engaged in  bullying  Mexico s institutions, belittling the work of the police and military. Those comments were ridiculed online, where many criticized the rising violence and graft that have stained his administration. In further bad news for Pena Nieto s unpopular government, Silvestre de la Toba, the head of the Baja California Sur state human rights commission, was shot dead on Monday. His killing drew criticism from U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Roberta Jacobson, who tweeted that his death should be fully investigated.  Baja California Sur, which includes the popular resort of Los Cabos, is one of the states that has seen the sharpest rise in murders. There were 409 in the first 10 months of 2017, up 178 percent from the same period last year.  ",worldnews,"November 21, 2017 ",1
Australia defends alternative accommodation for asylum seekers against U.N. criticism,"SYDNEY/GENEVA (Reuters) - Australia s foreign minister said on Wednesday that asylum seekers occupying an abandoned Australian-run detention camp in Papua New Guinea (PNG) can relocate to alternative accommodation, challenging United Nations claims that the substitute site is unfinished and inadequate. Some 380 men have barricaded themselves into Manus Island center for more than 20 days without regular food or water supplies, defying attempts by Australia and PNG to close the facility. The asylum seekers say they fear for their safety if moved to the transit center, and risk being resettled in PNG or another developing nation permanently.  There is accommodation that is perfectly acceptable,  Australia s Foreign Minister, Julie Bishop, said in an interview with Australian Broadcasting Corp radio on Wednesday.  The stand-off on Manus Island can be ended if the men ... move from the regional processing center to the alternative accommodation that is being offered.  Mostly from Afghanistan, Iran, Myanmar, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Syria, the men are held under Australia s strict  sovereign borders  immigration policy, under which it refuses to allow asylum seekers arriving by boat to reach its shores. The stand-off has attracted the attention of the United Nations, which is a long-time critic of the conditions experienced by asylum seekers held in Australia s offshore camps. Nai Jit Lam, a regional representative for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, told a U.N. briefing in Geneva on Tuesday that asylum seekers  are still not adequately provided for outside the center .  It s still under construction ... we saw for ourselves that they are trying to complete the site as quickly as possible but the fact remains that major work is still in progress,  Lam said in a satellite phone call from Manus Island. Australia says allowing asylum seekers arriving by boat to reach its shores would only encourage people smugglers in Asia and see more people risk their lives trying to make the perilous sea voyage. It rejected an offer from New Zealand to resettle 150 of the men to focus on sending up to 1,250 asylum seekers to the United States. Conditions at the abandoned facility are getting worse each day, according to Lam, with rubbish and human waste building up and medical supplies already exhausted. Papua New Guinea s Post-Courier newspaper reported on Tuesday that immigration officials would begin evicting the men on Wednesday, the fourth such deadline imposed on the refugees to leave since the camp s closure on Oct. 31. Papua New Guinea s Immigration department did not respond to a request for comment. ",worldnews,"November 22, 2017 ",1
Weather improves but clock ticks for Argentine submarine search,"MAR DEL PLATA, Argentina (Reuters) - The search for a missing Argentine submarine and its 44-member crew was helped by calmer seas on Tuesday, but there were no new clues about its location and worries multiplied because the vessel may be running low on oxygen, a navy spokesman said. The ARA San Juan was en route from Ushuaia, the world s southernmost city, to its base in Mar del Plata and was about 300 miles (480 km) off the coast when it gave its last location on Wednesday, soon after reporting an electrical malfunction.  If the German-built submarine had sunk or was otherwise unable to rise to the surface since it sent its last signal, it would be winding down its seven-day oxygen supply.  Oxygen is a permanent worry. Every day that passes is more critical,  naval commander Gabriel Galeazzi said at an evening news conference in Mar del Plata.  More than a dozen boats and planes from Argentina, the United States, Britain, Chile and Brazil have joined the search. Authorities had been mainly scanning from the sky as storms halted the maritime hunt last weekend.  The weather improved on Tuesday, helping search efforts by sea. Wind speed slowed and waves that rose as high as 8 meters (26 feet) at the weekend diminished.   The search by patrol ships has become more effective thanks more than anything to less pounding by the waves, which have fallen to three or four meters,  navy spokesman Enrique Balbi told reporters in Buenos Aires.  We have to make the most of today and tomorrow because on Thursday the weather is expected to get more complicated,  he said. Also on Tuesday, authorities investigated white flares spotted in the South Atlantic overnight. Searchers found an empty floating raft, and noticed the flares from a distance. But the raft s brand suggested it did not belong to the ARA San Juan, which was equipped with only red flares for emergencies and green flares for other situations, the navy said. Searchers have suffered other disappointments. Analysis of satellite signals and sounds detected by underwater probes, initially thought to be messages from the crew, has found they did not come from the vessel.  The sounds could be biological. We have discarded the possibility that it was a clanging of morse code against the hull of the submarine,  Balbi said.  Relatives of crew members have been gathered at a naval base in Mar del Plata, where the search is being coordinated. The ARA San Juan was launched in 1983, the newest of three submarines in the navy s fleet, and underwent maintenance in 2008 in Argentina. Its four diesel engines and its electric propeller engines were replaced, according to specialist publication Jane s Sentinel. ",worldnews,"November 21, 2017 ",1

Half of Germans want new elections after coalition talks fail,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Half of Germans are in favor of calling a new election after Chancellor Angela Merkel failed to reach a deal to form a new coalition with two other parties, while a fifth back forming a minority government, an opinion poll showed on Wednesday. The poll, conducted by INSA for the Bild daily, showed 49.9 percent favoring another election. It also showed 48.5 percent think the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) are right to rule out joining a new  grand coalition  with Merkel s conservatives, which only 18 percent would favor. The SPD lost ground in the September election after sharing power with Merkel for the last four years. The collapse of talks between Merkel s conservative bloc, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and environmentalist Greens has thrown Germany into political uncertainty and raised the prospect of new elections. The poll showed that 28 percent blame FDP leader Christian Lindner for the failure of the talks, followed by 27 percent, who blame Merkel, while only 13 percent blame Greens leader Cem Ozdemir. Four out of 10 people polled say Merkel should run again as chancellor if new elections are called, while 24 percent would prefer another candidate for her Christian Democrats (CDU), although there is little consensus on who that should be. The poll showed that most voters would prefer a coalition between the CDU and FDP after new elections, followed by a coalition between SPD, Greens and the left-wing Linke. However, the poll showed that a new election would bring little change to the results of the September vote, with the CDU down slightly on 30 percent, the SPD steady on 21 percent, the Greens on 10 percent and the FDP on 11 percent. That would still mean that the only possible coalitions with a majority would be between the CDU and the SPD or between the CDU, FDP and Greens. ",worldnews,"November 21, 2017 ",1
Hariri back in Lebanon for first time since quitting as PM,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Saad al-Hariri returned to Beirut on Tuesday for the first time since he resigned as Lebanon s prime minister in a broadcast from Saudi Arabia and plunged his country into political crisis. Hariri s sudden resignation on Nov. 4 thrust Lebanon to the forefront of regional tussle between the Sunni monarchy of Saudi Arabia and Shi ite Islamist Iran, whose powerful Lebanese ally Hezbollah is part of the government. Hariri was greeted by members of the security forces as he disembarked from a jet at Beirut airport, live footage of his arrival showed. Hariri, a long-time ally of Saudi Arabia, cited fear of assassination and meddling by Iran and Hezbollah in the Arab world in his resignation speech. The move caught even his aides off guard, and politicians close to him say Riyadh forced him to quit and held him in Saudi Arabia. Riyadh and Hariri have denied this. Lebanese President Michel Aoun has refused to accept the resignation until Hariri returns to present it in person. Earlier, Hariri met Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in Cairo, saying after the meeting that he would announce his  political position  in Lebanon. In a Nov. 12 interview from Saudi Arabia with Future TV, a station affiliated with his political party, Hariri said he would return to Lebanon to confirm his resignation. But he also held out the possibility of withdrawing it if Hezbollah respected Lebanon s policy of staying out of regional conflicts such as Yemen. ",worldnews,"November 21, 2017 ",1
"UK government averts Brexit rebellion, giving ground on EU rights plan","LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May s government averted a rebellion in parliament on Tuesday over plans to ditch the European Union s Charter of Fundamental Rights, promising to review its approach and make changes if needed.  Parliament is debating legislation which will enact Britain s exit from the EU in March 2019 and copy EU law into British law - described by officials as  one of the largest legislative projects ever undertaken in the UK . The bill is testing May s ability to govern effectively after she lost her parliamentary majority in June, leaving her leading a fragile minority government and in charge of a Conservative Party divided on how best to manage the split from the EU. On Tuesday, the focus of an eight-day debate which has already forced May s ministers into some concessions, fell on the government s plan not to include the Charter of Fundamental Rights in its mass  cut and paste  of EU law. The government, which says there is no need to copy across the EU charter because all it does is codify rights that exist through other legal instruments, headed off a potential rebellion by promising a review and possible technical changes later in the lawmaking process.   We do recognise the strength of views... and we are prepared to look again at this issue to make sure that we are taking an approach which can command the support of this house,  said the government s Solicitor General Robert Buckland. That was enough to dissuade dissatisfied members of May s party from joining forces with opposition lawmakers to force an outright U-turn on scrapping the charter.  The government still intends to scrap the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, but says citizens will not lose any of the existing rights the document sets out.  During the debate, critics - including members of May s own party - argued that abandoning the charter was an unnecessary risk and in its current form diluted some citizens  rights and created uncertainty over the protection of others.  The rights charter came into force in 2009 through the EU s Lisbon Treaty and brings together the fundamental EU-protected right in a single document. It is one of only a handful of exceptions contained within the government s Brexit blueprint which sets out to preserve EU law after Britain leaves the bloc to give businesses certainty that they won t face overnight rules changes.     The bill is currently at an early stage in the lawmaking process. The government has so far avoided any defeats, but has had to make last-minute concessions on several points. Tuesday s concession concerned a technical issue around how certain types of EU law should be treated after Brexit. The toughest test of May s authority, set to centre on the issue of fixing the date and time of Britain s EU exit in law, is yet to come. No date has been set yet for the remaining five days of debates that make up the current stage of the bill s passage. ",worldnews,"November 21, 2017 ",1
"Canada proposes health warnings, child-proof packs for legal pot sales","OTTAWA (Reuters) - The Canadian government proposed on Tuesday mandatory health warnings and child-proof packaging as well as a licensing regime for all cannabis products in legislation ahead of the July 2018 legalization of recreational marijuana. The proposals, which will be open for public consultation for 60 days, include restrictions on packaging to ensure the products are not enticing to children as well as legal standards for quality control and potency, Health Minister Ginette Petitpas Taylor told reporters. The government is on track to legalize recreational marijuana by July 2018, making it the first Group of Seven country to do so. Petitpas Taylor said the government wants to set strict guidelines for the safety of cannabis products, but ensure micro-producers and big companies alike will have access to the market as long as they are licensed.  We want to make sure the market will be open to everyone. Some people will be small businesses and they can certainly apply for a license in order to have a micro-industry, if you will,  she told reporters, adding there is no limit to the number of licenses that will be available. The proposed regulations address the licensing, tracking, packaging and labeling of recreational and medical marijuana practices, and include a permitting regime for the cultivation, processing, sale, testing and import and export of cannabis. The federal government earlier this month proposed splitting with the provinces income from excise taxes on recreational marijuana, drawing criticism from Ontario, which is concerned it will face higher costs associated with the new law.  The federal government said it wants an excise tax on all cannabis products, including medical marijuana, of C$1 per gram (0.04 ounce), or 10 percent of the retail price, whichever is higher. Some provinces have asked the government to delay legalization, saying they need more time to set up a sales system and train police officers who will be enforcing the new rules. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made the issue part of his 2015 successful election campaign and the Liberal government says regulating marijuana will keep it out of the hands of underage users and reduce drug-related crime. Shares of licensed producers, such as Canopy Growth, have soared in anticipation of legalization but the stocks are expected to face a bumpy ride in 2018. ",worldnews,"November 21, 2017 ",1

U.S. diplomats accuse Tillerson of breaking child soldiers law,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of about a dozen U.S. State Department officials have taken the unusual step of formally accusing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson of violating a federal law designed to stop foreign militaries from enlisting child soldiers, according to internal documents reviewed by Reuters. A confidential State Department  dissent  memo, which Reuters was first to report on, said Tillerson breached the Child Soldiers Prevention Act when he decided in June to exclude Iraq, Myanmar, and Afghanistan from a U.S. list of offenders in the use of child soldiers. This was despite the department publicly acknowledging that children were being conscripted in those countries. [tmsnrt.rs/2jJ7pav] Keeping the countries off the annual list makes it easier to provide them with U.S. military assistance. Iraq and Afghanistan are close allies in the fight against Islamist militants, while Myanmar is an emerging ally to offset China s influence in Southeast Asia. Documents reviewed by Reuters also show Tillerson s decision was at odds with a unanimous recommendation by the heads of the State Department s regional bureaus overseeing embassies in the Middle East and Asia, the U.S. envoy on Afghanistan and Pakistan, the department s human rights office and its own in-house lawyers. [tmsnrt.rs/2Ah6tB4]     Beyond contravening U.S. law, this decision risks marring the credibility of a broad range of State Department reports and analyses and has weakened one of the U.S. government's primary diplomatic tools to deter governmental armed forces and government-supported armed groups from recruiting and using children in combat and support roles around the world,  said the July 28 memo. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert, questioned at length by reporters on the issue at her daily briefing, strongly defended Tillerson s decision as valid and in  technical compliance with the law in the way he read it.   No one in the United States government likes the idea of the use of child soldiers,  she said.  It s abhorrent. Asked at a photo opportunity with the visiting Peruvian foreign minister about his decision, Tillerson sidestepped any direct response to the dissenting officials  complaint.  Reuters reported in June that Tillerson had disregarded internal recommendations on Iraq, Myanmar and Afghanistan. The new documents reveal the scale of the opposition in the State Department, including the rare use of what is known as the   dissent channel,  which allows officials to object to policies without fear of reprisals. The views expressed by the U.S. officials illustrate ongoing tensions between career diplomats and the former chief of Exxon Mobil Corp appointed by President Donald Trump to pursue  an  America First  approach to diplomacy.    The child soldiers law passed in 2008 states that the U.S. government must be satisfied that no children under the age of 18  are recruited, conscripted or otherwise compelled to serve as child soldiers  for a country to be removed from the list. The statute extends specifically to government militaries and government-supported armed groups like militias. The list currently includes the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, Mali, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.     In a written response to the dissent memo on Sept. 1, Tillerson adviser Brian Hook acknowledged that the three countries did use child soldiers. He said, however, it was necessary to distinguish between governments  making little or no effort to correct their child soldier violations ... and those which are making sincere - if as yet incomplete - efforts.  [tmsnrt.rs/2zWGRt0]Hook made clear that America s top diplomat used what he sees as his discretion to interpret the law. Foreign militaries on the list are prohibited from receiving aid, training and weapons from Washington unless the White House issues a waiver based on U.S.  national interest.  In 2016, under the Obama administration, both Iraq and Myanmar, as well as others such as Nigeria and Somalia, received waivers.    At times, the human rights community chided President Barack Obama for being too willing to issue waivers and exemptions, especially for governments that had security ties with Washington, instead of sanctioning more of those countries.  Human Rights Watch frequently criticized President Barack Obama for giving too many countries waivers, but the law has made a real difference,  Jo Becker, advocacy director for the group s children s rights division, wrote in June in a critique of Tillerson s decision. The dissenting U.S. officials stressed that Tillerson s decision to exclude Iraq, Afghanistan and Myanmar went a step further than the Obama administration s waiver policy by contravening the law and effectively easing pressure on the countries to eradicate the use of child soldiers.   The officials acknowledged in the documents reviewed by Reuters that those three countries had made progress. But in their reading of the law, they said that was not enough to be kept off a list that has been used to shame governments into completely eradicating the use of child soldiers. Ben Cardin, ranking Democrat on the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote to Tillerson on Friday saying there were  serious concerns that the State Department may not be complying  with the law and that the secretary s decision  sent a powerful message to these countries that they were receiving a pass on their unconscionable actions.  The memo was among a series of previously unreported documents sent this month to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the State Department s independent inspector general s office that relate to allegations that Tillerson violated the child soldiers law. Legal scholars say that because of the executive branch s latitude in foreign policy there is little legal recourse to counter Tillerson s decision.    Herman Schwartz, a constitutional law professor at American University in Washington, said U.S. courts would be unlikely to accept any challenge to Tillerson s interpretation of the child soldiers law as allowing him to remove a country from the list on his own discretion.    The signatories to the document were largely senior policy experts with years of involvement in the issues, said an official familiar with the matter. Reuters saw a copy of the document that did not include the names of those who signed it.    Tillerson s decision to remove Iraq and Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, from the list and reject a recommendation by U.S. officials to add Afghanistan was announced in the release of the government s annual human trafficking report on June 27.   Six days earlier, a previously unreported memo emailed to Tillerson from a range of senior diplomats said the three countries violated the law based on evidence gathered by U.S. officials in 2016 and recommended that he approve them for the new list.  It noted that in Iraq, the United Nations and non-governmental organizations  reported that some Sunni tribal forces ... recruited and used persons younger than the age of 18, including instances of children taking a direct part in hostilities.    Ali Kareem, who heads Iraq s High Committee for Human Rights, denied the country s military or state-backed militias use child soldiers.  We can say today with full confidence that we have a clean slate on child recruitment issues,  he said.    The memo also said  two confirmed cases of child recruitment  by the Myanmar military  were documented during the reporting period.  Human rights advocates have estimated that dozens of children are still conscripted there.  Myanmar government spokesman Zaw Htay challenged accusers to provide details of where and how child soldiers are being used. He noted that in the latest State Department report on human trafficking,  they already recognized (Myanmar) for reducing of child soldiers    though the report also made clear some children were still conscripted.   The memo said further there was  credible evidence  that a government-supported militia in Afghanistan  recruited and used a child,  meeting the minimum threshold of a single confirmed case that the State Department had previously used as the legal basis for putting a country on the list.   The Afghan defense and interior ministries both denied there were any child soldiers in Afghan national security forces, an assertion that contradicts the State Department s reports and human rights activists.

Ukraine rebel leader accuses sacked ally of staging revolt,"MOSCOW/KIEV (Reuters) - Armed men in masks blocked off the center of Ukraine s rebel-controlled city of Luhansk on Tuesday in what the rebel leader said was a revolt by supporters of a sacked regional police chief. In fighting that broke out in 2014, Russian-backed rebels threw off rule by a new pro-Western leadership in Kiev and set up two self-proclaimed separatist statelets in eastern Ukraine, one centered on Luhansk and another around the city of Donetsk. Those separatist regions are aided by Moscow but not recognized by any state, and they have been dogged by outbreaks of internal tensions that have on occasion turned violent. The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which monitors the implementation of a much-violated ceasefire agreement with Ukraine, said on Tuesday it had observed military-style vehicles and armed men in central Luhansk. The tension in Luhansk did not appear to have any direct connection to the conflict between the rebels and Ukraine s government, but President Petro Poroshenko called a meeting of his security and defense council late on Tuesday.  The Ukrainian armed forces are ready for all developments to ensure the safety of civilians,  Poroshenko said in a statement. Residents of Luhansk, capital of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People s Republic (LNR), saw unidentified armed men blocking access to downtown streets on Tuesday morning, according to local media and a resident of the city. The OSCE s monitoring mission posted photos on Twitter that showed lines of heavy military trucks and armored personnel carriers in central Luhansk. The LNR s rebel leader, Igor Plotnitsky, blamed disgruntled supporters of Igor Kornet, his chief of police whom he said he had fired on Monday.  The attempts by certain elements in the interior ministry in this way to challenge the decision .... (to remove Kornet) have gone beyond the bounds of what is acceptable,  Plotnitsky said in a statement on his administration s web site.  I can say with confidence that the attempts by certain persons to stay in power by destabilizing the situation ... are futile, and in the very near future will be neutralized.  But Kornet said he was still in his job, and demanded that senior figures in the region s rebel leadership be prosecuted.  I want to dispel rumors that I ve been removed,  he said in a video message, clad in field camouflage.  We have the situation completely under control.  He said that he had uncovered evidence that several senior LNR officials, acting in collusion with Kiev, were  involved in criminal activity to the detriment of the interests of the republic and the people of Luhansk .  Last night I provided all the documents available to the ...Igor Plotnitsky, who decided to launch criminal cases and arrest those involved,  Kornet said. In his statement the Luhansk rebel leader contradicted this, saying there were no grounds to arrest the officials identified by Kornet. The conflict in the country s east between Ukrainian government forces and pro-Russian separatists has killed over 10,000 people. Russia denies accusations from Ukraine and NATO that it supports the rebels with troops and weapons. ",worldnews,"November 21, 2017 ",1
Russia's Putin hosts Assad in fresh drive for Syria peace deal,"MOSCOW/BEIRUT (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin hosted Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for three hours of talks to lay the groundwork for a new push by Moscow to end Syria s conflict now that Islamic State s territory is overrun. Russia is trying to broker an international consensus around a peace deal for Syria, over two years after Moscow began a military intervention that turned the tide of the conflict in Assad s favor. Putin said he would follow up his meeting late on Monday with Assad by talking soon to international leaders with influence over the conflict, among them U.S. President Donald Trump, the Saudi king, and the leaders of Iran and Turkey.  In a more than hour long phone call on Tuesday, Trump and Putin stressed the importance of the U.N.-led peace process in resolving the Syrian civil war, the White House said.   According to the Kremlin, Putin told Trump that the  Syrian leader confirmed adherence to the political process, to run a constitutional reform  and presidential and parliamentary elections.  Previous attempts to end Syria s six years of war have foundered because of bitter disagreements, especially on whether Assad himself should stay in power. After the talks in Russia   Assad s first publicly-declared travel outside Syria since a trip to Moscow in October, 2015   a Kremlin spokesman declined to say if Assad s own future had come up in the discussions, saying only that was up to the Syrian people.  The White House statement made no mention of Assad s future. U.S. officials have said Assad has no future governing Syria. Putin meanwhile also spoke with Saudi King Salman, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.  The half-hour conversation with Netanyahu dealt with Iran s attempts to gain a foothold in Syria and Israel s opposition to such moves, according to a source in Netanyahu s office. The Israeli leader stressed his country s security concerns, the source said. In a sign that international attempts may be underway to bridge the differences between rival sides in the Syrian conflict, leading opposition figures, including former prime minister Riyad Hijab, resigned. Hijab headed the opposition High Negotiations Committee, formed with Saudi backing, and had insisted on Assad s removal from power at the start of a political transition. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, speaking in Moscow, said the resignations would make the opposition more reasonable and realistic. On Wednesday, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani   whose countries back opposing sides in the Syria conflict   will travel to Russia for a three-way meeting with Putin aimed at advancing the Syrian peace process. Assad s visit to Russia was brief and closely-guarded. He flew in on Monday evening, held talks, and flew out four hours after landing, according to the Kremlin. Officials did not release word of the meeting until Tuesday morning. Sitting either side of a small coffee table in a conference room at Putin s residence in Sochi, southern Russia, Putin told Assad it was time to pivot from a focus on military operations to a search for a peaceful solution. Syrian government forces and their allies at the weekend took control of Albu Kamal, the last major Syrian town held by Islamic State.  We still have a long way to go before we achieve a complete victory over terrorists. But as far as our joint work in fighting terrorism on the territory of Syria is concerned, this military operation is indeed wrapping up,  Putin told Assad, in comments broadcast by Russian television.  Now the most important thing, of course, is to move on to the political questions, and I note with satisfaction your readiness to work with all those who want peace and a solution (to the conflict),  Putin said. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, dressed in an olive-colored uniform, looked on as Putin and Assad spoke. Wearing a dark suit and sitting across from Putin, Assad told the Russian leader:  At this stage, especially after we achieved victory over terrorists, it is in our interests to move forward with the political process.  And we believe that the situation we now have on the ground and in the political sense permits us to expect progress in the political process. We count on the support of Russia to ensure the non-interference of outside players in the political process,  he said through an interpreter.  We don t want to look backwards. We welcome all those who truly want to see a political solution. We are ready to have a dialogue with them,  said Assad. Putin and Assad last met in Moscow on Oct. 20, 2015, a few weeks after Moscow launched its military operation in Syria, which has beaten back anti-Assad rebels and propped up struggling government forces. Underscoring the importance of the Russian military to Assad, Putin presented the Syrian leader to top military commanders assembled at his Sochi residence.  On behalf of the entire Syrian people, I express my gratitude for what you have done,  Assad told them.  We will not forget it.  Assad s opponents, and Western governments, have accused Russia of killing significant numbers of Syrian civilians with its air strikes, allegations Moscow denies. Some people familiar with the Kremlin s thinking say that, to reach a peace deal, Russia would not insist on Assad staying in power   as long as the institutions of the Syrian state remained intact. But while Russia is not wedded to Assad, Iran is committed to him. Iranian forces and the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia have played a big role in the fighting on the ground, supporting Assad s forces.  Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah thanked and praised Shi ite militias including Afghans and Iraqis for their role in the Syria war in a speech on Monday night. He said the head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Qods Force, Major General Qassem Soleimani, had led the battle for Albu Kamal from the frontlines. ",worldnews,"November 21, 2017 ",1
Britain to detail Brexit bill when EU agrees to move talks forward,"LONDON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May will only detail how big a divorce settlement Britain is willing to pay the EU when the bloc gives a commitment to moving talks forward, according to a plan rubber-stamped by even her most pro-Brexit ministers. The Brexit bill has become one of several hurdles to talks to unravel more than 40 years of union, with London reticent to offer too much too soon on what officials consider to be one of its strongest bargaining chips. In Brussels, British media speculation that May has won the backing of Brexit hardliners to offer more cash prompted talk among EU diplomats that a deal to unblock talks on future trade relations could be in the making ahead of a crunch Brussels summit in three weeks. At a meeting on Monday, May s Brexit committee - made up of some of her top ministers - backed the long-held strategy that Britain would honor commitments made when it was a member of the European Union. But the government will only offer any specifics when the bloc s negotiators give a commitment that talks will move to a discussion of the future relationship.  We are ready to move onto phase two, to see those talks about a deep and special partnership with the EU for the future, a comprehensive trade agreement with the EU,  May said on Tuesday.  I think that s in the interests of the UK and in the interests of the remaining EU-27. I think it s also important that the UK and the EU step forward together,  she added, a turn of phrase a source said expressed her desire for coordination. In public, Brussels is standing firm on the need for Britain to first make clear not a concrete  euros and cents  offer but a commitment to pay a share of EU spending for some items after Brexit - one of three key conditions the EU has set for opening trade talks. Asked if the EU was ready to give a promise to start those talks as soon as London offers more money, European Commission deputy head Frans Timmermans told CNN:  I hear them saying that. But as far as the EU27 is concerned, ... if we tackle the three issues ... if we deal with that satisfactorily, we can move to the next stage. And that s been crystal clear since Day One.  Nonetheless, EU negotiators are willing to help May with at least the appearance of cutting a deal. They could help  fudge  the amount of cash being handed over. And the EU already has an outline of a transition and free trade accord, which May could point to as something she had secured in exchange.  We are ready to present the exit bill in a way that would make it easier for the Brits to sell at home,  one diplomat said. He added that EU officials had looked at whether Britain might forgo its roughly 50-percent rebate on EU budget payments during a two-year transition period after Brexit, so reducing the gross amount Britain would otherwise hand over in advance. With only 16 months until Britain leaves the bloc, May is under increasing pressure not only from EU officials to move on the money, but also by businesses to provide certainty by early next year so they can make investment decisions. But she has a tightrope to walk.  Many in her governing Conservative Party want Britain to quit the talks, feeling the EU is holding the country hostage over money, which they want to spend at home rather than abroad. Her spokesman said no figures were discussed at Monday s meeting and other ministers gave no details of what was discussed.  Local media reported that she could increase the sum to 40 billion pounds ($53 billion), more than double the initial estimated offer of 20 billion euros ($23.5 billion). The Commission has cited a figure of 60 billion euros but EU officials have long said that is up for negotiation. For many in May s own party, however, the suggestion of any increase in how much Britain will pay at a time when talks had failed to move forward for five months was unpalatable.  I need to be able to look my voters in the eye and be able to say that I have backed a deal that is in the interests of Britain,  Conservative lawmaker Andrew Bridgen told Reuters.  If I can t do that, I will vote against a deal and we will go to WTO rules of trade, rules with which we already trade with most of the world successfully.  ",worldnews,"November 21, 2017 ",1

Colombia protests Venezuelan military crossing border,"BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia sent a letter to the Venezuelan foreign ministry on Tuesday protesting the incursion of a military helicopter and troops from that nation over the border, the latest in a series of similar incidents that have drawn criticism from Colombia. The incident occurred on Nov. 15 and 16 near the town of Tibu in Norte de Santander province, Colombia s foreign ministry said in a statement.  The events have already been protested by the foreign ministry and there has been a meeting arranged between the foreign ministers to analyze what happened and request that measures be taken to prevent a recurrence,  it said.  Forays by Venezuelan troops into Colombia have increased in recent years, heightening diplomatic tension between the government of Colombia s President Juan Manuel Santos and Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.  Santos has accused Maduro of destroying democracy in Venezuela, while Maduro has said Colombia is part of an international conspiracy seeking to overthrow his government.  Colombia and Venezuela share a border of 2,219 km (1,379 miles), over which contraband and illegal drugs frequently pass, according to security sources. ",worldnews,"November 21, 2017 ",1
"Zimbabwe's Mugabe resigns, ending four decades of rule","HARARE (Reuters) - Robert Mugabe resigned as Zimbabwe s president on Tuesday, a week after the army and his former political allies moved to end four decades of rule by a man once feted as an independence hero who became feared as a despot. His former vice president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, whose sacking this month prompted the military takeover that forced Mugabe out, will be sworn in as president on Wednesday or Thursday, Patrick Chinamasa, legal secretary of the ruling ZANU-PF party, told Reuters. The 93-year-old Mugabe had clung on for a week after an army takeover, with ZANU-PF urging him to go. He finally resigned moments after parliament began an impeachment process seen as the only legal way to force him out. Wild celebrations broke out at a joint sitting of parliament when Speaker Jacob Mudenda read out Mugabe s brief resignation letter. Mugabe, confined to his Harare residence, did not appear.  People danced in the streets of Harare and car horns blared at the news that the era of Mugabe   who had led Zimbabwe since independence in 1980   was finally over. Some brandished posters of Mnangagwa and army chief General Constantino Chiwenga.   Workers turned the Christmas lights on early in Africa Unity Square and people climbed aboard armored vehicles to pose for photographs with soldiers. Despite the public outpouring of joy, Mugabe s downfall was as much the result of in-fighting among the political elite as a popular uprising, although thousands of people rallied against him in the days after the army intervened last week.     The army seized power after Mugabe sacked Mnangagwa, ZANU-PF s favorite to succeed him, in a bid to smooth a path to the presidency for his wife Grace, 52, known to her critics as  Gucci Grace  for her reputed fondness for luxury shopping. Since the crisis began, Mugabe has been mainly confined to his  Blue Roof  mansion in the capital where Grace is also believed to be. ZANU-PF chief whip Lovemore Matuke told Reuters that Mnangagwa would be sworn in within 48 hours and serve the remainder of Mugabe s term until the next election, which must be held by September 2018.      I am very happy with what has happened,  said Maria Sabawu, a supporter of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), outside the hotel where the impeachment process was happening.  I have suffered a lot at the hands of Mugabe s government,  she said, showing her hand with a missing finger that she said was lost in violence during a presidential run-off election between Mugabe and opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai in 2008. Mugabe had led Zimbabwe since a guerrilla struggle ended white-minority rule in the country formerly known as Rhodesia. He took the once-rich nation to economic ruin, presiding over the forced takeover of white-owned farms at the end of the century, which devastated agricultural foreign exchange earnings and led to hyperinflation. But brandishing his anti-colonial credentials and styling himself the Grand Old Man of African politics, Mugabe retained the admiration of many people across the continent. Amnesty International said that under Mugabe tens of thousands of people were tortured, forcibly disappeared or killed in a culture of impunity that allowed  grotesque crimes to thrive .  The people of Zimbabwe deserve better. The next generation of leaders must commit itself to upholding the constitution, living up to Zimbabwe s international human rights obligations and treating its people with dignity and justice,  the rights group said in a statement.  Mnangagwa, 75, who fled Zimbabwe after his sacking in fear for his safety, was a chief lieutenant to Mugabe for decades and himself stands accused of participating in repression. He was internal security chief in the mid-1980s when Mugabe deployed a North Korean-trained brigade against rebels during which 20,000 civilians were killed, according to rights groups. Reuters reported in September that Mnangagwa was plotting to succeed Mugabe, with army backing, at the helm of a broad coalition to seek Zimbabwe s re-engagement with the world after decades of isolation from global lenders and donors. Nicknamed  Ngwena , or crocodile in the Shona language, an animal famed in Zimbabwean lore for its stealth and ruthlessness, Mnangagwa issued a statement from hiding on Tuesday calling on Zimbabweans to unite to rebuild the country. Opposition politician and former education minister David Coltart said that call gave hope of lifting a shattered economy from its knees, provided Mnangagwa made good on his promise to reach out to other factions.  When we all wake up with hangovers tomorrow, we will be reminded of the dreadful state our nation is in - no money in the banks and businesses collapsing,  Coltart told Reuters.  As Emmerson Mnangagwa said, ZANU-PF is not capable of resolving this issue on its own. I took some comfort from his words. If he translates them into action, the future is positive.  Zimbabwe s Platform for Concerned Citizens, a civil society group, called for a national dialogue and a  transitional authority  to decide the country s future. Theresa May, prime minister of former colonial power Britain, said Mugabe s resignation  provides Zimbabwe with an opportunity to forge a new path free of the oppression that characterized his rule . She said Britain, as  Zimbabwe s oldest friend , would do all it could to support the country.      The U.S. embassy in Harare said Zimbabwe was living  a historic moment .  Whatever short-term arrangements the government may establish, the path forward must lead to free, fair and inclusive elections,  it said in a statement. ",worldnews,"November 20, 2017 ",1
All eyes on the 'Crocodile' as Zimbabwe's Mugabe resigns,"HARARE (Reuters) - When Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe sacked his vice president in front of 12,000 baying party members in 2014, Emmerson Mnangagwa sat quietly in the crowd, a green baseball cap pulled low over his eyes. The man who stood to gain most from the dismissal betrayed nothing through his expression and gentle clapping - a survival tactic honed during five decades of service to the mercurial Mugabe. His cap, however, spoke volumes. Emblazoned across its front, next to a portrait of Mugabe, were four words:  Indigenise, Empower, Develop, Employ  - a slogan of the ruling ZANU-PF party. That day, he became Mugabe s official deputy. Mnangagwa, whose sacking from the post this month brought Zimbabwe s political crisis to a head, is now poised to take over after Mugabe, 93, resigned on Tuesday, ending almost four decades of rule. Mnangagwa will be sworn in on Wednesday or Thursday, ZANU-PF s legal secretary Patrick Chinamasa told Reuters. The party s chief whip said Mnangagwa would serve the remainder of Mugabe s term until the next election due by September 2018. But there are questions over how Mnangagwa will lead the country led by Mugabe since independence in 1980. In a statement issued from hiding on Tuesday, Mnangagwa said Zimbabweans from all walks of life had to work together to rebuild a shattered economy and deeply polarized society.  My desire is to join all Zimbabweans in a new era, where corruption, incompetence, dereliction of duty and laziness, social and cultural decadence is not tolerated,  he said.  In that new Zimbabwe, it is important for everyone to join hands so that we rebuild this nation to its full glory. This is not a job for ZANU-PF alone but for all people of Zimbabwe.  The 75-year-old was one of Mugabe s most trusted lieutenants, having been at his side in prison, during wartime and then in government. With his appointment in 2014 as Mugabe s official deputy, Mnangagwa had appeared well set as the eventual successor to Africa s oldest head of state.  There are no arguments around his credentials to provide strong leadership and stability, but there are questions over whether he can also be a democrat,  said Eldred Masunungure, a political science lecturer at the University of Zimbabwe. Speaking at the congress in 2014, Mnangagwa reinforced the message emblazoned on his headgear, announcing revisions to ZANU-PF s constitution that backed  total ownership and control  of Zimbabwe s natural resources. It was a key insight to the party s direction as it contemplated life beyond Mugabe.  We will remain forever masters of our own destiny,  Mnangagwa said at the time, to cheers from the crowd. Along the way, Mnangagwa earned the nickname  Ngwena , Shona for crocodile, an animal famed in Zimbabwean lore for its stealth and ruthlessness. He backed Mugabe s economic nationalism, especially a drive to force foreign firms to hand majority stakes to local blacks, suggesting he may not be the pro-market pragmatist many investors were hoping for. He has been in every administration since independence, holding posts as varied as minister of state security, defense and finance, as well as speaker of parliament. Most controversially, he was in charge of internal security in the mid-1980s when Mugabe deployed a crack North Korean-trained brigade against rebels loyal to his rival Joshua Nkomo. Rights groups say 20,000 civilians, mostly from the Ndebele tribe, were killed. Mugabe denies genocide or crimes against humanity but has admitted it was a  moment of madness . Mnangagwa s role remains shrouded in mystery, typical of a political operator trained as a communist guerrilla in China in the 1960s and who always stayed in the shadows behind Mugabe. Secretive and insular, he prefers to operate under the radar, those in his inner circle say, and when pushed into a corner, resorts to jokes and trivia to avoid serious discussion.  I wouldn t say he is deceptive but it s fair to say his default position is to crack jokes and deflect uncomfortable questions by asking endless questions,  one member of parliament close to him said.  He is very conscious that his public image is that of a hard man but he is a much more complex personality - pleasant and an amazing story-teller,  the politician, also from Mnangagwa s Midlands Province, told Reuters. Mnangagwa s appointment as vice president came a day after his predecessor Joice Mujuru was fired for allegedly planning to topple Mugabe. Asked whether the purge would weaken the party, a smiling Mnangagwa said:  The revolution has a way of strengthening itself. It goes through cycles, this is another cycle where it rids itself of elements that had now become inconsistent with the correct line.  Mnangagwa learnt his politics in prison in the 1960s after being sentenced to death for sabotage by British authorities. He was captured while in one of the earliest guerrilla units fighting white colonial rule in what was then Rhodesia. He was 19 and only spared the noose by a law prohibiting the execution of convicts under 21. After a decade in prison, often sharing a cell with Mugabe, Mnangagwa became personal assistant to the leader of the liberation struggle, and went on to head the guerrilla movement s feared internal security bureau. In January, a photograph appeared in local media showing Mnangagwa enjoying drinks with a friend. In his hand was a large novelty mug emblazoned with the words:  I M THE BOSS.  To supporters of Mugabe, this bordered on treason. They suspected that Mnangagwa already saw himself in the leader s shoes. When Mugabe fired Mnangagwa as vice president this month for showing  traits of disloyalty , he removed a possible successor who was also one of his last remaining liberation war comrades. But relations had already cooled between the two men after suggestions by Mnangagwa s allies in August that he had been poisoned by ice cream from a dairy owned by the Mugabes.

U.S. marine accused of drunk driving after Japanese man dies in crash,"TOKYO (Reuters) - A Japanese man was killed in a truck collision involving a 21-year-old U.S. marine who was well over the legal alcohol limit for driving, police said of a case that was likely to stoke resentment over the U.S. military presence on the southern island of Okinawa.     In response to the Sunday s fatal accident, U.S. forces in Japan banned, until further notice, all personnel in the country from drinking of alcohol.  The Defence and Foreign Ministries have lodged a stern representation to the U.S. forces in Japan and the U.S. embassy in Japan, asking for the enforcement of discipline, prevention of recurrence and sincere response to the bereaved,  Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a regular news conference on Monday. U.S. Ambassador to Japan William Hagerty expressed his condolences and offered an apology, Suga said. The accident occurred at an intersection in the city of Naha early Sunday morning. The marine was driving a military truck, and the 61-year-old crash victim was in a light truck. The Japanese man was later pronounced dead, while the U.S. serviceman, who was arrested for the fatal accident and driving under the influence of alcohol, suffered scratches, a police official in Naha said. The official said a breath test showed the marine was as much as three times over the legal limit for alcohol.  When our service members fail to live up to the high standards we set for them, it damages the bonds between bases and local communities and make it harder for us to accomplish our mission,  a statement from the U.S. forces in Japan said. Last year, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe protested to then-U.S. President Barack Obama about the killing of a young woman in Okinawa, for which a U.S. base worker had been charged. Obama, who was visiting Japan for a Group of Seven summit, expressed  deepest regrets.    The case is under trial. Residents in Okinawa, a reluctant host to the bulk of U.S. bases in Japan, believe that they shoulder an unfair burden in supporting the U.S. military presence in Japan.

German police present stolen John Lennon diaries,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German police presented on Tuesday diaries, pairs of glasses and other items belonging to late Beatle John Lennon that were stolen from his widow Yoko Ono in 2006 and eventually ended up in Berlin. Police arrested a man in Berlin on Monday suspected of receiving the 86 stolen items, which include Lennon s last diary that ended on the day he was shot and killed in New York on Dec. 8, 1980.  This day contains the entry that on that morning John Lennon and Yoko Ono had an appointment with Annie Leibovitz to take a photo which I think is world famous,  Berlin prosecutor Michael von Hagen told a news conference.  The Leibovitz portrait of a naked Lennon curled up around Ono on their bed ran on the January 1981 cover of Rolling Stone magazine. Hagen rejected suggestions that Ono might have lent or given away the objects:  The diaries especially ... were also treated by Yoko Ono as something sacred. And the idea that she would have given away three original diaries, especially the one that ends on the very day Lennon died, can be completely ruled out.  Carsten Pfohl, head of property crime for Berlin police, said investigators had found one of the pairs of glasses and a receipt in Lennon s name hidden in the trunk of the car of the accused on Monday. Police suspect that the items were stolen by Ono s former driver and then taken to Turkey and were only brought to Berlin in 2013 or 2014. Another suspect lives in Turkey, they said. The Berlin police was alerted after they were found by the administrator for a bankrupt auction house, which had previously valued the objects at 3.1 million euros  ($3.64 million).

He is being held for questioning in a case related to laundering of tax fraud proceeds,  the official said. Representatives for Kerimov could not immediately be reached for comment. Polyus declined to comment. A source said the investigation centers on the purchase of several luxury residences on the French Riviera via shell companies, something that would have enabled Kerimov to reduce taxes owed to the French state. The source added Kerimov would be held in custody for at least another 24 hours. Russia s foreign ministry said in a statement carried by Interfax news agency that Kerimov held a diplomatic passport and had immunity. It said it had informed the French authorities.  Kerimov does have a diplomatic passport, but that does not protect him from prosecution,  the French official said. The French foreign ministry could not immediately confirm it had been in contact with Moscow. A French diplomatic source said immunity was given by governments to people on diplomatic lists or if they had been mandated with a specific mission in the country.

Putin informs Trump of outcome of meeting with Syria's Assad,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President discussed the civil war in Syria on Tuesday, with Putin stressing the importance of finding a political solution to the conflict after meeting with Syria s president. Trump and Putin spoke by telephone for about an hour, covering topics including Syria, Ukraine, Iran, North Korea and Afghanistan, a White House official said earlier. Their conversation came after Putin hosted Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for three hours of talks on Monday, in preparation for a push by Moscow to end Syria s conflict now that Islamic State has been driven out of its self-styled caliphate in Iraq and Syria. According to Kremlin, Putin told Trump that the  Syrian leader confirmed adherence to the political process, to run a constitutional reform and president and parliament elections .  The message was sent of the necessity to keep the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Syria and to reach a political settlement based on principals to be worked out in a full-scale negotiation process in Syria,  the Kremlin said. On Wednesday, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani - whose countries back opposing sides in the Syria conflict - will travel to Russia for a meeting with Putin aimed at advancing the Syrian peace process. Putin stressed the importance to Trump of what he called  coordinating of efforts between the special services of both countries . The two leaders also discussed North Korea,  stressing the expediency of finding the ways of solution by the diplomatic means .  ",worldnews,"November 21, 2017 ",1

Lebanon's Hariri holds talks with Egypt President Sisi in Cairo,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Lebanon s Saad al-Hariri, who resigned as prime minister on Nov. 4, met Egypt s President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi for talks in a brief Cairo stopover before a planned return to Lebanon, Egypt state media said on Tuesday. Hariri had been in Paris since Saturday when he met French President Emmanuel Macron. He has said he will return to Lebanon by Wednesday for the country s Independence Day celebrations, where he said he will clarify his position. His surprise resignation announced from Riyadh triggered a political crisis in Lebanon s power-sharing government and drew his country deeper into a regional power struggle between Sunni kingdom Saudi Arabia and Shi ite Islamist Iran. A Saudi ally, Hariri said he quit over interference in Lebanon by Iran and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah, a Shi ite group, which is part the government. But President Michel Aoun and others say Hariri may have been coerced into resigning. Sisi, a former military commander who presents himself as a bulwark against Islamist militancy, has stressed his backing for Saudi Arabia and Gulf Arab allies who have helped with aid since he ousted a government led by the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013. But he has also said Egypt is not considering measures against Hezbollah despite Saudi demands for sanctions against the Lebanese group. He has received calls from Macron and from U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson over the crisis. Hariri arrived at Cairo International Airport, where he was received by Egypt s health minister, the Lebanese ambassador to Cairo and Egypt s ambassador to Beirut, his press office said. He went immediately to the presidential palace, it said. A message on Hariri s Twitter account said the meeting would be followed by a dinner in his honor.  Saad Hariri arrived in Cairo on Tuesday evening from Paris to meet President Sisi, and he is scheduled to return to Lebanon on Wednesday,  MENA state news agency said. Egypt s presidency said Aoun, a Hezbollah ally, also spoke with Sisi to discuss developments. Sisi and Aoun  underscored the importance of preserving Lebanon s stability as well as upholding Lebanon s national interest.  ",worldnews,"November 21, 2017 ",1

German political limbo threatens European reform push,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Half a year ago, the political stars seemed perfectly aligned for a deep reform of the European Union and its euro currency. Emmanuel Macron had won the French presidency on a promise to relaunch Europe. And Angela Merkel, on track to win a fourth term as German chancellor, looked ready to embrace his bold vision, telling an audience in Bavaria that it was time for Europe to take its fate into its own hands. Following the collapse of German coalition talks, however, the prospects for a meaningful leap forward in European cooperation, driven by newly minted governments in Berlin and Paris, look dimmer than ever.   Political uncertainty has crossed the Rhine,  said Jean Pisani-Ferry, an economist and academic who helped write Macron s election program.  Europe has gotten used to having a strong German government with clear positions. That is something we may not have for some time.  Germany now faces months of political limbo which will narrow an already tight window for agreeing reforms of euro zone governance and EU defense and asylum policies. Should Germany be forced to hold new elections, its partners may have to wait until next summer for a government to take form. By then, Europe will be entering crunch time in its Brexit negotiations with Britain, preparing for sensitive discussions on a long-term EU budget and gearing up for the election of a new European Parliament. Euro zone leaders were due to begin a six-month discussion on closer integration of their 19-nation currency bloc next month at a special summit in Brussels. Now that debate seems likely to be delayed and officials say the chances of reaching any conclusions by June 2018, as proposed by European Council President Donald Tusk, are slim.  Things will go on hold until there is a formal acting German government,  one euro zone official said.  At this stage I don t see what steps the leaders could take in December or June for deepening euro zone integration when there is a German government without a mandate.  Another casualty could be the completion of an EU pact on closer defense cooperation, known as PESCO.  Berlin and Paris had hoped to sign it into law at a regular EU summit next month. Now diplomats involved in EU foreign policy say that may be overly ambitious. Germany has also been a driving force behind EU efforts to reform its asylum policies in the wake of the 2015 refugee crisis. Those discussions, pitting countries like Italy and Greece against Poland and Hungary, were already bogged down. Without a new government in Berlin, there is next to no hope of a breakthrough.  We have so many things we need to do urgently that slowing us down is not good for Europe as a whole,  Frans Timmermans, a former Dutch foreign minister who is deputy head of the European Commission, told CNN.  He played down the risks, however, saying:  It might slow us down a little bit but I don t think it would take Europe off course, whatever happens.  Perhaps the only pressing issue which will not be significantly affected by the political uncertainty in Germany is Brexit, where there is a broad political consensus among German parties. That means that Merkel, who will remain in place in a caretaker capacity until a new coalition is formed, should have sufficient room to maneuver in talks that, in any case, are being led by the European Commission and its chief negotiator Michel Barnier. Still, hopes that the two political earthquakes of 2016   Britain s decision to leave the EU and the election of U.S. President Donald Trump   might shock European capitals into bold reforms, once elections in the Netherlands, France, Germany and Austria were out of the way, are fading. Even before the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) walked out of coalition negotiations with Merkel s conservatives and the Greens in the early hours of Monday, doubts were rising about whether she would have the flexibility to meet Macron halfway as head of an awkward three-way  Jamaica  alliance. Now that those talks have collapsed, she would appear to have three options: convince the Social Democrats (SPD) to enter another right-left  grand coalition ; form a minority government with the Greens or the FDP; or take the risk of new elections. So far the SPD leadership has shown no signs that it will go back on its pledge to go into opposition. On Monday, Merkel appeared to rule out a minority government. So unless something changes, a new election could be the only way forward. That would probably not take place before March or April, around the same time that Italy is due to hold elections which could also result in a hung parliament. Crucially, polls suggest that a new German election would not give Merkel more coalition options than she had coming out of the Sept. 24 vote. Indeed, if voters blamed her conservatives for failing to form a government the first time around, she could emerge even  weaker than she is now. That would be a further blow to German political stability and to Macron s European ambitions. ",worldnews,"November 21, 2017 ",1
"Iran's Rouhani urges France to remain ""realistic, impartial"" in Middle East","BEIRUT/PARIS (Reuters) - France can play a productive role in the Middle East by taking a  realistic and impartial approach , Iranian President Hassan Rouhani told his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, in a phone call on Tuesday, according to Iranian state media. Tensions between Iran and France increased last week after Macron said that Tehran should be less aggressive in the region and should clarify its ballistic missile program. His foreign minister also denounced Tehran s  hegemonic temptations  during a visit to Saudi Arabia.  Iranian state media said Rouhani told Macron that the Islamic Republic was ready to develop its relations with France on all bilateral, regional and international issues based on mutual respect and shared goals.  Rouhani referred to the  adventurism of some inexperienced princes in the region - an allusion to Iran s arch geopolitical rival, Saudi Arabia - and said France could play a positive role in easing the situation.  We are against adventurism and creating division in the region and believe that France, by keeping an independent vote and its position in the region, can, with a realistic and impartial approach, have a productive role,  he said. In a rare statement on both calls, Macron s office said he had talked to Rouhani and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu separately, telling them both that it was vital to keep Lebanon disassociated from regional crises.  He also said France was attached to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal with world powers, but that regional and ballistic issues should be discussed separately and constructively. Macron  also stressed the importance for the countries of the region to work collectively to reduce tensions,  the statement said. The foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia and other Arab states criticised Iran and its Lebanese Shi ite Muslim ally Hezbollah at talks in Cairo on Sunday, calling for a united front to counter Iranian influence. Rouhani also highlighted the importance of maintaining stability in Lebanon and, in the phone call with Macron, noted what he characterized as the threat posed by Israel.  Hezbollah are a part of the Lebanese people and are incredibly loved in this country. Their weapons are only defensive and are only for use in the face of a potential attack,  Rouhani said.  Now we have to try so the Lebanese groups can, with security, have a government that can help advance their country.  Macron, whose country has called for Hezbollah to disarm, has tried to mediate in a regional crisis that erupted after Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri announced his resignation in a broadcast from Saudi Arabia on Nov. 4, accusing Tehran and Hezbollah - which was part of his coalition government - of sowing strife across the Middle East. Macron spoke on Monday with Netanyahu, who is due in Paris in December, according to diplomatic sources. According to the Iranian state media, Macron invited Rouhani to Paris for a climate summit on Dec. 12. Macron s office did not respond when asked to confirm the invite.

U.S. says air strike kills over 100 militants in Somalia,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. military said it killed more than 100 Islamist militants in Somalia on Tuesday when it launched an air strike against al Shabaab, an al Qaeda-linked insurgent group that wants to topple the U.N.-backed government. The military s Africa Command said the strike was carried out on a camp 125 miles (201 km) northwest of the capital, Mogadishu and that the United States would continue to target militants.  The strike was done in coordination with Somalia s federal government, the Pentagon said. U.S. air strikes killing such a large number of militants in Somalia are rare, but not unprecedented. In March 2016, a U.S. air strike killed more than 150 al Shabaab fighters in Somalia. Somalia s state news agency SONNA reported late on Tuesday that  about 100 militants  were killed when U.S. planes and Somali commandos attacked al Shabaab bases in the Bur Elay area of Bay region.  Al Shabaab spokesman Abdiasis Abu Musab denied the attack.  It is just...propaganda,  he told Reuters in Somalia. Al Shabaab is fighting to topple Somalia s Western-backed transitional federal government and impose its own rule on the Horn of Africa country. Earlier this month, the U.S. warned of a threat to its diplomatic staff in Mogadishu and directed all non-essential staff to leave the capital. Al Shabaab has lost control of most of Somalia s cities and towns since it was pushed out of Mogadishu in 2011. But it retains a strong presence in parts of the south and center and carries out gun and bomb attacks.  Al-Shabaab has publicly committed to planning and conducting attacks against the U.S. and our partners in the region,  the U.S. military statement said. Al Shabaab aims to topple Somalia s government, drive out African Union peacekeeping troops and impose its own harsh interpretation of Islamic law. Earlier this month, the U.S. military also carried out its first strikes against Islamic State militants in Somalia and said it killed  several terrorists.      ",worldnews,"November 21, 2017 ",1
"Exclusive: African leaders wanted Mugabe, an ""embarrassment"", to go - Zimbabwe intelligence","JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - African leaders were embarrassed by Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and already encouraging him to step down before the army began moves last week to oust him, according to a secret Zimbabwean intelligence cable seen by Reuters. The cable, dated Oct 23 and written by someone within the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) to an unknown recipient, also says Mugabe spoke to South African President Jacob Zuma about his rivalry with Emmerson Mnangagwa, the vice president whose sacking by Mugabe prompted the army action. The 93-year-old president stepped down on Tuesday, the speaker of parliament said, in the middle of impeachment proceedings from his own ZANU-PF party and after a week of pressure from the military and crowds which thronged the capital at the weekend. Two party officials said Mnangagwa would take his place. The cable, one of a series seen by Reuters this year which give a detailed, insider s view of Zimbabwean politics, described intelligence officials warning Mugabe he would face  fierce resistance from the military  if Mnangagwa was removed. First seen by Reuters before the army intervened, it said the 16-country Southern African Development Community (SADC) led by Zuma was pressuring Mugabe to resign and Zuma had suggested offering him a senior African Union role to ease him out. Zuma s spokesman, Bongani Ngqulunga, dismissed the account as  completely untrue and scandalous .  President Jacob Zuma did not communicate with President Mugabe about former Vice-President Mnangagwa at all about the issues you mention.  Regional support allowed Mugabe to overcome an election setback in 2008 and could have held the key to his future as leader this time round. SADC leaders met on Tuesday to discuss the crisis in Zimbabwe; Zuma and his Angolan counterpart, Joao Lourenco, were set to travel to Harare on Wednesday.  All SADC leaders and African leaders want Mugabe to retire. Mugabe is seen as an embarrassment to the whole African continent,  the document said. A Zambian government source said Zuma, at the SADC meeting in Luanda, floated the idea of an AU position for Mugabe although the consensus was that he was too old. Reuters was not able to verify the assertion of widespread African opposition to Mugabe in the Oct 23 cable, which contrasts with his image as the respected  grand old man  of African politics. Botswana President Ian Khama is the only African leader to have openly called for him to step down. Khama told Reuters on Friday Mugabe should go and allow for  an opportunity to put Zimbabwe on a path to peace and prosperity . Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, a longtime strongman leader like Mugabe, condemned the de facto seizure of power by the army, which put troops on the streets of Harare and took over the state broadcaster. Uganda, which is not in the SADC, reiterated its support for Mugabe on Tuesday.  Mugabe is one person who couldn t care what the West thought. He spoke out for Africans  rights, pan Africanism,  said Okello Oryem, Uganda s state minister for foreign affairs. SADC and the African Union (AU) have avoided characterizing last week s intervention by the military as a  coup , a definition that would carry diplomatic consequences. The AU had no immediate comment on the account in the cable. The cable said Zuma told Zimbabwe s longtime leader that Mnangagwa, a former security chief known as  The Crocodile , was a  tricky customer  with  many lives  and that by taking him on Mugabe was  playing with big fire . Mnangagwa is widely expected to take over as president. His whereabouts are unknown after he fled the country citing fears for his safety. His political allies were not immediately available for comment. The same cable said Zimbabwean intelligence officers and SADC leaders told Mugabe the army would not accept Mnangagwa being fired as vice-president to pave the way for Mugabe s 52-year-old wife, Grace, to succeed him.  Mugabe was openly told by senior CIOs that the military is not going to easily accept the appointment of Grace,  it read. The intelligence services of other countries in the region also knew the military might rebel and step in, it continued.  SADC leaders also shared the same sentiments with the CIOs,  the cable said. Reuters reported in September that Mnangagwa was plotting to succeed Mugabe, with army backing, at the helm of a broad coalition. (nL4N1LL3V1) The plot posited an interim unity government with international blessing to allow for Zimbabwe s re-engagement with the world after decades of isolation from global lenders and donors.

Suicide bomber kills 50 in Nigeria in mosque attack,"YOLA, Nigeria (Reuters) - A suicide bomber killed at least 50 people in northeastern Nigeria on Tuesday in an attack on a mosque which bore the hallmarks of a faction of the Islamist militant group Boko Haram. The bombing in Mubi in Adamawa state was one of the deadliest in Nigeria s northeast since President Muhammadu Buhari came to power in 2015 pledging to end Boko Haram s eight-year insurgency and attacks by the group on civilian and military targets. It brought to at least 278 the number of people killed in 2017, according to calculations by Reuters. There was no claim of responsibility.  Some of the dead were in pieces beyond recognition,  said Bayi Muhammad, a worshipper who escaped the blast because he was late for early morning prayers. Abubakar Othman, a police spokesman in Adamawa state, said the death toll was at least 50, but added that the tally could rise. Eight people were critically injured and more than 30 others hurt but in stable condition, said Idris Garga, the northeast regional coordinator for Nigeria s national emergency agency. Boko Haram held territory in Adamawa state in 2014. Troops pushed them out in early 2015, and the town of Mubi had itself been relatively peaceful until Tuesday s bombing. In a statement on Tuesday, Nigeria s president said the attack was  very cruel  and gave assurances his government would do  everything required  to secure the state from Boko Haram.  The militant group often mounts suicide attacks in public places such as mosques and markets. Last December, two schoolgirl suicide bombers killed 56 people and wounded dozens more at a market in Adamawa. The mosque blast bears the hallmarks of a faction led by Abubakar Shekau, which forces women and girls to carry out suicide bombings. The attacks often leave only the bomber dead. Boko Haram has waged an insurgency in northeastern Nigeria since 2009 in its attempt to create an Islamic state in the region. It has killed more than 20,000 and forced around 2 million people to flee their homes.  The group split in 2016 and the faction under Shekau is based in the Sambisa forest on the border with Cameroon and Chad and mainly targets civilians with suicide bombers. The other faction is based in the Lake Chad region and led by Abu Musab al-Barnawi. It mainly attacks military forces after quietly building up its strength over the past year. Most attacks focus on Borno state, the birthplace of the insurgency. The group held land around the size of Belgium in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states until early 2015 but was forced out by Nigeria s army and troops from neighboring countries.

Iran's president declares end of Islamic State,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani declared the end of Islamic State on Tuesday while a senior military commander thanked the  thousands of martyrs  killed in operations organised by Iran to defeat the militant group in Syria and Iraq.   Today with God s guidance and the resistance of people in the region we can say that this evil has either been lifted from the head of the people or has been reduced,  Rouhani said in an address broadcast live on state TV.   Of course the remnants will continue but the foundation and roots have been destroyed.   Major General Qassem Soleimani, a senior commander of the elite Revolutionary Guards, also said Islamic State had been defeated, in a message sent on Tuesday to Iran s supreme leader which was published on the Guards  news site, Sepah News.  Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei congratulated Soleimani on the defeat of Islamic State and said it was a blow against Israel, America and its allies, an allusion to Saudi Arabia.  It was a blow against the past and current governments of America and the regimes linked to it in the region who created this group and gave them every kind of support so they could expand their malevolent power in west Asia,  Khamenei said in a statement published on his official website.   In June Islamic State carried out its first attack in Iran, killing 18 people in Tehran, testing the government s belief that by backing offensives against the group elsewhere in the region it could keep the militant group away from Iran. Iranian media have often carried video and pictures of Soleimani, who commands the Quds Force, the branch of the Guards responsible for operations outside Iran, at frontline positions in battles against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. The Revolutionary Guards, a powerful military force which also oversees an economic empire worth billions of dollars, has been fighting in support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and the central government in Baghdad for several years. More than 1,000 members of the Guards, including senior commanders, have been killed in Syria and Iraq. The Syrian conflict has entered a new phase with the capture at the weekend by government forces and their allies of Albu Kamal, the last significant town in Syria held by Islamic State, where Soleimani was pictured by Iranian media last week. Iraqi forces captured the border town of Rawa, the last remaining town there under Islamic State control, on Friday, signaling the collapse of the so-called caliphate it proclaimed in 2014 across vast swathes of Iraqi and Syrian territory.   Most of the forces battling Islamic State in Syria and Iraq have said they expect it to go underground and turn to a guerrilla insurgency using sleeper cells and bombings.         In his address on Tuesday, Rouhani accused the United States and Israel of supporting Islamic State. He also criticized Arab powers in the region and asked why they had not spoken out about civilian deaths in Yemen s conflict.  The foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia and other Arab states criticized Iran and its Lebanese Shi ite ally Hezbollah at an emergency meeting in Cairo on Sunday, calling for a united front to counter Iranian interference. Soleimani acknowledged the multinational force Iran has helped organize in the fight against Islamic State and thanked the  thousands of martyrs and wounded Iranian, Iraqi, Syrian, Afghan and Pakistani defenders of the shrine . He pointed to the  decisive role  played by Hezbollah and the group s leader Seyed Hassan Nasrallah and highlighted the thousands of Iraqi Shi ite volunteers, known as the Popular Mobilisation Forces, who have fought Islamic State in Iraq. On websites linked to the Guards, members of the organization killed in Syria and Iraq are praised as protectors of Shi ite holy sites and labeled  defenders of the shrine . Rouhani is scheduled to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish leader Tayyip Erdogan in Russia on Wednesday to discuss the Syria conflict. The Revolutionary Guards initially kept quiet about their military role in both Syria and Iraq but have become more outspoken about it as casualties have mounted. They frame their engagement as an existential struggle against the Sunni Muslim fighters of Islamic State, who see Shi ites, the majority of Iran s population, as apostates. Last month, U.S. President Donald Trump gave the U.S. Treasury Department authority to impose economic sanctions on Guards members in response to what Washington calls its efforts to destabilize and undermine its opponents in the Middle East.

China urges Thailand to find Muslim Uighurs quickly after dramatic cell break,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Tuesday it has urged Thailand to  quickly bring to justice  20 ethnic Uighur Muslims from China who broke out of a Thai detention center through a hole in the wall, using blankets to climb to the ground. Twenty-five Uighurs dug through their cell wall with broken tiles to make their dramatic escape from the center in Thailand s southern Songkhla province, near the border with Malaysia, early on Monday.  As of Tuesday, 10 had been caught, leaving 15 whose whereabouts were still unknown, according to Thai police, who said checkpoints had been set up along the border. The escapees were part of the last remaining group of more than 200 Uighurs detained in Thailand in 2014.  Members of the group identified themselves as Turkish citizens and asked to be sent to Turkey but more than 100 were forcibly returned to China in July 2015, a move that sparked international condemnation, including from rights groups who feared they could face torture in China. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China would continue to strengthen cooperation with Thailand on the detainees  escape and closely follow the situation.   China has already urged the relevant Thai department to quickly bring the relevant people to justice,  he said at a regular news briefing. Over the years, hundreds, possibly thousands, of Turkic-language speaking Uighurs have escaped unrest in China s western region of Xinjiang by traveling clandestinely via Southeast Asia to Turkey. The Chinese government has blamed violence in Xinjiang between majority Han Chinese and Uighurs on separatist Islamist militants, though rights groups and exiles say that anger over strict Chinese controls on the religion and culture of Uighurs is to blame. Exiled ethnic Uighur leader Rebiya Kadeer called on Thailand and any country that may find the Uighurs to treat them according to international law and not hand them over to China.  The Uyghurs took the risk of capture and perhaps harsh repercussions to try to save themselves from indefinite detention in Thailand and from deportation to China,  Kadeer said in an email released by the World Uyghur Congress, which she heads.  [Whether they] are indeed Turkish nationals as they claim or Chinese nationals as China claims, the fact that they are ethnic Uyghur is enough for them to face persecution and harsh punishment,  she said. Kadeer is a former political prisoner in China accused of leaking state secrets in 1999. She was later allowed to leave on medical grounds and lives in the United States. Amnesty International has said that Chinese authorities in recent months have detained up to 30 of Kadeer s relatives. China routinely denies accusations of rights abuses in Xinjiang, though it has admitted a problem with torture of detainees and has pledged to stop mistreatment of prisoners. On the borders of Central Asia, Afghanistan and Pakistan, the region is one of China s most sensitive domestic issues, and the government has dramatically ramped up police operations there and set up what critics characterize as  re-education  camps and oppressive surveillance.

Russia moves to shelter banks funding arms makers from sanctions,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia has proposed ending the publication of the names of banks which finance Russian state-controlled arms producers, in a possible sign that Moscow is preparing for new U.S. sanctions. The draft law would, if adopted, mean the Russian central bank no longer has to publish a list of banks dealing with the arms industry, which included eight lenders as of Oct. 1. Russia s government and the president would be able to include any banks they wanted to in such deals and would no longer publish the criteria for their involvement. Under current regulations only state-controlled or central bank-controlled lenders with capital of not less then 100 billion rubles ($1.7 billion) may get such contracts. Russian President Vladimir Putin chaired a meeting on Tuesday to discuss building up the country s military. The U.S. State Department last month named 39 Russian defense and intelligence-related entities following the signing in August of a new sanctions law by President Donald Trump to punish Moscow after U.S. intelligence agencies concluded it meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, allegations the Kremlin has repeatedly denied.  The U.S. law calls on the president to impose sanctions on anyone he identifies as having engaged  in a significant transaction with a person that is part of, or operates for or on behalf of, the defense or intelligence sectors  of the Russian government.. The action does not itself impose new sanctions, and determinations will be made on a case by case basis, State Department officials said in October. Banks on the list include state-controlled majors Sberbank, VTB and Russian Agriculture Bank, along with private-owned Rossiya and Gazprombank, in which gas producer Gazprom holds a stake. Sberbank has proposed establishing a special bank to finance Russia s military industry as a means of side-stepping the sanctions, three sources familiar with the talks told Reuters. Sberbank declined to comment. ",worldnews,"November 21, 2017 ",1
"Germany, citing own history, urges work to bridge Gulf divisions","BERLIN (Reuters) - German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel offered his Qatari counterpart a small piece of the Berlin Wall on Tuesday, saying Germany s post-war history was proof it was possible to overcome deep divisions such as those now plaguing the Gulf region. Gabriel said Germany had a keen interest in maintaining good relations with all the Gulf countries and working for peace in the region, even if those countries were sometimes in conflict.  Especially in politically troubled times in which dialogue has sometimes slipped into the background, it is all the more important to build bridges, to emphasize the things that unite us and to help remove walls,  Gabriel said at the opening of a new Qatar-funded Arabic cultural center in Berlin. Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said he hoped the new center, erected in a neo-classical villa in the southern part of Berlin, could showcase Arab culture and help battle stereotypes of Arabs in Europe. Sheikh Mohammed last week blamed what he called  reckless leadership  in the Gulf for a rift with Qatar and the current crisis in Lebanon, taking apparent aim at Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt this summer cut diplomatic, transport and trade ties with Qatar, accusing it of financing terrorism. Doha denies the charges. Gabriel did not refer to the Gulf dispute directly, but lauded Germany s World War Two enemies for building bridges and welcoming Germany back into the world community despite the devastation and horrors of the Nazi regime.  After 70 years, we saw that it s possible, even after a world war, to be partners in a first step and friends in a second,  he said.  Tearing down walls is exhausting but worth it.  Gabriel said a full segment of the Wall that once divided East and West Germany would be delivered to a museum in Doha, fulfilling a promise he had made to the sister of Qatar s ruler.  Because as a politician, particularly in these days in Germany, we ought to fulfill our promises,  he said.   That is a hot topic in my country at the moment.  Gabriel, a former leader of the Social Democrats (SPD), declined to comment further on Chancellor Angela Merkel s failure to forge a new coalition government with the pro-business Free Democrats and environmental Greens. Merkel is pressing the SPD to reconsider its refusal to join another  grand coalition  with the conservatives - a move that would stave off new elections that now loom.

U.S. appeals court revives claims in $1.7 billion Iran terrorism lawsuit,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court in New York on Tuesday revived part of a $1.68 billion lawsuit against Iran s central bank, Bank Markazi, by families of soldiers killed in the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine Corps barracks in Lebanon. By a 3-0 vote, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said a lower court judge erred in dismissing claims against Markazi; Banca UBAE SpA, an Italian bank accused of engaging in transactions for Iran; and Clearstream Banking SA, a Luxembourg bank accused of opening accounts for Markazi and UBAE. It upheld the dismissal of claims against JPMorgan Chase & Co. The plaintiffs sought to recoup bond proceeds allegedly owned by Markazi and held by Clearstream, to partially satisfy $3.8 billion of judgments they had won against Iran after a federal court deemed them victims of state-sponsored terrorism. They accused the banks of fraudulently processing billions of dollars of bond proceeds owed to Markazi, and targeted cash held in a Clearstream account at JPMorgan in New York. Iran is one of several countries and organizations ordered by U.S. courts to pay damages to terrorism victims. Such orders are often difficult to enforce. Lawyers for the plaintiffs and banks did not immediately respond to requests for comment. U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest had dismissed the case in February 2015. She said she lacked jurisdiction over Markazi assets located abroad, the plaintiffs had released claims against Clearstream and UBAE, and nothing was left in the Clearstream account for JPMorgan to  turn over.  In Tuesday s 72-page decision, Circuit Judge Robert Sack said Forrest reasonably assumed she lacked jurisdiction because the main assets in dispute had been recorded on Clearstream s books in Luxembourg. But he said recent court rulings interpreting the federal Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act permitted courts in New York  to exercise jurisdiction  to recall to New York extraterritorial assets owned by a foreign sovereign.  Sack ordered Forrest to decide whether she has personal jurisdiction over Clearstream, and whether state or federal law prevents the plaintiffs from recovering bond proceeds. In April 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court said in a separate case that Markazi must pay nearly $2 billion, which had been frozen, to terrorism victims, and Congress had not exceeded its authority by passing a law making it easier to recover damages. The 1983 attack, in Beirut, killed 241 U.S. service members. The case is Peterson et al v Islamic Republic of Iran et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 15-0690.

Truck bomb in northern Iraq kills at least 23,"KIRKUK, Iraq (Reuters) - At least 23 people were killed and 60 wounded when a suicide bomber set off a truck bomb near a crowded marketplace in the northern Iraqi town of Tuz Khurmatu, police and medical sources said on Tuesday. An interior ministry spokesman said a  violent explosion  took place near a vegetable market in the town, south of Kirkuk, but did not immediately provide casualty figures. Military authorities said 17 were killed and 36 injured, according to a statement. Most of the casualties were civilians, the police and medical sources told Reuters. The death toll was expected to rise because many of the wounded were in critical condition. The bombing took place in a mainly Shi ite Turkmen area. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack. Suicide bombings are a trademark of Islamic State, and Iraqi security officials have said the group was likely to wage an insurgency after its self-proclaimed caliphate collapsed and its militants were dislodged from territories they held in the country.

Iraq to declare final victory over Islamic State after desert campaign,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said on Tuesday Islamic State had been defeated from a military perspective but he would only declare final victory after IS militants were routed in the desert. Iraqi forces on Friday captured the border town of Rawa, the last remaining town under Islamic State control, signaling the collapse of the group s  caliphate  proclaimed after it overran much of Iraq s north and west in 2014. Securing desert and border areas is what remains in the campaign against Islamic State, military commanders say.  From a military perspective, we have ended the presence of Daesh in Iraq,  Abadi said while addressing a weekly news conference, referring to Islamic State by an Arabic acronym.  God willing we will announce very soon after the end of the purification operations victory over Daesh in Iraq.  Abadi s comments came as Iranian President Hassan Rouhani declared the end of Islamic State while a senior Iranian military commander thanked the  thousands of martyrs  killed in operations organized by Iran to defeat the militant group in Syria and Iraq. Political disagreements will pave the way for the Sunni militant group to carry out attacks, however, Abadi said. He was referring to the central Baghdad government s dispute with the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government over the latter s declaration of independence following a Sept. 25 referendum.  Any disagreement between political factions will encourage Daesh to carry out terrorist attacks,  he said.  I call on our Kurdish brothers to avoid fighting.  Hours before Abadi spoke, at least 23 people were killed and 60 wounded when a suicide bomber set off a truck bomb near a crowded marketplace in the northern Iraqi town of Tuz Khurmatu, south of the oil city of Kirkuk. Abadi praised a federal court verdict that ruled the Kurdish referendum unconstitutional and called on Kurds not to resort to violence. Iraq s Supreme Federal Court ruled on Monday that the referendum was unconstitutional and the results void, bolstering Baghdad s hand in a stand-off with the Kurdish region watched closely by neighbouring Turkey and Iran.  I hail the federal court s decision to void the Kurdish region s referendum,  he said. Kurds voted overwhelmingly to break away from Iraq in the referendum, defying Baghdad and alarming neighboring Turkey and Iran who have their own Kurdish minorities. The Iraqi government responded to the referendum by seizing Kurdish-held Kirkuk and other territory disputed between the Kurds and the central government. It also banned direct flights to Kurdistan and demanded control over border crossings. ",worldnews,"November 21, 2017 ",1
"Mugabe: Zimbabwe's liberator and, for many, its oppressor","HARARE (Reuters) - When he came to power, Zimbabwe s Robert Mugabe was feted as an African liberation hero in a nation that had endured nearly a century of white colonial rule. Nearly four decades after the country s independence from Britain in 1980, he was regarded by many as an autocrat, willing to unleash death squads, rig elections and trash the economy in the relentless pursuit of power. The 93-year-old resigned as president on Tuesday, ending 37 years of rule. He had clung on for a week after an army takeover and expulsion from his ZANU-PF party, but quit after parliament began an impeachment process against him. Educated and urbane, Mugabe took power after seven years of a liberation bush war and is the only leader Zimbabwe, formerly Rhodesia, has known since independence from Britain in 1980.  The army seized power last week after Mugabe sacked ZANU-PF s favorite to succeed him, Vice-president Emmerson Mnangagwa, to smooth a path to the presidency for his wife Grace, 52, known to her critics as  Gucci Grace  for her reputed fondness for luxury shopping.  It s the end of a very painful and sad chapter in the history of a young nation, in which a dictator, as he became old, surrendered his court to a gang of thieves around his wife,  Chris Mutsvangwa, leader of Zimbabwe s influential liberation war veterans, told Reuters after the army takeover. Born on a Catholic mission near Harare, Mugabe was educated by Jesuit priests and worked as a primary school teacher before going to South Africa s University of Fort Hare, then a breeding ground for African nationalism.  Returning to Rhodesia in 1960, he entered politics but was jailed for a decade four years later for opposing white rule. After his release, he rose to the top of the powerful Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army, known as the  thinking man s guerrilla  on account of his seven degrees, three of them earned behind bars. Later, as he crushed his political enemies, he boasted of another qualification -  a degree in violence . After the long bush war ended, Mugabe was elected as the nation s first black prime minister. Initially, he offered reconciliation to old adversaries as he presided over a booming economy.  But it was not long before Mugabe began to suppress challengers such as liberation war rival Joshua Nkomo. Faced with a revolt in the mid-1980s in the western province of Matabeleland which he blamed on Nkomo, Mugabe sent in North Korean-trained army units, provoking an international outcry over alleged atrocities against civilians. Human rights groups say 20,000 people died, most from Nkomo s Ndebele tribe. The discovery of mass graves prompted accusations of genocide against Mugabe. After two terms as prime minister, Mugabe changed the constitution and was elected president in 1990, shortly before the death of his first wife, Sally, seen by many as the only person capable of restraining him. When, at the end of the century, he lost a constitutional referendum followed by a groundswell of black anger at the slow pace of land reform, his response was uncompromising. As gangs of black people calling themselves war veterans invaded white-owned farms, Mugabe said it was a correction of colonial injustices.  Perhaps we made a mistake by not finishing the war in the trenches,  he said in 2000.  If the settlers had been defeated through the barrel of a gun, perhaps we would not be having the same problems.  The farm seizures helped ruin one of Africa s most dynamic economies, with a collapse in agricultural foreign exchange earnings unleashing hyperinflation. The economy shrank by more than a third from 2000 to 2008, sending unemployment above 80 percent. Several million Zimbabweans fled, mostly to South Africa. An unapologetic Mugabe portrayed himself as a radical African nationalist competing against racist and imperialist forces in Washington and London. Britain once likened him to Adolf Hitler but Mugabe did not mind, saying the Nazi leader had wanted justice, sovereignty and independence for his people:  If that is Hitler, then let me be a Hitler ten-fold.  The country hit rock bottom in 2008, when 500 billion percent inflation drove people to support the challenge of Western-backed former union leader Morgan Tsvangirai. Facing defeat in a presidential run-off, Mugabe resorted to violence, forcing Tsvangirai to withdraw after scores of his supporters were killed by ZANU-PF thugs. An increasingly worried South Africa squeezed the pair into a fractious unity coalition but the compromise belied Mugabe s de facto grip on power through his continued control of the army, police and secret service. As old age crept in and rumors of cancer intensified, his animosity towards Tsvangirai eased, with the two men enjoying weekly meetings over tea and scones, a quirky nod to Mugabe s affection for British tradition if not authority. On the eve of the 2013 election, Mugabe dismissed cries of autocracy and likened dealing with Tsvangirai to sparring in the ring.  Although we boxed each other, it s not as hostile as before,  he said.  It s all over now. We can shake hands.  At the same time, Mugabe s agents were finalizing plans to engineer an election victory through manipulation of the voters  roll, the Tsvangirai camp said. The subsequent landslide was typical of a man who could always out-fight and out-think opponents.  To give the devil his due, he is a brilliant tactician,  former U.S. ambassador Christopher Dell wrote in a cable released by WikiLeaks. ",worldnews,"November 21, 2017 ",1

Members of Libyan parliament signal backing for U.N. transition proposals,"BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Libya s eastern-based parliament voted on Tuesday to approve some U.N. proposals aimed at unifying the divided North African nation, although major obstacles remain for a deal to stabilize the oil producer. The U.N. launched a new round of talks in September to end years of turmoil in Libya following a 2011 NATO-backed uprising and unite the rival governments and parliaments in Tripoli and the east. Choosing the members of the presidency and the government, and settling the question of military leadership are seen as the biggest hurdles to any deal. Only a minority of members of the House of Representatives in Benghazi took part in Tuesday s vote, so it is unclear to what extent it will advance the latest push for a political deal. Opposition in the House had been a key obstacle to previous U.N. peace efforts. A rival assembly in Tripoli is also meant to approve the proposals. The U.N. talks were suspended in October, but the organization has been working behind the scenes. Its envoy Ghassan Salame said last week that delegations from rival assemblies were  close to a consensus . On Tuesday, a majority of about 75 members of the House present approved U.N. proposals regarding the broader structure of a future government, said Fathi al-Marimi, an adviser to House speaker Agila Saleh. An unspecified number were flown in by Saleh on a private plane, he said. The House session had originally been planned for Monday but was postponed when a U.N. flight carrying some deputies based in western Libya was prevented from landing. The U.N. proposals are aimed at relaunching a deal signed in December 2015, which produced a U.N.-backed government in Tripoli that has struggled to assert its authority and never been accepted by factions that control the east of the country. Salame said last week that he was planning to hold a national conference in February to agree how to finalize a transition, and that the U.N. was working to establish the right conditions for holding new elections.

Arm found near Copenhagen could relate to submarine case: Danish police,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - An unidentified arm found by divers in the water near Copenhagen could belong to Swedish journalist Kim Wall who died after taking a submarine ride with the vessel s Danish inventor in August, Danish police said on Tuesday. The arm was found near the route that had been investigated in connection with the submarine case, the police said in a statement. The limb would be examined by coroners on Wednesday.   We have not yet determined if this is a right or left arm or who the arm belongs to. But we are working from a perspective that it stems from the submarine case,  police spokesman Jens Moller Jensen said.  Wall, a freelance journalist who was researching a story on submarine owner Peter Madsen, went missing after he took her out to sea in the 17-metre (56-foot) submarine in August. On Aug. 23, police identified a headless female torso that washed ashore in Copenhagen as that of Wall. In October, police said they had recovered her head and legs. Madsen admitted to dismembering Wall on board his submarine and dumping her body parts in the sea, but he still denies murdering her and a charge of sexual assault without intercourse. The trial has been set to take place in Copenhagen next March. ",worldnews,"November 21, 2017 ",1
Lebanon army chief warns of Israel threat amid political crisis,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon s army chief told his soldiers on Tuesday to be extra vigilant to prevent unrest during political turmoil after the prime minister quit, and accused Israel of  aggressive  intentions at the southern frontier. Troops should be ready to  thwart any attempt to exploit the current circumstances for stirring strife,  the army s Twitter account quoted General Joseph Aoun as saying ahead of Independence Day celebrations on Wednesday.  The exceptional political situation that Lebanon is going through requires you to exercise the highest levels of awareness.  Aoun called on troops to  assume full readiness at the southern border to face the threats of the Israeli enemy, its violations, and the aggressive intentions it is indicating towards Lebanon.  A senior Israeli official dismissed the warnings of border aggression as  nonsense . Lebanon was thrust back onto the forefront of regional rivalry between Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shi ite Iran, after its prime minister quit this month in a broadcast from Riyadh.      In his shock resignation, Saad al-Hariri railed against the Iran-backed Shi ite military and political movement Hezbollah,  which both Saudi Arabia and Israel consider an enemy. The Lebanese president has refused to accept Hariri s resignation until he returns to Lebanon.  The Saudis have demanded that Hezbollah stop meddling in regional conflicts and say it must disarm. Hezbollah has long said it must keep its arsenal to protect Lebanon from Israel, and its leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah accused the Saudis this month of inciting Israel to attack Lebanon. He said he could not rule out a new clash with Israel, although he described it as unlikely. In a televised speech on Monday, Nasrallah suggested the Saudis and Israelis were working together.  Tensions grew earlier this year between Israel and Hezbollah, which fought a month-long war in 2006 that killed around 1,200 people in Lebanon, mostly civilians, and 160 Israelis, most of them troops.  Israeli Energy Minister Yuval Steinmetz said this week that Israel has had covert contacts with Riyadh amid common concerns over Iran, a rare disclosure by a senior official from either country of long-rumored secret dealings. But Israel dismissed claims that it is planning military action against Hezbollah at the behest of Saudi Arabia.  We are not interested in an escalation with Lebanon,  Israeli Education Minister Naftali Bennett, a member of the security cabinet, told Reuters about the accusation of Israeli-Saudi collusion.  However, Bennett added:  If rockets are fired from Lebanon at Israeli cities, then we will see that as a declaration of war by the state of Lebanon and will act with all our might.  In Israel, where the 2006 war was widely seen as inconclusive, there is little in the public mood or political discourse to suggest fighting with Hezbollah is imminent. But Israeli officials have voiced deep concern about Iran and Hezbollah s expanding influence in the region.  The Saudis and Israel definitely have common interests today,  including the threat from Iran, Israeli Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked said in a radio interview last week.  The countries  coming together could serve both of them.   But, Shaked said,  we don t work for anyone. We first and foremost look out for our interests.  ",worldnews,"November 21, 2017 ",1
"Yemen Houthis say Sanaa airport repaired, ready to receive flights: agency","ADEN (Reuters) - Yemen s Sanaa airport, damaged in an air strike by a Saudi-led coalition last week, has been repaired and is ready to receive international flights, the Houthi-led government which runs the capital city said on Tuesday. The Nov. 14 raid destroyed radio navigation equipment at the airport and in effect put the facility out of service. The attack happened after the coalition banned naval, air and land transportation to Yemen following a missile fired by the Houthis that was shot down over the Saudi capital Riyadh. The transport minister in the Houthi-run government, Zakariya al-Shami, said that technical civil aviation teams had completed implementation of technical alternatives necessary to restore services to the airport .  It is ready to receive international flights,  Shami said, according to Houthi-controlled news agency Saba. The airport had been mainly used by international relief agencies, including U.N. staff, using United Nations flights to Sanaa. The coalition has said that all Yemeni land crossings, air and sea ports would remain closed until assurances are made that no weapons can reach the Houthis. The coalition accuses Iran of smuggling weapons, including the missile fired towards Riyadh airport on Nov. 4, to the Houthis through Yemeni ports controlled by the group. Iran denies sending any weapons to the Houthis. The closure of Yemen s ports, including the main Hodeidah port where most of the country s food supplies enter, has raised alarm around the world. The European Union on Tuesday urged the Saudi-led coalition to reopen Yemen s ports and airports.  While fully recognizing the serious security threat incoming from Yemen, it is our firm belief that hindering vital humanitarian access to the Yemeni population that is already on the brink of famine and subject to a spreading cholera outbreak will not effectively address these security concerns,  EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said.

Northern Ireland parties downbeat on talks as May calls for progress,"LONDON (Reuters) - Northern Ireland s main political parties pointed on Tuesday to fresh obstacles to restoring a devolved power-sharing government in the British region after meeting Prime Minister Theresa May, who urged them to resume talks next week. The province has been without a regional government for almost a year, destabilizing the delicate balance between Irish nationalists and pro-British unionists that has already been shaken by Britain s vote to leave the European Union. The latest efforts at breaking the stalemate in Belfast collapsed this month, prompting Britain to begin setting a budget for the province, a major step toward imposing direct rule from London for the first time in a decade. The head of the pro-British Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) Arlene Foster accused Irish nationalist rival Sinn Fein - the former political wing of the Irish Republican Army - of the  glorification of terrorism  in a party conference last weekend.  Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams in turn accused May of  acting in bad faith  by including a potential statute of limitations covering crimes by British forces in a planned consultation on new laws to deal with the legacy of Northern Ireland s 30 years of sectarian violence. May struck a more positive tone, saying the issues dividing the parties were relatively few and that she believed an agreement could be reached. In Dublin, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said that if an administration could not be formed, he would seek a meeting in the New Year of the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference, a joint decision making body recognizing the Irish government s special interest in Northern Ireland that last met a decade ago.    Analysts have said a fresh round of talks is unlikely to be even contemplated until after both parties  annual conferences, culminating with the DUP s meeting on Saturday. The DUP has said it was upset by prolonged cheering at Sinn Fein s annual conference at the weekend after MP Elisha McCallion spoke of former Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness  pride in his role in the IRA.  The IRA killed hundreds in its campaign against British rule before a ceasefire in 1994. Around 3,600 died on all sides in the conflict, fought over whether Northern Ireland should be part of the United Kingdom or Ireland, before it ended with a 1998 peace agreement.  It was quite disgraceful to look at the glorification that happened at the weekend of the IRA and terrorism and of course that makes it more difficult for us,  Foster, whose father narrowly escaped alive from an IRA shooting, told reporters. Foster, who warned ahead of the talks that further steps toward direct rule looked inevitable unless there is a change of direction, said her party remained committed to devolution.

Macron scores diplomatic coup on Lebanon but balancing act under test,"PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron s initiative in bringing Lebanon s Saad al-Hariri to Paris puts France at the center of a power struggle between Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shi ite Iran and will test a policy of neutrality that critics doubt can be sustained.  While the move eased regional tensions that spiked after the prime minister s resignation on Nov. 4, it also exposed the difficulty of Macron s stated position of taking no sides in the Middle East.  Macron has put his neck out on Lebanon,  said a European diplomat who didn t want to be named talking about an ally s policies.  It s a bit like his moment of truth.  Hariri, a Saudi ally, arrived in France on Saturday days after announcing his resignation while in Riyadh, accusing Iran and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah of creating strife. Many Lebanese believe the Saudis made him quit. President Michel Aoun has not accepted the resignation and Hariri is expected to return to Beirut on Wednesday, when Lebanon celebrates the end of France s colonial mandate in 1943. Macron s maneuver, which came after a visit to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and a flurry of calls, appears to have taken the foreign ministry by surprise, an example of his penchant for bypassing state organs to show he s in charge, much like former leader Nicolas Sarkozy.  So far it s a symbolic victory for French diplomacy that has enabled a reduction in tensions,  said Stephane Malsagne, a lecturer at Sciences Po University in Paris, adding it was a  risky gamble  that could antagonize all sides.  Macron set out his foreign policy objectives for the region in his first speech to the diplomatic corps in August, saying he wanted France to maintain a balanced position.  We will achieve our goal of fighting terrorism only if we do not make the mistake that would impose a choice between Shi ites and Sunnis, and in a sense, force us to lock ourselves in one camp,  he said at the time. Some French diplomats say Macron will find it difficult to appease everyone, however.  Lebanon maintains a delicate sectarian balance after Sunnis, Shi ites, Christians and Druze fought a civil war between 1975 and 1990, with factions often backed by regional rivals. Hariri is Sunni Muslim and President Aoun, a political ally of Hezbollah, is Christian. Hariri s government, a power-sharing coalition formed last year, includes Shi ite Hezbollah.  This mediation is an introduction for a new French political role in Lebanon ... (and) a French attempt to find a foothold starting from Lebanon into the region,  said a senior Lebanese official, speaking on condition of anonymity.  But in the shadow of big players (U.S., Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia) in the region, the French will face difficulties.   Since Hariri announced his resignation, Saudi Arabia has accused Lebanon of declaring war on it, citing Hezbollah s role in fighting in other Arab countries.     France has a long history of commercial, political and social links with Iran that even saw Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomenei exiled near Paris in 1979, but it was arguably the most demanding of the six powers negotiating the 2015 nuclear accord. Under Presidents Sarkozy and Francois Hollande, who aligned themselves with Qatar and Saudi Arabia, respectively, there was a hawkish shift toward Tehran. Since the deal, Paris has been quick to restore trade ties, with planemaker Airbus, oil major Total and automobile manufacturers Peugeot and Renault all signing deals. That rapprochement annoyed Riyadh, which has been moving closer to the United States under President Donald Trump.  We had to reassure the Saudis ... and rebalance things. Prince Salman has gone into overdrive and that s dangerous for  everyone so he needs some love from us,  said one French diplomat, who asked not to be identified.  Tehran is now chafing in turn over France s warming Saudi ties and what appears to be a good relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is due in Paris on Dec. 10 for the second time since Macron took office in May. Recent rhetoric has reflected the tensions. At a news conference on Friday, Macron said Iran should clarify what is going on with its ballistic missile program which  seems to be uncontrolled . That followed a news conference in Riyadh on Thursday at which Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian denounced Tehran s  hegemonic temptations . On Saturday Ali Akbar Velayati, a senior adviser to Iran s supreme leader, told Macron to stay out of its affairs. Le Drian has pushed back a planned visit to Tehran and talk that Macron may visit next year has become more muted.   Speaking to all sides is noble, but this policy in the region will come tumbling down if Le Drian and Macron do not go to Tehran. Our credibility depends on it,  said a second French diplomat. Some hardline politicians in Iran have criticized President Hassan Rouhani for trying to strengthen ties with Paris, saying Europeans will not endanger their interests in the face of U.S. pressure. A senior Iranian official said Macron s policy of  balance  ultimately just offered mixed signals.  He talks about curbing Iran s defensive missile work and criticizes Iran s regional policy and then he wants to build closer ties?  the official said.   France should clearly announce which side Paris is taking.... we like to expand our relations but Paris sends mixed signals and cannot be trusted.  ",worldnews,"November 21, 2017 ",1
U.S. charges two with bribing African officials for China energy firm,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has charged a former Senegalese foreign minister and a former top Hong Kong government official with links to a Chinese energy conglomerate with bribing high-level officials in Chad and Uganda in exchange for contracts for the mainland company.

It added that Ho, a former Hong Kong home affairs secretary who heads a non-governmental organization based in Hong Kong and Virginia, was arrested on Saturday.  Wiring almost a million dollars through New York s banking system in furtherance of their corrupt schemes, the defendants allegedly sought to generate business through bribes paid to the president of Chad and the Ugandan foreign minister,  Joon Kim, acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, was quoted as saying in the statement. No one could be reached at the embassies of Chad and Uganda in Washington late on Monday. The missions did not immediately respond to emails requesting comment. In a statement, the U.S. Justice Department said the case against Ho involved two bribery schemes to pay high-level officials of Chad and Uganda in exchange for business advantages for a Shanghai-headquartered, multibillion-dollar energy firm. This energy company funded a non-government organization (NGO) based in Hong Kong and Virginia that Ho heads, the statement said, without naming the Shanghai company or the NGO.  Ho is the secretary general of the Hong Kong-based China Energy Fund Committee, a mainland-backed think-tank that describes itself as a charitable, non-government organization.  China Energy Fund Committee is fully funded by CEFC China Energy, a Shanghai-based private conglomerate, according to the think tank s website. The organization did not respond to an email requesting comment. CEFC China Energy said in a statement posted on its website late on Tuesday that:  As a non-governmental, non-profit organization, the fund is not involved in the commercial activities of CEFC China Energy.  CEFC does not have any investment in Uganda, the company said in the statement, and its investment in Chad had been acquired via a stake bought from Taiwan s state-owned Chinese Petroleum Corp and it had not dealt directly with the Chad government.  The company will continue monitoring this matter and will take necessary measures based on developments,  it said. CEFC has been a key player in Chinese President Xi Jinping s Belt and Road initiative, which aims to bolster China s global leadership ambitions by building infrastructure and trade links between Asia, Africa, Europe and beyond. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang told a regular news briefing Tuesday that he was not aware of the specific details of the case.  I want to emphasize that the Chinese government consistently requires Chinese companies abroad to operate lawfully and abide by local laws and regulations.   Idriss Deby has been Chad s president since 1990. Ugandan Foreign Minister Sam Kutesa served as the president of the U.N. General Assembly in 2014 and 2015. Ho s attorney, Ed Kim, of Krieger Kim & Lewin LLP, declined to comment to Reuters. Bob Baum of Federal Defenders, who represented Gadio for the bail argument, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Ho was ordered detained after appearing in court on Monday, the Justice Department statement said. It said Gadio appeared before a judge on Saturday and is being held until he can meet the conditions of a $1 million bond, according to court records. The Justice Department said a $2 million bribe was paid to Chad s president, who then provided the company with an opportunity to obtain oil rights in Chad without international competition. The department said in the statement that Gadio was the go-between and was paid $400,000 by Ho via wire transfers through New York. The Justice Department accused Ho of being involved with bribes and promises of future benefits to Uganda s foreign minister in exchange for help in obtaining business advantages for the Chinese company.

"After U.N. veto, Russia moves against chemical weapons watchdog","THE HAGUE (Reuters) - After blocking U.N. Security Council action against Syria, Russia has proposed changing the rules for inspectors at the world s chemical weapons body in The Hague, a move Western diplomats and experts said would undermine its work. It is the latest confrontation between Russia, a close ally and military backer of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and the West over an international inquiry established to determine who is behind ongoing chemical attacks in Syria s civil war. It came as Russian President Vladimir Putin hosted Assad late on Monday for talks aimed at ending a conflict that has now raged for nearly seven years. [L8N1NR3VO] At the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), a draft Russian-Iranian decision circulated among the 41 members of the body s executive council, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters, sought to overturn procedures on how  OPCW inspectors work and how their findings are shared. The proposal was to be discussed by the OPCW s decision-making executive council, which was meeting on Tuesday, but had little chance of obtaining sufficient support to pass. Russia s ambassador to the OPCW, Alexander Shulgin, said in an interview that Moscow remained committed to the OPCW and efforts to prosecute perpetrators of attacks. But Russia is  not convinced by some of the findings implicating the Syrian government,  he said, defending the effort to change the mandate. He also questioned the decision not to send OPCW inspectors to Khan Sheikhoun, where nearly 100 people were killed with sarin on April 4,  based on the pretext of the security conditions . The head of the OPCW said at the time the team was not deployed to Khan Sheikhoun due to genuine security risks   they were ambushed and shot at during investigations in 2013 and 2014. The team confirmed sarin poisoning by testing the blood of victims across the border in Turkey. The Russian draft says the OPCW should withhold  findings that are not based on the results of on-site investigations , but experts said this was an attempt to scupper the investigations.  (Russia s) supreme goal is to compromise the ability of the (OPCW) fact-finding mission to do its job professionally and without political interference,  said Gregory Koblentz, a non-proliferation expert at George Mason University, in the U.S. state of Virginia.  This draft resolution has to be seen as part of a Russian strategy to undermine all international investigations into the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government,  he said. Last Friday, Moscow blocked a proposal to extend the mandate of a joint investigation by the United Nations and the OPCW, saying it was seriously flawed. Under a 2013 U.S.-Russian deal, Assad agreed to hand over his toxic stockpile following a sarin attack in a Damascus suburb. Dozens of countries helped to remove and destroy the lethal chemicals, but attacks have continued. Investigators have already concluded that Syrian government forces were behind later attacks with nerve-agent sarin and chlorine barrel bombs, while Islamic State militants had used sulfur mustard gas. Syria denied using chemical weapons. Sweden and Uruguay are pushing for the U.N. Security Council to revive an international inquiry, but without the support of Russia, which holds a veto, there can be no further U.N.-backed inquiries. ",worldnews,"November 21, 2017 ",1
Somaliland picks ruling party's candidate as new president,"BOSASSO (Reuters) - Musa Bihi Abdi of the ruling Kulmiye party was declared the winner of Somaliland s presidential election on Tuesday, by the election commission of the breakaway region. Situated at the northern tip of east Africa on the Gulf of Aden - one of the busiest trade routes in the world - Somaliland broke away from Somalia in 1991 and has been relatively peaceful since. The region of 4 million people has not been internationally recognized but it has recently drawn in sizeable investments from the Gulf. In the election, Abdi won just over 55 percent of the vote, while opposition leader Abdirahman Iro took nearly 41 percent, election commission chairman Iman Warsame said. Turnout was 80 percent. In a debate before last week s vote, Abdi pledged to boost women s participation in politics and introduce compulsory national service for high school and university graduates. There was no immediate comment from Iro, whose opposition party Waddani had accused Kulmiye of vote-rigging although it has not given evidence. A U.K. government-funded international observer mission said the poll  preserved the integrity of the electoral process  and concluded irregularities were limited and did not undermine the vote. The former British protectorate broke away from Somalia in 1991 following a bloody civil war. The poll had originally been scheduled for 2015 but was delayed by political spats and severe drought. Analysts say the region enjoys strong ties with neighboring Ethiopia and Djibouti as well as its growing investment from the Gulf. Earlier this year the government agreed to let the United Arab Emirates establish a military base in its port of Berbera. That came after Dubai s DP World last year signed a 30-year concession to develop the same port that will require an investment of $440 million. The company is pouring further funds into a project connecting the port to landlocked Ethiopia. This month DP World said it would also develop an economic zone in the region.

"In movie-style heist, Kenya robbers tunnel into bank opposite police station","NAIROBI (Reuters) - In a heist reminiscent of a Hollywood movie, Kenyan robbers spent months tunneling into the bowels of a bank located opposite a police station and stole the equivalent of half a million dollars, police said on Tuesday. Police said they had arrested two men and one woman over the robbery but had not recovered the 50 million Kenyan shillings, reported missing by staff at the branch of Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) on Monday when they showed up to work.  We have not recovered the stolen money,  said Simba Willy, sub-county police commander in the town of Thika, northeast of Nairobi, where the heist took place.  We suspect the robbers hired one of the shops near the bank (while digging their tunnel),  Willy told Reuters. The robbers were able to remove the earth during their months-long excavations without arousing suspicion by concealing it in boxes, the Daily Nation newspaper quoted local traders as saying. The traders described the two young men who had rented the store as  very hardworking  and  introverts . KCB, which is the region s biggest bank by assets, confirmed the break-in on Twitter.  But the Kenyans have competition for the title of most ingenious robbery. Last month Brazilian police foiled a plot to rob a Sao Paulo bank after discovering a 500-metre underground tunnel kitted out with lighting and ventilation systems.

"UK Brexit minister says EU agreement likely, but UK ready for no deal","LONDON (Reuters) - Britain s Brexit minister David Davis said on Tuesday that reaching a deal with the European Union was the most likely outcome of talks, but added that the British government was prepared for no agreement with the bloc.  Reaching a deal with the European Union is not only far and away the most likely outcome, it s also the best outcome for our country,  Davis said in a speech in London.   I don t think it would be in the interest for either side for there to be no deal. But as a responsible government it is right that we make every plan for every eventuality.  Both sides have spoken of their frustration at a lack of progress in negotiations so far, although Davis said talks had made real and tangible progress. Britain wants to move discussions on to the future trade relationship with the EU which Brussels will not consider until London settles what it sees as past debts. While Davis said he was  unambiguously  seeking a deal, he said Britain was ready for talks to fail.  Over the past year every department across Whitehall has been working at pace covering the whole range of scenarios,  he said.  These plans have been well developed, have been designed to provide the flexibility to respond to a negotiated agreement, as well as preparing us for the chance that we leave without a deal.

"Turkey has not seen data on fugitive Raqqa fighters, officials say","ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey has not been given crucial data to help identify Islamic State militants who fled their former stronghold in Raqqa last month and may have slipped out of Syria to threaten Turkish or Western targets, Turkish officials said. Hundreds of Islamic State members and their families were allowed to leave Raqqa by Kurdish and Arab forces who captured the city in mid-October, spokesmen for the fighters and the U.S.-led alliance which supports them said. The coalition fighting Islamic State in Syria and Iraq said last month that biometric information including fingerprints was taken from the militants before their convoy left Raqqa, so they would be known  if they resurface in the future . But two senior Turkish security officials told Reuters they had not seen any such data which would identify fighters from Raqqa among the hundreds of Islamic State suspects rounded up in security sweeps in Turkish cities over the last two weeks.  If the United States or the coalition received information about Islamic State members who were withdrawn from Raqqa and is not sharing it with Turkey, how will we fight against terrorism together?  one official said.  We didn t receive any biometric data in this office,  another security official said. A third government official said he believed the biometric data had not been shared with Turkey. Ankara has bitterly criticized the deal to allow militants to leave Raqqa, saying it suspects some fighters have been smuggled across Syria s northern border into Turkey and could pose an international threat.  These Islamic State members, released with their weapons, will cause deaths of innocent people in Europe, the United States, all over the world, especially in Turkey,  Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said last week. His comments reflect long-running tensions with Washington over its support for the Kurdish YPG militia which spearheaded the fight to seize Raqqa from Islamic State, as well as Turkey s complaints at what it says is limited security cooperation. Turkey sees the YPG as an extension of the outlawed Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) which has waged an insurgency in the south of the country since the 1980s, and says weapons supplied by the United States will fall under PKK control. Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said last week that the Raqqa deal showed the YPG was more interested in gaining territory for a Kurdish state in Syria than defeating Islamic State. Syrian Kurdish leaders say they are not seeking secession.  They are in close cooperation with Daesh (Islamic State) there,  Cavusoglu said.  These organizations appear to be fighting when it suits them.  The coalition said around 250 fighters, accompanied by 3,000 people it described as human shields, left Raqqa on Oct. 15 under the deal reached by Arab tribal leaders and a local civil council. In a statement to Reuters, it said a coalition leader had attended talks where the deal was reached but was not an active participant, and it  explicitly disagreed with letting armed ISIS (Islamic State) terrorists leave Raqqa .  The coalition said screening of the departing fighters was carried out by Kurdish YPG-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) who took Raqqa, and the Raqqa Civil Council. It referred questions about the biometric data gleaned from the tests to those two bodies. As far as it was aware  none of the terrorists who departed Raqqa with the convoy on Oct. 15, 2017 were able to legally or illegally gain entry to Turkey,  the coalition said, without saying whether it had been able to track them. SDF spokesman Mostafa Bali said all the fighters who were allowed to leave Raqqa were in SDF detention. He did not say whether the biometric data had been shared. But another Turkish official said Ankara suspected - based on interrogations of captured suspects - that some militants from Raqqa had managed to smuggle themselves across the border, despite increased security at crossings.  We believe some of the captured Islamic State militants may be from those that left Raqqa,  he said.  Since they came in with their families, we get this (information) from their families . There was no specific intelligence of a threat to Turkey or Europe at the moment, he added, but an attack could take place at any time.  We have brought measures to counter this to their highest level,  he said. Exchange of information with Europe and the United States was continuing, despite any political differences, he added. France, where militants killed 130 people in coordinated strikes across Paris in November 2015, said last week the threat of an attack was no greater than over the last two years and security services were either arresting or monitoring Islamist militants who returned from Syria and Iraq.

Denmark to ramp up cyber security efforts: defense minister,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Denmark intends to invest to boost efforts to prevent cyber attacks in a strategy to be presented early next year, its defense minister said on Tuesday.  We are going to spend more money in this area,  Claus Hjort Frederiksen told Reuters on the sidelines of a conference in Copenhagen, though he declined to disclose a figure. Cyber security is  very high on the agenda  for the right-leaning government, but also for the broad selection of Danish political parties negotiating a new defense strategy for the coming six years, he said. The government would like to expand an early warning system with sensors that detects when Danish companies or authorities are under attack from, for example, malware.  To some degree we do have a system today, but we would like to expand it to the strategic infrastructure and to private companies,  he told Reuters. The government also wants to increase the preventive capacity at the Danish center for cyber security to increase its ability to better catch and inform about imminent cyber threats, he said. World s no.1 container shipper and one of Denmark s largest companies Maersk was hit by major cyber attack in June, one of the biggest-ever disruptions to hit global shipping.  The government also works for a deeper cooperation between authorities and private companies in battling cyber attacks, Frederiksen said. He said he believed companies were sometimes reluctant to inform they had been hit by cyber attacks, because they were afraid to scare off customers or investors.  Frederiksen said he saw the overall cyber threat as  one of the greatest threats of our time .  If you can undermine our democratic nations by hacking the energy systems or the communication systems or the financial systems it will undermine our own people s belief in our societies  ability to protect them,  he said. Russia hacked the Danish defense network and gained access to employees  emails in 2015 and 2016, Frederiksen said in April. Danish troops will get training in how to deal with Russian misinformation before being sent to join a NATO military build-up in Estonia in January, Frederiksen said in July.

Iraq relocates hundreds of foreign wives and children of suspected Islamic State militants to Baghdad,"ERBIL/BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi authorities have moved hundreds of foreign wives and children of suspected Islamic State militants from a detention center in northern Iraq to Baghdad, citing security concerns and the difficulties of keeping them in a remote location.  Local officials, security and aid agency sources said more than 800 women and children   mostly from Turkey, Europe and former Soviet states   had been moved to a secure detention facility in Baghdad.   Around 700 more are still being held at the facility in the northern town of Tal Keif, said Mohammed al-Bayati, the head of Mosul s provincial council security and defense committee. Most of the women and children have been in detention since Aug. 30, when more than 1,300 surrendered to Kurdish Peshmerga after government forces expelled the jihadist group from Tal Afar, one of its last remaining strongholds in Iraq.  Their numbers have swelled as more foreign nationals have surrendered or been captured, said Sara al-Zawqari, the spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Iraq. Security forces have continued operations to rout the militants from their last remaining pockets of control in Western Anbar. Iraqi authorities began moving the families several days ago, Bayati said, adding that the government intends to move all the foreign detainees to Baghdad within the next few days.  The move to the capital coincides with a push by Iraqi officials to begin legal proceedings to determine the fate of these women and children and end their prolonged detention, local officials and aid agency sources said.  The government should find a way of deciding their future and what to do with them,  said Abdul Rahman al-Wagga, a local councillor in Mosul where many of the women and children lived under the Islamic State s self-proclaimed caliphate.  These foreign women and children have the right to a fair trial,  said Zawqari, whose ICRC was the only aid group granted consistent access to the families in Tal Keif and has provided them with humanitarian services.  If they need to be repatriated, all parties involved should also ensure they have these rights and are treated with respect and dignity.  In September, aid agencies said they were  gravely concerned  about the fate of the families, after the initial 1,300 were relocated without warning to Tal Keif from the transit site south of Mosul where they had initially been kept.

"Still battling for independence, Lebanon to mark national day","BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon marks its independence on Wednesday with its sovereignty as compromised as ever by the agendas of foreign states that have shaped its history since the French mandate ended in 1943. The crisis ignited by Saad al-Hariri s sudden resignation  as prime minister is unprecedented even by the standards of a country where loyalties have been split between countries such as Iran and Saudi Arabia regionally and the United States, France and Russia globally. Hariri is due back in Lebanon on Wednesday for the first time since his resignation in a televised broadcast from Riyadh. Many believe Saudi Arabia made him quit and held him in Riyadh because he was not serving its objectives. Riyadh denies this. He will take part in independence day celebrations in Beirut after an intervention by Lebanon s former colonial power France led to him leaving Saudi Arabia for Paris last week.  Can Lebanese people act the way they want? Are they free to take a decision and follow it? No they cannot. Because there are foreign powers who decide the way things go,  said Antoine Mouawad, a 65-year old charity employee.  We do not feel independent,  said George al-Basha, 58, an unemployed barber in Beirut s Achrafiyeh district.  For some Lebanese, the latest chapter in their turbulent history carries echoes of its independence in 1943, when France arrested the president and prime minister. International pressure and popular protests eventually forced their release. The parallel with Hariri s situation was drawn by one of Lebanon s major TV stations at the start of the crisis. Foreign states have often regarded tiny Lebanon as a theater for their rivalry, exploiting the fissures between Muslim and Christian sects who have also courted foreign intervention to help them in their struggles with each other.  For years it was the tussle between Israel, which occupied southern Lebanon from 1982-2000, and Syria, which maintained a big military presence across much of the country from 1976-2005, that played out on Lebanese soil. The Palestine Liberation Organisation also controlled much of the country prior to 1982. Reflecting today s biggest Middle East rivalry, it is competition between Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia and Shi ite Iran that lies behind many accusations of foreign meddling. Critics of the heavily armed Lebanese Shi ite group Hezbollah view it as a tool of Iranian policy. Opponents of Hariri, who was thrust into politics by the 2005 assassination of his father, Rafik, have similarly labeled him as an instrument of Saudi policy. But the demand for his return has united Lebanese across the political spectrum. Politicians close to Hariri say Riyadh held him against his will and forced his resignation to bust a coalition government that suited Hezbollah.  Posters of Hariri demanding his return to Lebanon, even in areas dominated by his biggest political opponents, reflect widely felt anger at the perceived foreign intervention.       The most important thing in a country like Lebanon is to understand that independence is a battle that does not stop,  Interior Minister Nohad Machnouk, a member of Hariri s Future Movement, said on Tuesday as he laid a wreath on Rafik Hariri s grave.     Saad al-Hariri has also denied being held by Saudi Arabia, and in his resignation speech instead blamed Iran and Hezbollah for Lebanon s present difficulties.  Wednesday s independence parade will be held near the central Martyrs Square, where reconstruction from Lebanon s 1975-90 civil war continues. In the nearby seaport are moored naval vessels belonging to the U.N. peacekeeping force UNIFIL which was established after Israeli s first invasion in 1978, and expanded after the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah.  What we have seen in the last 10 days or two weeks, this is really crude intervention,  said Sami Atallah of the Lebanese Centre for Policy Studies, a thinktank in Beirut.  When you have a prime minister who resigns in a capital not his own, it tells you that someone else is giving the orders.  Syria s military presence in Lebanon was brought to an end in 2005 by a wave of popular protests and international pressure following the Hariri assassination. A U.N.-backed court has charged five Hezbollah members over the killing. The group denies any role.  Lebanon is tied either to Saudi Arabia or to Iran. It doesn t have the ability to take actions by itself and politicians are to blame for this,  said Nohad Chelhot, a retired business owner. ",worldnews,"November 21, 2017 ",1
Russia says retreat of Syrian opposition figures good for peace,"MOSCOW/BEIRUT (Reuters) - Russia said on Tuesday that the resignation of  radically minded  Syrian opposition figures such as Riyad Hijab would help unite the disparate opponents of President Bashar al-Assad around a more  realistic  platform. Hijab, a former Syrian prime minister, stepped down on Monday as head of the High Negotiations Committee (HNC) which was formed nearly two years ago with Saudi backing to bring together political and armed opponents of Assad.  The retreat of radically minded opposition figures from playing the main role will make it possible to unite this motley opposition   internal and external   on a more reasonable, realistic and constructive platform,  Russia s Rossiya 24 state television showed Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov saying at a news briefing.  We will support the efforts made by Saudi Arabia in this respect.  After intervening decisively in Syria s war in 2015 to support Assad, Russia now hopes to build on the collapse of militant group Islamic State to revive a political process to end the more than six-year-old war. Hijab is one of up to 10 HNC members who have quit the opposition umbrella group, including Riyad Naasan Agha, who told Reuters its work had now been  brought to an end . Agha said the HNC, which has insisted on Assad s removal from power at the start of a political transition, had been marginalized ahead of a conference of the Syrian opposition which Saudi Arabia is due to host this week.  The  expanded  conference aims to forge a united position ahead of a new round of U.N.-backed peace talks toward ending the conflict that erupted in 2011. But Yahya al-Aridi, an HNC member who will be taking part in the Riyadh conference, said:  The HNC is not finished ... it is a technical group with a particular function to carry out, which is negotiations.    There are other Syrians who are still committed to the rights of Syrian people for freedom and liberty,  Aridi said.   Hijab did not spell out his reasons for stepping down in a statement on Monday night. The Syrian opposition has long been weakened by ideological and political divisions, exacerbated by ties to regional states with competing agendas such as Qatar and Saudi Arabia   countries that have been at loggerheads since June. In a telephone interview with Reuters, Agha said HNC members including Hijab and himself had not been invited to the Nov. 22-24 conference, and  in practical terms its work has been brought to an end . Agha said he did not know who had taken the decision to marginalize the HNC but would not blame the Saudi hosts.  Russia is behind overturning the scales of the opposition to be in the interest of Assad and not against him,  he said. ",worldnews,"November 21, 2017 ",1

Tunisia PM will go ahead with painful policy despite opposition,"TUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisia will continue with a package of painful economic policies, Prime Minister Youssef Chahed said on Tuesday, despite resistance from labor unions and business associations to changes that will raise taxes and put thousands out of work. The North African country is under pressure from the International Monetary Fund to speed up policy changes and help its economy recover from militant attacks in 2015 that hurt its vital tourism industry. Tunisia plans to raise value-added and other taxes and lay off about 10,000 government workers as part of the 2018 budget to cut its budget deficit. The government has also proposed a 1 percent social security tax on employees and companies. A federation of company owners, UTICA, has rejected that proposal and is threatening to shut down companies.  We will seek consensus with all, but we go ahead with reforms needed to revive the economy and will not retreat,  Chahed told parliament at the start of the budget debate. Chahed also wants to freeze public-sector hiring, but the powerful union UGTT said it will not accept that, because branches such as education and health needed recruitments.  Beware the anger of the Tunisian UGTT if the situation continues and if the rest of the parties refuse to share sacrifice,  UGTT head Nourredine Taboubi said. Tunisia has been praised for its democratic progress after a 2011 uprising that toppled President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. But successive governments have failed to make the changes needed to trim deficits and create growth. Under the 2018 budget, the deficit will fall to 4.9 percent of gross domestic product in 2018, from about 6 percent expected in 2017. Tunisia hopes to raise GDP to about 3 percent next year against 2.3 percent this year. ",worldnews,"November 21, 2017 ",1
Lack of German government puts euro zone integration plans on hold,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The collapse of talks on a new German government means that the euro zone s ambitious plans for deeper economic integration could be put on hold, euro zone officials said on Tuesday. German government coalition talks collapsed on Sunday night as the liberal FDP party pulled out after weeks of  exploratory  talks, plunging the euro zone s most important economy into political uncertainty and raising the prospect of new elections. Euro zone leaders are to set a direction for deeper euro zone economic integration at a summit in the middle of December, at which Germany s input is crucial.  As long as Germany does not have a clear position, it will by default not agree to anything. Therefore, delay is the most likely option,  one senior euro zone official involved in the euro zone integration talks said. The summit is to launch six months of work that would lead  decisions in June 2018 on whether or not the single currency area should have a budget, a finance minister and a euro zone assembly in the European Parliament. The deeper integration push, championed by French President Emmanuel Macron, also includes the transformation of the euro zone bailout fund into a European Monetary Fund and the creation of a sovereign insolvency mechanism.  Things will go on hold until there is a formal acting German government,  a second euro zone official said.  At this stage I don t see what steps the leaders could take in December or June for deepening euro zone integration when there is a German government without a mandate,  he said. Some officials said that a potential delay in the euro zone integration talks was not a big issue because they concerned the future architecture of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), now encompassing 19 countries.  There is nothing that makes new decisions on the EMU especially urgent, so I don t believe this to be a real problem,  a third senior euro zone official said.  The June deadline can always be moved, if need be,  the official said. But others noted the initial timing of the talks was to make use of a  window of opportunity  in 2018, when no major euro zone countries, except Italy, or EU institutions had to face elections and were therefore free to focus on euro zone reforms. If the talks were delayed, decisions on key issues, often sensitive politically, could be pushed back toward 2019   a year of elections to the European Parliament, the formation of a new European Commission and choosing new heads of the European Central Bank and the chairman of EU leaders. An official involved in preparations for the December summit said it would go ahead as planned.  National elections happening all the time, all over Europe, are no reason to stop our work,  the official said. But others said they expected the mandate that leaders would give to the Commission for further work on euro zone integration would probably be weaker than it would have otherwise been if no German government is in place by then.

U.S. Congress members decry 'ethnic cleansing' in Myanmar; Suu Kyi doubts allegations,"YANGON/NAYPYITAW (Reuters) - Members of the U.S. Congress said on Tuesday operations carried out against the Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar had  all the hallmarks  of ethnic cleansing, while the country s leader Aung San Suu Kyi expressed doubts about allegations of rights abuses. The U.S. Senate members also said they were disturbed by a  violent and disproportionate  security response to Rohingya militant attacks that have driven more than 600,000 people from Myanmar to neighbouring Bangladesh. Human rights monitors have accused Myanmar s military of atrocities, including mass rape, against the stateless Rohingya during so-called clearance operations following insurgent attacks on 30 police posts and an army base. Myanmar s government has denied most of the claims, and the army last week said its own probe found no evidence of wrongdoing by troops.  We are not hearing of any violations going on at the moment,  Suu Kyi told reporters in response to a question about human rights abuses at the end of the Asia-Europe Meeting, or ASEM, in Myanmar s capital Naypyitaw.  We can t say whether it has happened or not. As a responsibility of the government, we have to make sure that it won t happen.  Nobel laureate Suu Kyi said she hoped talks with Bangladesh s foreign minister this week would lead to a deal on the  safe and voluntary return  of those who have fled. Suu Kyi s less than two-year old civilian government has faced heavy international criticism for its response to the crisis, though it has no control over the generals it has to share power with under Myanmar s transition to power after decades of military rule. While a top UN official has described the military s actions as a textbook case of  ethnic cleansing , U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on a visit to Myanmar last week refused to label it as such. In early November, U.S. lawmakers proposed targeted sanctions and travel restrictions on Myanmar military officials. Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley, who was among the sponsors of the legislation introduced in the Senate, led a congressional delegation that visited Rakhine this week, but was blocked from traveling to the violence-hit north of the state and to Rohingya camps. The group also traveled to Cox s Bazar district in Bangladesh, where Rohingya refugees are huddled into makeshift camps and fed by overstretched aid agencies.  Many refugees have suffered direct attacks including loved ones, children and husbands being killed in front of them, wives and daughters being raped, burns and other horrific injuries. This has all the hallmarks of ethnic cleansing,  Merkley told reporters in Myanmar on Tuesday.  We are profoundly disturbed by the violent and disproportionate response against the Rohingya by the military and local groups,  he said. The delegation called for Myanmar to allow an investigation into the alleged atrocities that would involve the international community.  We want to emphasize that the world is watching,  Merkley said, adding that it was important Myanmar allow anyone who wants to come back to return to their homes and their farms. Merkley said the delegation was  not here today to recommend what the U.S. government would do or should do,  when asked about the legislation introduced in the Congress. Myanmar officials have so far said they plan to resettle most returnees in new  model villages , rather than on the land they previously occupied, an approach the United Nations has criticized in the past as effectively creating permanent camps.  Individuals cannot be coming back simply to return to camps where there would be continued discrimination, restrictions on full participation in the economy and society,  said Merkley. He warned that isolating people in camps creates a  two-tier society that is fundamentally incompatible with the future of democracy and it guarantees perpetuation of suspicions and misunderstandings and conflicts.  Speaking earlier on Tuesday, Suu Kyi said discussions would be held with the Bangladesh foreign minister on Wednesday and Thursday about repatriation. Officials from both countries began talks last month on how to process the Rohingya wanting to return.  We hope that this would result in an MOU signed quickly, which would enable us to start the safe and voluntarily return of all of those who have gone across the border,  Suu Kyi said. The Rohingya are largely stateless and many people in Myanmar view them as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Suu Kyi said Myanmar would follow the framework of an  agreement reached in the 1990s to cover the earlier repatriation of Rohingya, who had fled to Bangladesh to escape previous bouts of ethnic violence. That agreement did not address the citizenship status of Rohingya, and Bangladesh has been pressing for a repatriation process that provided Rohingya with more safeguards this time.  It s on the basis of residency...this was agreed by the two governments long time ago with success, so this will be formula we will continue to follow,  Suu Kyi said. Earlier talks between the two countries reached a broad agreement to work out a repatriation deal, but a senior Myanmar official later accused Bangladesh of dragging its feet in order to secure funding from aid agencies for hosting the refugees.

French truckers jam border crossings over cut-price competition,"PARIS (Reuters) - French truck drivers blocked traffic at border crossings with Spain, Italy and Belgium on Tuesday in protest over cut-price competition in the road-freight industry. French truckers are angry that an agreement reached by EU member states on Oct. 23 to limit the amount of time workers can be  posted  from one EU country to another does not cover the road transport sector. [L8N1MY3RF] As a result, French truckers face being priced out by drivers from other EU member states, especially east Europe, Spain and Portugal, who are willing to do fixed-term work for lower pay than French drivers might normally receive.  Widening gaps in pay and conditions endanger French firms and workers,  said Pascal Favre, a member of the Force Ouvriere labor union who was among truckers protesting in southwest France, near the border with Spain.  (There are) those who work for lower pay because they spend more time behind the wheel on jobs the French do not do because of unfair competition.  The  posted workers  issue effectively pits wealthier EU countries against poorer peers like Poland and Bulgaria, whose skilled workers are keen to move around the EU on fixed-term contracts, earning more than they would do at home but often undercutting workers in the host country. The number of workers posted to France from other EU countries rose 23.8 percent to 354,151 in 2016, after a similar jump the preceding year, according to a government count cited by the business newspaper Les Echos on Tuesday. Emmanuel Macron made the issue part of his presidential campaign, saying he would fight to protect workers from unfair competition. While he managed to forge agreement among the EU s 28 states for some adjustments to the rules, transportation workers were not included. About 200 French truckers took part in the protest at the northern border crossing into Rekkem in Belgium, waving cars through but halting trucks, a local police official said. Traffic on the main motorway from the French city of Lille to the Belgian city of Ghent was disrupted by another trucker protest in the region for a few hours early in the day. Traffic through the Frejus tunnel to Italy in the southeast was similarly disrupted, as were some crossings with Spain. It wasn t immediately clear how great the economic impact of the protests would be, although they were not expected to continue beyond Tuesday. ",worldnews,"November 21, 2017 ",1
Famine survey warns of thousands dying daily in Yemen if ports stay closed,"GENEVA (Reuters) - A U.S.-funded famine survey said on Tuesday that thousands of Yemenis could die daily if a Saudi-led military coalition does not lift its blockade on the country s key ports. The warning came a day after the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said 2.5 million people in Yemen s crowded cities had no access to clean water, raising the risk that a cholera epidemic will spread. Using the internationally recognized IPC 5-point scale for classifying food security, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) said that even before the current blockade, 15 million people were in  crisis  (IPC Phase 3) or worse.  Therefore, a prolonged closure of key ports risks an unprecedented deterioration in food security to Famine (IPC Phase 5) across large areas of the country,  it said.  It said famine is likely in many areas within three or four months if ports remain closed, with some less accessible areas at even greater risk. In such a scenario, shortages of food and fuel would drive up prices, and a lack of medical supplies would exacerbate life-threatening diseases.  Thousands of deaths would occur each day due to the lack of food and disease outbreaks,  said FEWS NET, which is funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development.  Famine remained likely even if the southern port of Aden is open, its report said, adding that all Yemeni ports should be reopened to essential imports. The United Nations has said the Saudi-led coalition must allow aid in through Hodeidah port, controlled by the Houthis, the Saudis  enemies in the war in Yemen.  U.N. humanitarian agencies have issued dire warnings about the impact of the blockade, although U.N. officials have declined to directly criticize Saudi Arabia. Jan Egeland, head of the Norwegian Refugee Council and a former U.N. aid chief, was blunt in his criticism, however.  US, UK & other allies of Saudi has only weeks to avoid being complicit in a famine of Biblical proportions. Lift the blockade now,  he wrote in a tweet.   Last year Saudi Arabia was accused by then U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon of exerting  unacceptable  undue pressure to keep itself off a blacklist of countries that kill children in conflict, after sources told Reuters that Riyadh had threatened to cut some U.N. funding. Saudi Arabia denied this. ",worldnews,"November 21, 2017 ",1
"U.N. rebukes Philippines president Duterte, Burundi officials for threats","GENEVA (Reuters) - The United Nations human rights office on Tuesday condemned attacks and threats made against its investigators by Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte and by senior Burundian officials.  Last week Mr Duterte threatened to slap (U.N. special rapporteur Agnes) Callamard if she investigates him for alleged extrajudicial killings,  U.N. human rights spokesman Rupert Colville told a news briefing.  He made the same threat against her in June after she criticized his  war on drugs  campaign which has left thousands dead,  he added, referring to remarks made after her visit in May in an unofficial capacity to attend an academic conference. The Philippine Supreme Court on Tuesday began hearing arguments in a petition to declare Duterte s deadly war on drugs, denounced by rights groups across the world, as unconstitutional. More than 3,900 Filipinos have been killed in what the police called self-defense after armed drugs suspects resisted arrest in the 16 month-long campaign. Critics say executions are taking place with zero accountability, allegations the police reject. Callamard, U.N. special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings, is an independent expert reporting to the U.N. Human Rights Council. Her planned visit to the Philippines last December was called off because she refused to accept Duterte s conditions. Recently she has also been subjected to a  tirade of online abuse, including physical threats, during what appears to be a prolonged and well-orchestrated trolling operation across the internet and on social media , Colville said.   We condemn this treatment of Ms Callamard and the disrespect it shows to the Human Rights Council that appointed her in the strongest terms,  he added.  On Burundi, the U.N. rights office has written to the Bujumbura government to demand that officials stop  threatening with prosecution  members of a U.N. Commission of Inquiry that found Burundian officials at the highest level should be held accountable for crimes against humanity, Colville said. Burundi s ambassador in New York told the U.N. General Assembly that the inquiry s report was biased and politically motivated and threatened to  bring to justice  its authors for defamation and attempted detribalization, he said. Burundi is an elected member of the 47-member Human Rights Council, the main U.N. rights forum.  All states should cooperate with mandates established by the Council. None of them are established without good cause,  Colville said. ",worldnews,"November 21, 2017 ",1

Zimbabwe's state mouthpiece captures fall of First Lady Grace,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Zimbabwe s longstanding government and ruling party mouthpiece, The Herald newspaper, has abruptly changed its tune on President Robert Mugabe s wife Grace, confirmation of her political downfall. The Herald often takes its marching orders from the information ministry. And it has always reported from the point of view of the winning faction in the ruling ZANU-PF, making it a reliable barometer of someone s political standing. In August, the paper ran a typically fawning portrait of Grace under the headline  A Loving Mother of the Nation.   Loving mother, compassionate philanthropist, astute businesswoman, perceptive politician, remarkable patriot, these are all adjectives that can be used to describe the First Lady Dr Grace Mugabe,  The Herald gushed. Less than three months later and in the wake of a coup that threatens Mugabe s presidency and has seen both he and Grace expelled from ZANU-PF, her Herald portrayal was starkly different.  Grace Mugabe lacked grooming and true motherhood as shown by her foul language,  the paper quoted the ZANU-PF s youth wing as saying.   We take exception to the vulgar language which had become part of Mrs Mugabe s vocabulary,  it quoted a Youth League cadre as saying.  Zimbabweans, many of whom are devoutly religious and culturally conservative, often take offense at profanities.  The piece featured an unflattering picture of an unsmiling Grace - a sharp departure from the  loving mother  portrayal that included photos of her smiling and holding infants.  Until the events of the past week, the political fortunes of Grace   dubbed  Gucci Grace  for her reputed fondness shopping sprees   were on the rise, if The Herald s coverage was anything to go on. In September 2014, the University of Zimbabwe awarded her a PHD   raising eyebrows as her academic prowess had previously been unknown. But in Zimbabwe, the path to power is paved with academic letters. Weeks later, one Herald headline blared:  Dr Grace Mugabe honored in song.  At the time, she was being shoe-horned into the top position in ZANU-PF s Women s League, and the song was entitled:  Dr G Mugabe For Women s League Secretary.  Just 12 days ago, paper was reporting that the Women s League was backing Grace in her bid to become vice president. This was days after Mugabe sacked his deputy Emmerson Mnangagwa, clearing the path for Grace to assume the role and succeed her 93-year-old husband. It was this tilt at power that triggered the army backlash. ",worldnews,"November 21, 2017 ",1
Burkina Faso recalls ambassador to Libya over 'slave markets' report,"OUAGADOUGOU (Reuters) - Burkina Faso s foreign minister said on Monday it had recalled its ambassador to Libya over a report that black African migrants were being auctioned as slaves there. The decision by the West African nation followed the broadcast by CNN of footage of what it said was an auction of men offered to Libyan buyers as farmhands and sold for $400, a chilling echo of the trans-Saharan slave trade of centuries past.  Libya s ambassador to Burkina Faso said his country was being unfairly blamed for a global problem that all nations affected must come together to solve. Foreign Minister Alpha Barry announced the decision by President Roch Marc Kabore in a news conference.  The president of Burkina Faso has decided to recall the ambassador to Tripoli, General Abraham Traore, for a consultation,  Barry said. He had also  summoned the Libyan charge d affairs in (Burkina Faso s capital) Ouagadougou to express our indignation at these images that belong to other centuries, images of the slave trade .  In a news conference on Wednesday, Libya s ambassador to Burkina Faso, Abdul Rahman Khameda, appealed for help from both the European Union and African Union to help Libya reach a lasting resolution of the migrant crisis.  Libya alone can not solve this problem,  he said.  We call on the international community to intensify efforts to help Libya cope with this danger (illicit migration), which is tearing at its social fabric.    African and European leaders are due to meet next week in Ivory Coast s main city, Abidjan, where migration and Europe s efforts to tackle it by co-opting Libya will be high on the agenda.  Adopting an effective solution will prevent certain parties from exploiting such unfortunate events to tarnish Libya s name,  Khameda said. An agreement between Europe and Africa to stem the flow of migrants coming through Libya to Europe had failed to tackle the severe abuses they face, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra ad al-Hussein wrote in an article published in September. ",worldnews,"November 20, 2017 ",1
Philippines' Duterte threatens to close mines that support rebels,"MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Tuesday threatened to shut down any mine that supports Maoist rebels waging a protracted guerrilla war to overthrow the government. The Philippines has been in on-again, off-again peace talks with the National Democratic Front (NDF), the political arm of the communist movement, since 1986 to end a rebellion that has killed more than 40,000 people and stunted growth in resource-rich rural areas. In a speech honoring soldiers who fought pro-Islamic State militants for five months in the southern city of Marawi, Duterte said that attacks from the Maoist rebels had been on the rise, forcing him to end negotiations, and that he would declare the guerrilla group a terrorist organization.  If I go against the communists, then everybody has to reconfigure their relationship with the New People s Army,  he said, referring to the communists  armed wing.  If you support them financially, I will close you down.  Duterte said some mines were paying  revolutionary taxes  to the rebels in exchange for allowing their operations in remote areas to continue. He did not name any companies. Mines in the Philippines, many with foreign partners, are digging for gold, nickel, copper, chromite and coal. The Mines and Geosciences Bureau said the country had estimated $840 billion worth of untapped mineral wealth as of 2012. The rebels are also engaged in small-scale mining, like gold panning in the south. Mining companies shared the president s position, Ronald Recidoro, executive director at the Chamber of Mines of the Philippines, said.  We do not condone any member supporting the New People s Army through the payment of revolutionary taxes,  Recidoro told Reuters.  This is clearly against the law and they really should be prosecuted if they are found to be supporting these organizations. And if closure is warranted, that is within the prerogative of the president.  The Chamber of Mines groups 20 of the country s 43 operating mines. Recidoro said some mining firm members had experienced some of their equipment being burned by the NPA because of their refusal to pay the taxes.  I am fighting a rebellion... I have to build a strong army,  Duterte said, adding the military would next year acquire 23 attack helicopters to boost counter-insurgency capability. Military spokesman Major-General Restituto Padilla said the Philippines already had approval for the purchase of attack helicopters but had not decided what type or where to source them.

Czech police ask parliament to allow prosecution of prospective PM Babis,"PRAGUE (Reuters) - Czech police have requested parliament lift the immunity of prospective prime minister Andrej Babis to allow prosecution in a case involving alleged fraud in tapping European Union subsidies, the lower house s press office said on Tuesday. Babis, whose ANO party was the runaway winner in a parliamentary election in October on pledges to run the state better and fight corruption among traditional parties, denies any wrongdoing and has called the charges politically motivated.      Police suspect the billionaire businessman hid ownership of the Stork s Nest farm and convention center almost a decade ago to get a two million euro EU subsidy that was part of a program aimed at small businesses.  Lawmakers already voted in September to allow his prosecution, but Babis won immunity again with his re-election. He said on Tuesday the new request to lift immunity was further evidence of a campaign against him.   The speed at which they are coming after me again only shows what huge fear the corrupt system has; how much this old system is afraid of me and how tenaciously they are trying to get me,  Babis was quoted by CTK news agency as saying. President Milos Zeman has tasked Babis with forming a government, but the case has hurt his chances of assembling a coalition as almost all of the other eight parties in the lower house have refused to work with him if he faces police charges. Babis instead is aiming for a minority cabinet, which may be appointed in the coming weeks, but still faces the prospect he may lose a vote of confidence in the 200-seat lower house.  His party won 78 seats in the election and he has not found other support than possible tolerance from the Communist party with 15 seats.  A failure to win confidence would trigger two more attempts to form a cabinet, which could take months, while Babis s team would hold office in the meantime. Most parties have said they would vote to lift immunity again but it was not clear if a majority would be found. The case also involves ANO s deputy chairman Jaroslav Faltynek, who has denied wrongdoing. Babis entered politics in 2011 and had sat in the outgoing center-left government. He moved his holding in his business empire - valued at $4 billion and comprising numerous companies in food processing, agriculture, chemicals and media - to trust funds earlier this year.

Syrian Kurdish YPG accuses Turkey of Afrin aggression,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - A Syrian Kurdish militia accused Turkish forces on Tuesday of  aggression and escalation  in the Afrin region, which it controls, on Syria s northwestern border with Turkey.  Ankara has sent forces into areas of Syria adjacent to Afrin to oppose the influence of the YPG militia, which it sees as a branch of the PKK movement that has waged a three-decade insurgency inside Turkey. The YPG spearheads the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias fighting Islamic State with the help of a U.S.-led coalition.  Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said last week that Turkey needed to  cleanse Afrin  of the YPG. On Monday, Ankara accused it of attacking an observation post in Idlib province.  In an apparent response to that charge, the YPG said in a statement that Turkey was  spreading several rumors about our forces attacking Turkish lands .  It said Turkey had fired artillery and machine guns at several villages in Afrin on Monday. Turkey backed an incursion into a part of Syria immediately east of Afrin last year in support of anti-government Syrian rebel factions, which led to frequent clashes with the YPG.  Last month, Ankara also sent some troops into Idlib, south and west of Afrin, as part of a deal it has agreed with Russia and Iran to set up so-called  de-escalation zones  to reduce fighting.

U.N. urges Sudan to improve plight of Darfur's displaced people,"GENEVA (Reuters) - The United Nations urged Sudan to end violence and human rights abuses against the 2.6 million people displaced by its long conflict in Darfur, a U.N. report documenting the abuses said on Tuesday. Conflict in Darfur began in 2003 when mainly non-Arab tribes took up arms against Sudan s Arab-led government.  Progress on resolving the conflict was a key demand made by the United States before it lifted 20-year sanctions last month that had long-isolated the country. Sudan said last month that it would extend a unilateral ceasefire with rebels that has been in place since October 2016 until the end of December. The U.N. report found that  despite a ceasefire between the Government and various armed opposition groups ... violence against internally displaced people continues to be widespread and impunity for human rights violations persists.   I urge the Government to address fundamental issues that are preventing the return of displaced people, such as continued violence, including from armed militias, which raise continuing and justifiable fears for their safety and the lack of basic services that leave them dependent on aid,  U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra ad Al Hussein said in a statement.  People displaced by the conflict face  outright absence of law enforcement and judicial institutions  and  serious human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law,  the statement said.

Sweden stops some new aid for Cambodia in protest over crackdown,"PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Sweden said on Tuesday it was stopping new aid for Cambodia, except in education and research, and would no longer support a reform programme after the main opposition party was outlawed by the Supreme Court at the government s request. The announcement marked the first concrete action by a European Union country in protest at a political crackdown in which veteran Prime Minister Hun Sen s main rival has also been arrested and civil rights groups and independent media attacked. The United States cut election funding and said it would take more punitive steps after last week s ban on the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP). The European Union has also threatened action. Sweden s embassy in Phnom Penh said the country was reviewing its engagement with Cambodia.   We will not initiate any new government-to-government development cooperation agreements, except in the areas of education and research,  it said in a statement. As a consequence, it would be unable to support decentralisation reform in its current form. That reform aims to strengthen lower levels of government, such as local communes. The CNRP won control of more than 40 percent of the communes in elections in June, but has now had to give them up to the ruling Cambodian People s Party (CPP). The CNRP was banned after its leader, Kem Sokha, was arrested for alleged treason. The government says he sought to take power with American help. He rejects that allegation as politically motivated, to allow Hun Sen to extend his more than three decades in power in next year s general election. Responding to the Swedish statement, a senior official said Cambodia welcomed friendship with Sweden or other countries, but said they must understand the CNRP had been banned because the courts found it had committed treason.      People should respect the Cambodian people s decision in accordance with the principle of democracy and the rule of law,  said Huy Vannak, undersecretary of state at the Interior Ministry. Sweden, which has given Cambodia an estimated $100 million in aid over five years, ranked third among individual EU member states in Cambodia s database of donors last year, after France and Germany. Swedish fashion group H&M is also a key buyer from Cambodia s garment factories - the country s main export earner. But Western donors have less sway than they once did since China has emerged as Cambodia s biggest aid donor and investor. Meeting on Monday on the sidelines of a meeting of Asia-Europe foreign ministers in Myanmar, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his Cambodian counterpart Prak Sokhon that China supported the government s actions. China has repeatedly expressed its support for Cambodia, making no criticism of the government led by Hun Sen, a former Khmer Rouge commander, who is one of Beijing s most important allies in Southeast Asia.

Chinese court jails rights lawyer for two years for inciting subversion,"BEIJING (Reuters) - A Chinese court on Tuesday jailed a prominent rights lawyer for two years, saying he incited subversion of state power, the most recent such verdict in a sweeping crackdown on activism. Jiang Tianyong, 46, developed notions of overthrowing China s political system after being influenced by training workshops held by  anti-China foreign forces  overseas, the court in the central city of Changsha said. He used social media to  attack or defame  government departments and incited others to gather and demonstrate in public, the Changsha Intermediate People s Court said on its Twitter-like Weibo microblog.     However, Jiang s wife, Jin Bianling, called the verdict  unacceptable , adding that she believed he was being made an example of, in order to deter or repress other rights lawyers.       I do not acknowledge or accept this verdict,  she told Reuters in a telephone interview from the United States, where she lives.  Jiang Tianyong is innocent.    Jiang s family was unable to appoint their own lawyers, Jin said, and she had been unable to contact him in detention.  In Geneva, the U.N. human rights office, which has denounced China s crackdown on defense lawyers since 2015, called for his release.  We urge the Chinese authorities to release Jiang Tianyong as well as lawyer Wang Quanzhang and other lawyers and activists who have remained in detention since August 2015,  U.N. human rights spokesman Rupert Colville told Reuters. The verdict came exactly a year after Jiang disappeared last November while visiting the family of another detained rights lawyer. He was held incommunicado for six months before being formally charged. There were  serious concerns regarding the lawfulness of the legal proceedings , said Germany s ambassador to China, Michael Clauss, including the denial of access to lawyers of Jiang s choice.  The circumstances and the lack of regard for the rights of the defendant certainly call into question the fairness of the verdict,  Clauss said in a statement. Jiang, who was disbarred in 2009 after taking on sensitive cases such as defending practitioners of the banned Falun Gong spiritual movement, had been an outspoken critic of the government crackdown on dissent. Since mid-2015, hundreds of rights lawyers and activists have been sentenced or detained, drawing condemnation from foreign governments and international rights groups. Tuesday s ruling broadly followed the facts in Jiang s confession at his trial in August, when the court released video images of him reading parts of a written statement. China has videostreamed or liveblogged increasing numbers of court hearings in recent years, in a push for judicial transparency. But in sensitive cases, say rights activists, only selected portions are made available, when the defendant has agreed to go along with a pre-prepared outcome. Rights group Amnesty International called Jiang s conviction  baseless  and his trial a  total sham .  His so-called confession and apology, most likely extracted under duress, were nothing more than an act of political theater directed by the authorities,  said William Nee, a China researcher at Amnesty.

Rosneft's Sechin to miss hearing at ex-minister corruption trial: media,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - The head of Russian state oil giant Rosneft, Igor Sechin, will not be in Moscow on Wednesday where he is meant to appear in court to testify in a major corruption trial of a former minister, according to Russian news agencies.  Russian prosecutors accuse Alexei Ulyukayev of extorting a $2 million bribe from powerful political rival Sechin in exchange for approving a lucrative business deal in what turned out to be a sting operation.  Ulyukayev, who was fired by President Vladimir Putin from his post as economy minister shortly after being detained, denies the charges and says Sechin framed him.   Asked by reporters whether he would be in Moscow on Wednesday when the hearing is due, Sechin replied that he would be still be on a visit to western Siberia where on Tuesday he attended the opening of a new Rosneft oil field.  Tomorrow I am meeting with the governor (of the Khanty-Mansiiysk region), gathering the staff, will be summing up results of the prime minister s visit,  Sechin was quoted as saying by Interfax news agency. Sechin has already missed two hearings in Ulyukayev s trial. He has previously said he would attend as soon as his schedule allowed. Ulyukayev s arrest a year ago came moments after Sechin personally handed him the cash in a late-night meeting at the Rosneft headquarters in exchange for signing off on Rosneft s purchase of a stake in mid-sized oil producer Bashneft, according to investigators. The fate of Bashneft, one of the most lucrative state assets to be privatized in years, was the focus of a major turf war between rival Kremlin camps, sources close to the deal and in the government have said. Ulyukayev was among those who believed Bashneft should go to private investors. Both he and Sechin are deeply embedded in the tangle of allegiances and rivalries in Russian politics and business.  Ulyukayev belonged to a faction of economic liberals who argued for less state control over the economy, while Sechin, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, represents the opposite view.   Rosneft spokesman Mikhail Leontyev dismissed speculation over possible reasons for Sechin s likely absence at Wednesday s hearing, also citing the demands of his schedule.   This is a made up problem and it was made up with only one purpose - to avoid attention from the essence of the trial,   Leontyev said.  This is not the first case in the human or Russian history when the court wants to hear a testimony of a man with tight schedule.  Ulyukayev faces up to 15 years in jail if found guilty.

"Once inside Kim Jong Un's inner circle, top aide's star fades","SEOUL (Reuters) - When Kim Jong Un sat down in September to order the sixth and largest of North Korea s nuclear tests, Hwang Pyong So sat by his side, his khaki military uniform conspicuous among the suits at the table, photos released by state media at the time showed. Now Hwang, once one of Kim s most-trusted advisers, is facing unspecified punishment on the orders of another man who also sat at that exclusive table in September, Choe Ryong Hae, South Korean intelligence officials believe. Information on North Korea is often difficult to obtain, and with few hard details and no official confirmation from Pyongyang, analysts said it was too soon to draw any firm conclusions from the unspecified punishments. But the moves, which appear to involve two of Kim s top four advisers, are being closely watched for indications of fractures within his secretive inner circle, and come as North Korea faces increasing international pressure over its nuclear weapons program.      Having his advisers compete with each other suits Kim just fine, said Christopher Green, an analyst with the Crisis Group.  It is hardwired into autocracy to have underlings in competition,  he said. Hwang, a shy, bespectacled general in his mid-60s, is a close confidant of Kim Jong Un and has had an unprecedented rise to the top rungs of North Korea s leadership in the space of a few years.  In 2014, he became one of the most powerful people outside the ruling Kim family when he was named chief of the General Political Bureau of the army, a powerful position that mobilizes the military for the leader. His apparent punishment takes on additional meaning as it was orchestrated by Choe who has competed with Hwang in the past and stands to gain from any demotion, according to South Korea s spy agency.  The two men were last seen in public together early last month as they watched a gymnastics gala, according to state media. Hwang has since faded from public view, whereas Choe was the ranking official who met with a senior envoy from China in Pyongyang last week. Kim has not shied away from removing or punishing even favored leaders who could become powerful enough to threaten his grip on power, said Michael Madden, an expert on the North Korean leadership at 38 North, a project of the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced Studies in Washington.  Vice Marshal Hwang Pyong So could not have continued in the capacity that he was operating in, without it coming back to bite him,  he said. Both Hwang and Choe came to South Korea during the Asian Games in 2014 - the highest such visit by North Korean officials to the rival South. Dressed in a drab, olive army uniform and his large officer s cap, Hwang, who had been promoted to the No.2 spot behind Kim just one week earlier, had tea and lunch with Choe and South Korean officials and waved to crowds at the games  closing ceremony. The trip had been announced just one day in advance and took many South Korean observers by surprise. Some suggested there may have been a power struggle between the two men, neither wanting to yield the high-profile visit to the other. Choe, who was subjected to political  reeducation  himself in the past, now appears to be gaining more influence since he was promoted in October to the party s powerful Central Military Commission, according to South Korean officials.  The National Intelligence Service indicated Choe now heads the Organisation and Guidance Department (OGD), the secretive body which oversees appointments within North Korea s leadership. The punishment represents the first time Hwang has faced any major blow to his standing, said Lee Sang-keun, a North Korea leadership expert at Ewha Woman s University s Institute of Unification Studies. Hwang had a reputation of playing a respectful and careful role around the notoriously unpredictable Kim. Photos released by state media often showed him covering his mouth as he politely laughed with the supreme leader. The punishment may not reflect any specific mistakes on Hwang s part but could be part of a wider effort by Kim to ensure that the ruling party retains its control over the military, Lee said. The moves are part of a sweeping ideological scrutiny of the political unit of the military for the first time in 20 years, according to Kim Byung-kee, a lawmaker on South Korea s parliamentary intelligence committee. They could also be an effort to prevent a repeat of a major purge in 2013, 38 North s Madden said. Kim s uncle and second most powerful man in the secretive state, Jang Song Thaek, was executed during that purge after a special military tribunal found him guilty of treason.  Preemptively putting Hwang in his place now meant Kim might prevent him from becoming so powerful he could only be dealt with in a similar way, Madden said.   What (Kim s) doing can be described as clipping wings.   ",worldnews,"November 21, 2017 ",1
Ukraine expels Belarus diplomat over Minsk spy-ring spat,"KIEV (Reuters) - Ukraine said on Tuesday it had expelled a Belarussian diplomat in a tit-for-tat move linked to allegations from Belarus that the Ukrainian defense ministry had set up a spy ring in Minsk. Belarus s KGB state security service said on Monday it had arrested a Ukrainian journalist and declared a Ukrainian diplomat persona non grata due to their alleged involvement in espionage.  The Ukrainian foreign ministry has also made the decision to declare a Belarussian diplomat persona non grata and he has already left the country,  Ukrainian foreign ministry spokeswoman Mariana Betsa said by telephone. Betsa said the diplomat was a first secretary in the embassy in Kiev but declined to name him or her. The Ukrainian defense ministry has denied the KGB s allegations. Minsk-based Ukrainian journalist Pavlo Sharoyko was arrested in October and has since been charged with being an undercover intelligence officer by the KGB. Reuters has not been able to reach him for comment.    The case puts further pressure on relations between Minsk and Kiev that were tested earlier this year when Belarus hosted large-scale joint military exercises with Russia. September s Zapad-2017 ( West-2017 ) war games unnerved Ukraine and NATO member states on Europe s eastern flank, which feared the exercises could be a rehearsal or cover for a real offensive.

Germany detains six Syrian suspected of planning attack,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German police on Tuesday detained six Syrians suspected of planning an attack using weapons or explosives on behalf of the Islamic State militant group, prosecutors said. Police detained the suspects aged between 20 and 28 during  raids in the cities of Kassel, Hanover, Essen and Leipzig, the general prosecutor s office in Frankfurt said in a statement. Some 500 police officers took part in the raids during which  eight apartments were searched. Four of the suspects arrived in Germany in December 2014 and two arrived the following year. All six had applied for asylum. The prosecutor s office did not say if their asylum applications had been approved. Prosecutors said the six Syrians  are suspected of being members of the foreign terrorist organization that calls itself Islamic State (IS) . They added:  The accused are also suspected of having planned an attack against a public target in Germany using either weapons or explosives.  It is the second time this month that Syrians have been arrested on suspicion of planning militant violence. Earlier this month a 19-year-old Syrian man was detained on suspicion of planning a bomb attack. The arrest comes one month before the first anniversary of an attack in Berlin by a failed Tunisian asylum seeker who killed 12 people by plowing a truck into a Christmas market. Concrete blocks have been installed around Christmas markets at several central squares in the capital this year before the festive season opens in a couple of weeks.

Merkel signals readiness for new election after coalition talks collapse,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would prefer a new election to ruling with a minority after talks on forming a three-way coalition failed overnight, but Germany s president told parties they owed it to voters to try to form a government. The major obstacle to a three-way deal was immigration, according to Merkel, who was forced into negotiations after bleeding support in the Sept. 24 election to the far right in a backlash at her 2015 decision to let in over 1 million migrants. The failure of exploratory coalition talks involving her conservative bloc, the liberal pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and environmentalist Greens raises the prospect of a new election and casts doubt about her future after 12 years in power. Merkel, 63, said she was sceptical about ruling in a minority government, telling ARD television:  My point of view is that new elections would be the better path.  Her plans did not include being chancellor in a minority government, she said after meeting President Frank-Walter Steinmeier. Steinmeier said Germany was facing the worst governing crisis in the 68-year history of its post-World War Two democracy and pressed all parties in parliament  to serve our country  and try to form a government. His remarks appeared aimed at the FDP and the Social Democrats (SPD), who on Monday ruled out renewing their  grand coalition  with the conservatives.  Inside our country, but also outside, in particular in our European neighbourhood, there would be concern and a lack of understanding if politicians in the biggest and economically strongest country (in Europe) did not live up to their responsibilities,  read a statement from Steinmeier, a former foreign minister who has been thrust centre-stage after taking on the usually largely ceremonial head of state role in March. Steinmeier s intervention suggests he regards a new election - desired by half of Germany s voters according to a poll - as a last resort. The SPD has so far stuck to a pledge after heavy losses in the September election not to go back into a Merkel-led broad coalition of centre-left and centre-right. Merkel urged the SPD to reconsider.  I would hope that they consider very intensively if they should take on the responsibility  of governing, she told broadcaster ZDF, adding she saw no reason to resign and her conservative bloc would enter any new election more unified than before.  If new elections happened, then ... we have to accept that. I m afraid of nothing,  she said. Business leaders also called for a swift return to talks. With German leadership seen as crucial for a European Union grappling with governance reform and Britain s impending exit, FDP leader Christian Lindner s announcement that he was pulling out spooked investors and sent the euro falling in the morning. Both the euro and European shares later recovered from early selling, while German bond yields steadied near 1-1/2 week lows, as confidence about the outlook for the euro zone economy helped investors brush off worries about the risk of Germany going to the polls again soon.  FEAR OF FAR-RIGHT GAINS Earlier, Merkel got the strong backing of her CDU leadership. Josef Joffe, publisher-editor of Germany weekly Die Zeit said she could rely on CDU support for now, but added:  I will not bet on her serving out her entire four-year term.  The main parties fear another election so soon would let the far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party add to the 13 percent of votes it secured in September, when it entered parliament for the first time. Polls suggest a repeat election would return a similarly fragmented parliament. A poll published on Monday showed a new election would bring roughly the same result as the September election, with the Greens set to see the biggest gains. If Germans voted next Sunday, Merkel s conservatives would get 31 percent, the SPD 21 percent, the Greens and the AfD both 12 percent, the FDP 10 percent and the Left party 9 percent, the Forsa survey for RTL television showed. This compares with the election result of 32.9 percent for the conservatives, 20.5 percent for the SPD, 12.6 percent for AfD, 10.7 percent for FDP, 9.2 percent for the Left party and 8.9 percent for the Greens.  The failure of coalition talks is unprecedented in Germany s post-war history, and was likened by newsmagazine Der Spiegel to the shock election of U.S. President Donald Trump or Britain s referendum vote to leave the EU - moments when countries cast aside reputations for stability built up over decades. Any outcome in Germany is, however, likely to be more consensus driven.  The problem is stagnation and immobility, not instability as in Italy,  said Joffe. The unravelling of the German talks came as a surprise since the main sticking points - immigration and climate policy - were not seen as FDP signature issues. Responding to criticism from the Greens, FDP vice chairman Wolfgang Kubicki said a tie-up would have been short-lived.  Nothing would be worse than to get into a relationship about which we know that it will end in a dirty divorce,  he said.  Even if the SPD or the FDP revisit their decisions, the price for either party to change its mind could be the departure of Merkel, who since 2005 has been a symbol of German stability, leading Europe through the euro zone crisis. The inability to form a government caused disquiet elsewhere in Europe, not least because of the implications for the euro zone reforms championed by French President Emmanuel Macron. Germany s political impasse could also complicate and potentially delay the Brexit negotiations - Britain has just over a year to strike a divorce deal with the EU ahead of an exit planned for March 29, 2019.   It s not in our interests that the process freezes up,  Macron told reporters in Paris, adding he had spoken with Merkel shortly after the failure of talks. ",worldnews,"November 19, 2017 ",1

"South Korea, Japan welcome U.S. relisting North Korea as sponsor of terrorism","SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea and Japan on Tuesday welcomed U.S. President Donald Trump s move to put North Korea back on a list of state sponsors of terrorism, saying it will ramp up pressure on the reclusive regime to get rid of its nuclear weapons. The designation, announced on Monday, allows the United States to impose more sanctions on North Korea, which is pursuing nuclear weapons and missile programs in defiance of U.N. Security Council sanctions. (Graphic: Nuclear North Korea - tmsnrt.rs/2lE5yjF)  I welcome and support (the designation) as it raises the pressure on North Korea,  Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters. South Korea said it expected the listing to contribute to peaceful denuclearisation, the foreign ministry said in a text message. North Korea has vowed never to give up its nuclear weapons program, which it defends as a necessary defense against U.S. plans to invade. The United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean war, denies any such plans. In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China had noted the reports on the U.S. decision.  Currently, the situation on the Korean peninsula is complicated and sensitive,  Lu told a daily news briefing.  We still hope all relevant parties can do more to alleviate the situation and do more that is conducive to all relevant parties returning to the correct path of negotiation, dialogue and consultation to resolve the peninsula nuclear issue.  The move will further weigh on the  precarious situation  on the peninsula, China s official Xinhua news agency said in an English-language editorial.  The prospect of a nuclear-free Korean peninsula has been pushed farther away by one after another irresponsible action or blaring rhetoric,  it said. This year s rapid escalation of tension was largely down to a  game of chicken  between Washington and Pyongyang, it added.  Trump s re-listing of North Korea as a sponsor of terrorism comes a week after he returned from a 12-day trip to Asia in which containing North Korea s nuclear ambitions was a centerpiece of his discussions.  In addition to threatening the world by nuclear devastation, North Korea has repeatedly supported acts of international terrorism, including assassinations on foreign soil,  Trump told reporters at the White House.  This designation will impose further sanctions and penalties on North Korea and related persons and supports our maximum pressure campaign to isolate the murderous regime.  Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull also backed Trump s decision.  Kim Jong Un runs a global criminal operation from North Korea peddling arms, peddling drugs, engaged in cyber-crime and of course threatening the stability of region with his nuclear weapons,  Turnbull told reporters in Sydney, referring to the North Korean leader. Trump, who has often criticized his predecessors  policies toward North Korea as being too soft, said the designation should have been made  a long time ago . North Korea was put on the U.S. terrorism sponsor list for the 1987 bombing of a Korean Air flight that killed all 115 people aboard. But the administration of former President George W. Bush, a Republican, removed it in 2008 in exchange for progress in denuclearisation talks. Experts say the designation will be largely symbolic as North Korea is already heavily sanctioned by the United States. On Monday, South Korean President Moon Jae-in s special security adviser, Moon Chung-in, told reporters any such designation would be  more symbolic than substance . The United States has designated only three other countries - Iran, Sudan and Syria - as state sponsors of terrorism. North Korea has said it plans to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland. It has fired two missiles over Japan and on Sept. 3 conducted its sixth and largest nuclear test. ",worldnews,"November 21, 2017 ",1

Turkish opposition journalist sentenced to three years over tweet: agency,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - A Turkish court sentenced a journalist from opposition newspaper Cumhuriyet to three years in prison on Tuesday on a charge of spreading terrorist propaganda over a tweet which the paper briefly posted in May, state media said. The newspaper s online editor, Oguz Guven, was accused of discrediting Ankara s fight against supporters of the U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, who the government says orchestrated a coup attempt last year. The tweet had referred to a prosecutor being killed in a road accident with the expression that he had been  mowed down by a truck . Cumhuriyet, long a pillar of the secularist establishment, says the tweet was replaced within one minute by one saying the prosecutor  died awfully in a truck accident . The prosecutor who died had prepared an indictment against Gulen s network. The cleric denies any involvement in the coup attempt. State-run Anadolu agency said Guven was sentenced to three years and one month in jail. He had been remanded in custody in May but was released in June pending trial. More than a dozen Cumhuriyet correspondents and executives are being tried in a separate case in which prosecutors say the paper was taken over by supporters of Gulen and used to target Erdogan and veil the actions of militant groups.  Prosecutors are seeking up to 43 years in jail for the paper s staff, accused of targeting Erdogan through  asymmetric war methods.  They have denied the charges. Since the failed coup in July 2016, Turkey has jailed more than 50,000 people and closed more than 130 media outlets, raising concerns among Western allies about deteriorating rights and freedoms.

Thailand seeks to prosecute ousted PM Thaksin in absentia in two graft cases,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand is seeking to prosecute ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra for graft under a law that allows politicians to be tried in absentia, an official said on Tuesday, months after Thaksin s sister was sentenced to jail in her absence. Thailand is divided broadly between those backing Thaksin and his sister, former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, whose government was removed in a 2014 coup, and the elite in the capital, Bangkok. A former commerce minister and member of Yingluck s Puea Thai Party that was ousted in the coup said the planned prosecution of Thaksin was politically motivated. The former telecommunications tycoon was ousted in a 2006 coup and has since lived in self-imposed exile to avoid a graft conviction in 2008 he says was politically motivated.  Separate cases against Thaksin, including graft cases in 2008 and 2012, had to be suspended until he returned to Thailand for trial. But an amendment to the law in September makes it possible for politicians to be prosecuted in their absence.  The 2008 and 2012 cases involved Thaksin s alleged conflict of interest in a telecoms concession and suspected abuse of power.   Public prosecutors put in a request to the supreme court today to proceed with the two cases without presence of the accused, in accordance with the new law,  Wanchart Santikunchorn, a spokesman for the office of the attorney-general, told reporters. Thaksin was not immediately available for comment.  Thaksin re-shaped Thai politics after building a business empire, winning staunch support with populist policies that raised living standards, especially among the rural poor, and propelled him or his loyalists to victory in every election since 2001. Yingluck fled the country in August, ahead of a verdict in a negligence trial, but was eventually found guilty and handed down a five-year jail term in absentia in September.  Former commerce minister Watana Muangsook said the junta was damaging the country with politically motivated court cases.   The law which allows court proceedings in absentia of the accused is aimed at destroying the regime s political opposition,  Watana said in a statement to Reuters. Wanchart denied the moves against the Shinawatra family were biased, saying they were in line with the newly amended law.   ",worldnews,"November 21, 2017 ",1
Mexico's presidential front-runner vows stable economy; aide urges NAFTA delay,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico s leftist presidential hopeful Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed on Monday to boost infrastructure spending but guard economic stability, while his team reiterated that ongoing NAFTA talks should be put off until after next year s election. Lopez Obrador, the front-runner in most polls ahead of the July vote, unveiled a platform that envisioned an austere government to root out corruption and redirect spending to public works and social programs without new taxes or raising the debt-to-GDP ratio. He rebutted claims he would pursue Venezuela-style socialist policies if elected.  Let s be very clear, we are not inspired by any foreign governments, neither Maduro nor Trump,  said Lopez Obrador, referring to Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and U.S. President Donald Trump. The veteran leftist who is known popularly by his initials AMLO, is set to make his third bid for the presidency, this time seeking closer ties with business and moderating some policies to fend off rivals who claim he will wreck Mexico s economy. Lopez Obrador has mainly avoided picking public fights with Trump, who is widely loathed south of the border for his anti-Mexican rhetoric. On Monday he said he would seek friendly relations with the U.S. government but would demand respect. His team repeated his position that talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) should be scrapped until after Mexico s election because the government of President Enrique Pena Nieto would not defend Mexico s interests.  A government like this ... lacks the necessary legitimacy to represent the interests of the country in this negotiation,  said Hector Vasconcelos, a former diplomat who helped draw up the government plan and spoke at the event.  U.S., Mexican and Canadian negotiators are currently engaged in a fifth round of talks in Mexico City following Trump s demand the deal be rewritten to benefit the United States.  The talks are due to be wrapped up in early 2018. The two-time presidential runner-up s platform also calls for studying the construction of new oil refineries with the capacity to process 300,000 barrels per day. Lopez Obrador narrowly lost in 2006 and by a larger margin in 2012, in both cases refusing to accept the results which he dismissed as marred by fraud. This time he will run as head of the MORENA party he founded in 2014.  He previously ran a popular, moderate government as mayor of Mexico City, but political rivals depict him as a dangerous firebrand and liken his policies and style to the socialist project in crisis-hit Venezuela. At a packed 10,000 seat arena, MORENA party delegates voted in favor of a  development plan  that Lopez Obrador said he would implement if elected and after further discussion with supporters. The folksy orator offered the platform on the national holiday that commemorates the start of Mexico s 1910 revolution. The plan touted a series of proposals including universal access to public or private universities for all qualified students, better pensions and public health services.  Vasconcelos said a Lopez Obrador government would gradually pull back the army and marines from the streets where they have been engaged in a decade-long war against cartels that has left more than 100,000 dead.  However, he said the military would not be abruptly removed from towns where its presence was the main guarantee of security. The plan vowed less spending on running the government, respect for private-property rights and the central bank s autonomy.   We are not opposed to businesses, they are necessary. We are against corrupt politicians and influence traffickers,  Lopez Obrador said.   As the central plank of the platform, Lopez Obrador promised to redirect federal government spending equivalent to 4.1 percent of gross domestic product to infrastructure and priority social programs, with a goal of increasing economic growth. According to the plan, a $13 billion airport being constructed by the current government of President Enrique Pena Nieto is not economically viable. Lopez Obrador s government would come up with an alternative to improve air transportation, it said. Lopez Obrador also vowed to slash the large pensions former presidents receive, while halving the presidential salary and reducing that of other top officials.  This is not revenge, it is justice,  he said. Lopez Obrador said he will announce his 16-member cabinet next month, which he said will feature equal numbers of men and women. Also on Monday, the leaders of a left-right coalition that could represent a stiff challenge to Lopez Obrador adopted an anti-corruption platform that also proposes a universal minimum income.  The coalition, dominated by the conservative National Action Party (PAN) and the center-left Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) will choose its consensus presidential candidate by mid-December. Next year s election is expected to be contested by multiple candidates including independents for the first time, which is likely to fragment the vote and could help a candidate win with less than a third support, a change that could favor either Lopez Obrador or the ruling party. Pena Nieto is barred by law from seeking a second term. ",worldnews,"November 20, 2017 ",1
Sound in Atlantic not from missing Argentine submarine: navy spokesman,"MAR DEL PLATA, Argentina/BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - A sound detected on Monday in the South Atlantic, near where an Argentine navy submarine with 44 crew went missing five days ago, is not believed to have come from the ill-fated vessel, a navy spokesman said. The sound detected by probes initially raised hopes that crew members aboard the ARA San Juan submarine, which disappeared after reporting an electrical malfunction, may have been intentionally making noise to attract rescuers. But an analysis by Argentine authorities, on the fourth day of a search-and-rescue mission, showed that it was highly unlikely it had come from the German-built submarine, navy spokesman Enrique Balbi told reporters in Buenos Aires.  It does not correspond to a pattern that would be consistent with bangs against the walls in morse code,  Balbi said. He described whatever had been detected as  a continuous, constant sound.  The disappointment followed another letdown earlier in the day, when the navy said satellite calls detected over the weekend did not in fact come from the vessel. (tmsnrt.rs/2zQ8HGZ) The vessel reported an electrical problem and was headed back to its base in the port of Mar del Plata when it disappeared on Wednesday, the navy said. Storms have complicated search efforts as relatives wait anxiously.     More than a dozen boats and aircraft from Argentina, the United States, Britain, Chile and Brazil have joined the search effort. Authorities have mainly been scanning the sea from the sky, as storms have made it difficult for boats. The navy said on Monday night that two boats belonging to French oil company Total SA, which has offshore operations in Argentina, arrived at the Patagonian port of Comodoro Rivadavia to transport rescue equipment the U.S. Navy brought to the country, including a remote-operated vehicle, a mini-submarine, and a submarine rescue chamber.  Gabriel Galeazzi, a naval commander, told reporters that the submarine had come up from the depths and reported the unspecified electrical malfunction before it disappeared nearly 300 miles off the coast.  The submarine surfaced and reported a malfunction, which is why its ground command ordered it to return to its naval base at Mar del Plata,  he said. The malfunction did not necessarily cause an emergency, Galeazzi added. The craft was navigating normally, underwater, at a speed of five knots toward Mar del Plata when it was last heard from, he said.  A warship has a lot of backup systems, to allow it to move from one to another when there is a breakdown,  Galeazzi said. One of the crew is Argentina s first female submarine officer, Eliana Maria Krawczyk, 35, who joined the navy in 2004 and rose to become the master-at-arms aboard the ARA San Juan. The families of crew members have gathered at the Mar del Plata naval base awaiting news. They were joined on Monday by President Mauricio Macri.  We continue to deploy all available national and international resources,  to find the submarine, Macri said on Twitter. Intermittent satellite communications were detected on Saturday and the government had said they were likely to have come from the submarine. But the ARA San Juan sent its last signal on Wednesday, according to Balbi. The calls that were detected  did not correspond to the satellite phone of the submarine San Juan,  he said on Monday, adding that the craft had oxygen for seven days. After that, he said, it would have to surface or get near the surface to replenish air supply. The ARA San Juan was inaugurated in 1983, making it the newest of the three submarines in the navy s fleet. Built in Germany, it underwent maintenance in 2008 in Argentina. That maintenance included the replacement of its four diesel engines and its electric propeller engines, according to specialist publication Jane s Sentinel.      ",worldnews,"November 20, 2017 ",1
"Trump declares North Korea state sponsor of terrorism, triggers sanctions","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump put North Korea back on a list of state sponsors of terrorism on Monday, a designation that allows the United States to impose more sanctions and risks inflaming tensions over Pyongyang s nuclear weapons and missile programs. The Republican president, who has traded personal insults with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un but has not ruled out talks, said the Treasury Department will announce additional sanctions against North Korea on Tuesday. The designation came a week after Trump returned from a 12-day, five-nation trip to Asia in which he made containing North Korea s nuclear ambitions a centerpiece of his discussions.  In addition to threatening the world by nuclear devastation, North Korea has repeatedly supported acts of international terrorism, including assassinations on foreign soil,  Trump told reporters at the White House.  This designation will impose further sanctions and penalties on North Korea and related persons and supports our maximum pressure campaign to isolate the murderous regime.  Trump, who has often criticized his predecessors  policies toward Pyongyang, said the designation should have been made  a long time ago.   North Korea is pursuing nuclear weapons and missile programs in defiance of U.N. Security Council sanctions and has made no secret of its plans to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland. It has fired two missiles over Japan and on Sept. 3 fired its sixth and largest nuclear test. South Korea s spy agency said on Monday the North may conduct additional missile tests this year to improve its long-range missile technology and ramp up the threat against the United States. Experts say the designation will be largely symbolic as North Korea is already heavily sanctioned by the United States, a reality that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson seemed to acknowledged while saying it would help dissuade third parties from supporting Pyongyang.  The practical effects may be limited but hopefully we re closing off a few loopholes with this,  he told reporters. The United States has designated only three other countries - Iran, Sudan and Syria - as state sponsors of terrorism.  Some experts think North Korea does not meet the criteria for the designation, which requires evidence that a state has  repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism.  In his remarks, Trump remembered Otto Warmbier, the college student from Ohio who died in June shortly after his return from North Korea, where he was held for more than a year.  His death caused outrage in the United States and further inflamed tensions with Pyongyang.  A U.S. intelligence official who follows developments in North Korea expressed concern that Trump s move could backfire, especially given that the basis for the designation is arguable.  Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official said Kim could respond in a number of ways, including renewing missile or nuclear tests in  a very volatile environment.  The move also could undercut Trump s efforts to solicit greater Chinese cooperation in pressuring North Korea to halt its nuclear and ballistic missile tests, the official said. In any case, it will do little to open the way for U.S. dialogue with North Korea, which China - Pyongyang s main ally -  and others have been pushing for.  I don t see how this helps, and it might just be an important miscalculation,  said Robert Gallucci, the chief U.S. negotiator during the 1994 North Korean nuclear crisis. In February, plans for talks in the United States between former U.S. officials and North Korea were scrapped when the State Department denied a visa for a top envoy from Pyongyang after the murder of Kim s half brother, Kim Jong Nam, in Malaysia. North Korea was put on the U.S. terrorism sponsor list for the 1987 bombing of a Korean Air flight that killed all 115 people aboard. But the administration of former President George W. Bush, a Republican, removed Pyongyang in 2008 in exchange for progress in denuclearization talks. Some members of Congress had been pushing for years for North Korea to be put back on the list, but others questioned whether the reclusive regime met the criteria of actively sponsoring international terrorism. U.S. Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, called the decision  an important step in our efforts to apply maximum diplomatic and financial pressure on Kim Jong Un.  Democratic Senator Edward Markey said the designation  ratchets up the rhetoric  but does nothing to hold North Korea  accountable for its weapons program. The designation could prove counterproductive, said Harry Kazianis, director of defense studies at the conservative Center for the National Interest.  Sadly, this action by the Trump administration just further cements a dangerous game of escalatory brinkmanship where neither side is giving the other any off-ramp,  he said.

Pinera aims for center in tight battle for Chile's top job,"SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Conservative billionaire Sebastian Pinera said he would court centrist s on Monday in a bid to regain ground in Chile s presidential election after a surprise surge by leftists in Sunday s first-round vote. Pinera faces a tight Dec. 17 runoff against center-left Alejandro Guillier and will also likely have to deal with opposition to his promised tax breaks in the next left-leaning Congress if he triumphs. A former president who ran Chile between 2010 and 2014, Pinera placed first with more than 36 percent of the vote, but his two main left-leaning rivals made a stronger-than-expected showing, garnering a combined 43 percent between them. And after Congressional elections that also took place on Sunday, left-of-center lawmakers will outnumber Pinera s Chile Vamos voting bloc in Congress, complicating his plans to cut the corporate tax rate and slash red tape in the top copper exporter. Markets that had priced in a new four-year term for Pinera sank on Monday. Chile s stock index took its biggest daily dive in six years and the peso currency suffered its sharpest depreciation since 2013.  It s going to be a tight and hard-fought election,  Pinera told foreign media on Monday in capital Santiago.  To boost his chances of winning, Pinera said he would tap some of the more popular lawmakers-elect in his bloc to help guide his campaign.  We re going to appeal to the center, to the kind of people who want moderation,  said Pinera.  We re going to listen with humility to what the majority of Chileans want.  On Monday night, the center-left Christian Democratic party endorsed Guillier  without conditions.  Its presidential candidate, Carolina Goic, who was the most moderate of those running to Pinera s left, garnered about 2 percent of the vote in Sunday s contest. According to the vote tally, many Chileans want change. A new leftist grouping, Frente Amplio, which has criticized Chile s model of free-market provision of services and promised to tax mining companies and the  super-rich , performed much better than expected. The bloc s presidential candidate, Beatriz Sanchez, secured 20 percent of votes in the field of eight, double the support predicted by pollster CEP. The block won its first senate seat and around 20 seats in the lower house of Congress. No single bloc will control Congress. A Pinera victory in December was no longer a sure thing, said election forecaster and political scientist Kenneth Bunker.  It s all up in the air right now,  Bunker said.  We were just dumbfounded when the results started to come in.  In another bad sign for Pinera, Chileans went to polls in bigger numbers than expected on Sunday. Analysts say a low voter turnout favors Pinera because his supporters tend to be better at showing up to vote. Chile, a country of 17 million people with a $250 billion economy, has been one of Latin America s most business-friendly and stable nations since its transition to democracy in 1990. Its economy slowed, however, to an average growth rate of 1.8 percent during outgoing President Michelle Bachelet s term, with lower copper prices dragging on government revenue. Guillier has promised to deepen Bachelet s policies, from expanded access to free university education to protections for striking unions, without departing from Chile s free-market economic model. He has a tricky task ahead to attract the support of Chile s wide-ranging left-of-center voters, in part because he is seen by many as a continuation of Bachelet s unpopular government. Having slammed Pinera as a  step backward  for Chile, Sanchez, a 46-year-old former radio journalist, could rally her  supporters to vote for Guillier, but likely in exchange for policy concessions.  If Mr Guillier wants us to vote for him, he s going to have to give in to Beatriz s proposals,  Sanchez supporter and salesman Hector Mino said. He cited Sanchez  plan to wipe out student debt and overhaul the public-private pension system to ensure bigger payouts as possible offerings. But a too-sharp left turn could push more centrist s to Pinera. As left-leaning blocs weighed possible alliances, far-right Jose Antonio Kast threw his weight behind Pinera. Kast won nearly 8 percent of votes and urged the Chileans who cast them to vote for Pinera in the runoff.  We re not going to demand anything in return,  said Kast, who defended deceased Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet during the campaign. ",worldnews,"November 20, 2017 ",1

China pledges to be more open to providing information: China Daily,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Central and local governments will be more open to providing information to help the international community understand China, the official China Daily reported on Tuesday, citing a senior government official.  We should be open-minded to talk about our disadvantages calmly and conflicts with other countries frankly,  the paper quoted Jiang Jianguo, minister at the State Council Information Office, as saying.  Jiang said China should be more confident in discussing its political thought and the way it governs, and should also  not avoid talking about hot-button issues . China enforces strict controls over the media and the dissemination of information online. It has built a  Great Firewall  aimed at restricting overseas websites and is also cracking down on the use of virtual private networks used to circumvent censorship.  In a report published last week, the U.S. non-government organization Freedom House ranked China last when it comes to internet freedom, citing censorship targeting ethnic minorities, media and regular citizens. China has also imposed restrictions on academic publications, forcing them to block access to articles judged to be in violation of local regulations. However, local authorities have also been urged to improve the accuracy, speed and transparency of economic and environmental data as part of efforts to improve their performance, and China says it is also encouraging the media to hold local officials to account.

Beijing detains 18 after apartment fire: Xinhua,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Police in Beijing have detained 18 people following a fire that killed 19 people and injured another eight on Saturday evening, the state news agency Xinhua reported late on Monday. The fire took place in three-storey apartment block in Beijing s southern Daxing district. A large refrigeration facility had been under construction in the building s basement, and preliminary investigations suggested the fire may have started there, Xinhua said late on Monday. Seven managers at the apartment block had been detained, along with seven electricity workers and four construction workers at the facility. None of the workers were properly qualified, it added, citing police. Beijing s Communist Party chief Cai Qi has already ordered a city-wide safety check, which will last four 40 days.

China supports Cambodia's crackdown on political opposition,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China supports Cambodia s efforts to protect political stability and believes it will smoothly hold elections next year, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his Cambodian counterpart, after the country s main opposition party was dissolved. The Supreme Court banned the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) last week at the request of Prime Minister Hun Sen s government in a move that prompted the United States to cut election funding and threaten more punitive steps. The European Union has also threatened action. The CNRP was banned after its leader, Kem Sokha, was arrested for alleged treason. The government says he sought to take power with American help. He rejects that allegation as politically motivated, to allow Hun Sen to extend his more than three decades in power in next year s general election. The United States has said that Cambodia s 2018 election  will not be legitimate, free or fair . Meeting on Monday on the sides of a Asia-Europe foreign ministers meeting in Myanmar, Wang told his Cambodian counterpart Prak Sokhon that China supported the government s actions.  China supports the Cambodian side s efforts to protect political stability and achieve economic development, and believes the Cambodian government can lead the people to deal with domestic and foreign challenges, and will smoothly hold elections next year, , China s Foreign Ministry said in a Tuesday statement. China has repeatedly expressed its support for Cambodia, making no criticism of the government led by Hun Sen, a former Khmer Rouge commander, who is one of Beijing s most important allies in Southeast Asia after more than three decades in power.

Panama illegal drug seizures set to hit record in 2017: officials,"PANAMA CITY (Reuters) - Panama is on track to hit a record level of illegal narcotics seizures this year after authorities over the weekend seized about 2 tonnes of cocaine near the Central American country s border with Colombia, officials said on Monday. The total drug confiscations in full-year 2017 are expected to surpass the previous annual record of 72 tonnes confiscated last year, Security Minister Alexis Bethancourt told reporters, adding that the uptick is due to better coordination among local law enforcement agencies as well as help from  friendly countries.  The weekend drug bust was made in the border province of Darien on a boat from Colombia, the national border agency SENAFRONT said at a press conference. Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela has previously complained that a peace deal between the Colombian government and the Marxist FARC rebel group has led to a spike in drug trafficking and violence in Panama.

Argentina's first female submarine officer on board missing vessel,"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - One of the 44 crew members on board the Argentine submarine that is missing in the South Atlantic is Eliana Maria Krawczyk, who came from a landlocked province to become the country s first female submarine officer.    In a Facebook video posted in January by the Defense Ministry, Krawczyk discussed her experience of being the first woman in a traditionally male space. She said that she aspired to become the commander of a navy submarine one day.  If you think about being underwater, navigating, and being the only woman, it is strange, but at the same time it is exciting and very challenging,  she said in the video.  Any woman that wants to can do it.                   Krawczyk, 35, was born in the northeastern province of Misiones and joined the navy in 2004, after responding to an advertisement online. She rose to become the master-at-arms aboard the ARA San Juan, which went missing last week. She graduated from Argentina s submarine and diving school in 2012 as the first female officer and always loved her job working at sea, according to her sister Silvina Krawczyk.  It is like she was born for this,  Silvina told Reuters.  She really likes to do what she does in the navy.  Hopes of discovering the ARA San Juan received a setback on Monday when the navy confirmed that failed satellite calls traced to the area on Saturday did not come from the submarine.  With rough seas and high winds hampering the search for the 34-year-old vessel, a navy spokesman said the German-built submarine had surfaced and reported an electrical problem before it disappeared 268 miles (432 km) off the coast.  They are working very hard to find them,  said Silvina Krawczyk who, like many relatives of the missing crew members, was camped out at a naval base in the coastal city of Mar del Plata, awaiting updates on the search and rescue mission.  Besides just the faith one has to maintain in these situations, I truly trust that they are going to find them,   Silvina said. The pioneering submariner had been aboard the ARA San Juan - the newest of the three operated by the Argentine navy - when it made the same trip from Ushuaia, the southernmost city in the world, to Mar del Plata last year without incident, her sister said.  The voyage normally takes around a week, but modest delays due to poor weather are not uncommon. The submarine left Ushuaia on Nov. 13.   It is the first time that something like this has happened,  said Silvina, who herself is a machinist in Argentina s Merchant Marines. At the entrance to the Mar del Plata base, locals hung signs with messages in support of the crew members and their families on a chain-link fence.  Strength for Argentina. We trust in God. We are waiting for you,  read one inscribed on a celestial blue-and-white Argentine flag hanging on the fence.     ",worldnews,"November 20, 2017 ",1

May meets senior ministers to discuss Brexit divorce bill offer,"LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May met with senior members of her ministerial team on Monday to discuss their response to European Union demands for more detail on how much Britain is willing to pay as part of its Brexit divorce package. The EU told May on Friday that there was more work to be done to unlock the Brexit talks, repeating its early December deadline for her to flesh out Britain s opening offer on the financial settlement   thought to be worth around 20 billion euros ( 17.72 billion). May met with ministers amid expectations that she will offer the EU more than she committed to during a speech in Florence in September which failed to provide a meaningful breakthrough in the stalled negotiations. Despite growing pressure from businesses to show she can drive talks onto the subject of future trading relations with the EU, May s office gave little away as to the conclusions of Monday s meeting.  It remains our position that nothing s agreed until everything s agreed in negotiations with the EU,  a source from May s office said.  As the Prime Minister said this morning, the UK and the EU should step forward together.  Media reports said the ministers had agreed to make an offer which would increase the value of May s existing commitment but  gave no specific details. The BBC reported that no specific amounts had been discussed during the meeting. May has repeatedly signalled that she will increase an initial offer that is thought to be worth about a third of what Brussels wants. But, wary of the need to keep the peace in her Conservative Party, which has a powerful faction insisting Britain should be paying the minimum possible to the EU and using the cash offer to leverage better exit terms, May has avoided publicly discussing any figure. Instead, she has said Britain will meet its financial obligations to the bloc   a commitment which remains wide open to interpretation.  Finance minister Philip Hammond said on Sunday that the government would submit its proposal to the EU before a Dec. 14-15 summit.  He warned Britain would be prepared to negotiate hard over the bill, acknowledging differences of opinion with the EU on the value of liabilities, and whether Britain was even liable at all for some elements of the total amount mooted by Brussels.

Televisa exec shot dead outside Mexico City while riding bike,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Adolfo Lagos, the head of struggling Mexican broadcaster Grupo Televisa s telecoms unit izzi, was shot dead on Sunday on the outskirts of Mexico City, the state attorney general s office said in a statement. The attorney general s office for the State of Mexico, which surrounds the capital, said it was investigating the homicide near the ancient Teotihuacan pyramids. It said Lagos was on a bicycle when he was shot. He died in hospital from his wounds.  Press reports said Lagos died after group of men tried to steal his bike. In his Twitter profile photo, Lagos is shown riding a bike. The attorney general s office could not immediately be reached for comment.   Grupo Televisa profoundly laments the death of izzi Director Adolfo Lagos Espinosa that took place in the State of Mexico. Our condolences to his wife, daughters and family members,  the company wrote on Twitter. izzi offers phone, internet and cable television services. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto took to Twitter to offer his condolences, saying that the federal attorney general s office would help state prosecutors investigate. The death of Lagos, a well-known former banker, is a fresh pain for Televisa, which is struggling with declining ad sales and tough competition from the widespread move to online video. The company s longtime chief executive will step down next year, the company said last month, and Televisa has also faced U.S. allegations that it was among media companies that paid bribes to secure television rights for soccer matches. The testimony came during the first trial to emerge from the U.S. investigation of bribery surrounding FIFA, soccer s world governing body. ",worldnews,"November 20, 2017 ",1
U.S. Navy rolls out new measures after deadly Asia-Pacific crashes,"PATTAYA, Thailand (Reuters) - The U.S. Navy has introduced new measures aimed at avoiding a repeat of two deadly crashes in the Asia Pacific region involving its warships and commercial vessels following a review of its practices, the Seventh Fleet commander said on Monday.     Vice Admiral Phillip Sawyer s comments come after a U.S. guided-missile destroyer was slightly damaged at the weekend when a Japanese tug drifted into it during a towing exercise off central Japan, the latest incident in the Pacific this year involving ships from the fleet. The U.S. Navy announced a series of reforms this month aimed at restoring basic naval skills and alertness at sea after a review of deadly collisions in the Asia-Pacific region showed sailors were under-trained and over-worked. Two of the incidents - collisions with commercial vessels involving guided-missile destroyers, the Fitzgerald in June off Japan and then the John S. McCain in August as it approached Singapore - have left a total of 17 sailors dead. The crashes were caused by preventable errors by the sailors on board the ships, Navy investigations showed. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of an international fleet review in the Thai seaside town of Pattaya, Sawyer said the Navy made  circadian rhythm  sleep guidelines a requirement and a new group, the Naval Surface Group Western Pacific, has been training officers at the fleet s headquarters in Yokosuka, south of Tokyo, Japan.  This is a team that is now in Yokosuka and they re charged with doing the man, train, equip aspect of our operations with surface ships,  Sawyer told reporters.  The second thing we have done is Automatic Identification System and that s a system onboard ships that puts out signal and it tells whoever is receiving that signal the course, speed and identification of the ship,  he said.  The third thing is that we are working on the circadian rhythm onboard the ships  to make the sailors more alert. Sawyer took command of the U.S. force in August after the Navy removed the fleet s previous commander, Vice Admiral Joseph Aucoin, following a series of collisions. The U.S. Seventh Fleet operates in the largest of the U.S. Navy s numbered fleets. It oversees about 70-80 ships and submarines at any given time in the region.  The fleet operates over an area of 124 million square km (48 million square miles) from bases in Japan, South Korea and Singapore. ",worldnews,"November 20, 2017 ",1

Head of Syrian opposition's HNC resigns: statement,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - The head of the Syrian opposition s High Negotiations Committee (HNC) resigned on Monday, nearly two years after he was picked to chair the Saudi-backed umbrella group that brings together the armed and political opposition to President Bashar al-Assad. Riyad Hijab, a former Syrian prime minister under Assad, did not explain his reasons for stepping down in a statement posted on social media. The HNC has been the main representative of the Syrian opposition since its formation at a meeting in Saudi Arabia in December, 2015, and has taken part in U.N.-led diplomacy aimed at ending the conflict that erupted in 2011. The war has been going Assad s way since Russia sent its air force to support him militarily in 2015. The Damascus government has been steadily regaining control of territory, thanks also to the support of Iran-backed forces such as Lebanon s Hezbollah. Saudi Arabia is due to host an  expanded  conference for the Syrian opposition this month, aiming to unify its position ahead of more U.N.-backed peace talks, the Saudi state news agency SPA reported last week.

Lebanon's Hezbollah denies sending weapons to Yemen,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - The leader of Lebanon s Hezbollah said on Monday his Iran-backed group had not sent any weapons to Yemen and denied that it was behind the firing of a ballistic missile at Riyadh from Yemeni territory held by Tehran-allied Houthi forces.      In a televised address, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah also urged followers to listen to recent comments by Israeli officials which he said pointed to ties between Saudi Arabia and Israel, Hezbollah s arch foe. An Israeli cabinet minister said this week that Israel has had covert contacts with Riyadh amid common concerns over Iran, a first disclosure by a senior official from either country of long-rumoured secret dealings. Nasrallah also heaped criticism on Arab states that accused Hezbollah of terrorism at an emergency Arab League meeting on Sunday. He called the charge  trivial and ridiculous , asking why Arab states were silent about what he described as the destructive war a Saudi-led coalition has waged in Yemen.  I confirm to them, no ballistic missiles, no advanced weapons, and no guns ... we did not send weapons to Yemen,  or Bahrain, or Kuwait, or Iraq, he said.  Hezbollah had however sent arms to Palestinian territories, including anti-tank missiles, Nasrallah said.  I take pride in that. And in Syria there are the weapons we are fighting with,  he said.  Regional tensions have risen in recent weeks between Sunni Muslim monarchy Saudi Arabia and Shi ite Iran, whose rivalry has wrought upheaval in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Bahrain.      Arab League foreign ministers held an emergency meeting on Sunday at the request of Saudi Arabia to discuss ways to confront Iran and Hezbollah over their role in the region.  Saudi Arabia has accused the heavily armed Shi ite Hezbollah of helping Houthi rebels in Yemen and playing a role in the ballistic missile attack this month. Riyadh has been bogged down in the war it launched against the Houthis in Yemen in 2015.   I categorically deny it,  Nasrallah said.  No man from Lebanese Hezbollah had any part in the firing of this missile or any missiles fired previously.   Lebanon was thrust back to the forefront of the power struggle between Riyadh and Tehran after its prime minister quit abruptly in a broadcast from Saudi Arabia this month. In his shock resignation speech, Saad al-Hariri accused Iran and Hezbollah of  sowing strife  in the region.  Lebanese state officials and politicians close to Hariri say he was held in Riyadh against his will and forced to resign, which Riyadh and Hariri denied. Lebanese President Michel Aoun has refused to accept the resignation until Hariri comes home. A long-time Saudi ally and Sunni leader, Hariri flew to France at the weekend and is expected to return to Beirut in time for independence day celebrations on Wednesday.  We are all waiting for the return of the prime minister, whom we still consider has not resigned,  Nasrallah said.  When he comes, we will see. We are open to any dialogue and any discussion that happens in the country.  Hariri took office last year in a power-sharing deal that saw Aoun, a Hezbollah political ally, become president. His coalition government includes Hezbollah, a military and political movement that wields great influence in Lebanon.     Hezbollah has sent thousands of fighters to Syria to support the Damascus government against mostly Sunni Syrian rebel factions, some of whom have received Saudi aid, and Islamic State militants. Nasrallah also thanked Major-General Qassem Soleimani for what he described as his huge role in fighting Islamic State in the eastern Syrian town of Albu Kamal. Soleimani, commander of foreign operations for Iran s Revolutionary Guards, led the battle from the frontlines from the very beginning, he said.   The battle must continue with the same strength ... and we must continue working to end the remnants of Daesh,  he said, using the Arabic acronym for Islamic State. Hezbollah could withdraw its large number of commanders from Iraq once Islamic State was defeated there, he said.          ",worldnews,"November 20, 2017 ",1
DUP says Northern Ireland will leave EU on same terms as rest of UK,"BELFAST (Reuters) - The head of the Democratic Unionist Party said on Monday Northern Ireland would leave the EU on the same terms as the rest of the United Kingdom, rebuffing a suggestion from the bloc that the region remain subject to some of its rules.  Brussels has said it will not move to the second phase of Brexit talks with Britain until London provides additional detail of how it will guarantee that there be no hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.  Chief EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier on Monday asked the British government to detail what specific EU rules it would retain in Northern Ireland to ensure regulatory equivalence between the region and the Irish Republic and thus avoid the need for a hard border. But the head of the DUP, whose votes the government of British Prime Minister Theresa May is dependent on to pass legislation, repeated her rejection of the suggestion on Monday, saying she would not create barriers to business with the rest of the United Kingdom to allow smooth trade with Ireland.   Northern Ireland will exit the EU on the same terms as the rest of the United Kingdom,  Arlene Foster said in a statement ahead of a meeting with May on Tuesday morning.   We will not countenance a border in the Irish Sea. I welcome the Prime Minister s commitment on this.   The EU has said the UK needs to come forward with concrete proposals on the Irish border and on what past financial commitments it will honor by early December if EU leaders are to declare at their Dec. 14-15 summit that enough has been achieved to start talks on a transition period and a trade deal. Britain is scheduled to leave the bloc in March 2019. Foster said the EU s stance on Northern Ireland amounted to blackmail.  Those in Dublin and Brussels, recklessly trying to use Northern Ireland for their own objectives, should cease,  she said in the statement.  The Prime Minister should warn Brussels that Northern Ireland must not be used as blackmail. ",worldnews,"November 20, 2017 ",1
"U.S., Afghan forces strike opium factories to curb Taliban funds","KABUL (Reuters) - U.S. and Afghan forces have launched joint attacks on Taliban opium factories to try to curb the insurgent group s economic lifeline, officials from both countries said on Monday. U.S. Army General John Nicholson showed videos at a press conference of targeted aerial strikes against what he described as Taliban drug factories.  Last night we conducted strikes in northern Helmand to hit the Taliban where it hurts, in their narcotics financing,  said Nicholson, flanked by Afghan Army Lieutenant General Mohammad Sharif Yaftali. The southern province of Helmand suffers heavy fighting and is the single-largest producer of opium. Opium production in Afghanistan reached record highs this year, up 87 percent on last year, the United Nations said last week. The U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said output of opium made from poppy seeds in Afghanistan, the world s main source of heroin, stands at around 9,000 metric tons this year. UNODC has warned in the past that Kabul s weakening grip on security was contributing to a collapse in eradication efforts. Nearly half of Afghan opium is processed, or refined into morphine or heroin, before it is trafficked out of the country, according to U.S. and Afghan officials.  We re determined to tackle criminal economy and narcotics trafficking with full force,  said Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on Twitter. Nicholson said the attacks were part of U.S. President Donald Trump s new policy toward Afghanistan as he boosts troop numbers. The four-star general showed one video of an F-22 fighter jet dropping 250-pound bombs on two buildings, emphasizing that a nearby third building was left unscathed. U.S. troops have long been accused of causing unnecessary collateral damage and civilian deaths. The United States says it takes every precaution to avoid civilian casualties. The United Nations said at least 10 civilians may have been killed by a strike in Kunduz earlier this month, contradicting a U.S. investigation that found no civilian deaths.

Zimbabwe's Mugabe in contact with ousted vice president,"HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe s top general said on Monday talks were planned between President Robert Mugabe and former vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa, whose sacking by the 93-year-old leader two weeks ago triggered a coup. General Constantino Chiwenga, head of the armed forces and leader of the takeover codenamed  Operation Restore Legacy , told a media conference he was encouraged by contact between the two men and Mnangagwa would be back in the country soon.  Thereafter, the nation will be advised on the outcome of talks between the two,  he said, reading from a statement. Earlier, Zimbabwe s ruling ZANU-PF resolved to bring a motion in parliament on Tuesday to impeach Mugabe, after a noon deadline expired for the besieged leader to resign and bring the curtain down on nearly four decades in power. Impeachment could see Mugabe kicked out in days and would be an ignominious end to the career of the  Grand Old Man  of African politics, once lauded as an anti-colonial hero. In the draft motion, the party accused Mugabe of being a  source of instability , flouting the rule of law and presiding over an  unprecedented economic tailspin  in the last 15 years. It also said he had abused his constitutional mandate to favor his unpopular wife Grace, 52, whose tilt at power triggered the backlash from the army that brought tanks onto the streets of the capital last week. Mnangagwa s removal was meant to boost her chances of succeeding her husband. On paper, the impeachment process is long-winded, involving a joint sitting of the Senate and National Assembly, then a nine-member committee of senators, then another joint sitting to confirm his dismissal with a two-thirds majority. However, constitutional experts said ZANU-PF, in revolt against Mugabe, could push it through quickly.  They can fast-track it. It can be done in a matter of a day,  said John Makamure, executive director of the Southern African Parliamentary Support Trust. Mugabe s demise, now apparently inevitable, is likely to send shockwaves across Africa. A number of entrenched strongmen, from Uganda s Yoweri Museveni to Democratic Republic of Congo s Joseph Kabila, are facing mounting pressure to step aside. Mugabe was once admired as the  Thinking Man s Guerrilla , a world away from his image in his latter years as a dictator who proudly declared he held a  degree in violence . As the economy crumbled and opposition to his rule grew in the late 1990s, Mugabe tightened his grip in the southern African country of 16 million, seizing white-owned farms, unleashing security forces to crush dissent and speaking of ruling until he was 100. ZANU-PF s action follows a weekend of high drama in Harare that culminated in reports Mugabe had agreed to stand down - only for him to dash the hopes of millions of his countrymen in a bizarre and rambling national address on Sunday night. Flanked by the generals who sent in troops last week to seize the state broadcaster, Mugabe spoke of the need for national unity and farming reform, but made no mention of his own fate.  I am baffled. It s not just me, it s the whole nation,  shocked opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai told Reuters.  He s playing a game.  Two senior government sources told Reuters Mugabe had agreed on Sunday to step aside and CNN said on Monday his resignation letter had been drawn up, with terms that included immunity for him and Grace. Two other political sources told Reuters on Monday Mugabe had indeed agreed to resign but ZANU-PF did not want him to quit in front of the military, an act that would have made its  intervention last week look more like a coup. Another political source said Mugabe s opponents had hoped his televised speech would  sanitize  the military s action, which has paved the way for Mnangagwa, a former security chief known as The Crocodile, to take over. Moments after the address, war veterans  leader Chris Mutsvangwa, called for a wave of protests if Mugabe refused to go. In London, a spokesman for British Prime Minister Theresa May said Mugabe had clearly lost the support of his people. Since last week, Mugabe has been confined to his lavish  Blue Roof  residence in Harare, apart from two trips to State House to meet the generals and one to a university graduation ceremony at which he appeared to fall asleep. Grace and at least two senior members of her  G40  political faction are believed to be holed up in the same compound. On Saturday, hundreds of thousands took to the streets of  Harare to celebrate Mugabe s expected downfall and hail a new era for their country, whose economy has imploded under the weight of economic mismangement. Inflation reached 500 billion percent in 2008. An estimated 3 million Zimbabweans have emigrated to neighboring South Africa in search of a better life. The huge crowds on the streets have given a quasi-democratic veneer to the army s intervention. Behind the euphoria, however, some Zimbabweans have misgivings.   The real danger of the current situation is that, having got their new preferred candidate into State House, the military will want to keep him or her there, no matter what the electorate wills,  former education minister David Coltart said. Others worry about Mnangagwa s past, particularly as state security chief in the early 1980s, when an estimated 20,000 people were killed in the so-called Gukurahundi crackdown by the North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade in Matabeleland. He has denied any wrongdoing but critics say Zimbabwe risks swapping one army-backed autocrat for another.  The deep state that engineered this change of leadership will remain, thwarting any real democratic reform,  said Miles Tendi, a Zimbabwean academic at Oxford University.

"U.S. sanctions individuals, entities for Iran-linked counterfeiting","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department on Monday sanctioned a network of individuals and companies it said counterfeited Yemeni bank notes potentially worth hundreds of millions of dollars for Iran Revolutionary Guard s Qods Force. The network circumvented European export restrictions in order to provide the counterfeiting supplies and equipment, according to a Treasury statement.  President Donald Trump last month declared Iran s Revolutionary Guard a supporter of terrorism and authorized Treasury to impose tough sanctions limiting its access to goods and funding.  Republican Trump has been critical of the 2015 agreement his predecessor, former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, reached with Iran and said the United States must take stronger steps to ensure the country does not acquire nuclear weapons. The counterfeiting scheme exposed the  deep levels of deception  that the Qods Force, a Revolutionary Guard unit carrying out missions outside the country, employs  against companies in Europe, governments in the Gulf, and the rest of the world to support its destabilizing activities,  said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. According to Treasury, Pardavesh Tasvir Rayan Co. is a printing operation controlled by businessman Reza Heidari and owned by Tejarat Almas Mobin Holding that procured equipment and materials to print counterfeit Yemeni rial bank notes.  Qods Force used the currency to support its activities. Heidari used front companies and other methods to keep European suppliers in the dark about their ultimate customer. He coordinated with Mahmoud Seif, Tejarat s managing director, on the logistics of procuring materials and moving them into Iran, Treasury said. Treasury sanctioned both men and both companies, as well as ForEnt Technik GmbH, which Heidari owns, and Printing Trade Center GmbH for serving as front companies in the operation.

"Like Zimbabwe, South Africa needs leadership change: ANC official","JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa s ruling African National Congress (ANC) should get President Jacob Zuma to stand down as head of state after a party conference next month because like Zimbabwe the country urgently needs a change of leader, a senior ANC official said. The ANC has been dogged by infighting for much of this year as a series of corruption scandals have tarnished its image ahead of the December conference at which it will elect Zuma s successor. The party is split between factions backing Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, a former minister and ex-wife of Zuma, and Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa for the ANC s top job. ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu told Reuters that whoever the party chooses next month, the incoming leadership should tell Zuma to go to allow the ANC to clean up its act.   You can t keep him there,  he said. Mthembu said the ANC could learn from what was happening in Zimbabwe, where the ruling ZANU-PF party is pushing for President Robert Mugabe to leave his post.  In Zimbabwe they call that bloodless corrections ... We need to make the corrections immediately after the conference. How do you effect those corrections in government when the same person who might have contributed to a better degree still sits?  Mthembu asked. Mthembu is in the camp that backs Ramaphosa for ANC president and said it was important for the ANC to regain the trust of South African people after news reports that the Gupta brothers, business friends close to Zuma, had influenced government appointments and secured contracts from state firms. Both Zuma and the Guptas deny any wrongdoing. Zuma s second term as president expires in 2019, but he could be forced out as head of state by the ANC s new leadership before his term ends, as was the case with former president Thabo Mbeki.  In May the ANC said its executive committee backed Zuma after calls for him to resign, and in August Zuma survived a no-confidence motion in parliament. Zuma still has strong support in the party, including from the influential women s and youth leagues as well as in rural areas, where several tribal chiefs back the traditionalist leader. The ANC has seen its electoral majority shrink over recent years, and some analysts predict it could lose the 2019 election. Until recently that was unthinkable for a party that has led comfortably since sweeping to power under Nelson Mandela at the end of apartheid in 1994. Mthembu said if the ANC failed to emerge from its December conference with a new image it was  doomed .  It s us who got South Africa into this mess by electing Zuma to be president. We should have looked closely into the man. With hindsight we made a terrible error of judgment,  he said. ",worldnews,"November 20, 2017 ",1
Defiant Hun Sen tells U.S. to cut all aid to Cambodia,"PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen challenged the United States on Sunday to cut all aid after it announced it was ending funding for a general election next year in response to the dissolution of the main opposition party, media reported. Hun Sen, the strongman who has ruled Cambodia for more than three decades, has taken a strident anti-American line in an increasingly tense run-up to a 2018 election that has included a crackdown on critics, rights groups and independent media. The United States announced on Friday it was ending funding for the election, and promised more  concrete steps , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) at the request of the government, on the grounds it was plotting to seize power. The party denied the accusation. The pro-government Fresh News website reported that Hun Sen said in a speech to garment workers that he welcomed the U.S. aid cut and urged it cut it all.  Samdech Techo Hun Sen confirmed that cutting U.S. aid won t  kill the government but will only kill a group of people who serve American policies,  Fresh News reported, using Hun Sen s official title.  It did not identify the people suspected of serving U.S. policies but added:  Hun Sen ... welcomes and encourages the U.S. to cut all aid.  The U.S. embassy in Phnom Penh did not respond to a request for comment. In April, the U.S. embassy announced a $1.8 million grant to assist local elections this year and next year s general election. The U.S. State Department said on its website that U.S. assistance to Cambodia for programs in health, education, governance, economic growth and clearing unexploded ordnance was worth more than $77.6 million in 2014. However, Chinese support for big ticket projects has allowed Hun Sen to brush off Western criticism of his crackdown on dissent. China vastly outspends the United States in a country once destroyed by Cold War superpower rivalry, and its money goes on highly visible infrastructure projects and with no demands for political reform. In September, authorities arrested the CNRP leader, Kem Sokha, and charged him with treason over what they said was a plot to take power with U.S. help. He denied any such plot. The U.S. State Department called on Friday for Cambodia to release him and reverse the decision to ban his party. The court also banned 118 party members from politics for five years. Police have begun to take down CNRP signs from their offices across the country. Mu Sochua, a senior CNRP member who moved abroad shortly before the party was banned, said Hun Sen was jeopardizing foreign investment.  Foreign investors serious about investing in Cambodia won t be coming and are, or will be, looking at an exit if they can t compete with China s monopoly in Cambodia because Hun Sen needs to pay back favors to China,  she said. Western countries, which for decades supported Cambodia s emergence from war and isolation, have shown little appetite for sanctions in response to the crackdown, but the European Union has raised the possibility of Cambodia losing trade preferences. Tariff-free access to Europe for Cambodian garments - and similar trade preferences in the United States - have helped Cambodia build a garment industry on low-cost labor. EU and U.S. buyers take some 60 percent of Cambodia s exports. ",worldnews,"November 19, 2017 ",1
Saudi agency says country targeted in cyber spying campaign,"LONDON/RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabian security officials said on Monday that the country had been targeted as part of a wide-ranging cyber espionage campaign observed since February against five Middle East nations as well as several countries outside the region. The Saudi government s National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) said in a statement the kingdom had been hit by a hacking campaign bearing the technical hallmarks of an attack group dubbed  MuddyWater  by U.S. cyber firm Palo Alto Networks. Palo Alto s Unit 42 threat research unit published a report last Friday showing how a string of connected attacks this year used decoy documents with official-looking government logos to lure unsuspecting users from targeted organizations to download infected documents and compromise their computer networks. Documents pretending to be from the U.S. National Security Agency, Iraqi intelligence, Russian security firm Kaspersky and the Kurdistan regional government were among those used to trick victims, Unit 42 said in a blog post (goo.gl/SvwrXv). The Unit 42 researchers said the attacks had targeted organizations in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey and Israel, as well as entities outside the Middle East in Georgia, India, Pakistan and the United States.  The Saudi security agency said in its own statement that the attacks sought to steal data from computers using email phishing techniques targeting the credentials of specific users.  The NCSC said they also comprised so-called  watering hole  attacks, which seek to trick users to click on infected web links to seize control of their machines. The technical indicators supplied by Unit 42 are the same as those described by the NCSC as being involved in attacks against Saudi Arabia. The NCSC said the attacks appeared to be by an  advanced persistent threat  (APT) group - cyber jargon typically used to describe state-backed espionage.  Saudi Arabia has been the target of frequent cyber attacks, including the  Shamoon  virus, which cripples computers by wiping their disks and has hit both government ministries and petrochemical firms. Saudi Aramco, the world s largest oil company, was hit by an early version of the  Shamoon  virus in 2012, in the country s worst cyber attack to date. The NCSC declined further comment on the source of the attack or on which organizations or agencies were targeted. Unit 42 said it was unable to identify the attack group or its aims and did not have enough data to conclude that the MuddyWater group was behind the Saudi attacks as outlined by NCSC.  We cannot confirm that the NCSC posting and our MuddyWater research are in fact related,  Christopher Budd, a Unit 42 manager told Reuters.  There s just not enough information to make that connection with an appropriate level of certainty.  Palo Alto Networks said the files it had uncovered were almost identical to information-stealing documents disguised as Microsoft Word files and found to be targeting the Saudi government by security firm MalwareBytes in a September report.

U.S. general sets two-year goal for driving back Afghan Taliban,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top U.S. general in Afghanistan said on Monday he believes he could help Afghan forces drive back the Taliban enough to control at least 80 percent of the country within two years, compared with about two-thirds today.  General John Nicholson, citing counter-insurgency doctrine, said gaining 80 percent control of the country would represent a turning point in the 16-year-old conflict, which has become the  longest U.S war.  This we believe is the critical mass necessary to drive the enemy to irrelevance, meaning they re living in these remote outlying areas, or they reconcile, or they die,  Nicholson told a Pentagon news briefing via video conference from Afghanistan. His remarks carried echoes of a U.S.-led strategy that began in 2009 and was accompanied by a massive surge in U.S. forces, which peaked in 2011 at more than 100,000 troops.  Many areas that were regained during U.S.-led operations eventually reverted to Taliban control when Western forces turned them over to the Afghans.   The U.S. military presence is just a fraction of its peak levels today. President Donald Trump sent an additional 3,000 troops to Afghanistan in recent weeks, bringing the total number of U.S. troops to about 14,000.  The Pentagon is also directing more and more intelligence assets and firepower to the country as gains against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria free up resources for Afghanistan. That has allowed for a major increase in U.S. air strikes, which Nicholson said reached their highest level this year since 2012. Still, Taliban control of the country remains roughly steady against last year, Nicholson acknowledged. As of August, 13 percent of the 407 districts in Afghanistan were under Taliban control or influence, compared with 11 percent in February, according to a report released last month by the U.S. government watchdog, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR). Many analysts, as well as current and former U.S. officials, believe that Afghanistan s war cannot be won militarily, particularly when the Taliban benefit from safe-havens in Pakistan. Trump has articulated a harder policy toward Pakistan in recent months, but U.S. officials say they have not yet seen a meaningful shift by Islamabad against insurgents using Pakistan as a hub for attacks in Afghanistan. The Afghan army also suffers from deep structural problems, including high casualty rates, rampant illiteracy, corruption and a frequent lack of tribal ties to areas where they are sent to fight.  Still, in Nicholson s view, getting Afghan forces to hold 80 percent of the country s population would leave the Taliban with less than 10 percent control.  Maybe the rest is contested,  he said. One way that Nicholson hopes to increase pressure on the Taliban is to curb their financing, and he showed videos to Pentagon reporters of U.S. strikes in recent days against Taliban opium factories. He cited estimates of between 400 and 500 opium factories in Afghanistan. Afghan opium production reached record highs this year, up 87 percent from last year, the United Nations said last week. The U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said output of opium made from poppies in Afghanistan, the world s main source of heroin, stands at around 9,000 metric tons this year.

Detained Catalan government members say they accept Madrid's control,"MADRID (Reuters) - Two former members of the Catalan government held in custody over their roles in Catalonia s banned independence drive have asked to be released from custody after accepting Madrid s control of the region, according to appeals published on Monday. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy sacked the Catalan government and took control in October, hours after the Catalan parliament made a unilateral declaration of independence in a vote boycotted by the opposition and declared illegal by Spanish courts. Lawyers for Jordi Turull and Josep Rull have lodged requests with the High Court to be released, saying they had not shown any resistance to Rajoy instigating direct rule over Catalonia by activating Article 155 of the Spanish constitution. Six other ex-members of the Catalan government and the leaders of the two main pro-independence grassroots groups are also in jail awaiting trial at the High Court on charges of rebellion and sedition. Catalonia s independence movement has deeply divided Spain, dragging it into its worst political crisis since the return of democracy four decades ago and fuelling anti-Spanish sentiment in Catalonia and nationalist tendencies elsewhere. Rajoy has called a Dec. 21 election in Catalonia, which he hopes will lead to a unionist majority in the regional parliament. Separatist parties failed to agree to run on a united ticket, knocking their chances of retaining control.  In their requests to the court, Turull and Rull s lawyers  said there was no risk their clients would hide or alter or destroy evidence.  My client has accepted the application of Article 155 of the constitution by the Spanish Government,  they said. Earlier this month, Spain s Supreme Court released the Catalan parliament speaker Carme Forcadell on bail of 150,000 euros after she agreed to renounce any political activity that went against the Spanish constitution.  Ousted Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont is in Belgium, and Spain has issued a European arrest warrant for him. He said a week ago he might consider a solution to the crisis that did not involve Catalonia s secession.  ",worldnews,"November 20, 2017 ",1
Iraqi court rules Kurdish independence vote unconstitutional,"BAGHDAD/ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - Iraq s Supreme Federal Court ruled on Monday a Sept. 25 Kurdish independence referendum was unconstitutional and the results void, strengthening Baghdad s hand in a stand-off with the Kurdish region watched closely by neighboring Turkey and Iran. The Kurdistan Regional Government did not directly say whether it accepted the effective cancellation of the vote, but its new prime minister called for a third party to oversee talks between Iraq s central government and the Kurds. The KRG also called on the international community   including the United Nations, European Union and non-governmental organizations   to intervene and help lift what it called  restrictive  sanctions imposed by Baghdad in retaliation for the referendum.  Kurds voted overwhelmingly to break away from Iraq in the referendum, defying the central government in Baghdad and alarming neighboring Turkey and Iran who have their own Kurdish minorities.  The Federal Court issued the decision to consider the Kurdish region s referendum unconstitutional and this ruling is final,  a court spokesman said.  The power of this ruling should now cancel all the results of the referendum.  The court is responsible for settling disputes between Iraq s central government and its regions, including Kurdistan. The verdict is not subject to appeal. A statement from Iraq s Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said:  We call upon everybody to ... avoid taking any step which violates the constitution and law.  The court had ruled on Nov. 6 that no region or province can secede. The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) said last week it would respect that verdict, signaling a new phase in efforts to restart negotiations over the region s future. The Iraqi government responded to the Kurdish independence referendum by seizing the Kurdish-held city of Kirkuk and other territory disputed between the Kurds and the central government. It also banned direct flights to Kurdistan and demanded control over border crossings. Long-serving Kurdish president Masoud Barzani stepped down over the affair and the regional government led by his nephew Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani has tried to negotiate an end to the confrontation. In a news conference following Monday s ruling, Nechirvan Barzani said the court s ruling was reached unilaterally, without input from KRG representatives, and called for a third party to oversee negotiations between Baghdad and the Kurds.      The rights of Kurds are enshrined in the (Iraqi) constitution and we seek the implementation of this constitution to resolve our issues with Baghdad,  Barzani told reporters, according to Kurdish Rudaw TV.  The constitution is one package and must be applied in its entirety, not selectively.  However, Barzani did not directly say whether Kurdish officials accepted the effective cancellation of the referendum. The KRG had previously offered only to freeze the results. The KRG later said its chief concern was the lifting of an embargo on international flights to the region, which it said hampered foreign investment as well as humanitarian efforts for the more than 1.5 million internally displaced people currently in the region.   We call on the international community to intercede in urging Baghdad authorities to lift the embargo, without condition, on international flights.    The restrictive policies adopted by Baghdad against Erbil are in violation of Iraq s obligations and responsibilities under international and humanitarian law,  the KRG said in a statement.

Merkel told German broadcaster ZDF she was ready to serve four more years as chancellor, and felt it was important to send a signal of stability for the country and Europe and the world. Asked about the possibility of another  grand coalition  with the Social Democrats, Merkel said she would wait to see the party s response after their talks with President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on Wednesday. But she said any demand for her to step down would not be a good way to start a new coalition. She said she was disappointed by the decision of the pro-business Free Democrats to pull out of the coalition talks, but did not expect the party to reverse course. ",worldnews,"November 20, 2017 ",1
Face time with May: UK listens to bankers' Brexit worries,"LONDON (Reuters) - A few hours before Theresa May lost her second cabinet member in a week, the British prime minister found time amidst the crisis to meet one of the world s most powerful bankers. With May renowned for keeping finance chiefs at arm s length, some commercial rivals suspected special treatment in her willingness to sit down with Jamie Dimon, chief executive of U.S. investment bank JPMorgan.  Others, however, sense a subtle but significant change in the political climate with May listening more to the worries of an industry struggling to fathom out Britain s departure from the European Union. Her talks with Dimon on Nov. 8 raised eyebrows - and some hackles - around the City of London financial center.   It s a bit outrageous,  said a senior executive at one of Britain s top banks.  What other bank CEO is getting as much one-on-one face time with the prime minister? We certainly aren t.   From Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s to David Cameron last year, British prime ministers have traditionally held the door open for leaders of a finance industry that pays more than 70 billion pounds ($92 billion) in UK tax every year and employs more than a million Britons.  Not so May, who has appeared reluctant to meet bank executives. Still, Dimon secured the face-to-face talks between the abrupt departures of her defense and international development ministers which rocked the minority government. Shortly before last year s Brexit referendum, Dimon warned that 4,000 out of JPMorgan s 16,000 British jobs might have to move abroad to ensure the bank could continue selling services across the remaining nations of the EU. Dimon has since softened his tone, but the British bank executive asked whether the original estimate had won JPMorgan the access.  I don t know if it s because they ve threatened to move the most jobs - maybe we should say we re moving 4,000 too,  he said.  But something is afoot. Reuters has spoken to more than a dozen executives at large banks and government officials, with many saying May is showing greater willingness to press the City s cause in Brexit negotiations.  In return, the bankers are scaling back their plans to move jobs to rival financial centers such as Frankfurt, Paris and Dublin, at least during any transitional period after Britain leaves the EU in March 2019.  Britain and the EU have yet to begin discussing financial services at the Brexit talks, worrying bankers who fear the government has left it too late to negotiate a transition period or secure a good deal.   Our view is that the government frankly is in chaos,  said another senior executive at a U.S. bank.  We are really nervous.   However, May outlined to Dimon her vision for a transition period after Brexit day - March 29, 2019 - and a future trade deal with the EU, easing concerns that Britain may crash out of the world s biggest trading bloc without any agreement.  A JPMorgan spokeswoman expressed cautious optimism after the Downing Street talks.   While some uncertainty remains, we feel that the government understands the concerns of international firms such as ours, and the economy more broadly,  she said.  We were grateful for better clarity on the government s objectives in the Brexit negotiations.   A spokesman for the prime minister did not respond to requests for comment.  However, sources with knowledge of the meeting noted that she can make promises on her intentions for the Brexit talks but not on their outcome.  We got clarity on what they re looking for, not on how it will unfold,  said the source.  The bankers pressed their case for a period of adjustment to the post-Brexit financial services regime, rather than an abrupt change as soon as Britain leaves.   We re all looking for transition and a good future deal,  said the source.  In return, the JPMorgan team indicated there would be no major staff upheaval, at least on Brexit day.   They told her we will try to move as few people as possible on Day One. It will be a few hundred people and we will keep as many people as possible in the UK,  said another source.  For the banks, moving top London employees to the continent is expensive and unpopular with staff reluctant to uproot their families. But longer term, a significant number of jobs may still shift if a final deal is not to their liking.  As in a number of countries, banks have been deeply unpopular in Britain since the global financial crisis. But their leaders felt particularly unloved after May came to power last year and cooled what critics regarded as an overly cozy relationship between the government and big business.  May confined her contacts with bankers largely to round table gatherings such as at Davos in January, a meeting Dimon also attended. Some Wall Street bosses were left expressing frustration with a lack of detail on the Brexit process, and questioning May s commitment to protecting the finance industry The relationship remains measured. May was scheduled to make only a five minute courtesy appearance at the talks with Dimon, hosted by finance minister Philip Hammond. In the event she stayed a quarter of an hour.  Still, those who connect government and business have noticed a change.  Iain Anderson, executive chairman of public affairs company  Cicero, said a thaw began after the May lost her parliamentary majority in a June election and the government started asking companies for more input on the Brexit talks.      The mood has improved from last year when I don t think I have ever seen businesses as emotional and angry,  said Anderson, whose firm represents many FTSE 100 companies.  Government officials confirmed May s change of tack.  She is far more skeptical about engaging with business than her predecessors,  said one official, who declined to be named.  This created bitterness because people are getting less face time,  said the official, but added:  The situation has improved since the election.    Brexit minister David Davis, whose talks with chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier appear deadlocked, has led his own charm offensive in the past week or so.  Davis said on Tuesday the financial industry would be exempt from any curbs on immigration from the remaining EU countries. That is likely to contrast with tough new rules planned for arrivals of lower-skilled workers. In another speech, he emphasized the importance of an industry which accounts for about 12 percent of Britain s economic output.   When I sit round the negotiating table with Michel Barnier, or round the cabinet table with my colleagues, it s always with the importance of the City very much in my mind,  Davis said.    Only a year ago, he was accusing bankers of leading a  blame Brexit festival  and lying about the number of UK employees they would have to fire.     Davis had surprised executives in his initial meetings by telling them they would not get any special favors in the negotiations, according to people who attended.  The head of one of Britain s largest finance companies, who has met Davis several times in the last year, said the minister has accepted the damage to the wider economy if firms go overseas.   Davis has got the message,  the executive said. According to government officials, the atmosphere has improved since the banks scaled back their estimates of how many jobs will move to more realistic levels.   There has been an effort on both sides to improve the relationship,  he said.  ",worldnews,"November 20, 2017 ",1

UK Brexit campaign probed over possible breach of campaign finance rules,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain s Electoral Commission has opened an investigation to establish whether Vote Leave Limited, the organization behind the official campaign to leave the European Union, breached campaign finance rules during the 2016 referendum campaign. The commission said on Monday its decision to open an investigation followed a review of previous assessments conducted in February in March, which had resulted in no further action being taken.  Since that time, new information has come to light which, when considered alongside the information obtained previously, has given the Commission reasonable grounds to suspect an offense may have been committed,  it said in a statement.

Greek island on strike in protest against becoming migrant 'prison',"ATHENS (Reuters) - Residents on the Greek island of Lesbos went on strike on Monday to protest against European policies they say have turned it into a  prison  for migrants and refugees. Islanders shut businesses, shops, municipal offices, nurseries and pharmacies and dozens rallied on a central square, calling on the government to transfer asylum-seekers to the mainland.   Lesbos is not a place of exile,  a banner read.  Just a few miles from Turkey s coast, Lesbos has borne the brunt of Europe s migrant crisis. In 2015, nearly a million people - most fleeing Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan - landed on its shores before heading north, mainly to Germany. It is now hosting some 8,500 asylum-seekers in facilities designed to hold fewer than 3,000.  Lesbos is not an open prison, nor will we allow anyone to view it as such,  Mayor Spyros Galinos was quoted as saying by the Athens News Agency. Thousands of asylum-seekers have become stranded on Lesbos and four other islands close to Turkey since the EU agreed a deal with Ankara in March 2016 to shut down the route through Greece. Some have been moved to camps on the mainland, but authorities say the terms of the agreement prevent asylum-seekers from traveling beyond the islands. Rights groups have described conditions in camps across Greece as deplorable and unfit for humans. On Lesbos, violence often breaks out over delays in asylum procedures and poor living standards.  The message (today) was that we can t take it any more,  Galinos said.  Lesbos is in a state of emergency.  ",worldnews,"November 20, 2017 ",1

Belarus KGB says Ukrainian journalist set up spy ring in Minsk,"MINSK (Reuters) - Belarus s KGB state security service said on Monday it had uncovered a spy ring working for the Ukrainian defence ministry that had been set up by a detained Ukrainian radio correspondent. Minsk-based journalist Pavlo Sharoyko was arrested in October and charged with being an undercover intelligence officer, KGB spokesman Dmitry Pobyarzhin said in a briefing.  In Belarus, Sharoyko built a network of agents made up of Belarussian citizens, who carried out his assignments for monetary compensation,  Pobyarzhin said. An adviser to the embassy in Minsk, Ukrainian Ihor Skvortsov, has been declared persona non grata - banned from the country - as he is believed to be Sharoyko s handler, Pobyarzhin said. The Ukrainian defence ministry denied the allegations against Sharoyko who it said had worked as a spokesman for the ministry before switching to journalism in 2009.  The information contained in the (KGB) statement is not true,  it said.  The Ukrainian foreign ministry declined immediate comment. Sharoyko and Skvortsov could not be reached for comment. The case could put further pressure on relations between Minsk and Kiev that were tested earlier this year when Belarus hosted large-scale joint military exercises with Russia. September s Zapad-2017 ( West-2017 ) war games unnerved Ukraine and NATO member states on Europe s eastern flank, which feared the exercises could be a rehearsal or cover for a real offensive.

"North Korean women suffer discrimination, rape, malnutrition: U.N.","GENEVA (Reuters) - North Korean women are deprived of education and job opportunities and are often subjected to violence at home and sexual assault in the workplace, a U.N. human rights panel said on Monday. After a regular review of Pyongyang s record, the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women also voiced concern at rape or mistreatment of women in detention especially those repatriated after fleeing abroad. North Korean women are  under-represented or disadvantaged  in tertiary education, the judiciary, security and police forces and leadership and managerial positions  in all non-traditional areas of work , the panel of independent experts said.  The main issue is first of all the lack of information. We have no access to a large part of laws, elements and information on national machinery,  Nicole Ameline, panel member, told Reuters.  We have asked a lot of questions.  North Korea told the panel on Nov. 8 that it was working to uphold women s rights and gender equality but that sanctions imposed by major powers over its nuclear and missile programs were taking a toll on vulnerable mothers and children. Domestic violence is prevalent and there is  very limited awareness  about the issue and a lack of legal services, psycho-social support and shelters available for victims, the panel said. It said economic sanctions had a disproportionate impact on women. North Korean women suffer  high levels of malnutrition , with 28 percent of pregnant or lactating women affected, it said.      We have called on the government to be very, very attentive to the situation of food and nutrition. Because we consider that it is a basic need and that the government has to invest and to assume its responsibilities in this field,  Ameline said.   Unfortunately I am not sure that the situation will improve very quickly.  The report found that penalties for rape in North Korea were not commensurate with the severity of the crime, which also often goes unpunished. Legal changes in 2012 lowered the penalties for some forms of rape, including the rape of children, rape by a work supervisor and repeated rape. This has led to reducing the punishment for forcing  a woman in a subordinate position  to have sexual intercourse from four years to three years, the report said. It said women trafficked abroad and then returned to North Korea, are reported to be sent to labor training camps or prisons, accused of  illegal border crossing , and may be exposed to further violations of their rights, including sexual violence by security officials and forced abortions.

Gerry Adams to step down in end of an era for Irish nationalism,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Sinn Fein s Gerry Adams, a pivotal figure in the political life of Ireland for almost 50 years, said on Saturday he will step down as party leader and complete a generational shift in the former political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA). Reviled by many as the face of the IRA during its campaign against British rule in Northern Ireland, Adams reinvented himself as a peacemaker in the troubled region and then as a populist opposition parliamentarian in the Irish Republic. Adams said he would be replaced as party president, a position he has held since 1983, at a party conference next year. He would also not stand for reelection to the Irish parliament.  Republicanism has never been stronger... But leadership means knowing when it is time for change. That time is now,  Adams said in an emotional speech to a packed party conference.  I have complete confidence in the next generation of leaders,  he said.  Adams stayed on stage as the 2,500-strong crowd, some in tears, gave him a standing ovation and sang a traditional Irish song about the road home, followed by the national anthem.  Adams will almost certainly hand over to a successor with no direct involvement in the decades of conflict in Northern Ireland, a prospect that would make Sinn Fein a more palatable coalition partner in the Irish Republic where it has never been in power. Deputy leader Mary Lou McDonald, an English literature graduate from Trinity College Dublin who has been at the forefront of a new breed of Sinn Fein politicians transforming the party s image, is the clear favourite to take over. That would mean the left-wing party being led on both sides of the Irish border by women in their 40s after Michelle O Neill succeeded Martin McGuinness as leader in Northern Ireland shortly before the former IRA commander s death in March. Adams, who will turn 70 next October, has always denied membership of the IRA but accusations from former IRA fighters that he was involved in its campaign of killings have dogged him throughout his career.  Adams was a key figure in the nationalist movement throughout the three decades of violence between Catholic militants seeking a united Ireland, mainly Protestant militants who wanted to maintain Northern Ireland s position as a part of Britain, and the British army.  3,600 died in the conflict, many at the hands of the IRA. As head of the political wing of the IRA during its bombing campaigns in 1980s Britain, Adams was a pariah and banned from speaking on British airwaves, forcing television stations to dub his voice with that of an actor. He and his party emerged from the political cold in October 1997 when he shook hands with Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair at their first meeting. A year later, he helped win sceptical elements in the IRA to the Good Friday peace deal, which largely ended the violence. Since the peace deal Adams and McGuinness turned Sinn Fein from a fringe party into the dominant Irish nationalist party in Northern Ireland and the third largest party in south of the border. While its anti-austerity platform led to a six-fold increase in its number of seats in the Republic - 23 out of 158 -  suspicion of Sinn Fein s role in the Northern Ireland troubles still runs deep and the far larger ruling Fine Gael and or main opposition Fianna Fail have ruled out governing alongside them. Analysts say a change of leader could help open the way to Sinn Fein entering government in Dublin for the first time.   Under a new Sinn Fein leader I think anything is possible,  said David Farrell, politics professor at University College Dublin.  A new Sinn Fein leader will also take over responsibility for rescuing power-sharing devolved government in Northern Ireland and avoid a return to full direct rule from London for the first time in decade.  Power-sharing collapsed after Sinn Fein withdrew in January saying the Democratic Unionist Party was not treating it as an equal partner and a series of talks have failed to break the impasse.

Health staff in southern Libya strike after doctor's kidnapping,"BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Medical staff in the southern Libyan city of Sabha said on Monday they were suspending work for 10 days in protest over poor security after a doctor was kidnapped.  Health services in Libya have been severely disrupted by years of conflict with the remote south particularly affected. Salem al-Selhab, who worked in the surgical department of the Sabha Medical Centre, the biggest hospital in southern Libya, was kidnapped by an unknown group on Thursday evening.   For a long time the medical staff of the Sabha Medical Centre have suffered attacks, abuse and been shot at,  said Osama al-Wafi, a spokesman for the center, adding that Selhab s kidnapping was a serious setback.  This doctor was very important,  he said.  Staff at the center and at private clinics in the city announced a 10-day strike on Sunday to demand Selhab s release and the provision of security for medical staff. Sabha is a major hub for the smuggling of migrants toward Libya s northern coast, some of whom seek treatment in local medical facilities.  The Sabha Medical Centre receives 70 percent of its backing from international organizations in the absence of state support from rival governments in Tripoli and the east, said Wafi.   We suffer greatly from a shortage of medicines, political division and lack of support,  he said. The World Health Organization (WHO), one of the international bodies to provide Sabha Medical Centre with support, strongly condemned violence against staff in the area.  WHO urges all to refrain from attacking health workers and facilities, as required by international humanitarian law, and calls upon parties responsible for the kidnapping of the doctor in Sabha to ensure his safety and immediate release,  it said in a statement.

Soros says Hungarian government lying in attacks against him,"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - U.S. financier George Soros on Monday denounced a Hungarian government campaign against him as  distortions and lies  designed to create a false external enemy. Soros, 86, is a Hungarian-born Jew whose longtime support for liberal and open-border values in eastern Europe have put him at odds with right-wing nationalists, in particular the government of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Orban, who faces elections in April 2018, last month sent to voters seven statements attributed to Soros that, among other things, called for the European Union to settle a million migrants a year and pay each of them thousands of euros.  The statements ... contain distortions and outright lies that deliberately mislead Hungarians about George Soros s views on migrants and refugees,  said a statement issued by Soros s Open Society Foundations.  With Hungary s health care and education systems in distress and corruption rife, the current government has sought to create an outside enemy to distract citizens. The government selected George Soros for this purpose,  it said. The ruling Fidesz party s vice chairman said Soros was engaged in a  frontal assault  against Hungary.  What Soros writes about immigration, in general, is a pro-immigration stance that is open about its disdain for the nation state,  Gergely Gulyas told a news conference.  Decisions made in Brussels echo that in the field of immigration policy.   Days before a recent immigration decision in the European Parliament Soros was meeting with the rapporteur on the subject as well as five different EU commissioners. I am not a conspiracy theorist but this holds some clues.  Soros said each of the seven statements was a distortion or lie, refuting them one by one. It said Soros proposed admitting an annual 300,000 refugees to the EU only while strengthening European border controls and making migrant relocations within the bloc voluntary, not mandatory as Budapest asserted. It said Soros proposed no payments to migrants, rather EU subsidies to member states to help them cope with migration. To three other proposals attributed to Soros - that he wanted milder criminal sentences for migrants, to push national cultures and languages into the background to facilitate easier integration of migrants and sanctions against countries that oppose migration, the Open Society statement said,  Nowhere has Soros made any such statement(s). This is a lie.  Orban once received a Soros grant to study at Britain s Oxford University but later turned against the billionaire philanthropist, vilifying him as an alleged mastermind of a global agenda to weaken nation states. The election campaign of Orban s Fidesz party has built on a series of billboards warning Hungarians,  Don t let Soros have the last laugh  and showing a laughing Soros in black and white. Some of the billboards have had  stinking Jew  scrawled on them. The billboards, along with calls from Orban to preserve Hungary s  ethnic homogeneity  and his endorsement of a World Two Hungarian leader who allied with Nazi Germany, drew accusations of anti-Semitism earlier this year. Alluding to the billboards and to Orban s rejection of immigration, especially from Muslim nations, the Open Society Foundations accused Budapest of  stoking anti-Muslim sentiment and employing anti-Semitic tropes reminiscent of the 1930s . Fidesz pulled the billboard campaign just before a July visit to Budapest by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and Orban vowed to fight anti-Semitism. The government has denied its campaign was anti-Semitic, and re-launched the billboards in the autumn in promoting a  national consultation  with voters. Gulyas said it was  outrageous  that Soros called the campaign anti-Semitic. Immigration which Soros supported was bringing hundreds of thousands of people into Europe whose cultural background was inimical to Jewsm he said.  It is not us who should be facing anti-Semitism charges,  he said, adding that Fidesz also had nothing against Muslim culture but was against mass immigration of people with a different cultural background to Hungary s Christian roots.

"UK queen and husband Philip celebrate 70 years of marriage, quietly","LONDON (Reuters) - Queen Elizabeth and husband Prince Philip mark their platinum wedding anniversary with a small family get-together on Monday, a far cry from the pomp and celebration which greeted their marriage 70 years ago. The couple married at London s Westminster Abbey on Nov. 20, 1947, just two years after the end of World War Two, in a glittering ceremony which attracted statesmen and royalty from around the world and huge crowds of cheering well-wishers. Seventy years on, no public events are planned, although the 91-year-old queen did acknowledge the occasion by appointing Philip a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order for his services to the sovereign. Elizabeth and her 96-year-old husband, who retired from active public life in August, will celebrate their milestone with a private party at Windsor Castle, the monarch s home to the west of London. That contrasts with their silver, golden and diamond wedding anniversaries when they attended thanksgiving services at the thousand-year-old Abbey, where the queen was crowned and where her grandson and his wife, William and Kate, were married in 2011. However, the Abbey itself will mark the occasion with a full peal of its bells involving 5,070 change of sequences, with the 70 reflecting the anniversary, which will last more than three hours.  Congratulations to The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh as they celebrate their Platinum Wedding anniversary,  Prime Minister Theresa May said on Twitter.  They have devoted their lives to the service of the UK and the Commonwealth - my best wishes to them both on this special occasion.  The wedding of Princess Elizabeth, as she then was, to the dashing naval officer Philip Mountbatten was seen as raising the nation s spirits amid an austere background of rationing and shortages that followed the war.   Millions will welcome this joyous event as a flash of colour on the hard road we have to travel,  said former Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Five years later, Elizabeth succeeded her father George VI on the throne and has ruled for the following 65 years, more than any other monarch in British history, with Philip by her side throughout.  The support he gives to my grandmother is phenomenal,  Prince Harry said in a documentary to mark her 60th year on the throne.  Regardless of whether my grandfather seems to be doing his own thing, sort of wandering off like a fish down the river, the fact that he s there - I personally don t think that she could do it without him.  While the couple s marriage has remained strong, three of their four children have seen their unions end in divorce, most notably heir Prince Charles s ill-fated union with his late first wife Princess Diana.  He has, quite simply, been my strength and stay all these years,  Elizabeth said in a speech to mark the couple s 50th wedding anniversary in 1997. Royal historian Hugo Vickers said the secret of their long marriage was their mutual support and devotion to duty.  They don t waste a jot of time wondering whether we like them or not - they just get on with the job,  he told Reuters.   On the occasions when I have been lucky enough to see them together, they always look incredibly comfortable in each other s company.  ",worldnews,"November 20, 2017 ",1
Kenya's Supreme Court upholds Kenyatta's presidential win,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya s Supreme Court on Monday upheld the re-election of President Uhuru Kenyatta in last month s repeat presidential vote, paving the way for him to be sworn in next week. Chief Justice David Maraga said all six judges dismissed the two legal challenges to the vote. The opposition coalition NASA insisted the government was illegitimate. Kenyatta s main challenger, NASA s Raila Odinga, said via his adviser Salim Lone that the ruling  did not come as a surprise  and said  it was a decision taken under duress .   We in NASA had repeatedly declared before this Supreme Court ruling today that we consider this government to be illegitimate and do not recognise it. This position has not been changed by the court ruling,  the statement said. It referred to security concerns raised by the opposition about the judges after one of their bodyguards was shot the day before the court was to rule on a request to delay the vote.  The chief justice said at the time police had  enhanced  security after the shooting. The court could not immediately be reached on Monday to comment on NASA s allegation. Monday s ruling clears the way for Kenyatta s swearing-in on Nov. 28, but it is unlikely to end the worst political crisis in East Africa s most developed economy in a decade. Sporadic clashes erupted in pro-opposition areas after the ruling.  Odinga had called for a  National Resistance Movement  after Kenyatta s victory last month. Kenyatta had said he would not engage in dialogue with the opposition until  constitutional options  had been exhausted.  The prolonged election process has disrupted the economy and forced the government to cut its growth forecast. Rights groups say at least 66 people have died in bloodshed surrounding the votes in August and October.     The petitioners had argued that the outcome should be voided because the election board did not seek fresh nominations after the Aug. 8 poll was invalidated, and because the vote was not held in each of the 291 constituencies.  The Supreme Court ordered the Oct. 26 election after nullifying the results of the August election, citing irregularities in the tallying of votes - an unprecedented move on the continent.  The opposition boycotted the poll, which Kenyatta won with 98 percent of the vote. Some opposition supporters mobilised to prevent polls from opening in the west of the country.     The court has unanimously determined that the petitions are not merited,  chief justice Maraga said.  As a consequence, the presidential election of 26th of October is hereby upheld.  The court did not detail its reasons. It said it would issue a full judgment within 21 days.  The decision was met with applause in the courtroom from lawyers for the election commission and Kenyatta. The commission said the ruling affirmed its  resolve and deliberate efforts to conduct free, fair and credible elections . There was no immediate reaction from Kenyatta. Kenya, a U.S. ally in the fight against Islamists and a trade gateway to East Africa, has a history of disputed elections. A row over the 2007 poll, which Odinga challenged after being declared loser, was followed by weeks of ethnic bloodshed that killed more than 1,200 people. Police said on Sunday at least four people were killed overnight in a Nairobi opposition stronghold. [L8N1NP07P]  Odinga accused the government of being behind the killings, which followed at least five deaths on Friday as police tried to disperse opposition supporters. Deputy President William Ruto said action would be taken against those inciting violence. Odinga put the death toll in violence since he returned to Nairobi on Friday from an overseas trip far higher, at 31. The police tally over the same period was nine.  In several areas of the capital, riots broke out on Sunday in response to the deaths, as residents set cars and buses on fire and police responded with teargas.  Outside the Nairobi court, Kenyatta supporters waved Kenyan flags and danced, and celebrations broke out in the central city of Nyeri, a ruling party stronghold, and other cities.  In the western, pro-opposition city of Migori, protesters said one person was killed in skirmishes with the police after the court ruling. Migori county police commander Joseph Nthenge denied the report.  There were no deaths reported from Kisumu, the largest city in western Kenya and a hotbed of opposition support, although police and protesters also briefly clashed there too.  In the Nairobi slum of Kibera, residents said three people were killed on Monday, including a 67-year-old woman and a young man, but there were conflicting reports of who was responsible for the violence. Police spokesman Charles Owino told Reuters that he had no reports of deaths in the capital on Monday.  In downtown Nairobi, Elvis Kinyanjui, a vendor selling socks and watches, said he hoped next year business would be  back to normal .  Everyone is holding on to their shilling not knowing what tomorrow will be like,  he said.  Shares headed higher and the currency strengthened against the dollar after the ruling, traders said. [L8N1NQ1OW] The markets dropped sharply when the court nullified August s vote. ",worldnews,"November 20, 2017 ",1

Italy's 5-Star pummels center-right in Rome beachfront vote,"ROME (Reuters) - Italy s anti-establishment 5-Star Movement pummeled a center-right coalition to govern Ostia, one of Rome s largest neighborhoods, in a run-off vote that confirms the 5-Star s strength months away from a national election. Five-Star s Giuliana Di Pillo took 60 percent of the vote, doubling her first-round result, against 40 percent for the center-right s Monica Picca in a closely watched contest that comes just months before a national election. The result shows the legal troubles that have plagued the administration of Rome s 5-Star mayor, Virginia Raggi, since her election in June of last year have not dampened the maverick party s popularity in the capital.  There is a Raggi effect and it s positive,  Luigi Di Maio, the 5-Star prime minister candidate, wrote on Twitter.  In Rome we continue to win even against a coalition of five center-right forces.  The 5-Star is Italy s most-popular party ahead of a national vote due between March and May, while the ruling Democratic Party (PD) is a distant second, a poll showed last week.  But a center-right alliance joining Silvio Berlusconi s Forza Italia (Go Italy!), the anti-immigration Northern League and the far-right Brothers of Italy would pull in the most votes, though it would fall short of a parliamentary majority. The PD failed to make it to Ostia s run-off and the turnout was just 34 percent. The previous center-left administration for the capital s seaside borough, which has more than 230,000 inhabitants, was dissolved two years ago after police said it had fallen under the influence of organized crime. This year s campaign was marred by alleged connections between the neo-fascist Casapound party, which won more than 9 percent in the first round and will have a seat on the local council, and organized crime. Ten days before the runoff, Robert Spada, a brother of an imprisoned mobster, attacked a journalist for RAI state TV who had gone to ask questions about Spada s open support for Casapound.  Italian organized crime groups have long sought control of local governments, and some 450 municipal administrations of different political stripes have been dissolved for mafia infiltration over the past quarter century.

North Korean foreign minister heads to Cuba,"HAVANA (Reuters) - North Korea s foreign minister will arrive in Cuba on Monday, in search of support amid unprecedented pressure from the United States and the international community to cease its nuclear weapons and missile programs. The Cuban foreign ministry, in a brief note on its web page, said Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho would meet with his Cuban counterpart Bruno Rodriguez, among other unspecified activities. North Korea is pursuing nuclear weapon and missile programs in defiance of U.N. Security Council sanctions and has made no secret of its plans to develop a missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland. It has fired two missiles over Japan. Cuba and North Korea have maintained warm political relations since 1960, despite Havana s often-stated opposition to nuclear weapons. President Donald Trump has also increased pressure on Cuba since taking office, rolling back a fragile detente begun by predecessor Barack Obama and returning to the hostile rhetoric of the Cold War. The visit provides an opportunity for North Korea to demonstrate, just 90 miles from the United States, that it is not completely isolated, and for Cuba that it will not buckle under U.S. pressure. At the same time, diplomats said Cuba was one of the few countries that might be able to convince North Korea to move away from the current showdown with the United States that threatens war.  We often ask the Cubans if they can talk to them,  an Asian diplomat said. The two Communist-run countries are the last in the world to maintain Soviet-style command economies, though under President Raul Castro, the Caribbean nation has taken some small steps toward the more market-oriented communism of China and Vietnam. Cuba maintains an embassy in North Korea, but publicly trades almost exclusively with the South. Last year, trade with the latter was $67 million and with the North just $9 million, according to the Cuban government. However, in 2013, Panama discovered a load of Soviet vintage weapons hidden under 10,000 tonnes of Cuban sugar on a North Korean vessel, in violation of U.N. sanctions and appearing to confirm suspicions that the two countries worked together to circumvent them. Cuba claimed the weapons were going to North Korea for repairs and were to be sent back. ",worldnews,"November 20, 2017 ",1

Lebanon's president rejects terrorism suggestion,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - The Lebanese president appeared to defend Hezbollah as necessary to resist Israel on Monday, after an Arab League statement accused the group of terrorism and noted it is part of Lebanon s coalition government.   Israeli targeting still continues and it is the right of the Lebanese to resist it and foil its plans by all available means,  President Michel Aoun s office quoted him as saying in a Tweet.  The heavily armed Shi ite Muslim Hezbollah, formed by Iran s Revolutionary Guards, fought Israel s occupation of Lebanon in the early 1980s and says its weapons are still needed against Israel.  Saudi Arabia, a regional rival of Iran, opposes Hezbollah s role as a military force in Syria and has accused it of helping the Houthi group in Yemen and militants in Bahrain.      The Arab League met on Sunday to discuss what it called Iranian interference in Arab countries, and accused Tehran s ally Hezbollah of terrorism.  Aoun said that Lebanon could not accept suggestions that its government was a partner in acts of terrorism, another Tweet quoted him as saying after meeting Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Aboul Gheit in Beirut.  Aboul Gheit said in Beirut that nobody was accusing Lebanon s government of terrorism or wanted to harm Lebanon.   One of the ruling partners is accused of this...It is an indirect means of asking the Lebanese state to talk to this partner and convince them to restrain their acts on Arab land,  he said.  Everyone acknowledges the particularity of the Lebanese situation.   Lebanon faces a political crisis after its prime minister Saad al-Hariri suddenly resigned on Nov. 4 in a statement broadcast from Saudi Arabia. His resignation statement accused Iran and Hezbollah of  sowing strife  in Arab countries.  ",worldnews,"November 20, 2017 ",1

Fifteen dead in food aid stampede in Morocco: ministry,"RABAT (Reuters) - Fifteen people were killed and five more injured when a stampede broke out in a southwestern Moroccan town on Sunday as food aid was being distributed in a market, the Interior Ministry said. A hospital source put the death toll at 18, adding that most victims were women who had been scrambling for food handed out by a rich man in the small coastal town of Sidi Boulaalam. A local journalist said the donor had organised similar handouts before, but this year some 1,000 people arrived, storming an iron barrier under which several women were crushed.  King Mohammed ordered that the victims  families be given any assistance they needed and the wounded treated at his cost, the ministry said in a statement, adding that a criminal investigation had been opened. Last month, the king dismissed the ministers of education, planning and housing and health after an economic agency found  imbalances  in implementing a development plan to fight poverty in the northern Rif region. The Rif saw numerous protests after a fishmonger was accidentally crushed to death in a garbage truck in October 2016 after a confrontation with police, and he became a symbol of the effects of corruption and official abuse. In July, the king pardoned dozens of people arrested in the protests and accused local officials of stoking public anger by being too slow to implement development projects.

German coalition talks collapse is 'bad news for Europe': Dutch minister,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The collapse of German Chancellor Angela Merkel s talks to form a three-way coalition government is  bad news for Europe  given the leading role of the European Union s biggest member state, the Dutch foreign minister said on Monday.  Germany s political crisis was weighing on the euro and European shares after the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) unexpectedly pulled out on Sunday from weeks of talks with Merkel s conservatives and the ecologist Greens.  It s bad news for Europe that the government in Germany will take a little longer,  new Dutch Foreign Minister Halbe Zijlstra said on arrival for talks with EU peers in Brussels.  Germany is a very influential country within the EU so if they don t have a government and therefore don t have a mandate it ll be very hard for them to take positions.  Germany s outgoing EU Minister Michael Roth, a member of the Social Democrats who are not in talks on forming a new Merkel government, said:  We all have an interest in getting a mandate so that we are able to take care fully of business in Europe.   We have never had such a situation in Germany. So, given the collapse of these exploratory talks, we will need to assess the situation and decide accordingly.  The spokesman for the EU s executive arm in Brussels stressed the need for stability in Germany, as did an official in French President Emmanuel Macron s office.  We are confident that the German constitutional process will provide the basis for the stability and continuity that has been a trademark of German politics and we hope this time will not be different,  said the European Commission s Margaritis Schinas. While some in Germany spoke of a possible new election, Zijlstra said that was a bad idea and noted that the Dutch government took seven months to form, which meant German parties could still return to talks after a pause. Foreign Minister Didier Reynders of Belgium, which was without a government for 18 months after an election, sought to strike a lighter tone on Germany.  In Belgium we have a tradition to do that, sometimes it s very long,  Reynders told reporters. Zijlstra did not think the situation in Germany affected the Brexit talks specifically for now, as the EU was  waiting for a substantial offer from the British  on the exit bill. Both Roth and Reynders agreed London must make a move on the money now. Arriving at the same talks, the Czech Republic s EU minister, Ales Chmelar, said:  We are hopeful that we will have a strong government in Germany sooner rather than later.

Germany's SPD not available for government after talks fail,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany s Social Democrats are still not available to join Chancellor Angela Merkel s Christian Democrats in a continuation of their  grand coalition  government after talks with other parties failed, a party document showed on Monday.  Given the results of the Sept. 24 election, we are not available for entry into a grand coalition,  read a SPD paper due to be discussed by party leaders that was obtained by Reuters.  We are not afraid of new elections.  The comments came after Merkel s efforts to form a three-way coalition government failed, pitching Germany into its worse political crisis for decades, raising the prospect of fresh elections and casting doubt over her future. The SPD won just 20.5 percent in the September election, its worst post-war result after it lost stature as junior partner in the often awkward coalition dominated by Merkel.

What happens now after collapse of German coalition talks?,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel s failure to forge a three-way coalition government has plunged Europe s largest economy into uncharted waters, raising pressure on the three-term conservative chancellor to maintain stability. The pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) abruptly pulled out after more than four weeks of negotiations with Merkel s conservative bloc and the ecologist Greens, citing irreconcilable differences. The euro recovered from a two-month low on Monday as investors brushed off the broader political risks. But Germany now faces a prolonged period of political wrangling and uncertainty. The path to a new election would be difficult and involve more than one vote in parliament. Many fear a new election could further strengthen the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party that surged into parliament in the Sept. 24 election after winning nearly 13 percent of the vote. AfD leaders have pushed for new elections for weeks as the coalition talks failed to reach agreement. Current opinion polls predict little change compared to the September vote. A Forsa poll released last week showed conservatives on 32 percent, the Social Democrats on 20 percent, the FDP 12 percent, the Greens 10 percent and the AfD 12 percent. It was not immediately clear what impact the latest development would have on the parties  support. Leaders of the other parties expressed shock about the FDP s move since negotiators had been on the cusp of an agreement. The Greens accused the FDP of a pre-meditated move to oust Merkel. Here s what could happen next, and possible scenarios for the coming weeks: The political crisis hands significant power to German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, a member of the Social Democrats (SPD) and a former foreign minister under Merkel who assumed the normally ceremonial post in February. Merkel was to meet with Steinmeier on Monday to discuss the most serious political crisis to confront Germany in the post-war era.  Steinmeier had already urged negotiators on Saturday to uphold their civic responsibilities and avoid new elections. He is expected to repeat that message in a statement later Monday, according to the RND newspaper chain. Steinmeier could push the FDP and its leader Christian Lindner to return to the negotiating table. But political experts say it would be difficult to rebuild any sense of trust among the would-be coalition partners after Sunday s events. MERKEL LOOKS INTO CONTINUATION OF  GRAND COALITION  Merkel is likely to approach the SPD, which served for four years as junior partner in her  grand coalition , but SPD leaders have vowed to return to opposition after the party s worst election result since 1933. Labour Minister Andrea Nahles reaffirmed that view in an interview with broadcaster ZDF on Monday, saying voters had clearly voted against a further tie-up of Germany s two largest parties. If they agreed to talks, the SPD - which saw its support slide in the September election after it lost stature as junior partner in the often awkward coalition dominated by Merkel - would probably insist on her departure, according to party insiders.  The SPD is in a much stronger negotiating position now,  said Tyson Barker at the Aspen Institute.  But I just don t see the incentives there for the SPD. The grand coalition is just teetering on a majority.  If coalition talks fail, the only way to trigger a new election under the German constitution would be for Steinmeier to suggest a parliamentary vote on Merkel as chancellor. If Merkel wins a majority in such a vote, he would name her as chancellor. If she doesn t raise a majority, parliament can vote again within 14 days.  If she again misses the majority, parliament votes again and the candidate with the most votes wins. Then Steinmeier could name Merkel - or whoever wins the most votes - as chancellor, but is not required to do so. If he refrains, he would dissolve parliament and new elections must be held within 60 days. If she is elected as chancellor, Merkel could form a minority government with a variety of partners, including just the Christian Social Union (CSU), the Bavarian sister party of her Christian Democrats, or among conservatives with the FDP. She could also form a minority coalition with the Greens. Juergen Hardt, foreign policy spokesman for the conservative bloc, said such a tie-up was promising and could convince Steinmeier to agree to a minority government. A minority government would require Merkel to find changing majorities for her policies, but it would allow the smaller parties to maintain an independent profile, said Christian Odendahl, chief economist at the Centre for European Reform.  He said that could be helpful for the CSU, which has said it needs to pursue a more hardline position on immigration and security as it gears up for state elections in September 2018, given massive losses to the far-right AfD on Sept. 24.

"Australia, NZ officials discuss screening for Manus refugees - NZ PM","WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand and Australia have begun talks about screening procedures for asylum seekers holding out in a Papua New Guinea detention center, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Monday, amid reports of worsening health conditions there. Australia has been refusing New Zealand s offer to take up to 150 of the detainees from the Australian-run camp on Manus Island, but Ardern s comments have raised speculation that Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is ready to accept.  The center was closed almost three weeks ago after PNG s High Court ruled it was illegal, but more than 400 detainees have refused to leave, citing concerns for their security if they were moved to transit centers as planned. More than 150 men at the center were seriously ill without access to basic first aid or medicine, said advocacy group Asylum Seeker Resource Centre (ASRC), which is calling for safe resettlement of the men.  A team from the group, which is based in Australia, visited the center last Wednesday, a spokeswoman said.  The deteriorating state of the men s bodies was obvious to me as I was shown around,  said Jana Favero, the group s campaigns director.  This is a medical emergency festering inside a humanitarian crisis.    Medical conditions requiring urgent care ranged from chest pain and undiagnosed episodes of unconsciousness to infections and chronic diarrhea among others, the group added. Turnbull has been refusing New Zealand s offer as he worries asylum seekers could view it as a  back door  to Australia, undermining the country s tough immigration policies.  Ardern said the conversations were about establishing the screening processes.   To be clear, we have not started that process,  she told Radio New Zealand.  But I think that certainly we re a bit further along than we have been before - we haven t even had officials having those discussions in the past.  The United Nations, which has warned of a  looming humanitarian crisis , last week urged Australia to accept New Zealand s offer to take the men.  Turnbull has insisted the priority was an existing refugee swap deal negotiated last year with former U.S. president Barack Obama. The men holed up in the camp depend on erratic food supplies smuggled in by supporters. They lack power and running water.  Australia s  sovereign borders  immigration policy that  refuses to let asylum seekers arriving by boat reach its shores has been heavily criticized by the United Nations and human rights groups, but has bipartisan domestic political support.

Cambodia's opposition gives up posts after ban,"PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Elected officials of Cambodia s banned opposition party have begun handing over their duties after a court ordered the party dissolved, the government said on Monday. The Supreme Court outlawed the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) last week at the request of authoritarian Prime Minister Hun Sen s government in a move that prompted the United States to cut election funding and threaten more punitive steps. The party was banned after its leader, Kem Sokha, was arrested for alleged treason. The government says he sought to take power with American help. He rejects that allegation as politically motivated, to allow Hun Sen to extend his more than three decades in power in next year s general election. Among those told to give up their positions were councillors elected to communes in June, when the CNRP gained control of 40 percent of local councils, showing the electoral threat it posed to Hun Sen.  The implementation has been going smoothly,  the Interior Ministry s spokesman, Khieu Sopheak, told Reuters on Monday, adding that he did not know how long handover completion would take. The ruling Cambodian People s Party (CPP) will take over nearly all of the communes won by the opposition. The CNRP s 55 seats in the 123-member parliament will be shared among six minor parties, the National Election Committee (NEC) said. It had been unable to contact one of the parties entitled to a seat because its headquarters was shut, it added. Three NEC members submitted a letter of resignation from the electoral body in protest at their party s dissolution, saying the redistribution of seats to other parties was  unconstitutional  and against  voters  will . The court has also banned 118 CNRP party members from politics for five years. Mu Sochua, a senior CNRP member who moved abroad shortly before the ban, said party officials met over the weekend outside Cambodia  to put together an action plan for the immediate future.    We reject the decision of the court,  she said, adding that Kem Sokha remained president and the party s former leader, Sam Rainsy, had rejoined it. Sam Rainsy had resigned in February, saying he feared the party would be banned if he did not, because of defamation convictions that he calls politically motivated and which pushed him to flee Cambodia in 2015. Across Cambodia, police took down CNRP signs outside party offices and on the streets. The interior ministry spokesman said the CNRP had helped by taking down its Phnom Penh headquarters sign itself. Rejecting the criticism from the United States over the dissolution of the opposition party and a crackdown on local rights groups and independent media, Hun Sen said on Sunday that Washington should cut off all aid for Cambodia.

"Pinera wins first round of Chile election, faces runoff","SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Conservative billionaire Sebastian Pinera will face center-left Senator Alejandro Guillier in a runoff for Chile s presidency next month, after a first round vote on Sunday that Pinera won, but with fewer votes than expected. Both candidates would keep in place the top copper exporter s longstanding free-market economic model, but former president Pinera has promised investor-friendly policies to turbocharge growth, while Guillier wants to press on with outgoing President Michelle Bachelet s overhaul of education, taxes and labor. With over 98 percent of votes counted, Pinera, a 67-year-old businessman, had clinched 36.6 percent, falling short of the 50 percent needed for an outright victory, Chile s electoral agency Servel said. Guillier, a 64-year-old bearded former TV news anchor elected to the Senate in 2013, had 22.7 percent, just over two points ahead of the third placed candidate, leftist Beatriz Sanchez, whose better than expected showing will likely ensure her Frente Amplio coalition will yield sway in Congress. Pinera s result was below pollster expectations, indicating that the Dec. 17 runoff will likely be a more closely-fought contest than previously forecast, especially if Guillier can rally supporters of Sanchez and four other left-leaning rivals behind him.      We re going to have a very competitive second round,  Pinera s campaign chief Andres Chadwick told journalists on Sunday evening. The most recent opinion survey by CEP last month had forecast Pinera securing 42 percent of likely votes in the first round, and easily defeating Guillier in the runoff. After a divisive race, Guillier called for  profound unity  to unite Chile s fractured left against Pinera.  There are more of us, and therefore we must win in December!,  Guillier told his cheering supporters.  Sanchez did not endorse Guillier in a fiery speech before her followers, even as she pilloried his opponent.  Sebastian Pinera is a step backward for the country and the country is going in a different direction!  Sanchez said. But Pinera, who previously led Chile between 2010 and 2014, flashed the optimism he has shown on the campaign trail, where he has repeatedly plugged his campaign slogan  better times.   This result is very similar to the one in 2009. And you ll remember that in 2009 we won the election,  Pinera said, before a buoyant crowd. Voter turnout was higher than expected, a factor which analysts forecast will count against Pinera if repeated in a runoff. Bachelet cannot run again this year because of term limits. Guillier was one of two candidates her center-left coalition Nueva Mayoria backed in the first round. Speaking from the presidential palace on Sunday evening, she urged Chileans to vote in December, saying her policy changes were at stake. Guillier faces a more polished opponent in Pinera, who oversaw robust economic growth in his first presidential term that overlapped with higher copper prices.     Pinera has vowed to double Chile s economic growth rate, with proposals that include trimming corporate taxes, making state-run miner Codelco more self-sufficient, and tweaking the pension system to include incentives for later retirement. But he must ease fears that he would wipe out gains made in Bachelet s government for students, women and workers - from expanding free education to strengthening unions. Should Guillier triumph in the runoff, he has pledged to tackle stubbornly high inequality in one of Latin America s most business-friendly economies. He wants to diversify Chile s dependence on copper, increase access to free higher education and write workers  rights into a new constitution.  I voted for Guillier because I think we have to continue to provide free education. It s a social right,  said unemployed voter Mario Giannetti, 53. Since its transition to democracy from dictatorship in 1990, Chile has stood out as one of the region s most developed countries. But public debt has grown as lower copper prices hit government revenues in recent years, and Bachelet s critics say she failed to court investments or prioritize economic growth that slowed to an annual average of 1.8 percent. In a first since the 1990s, credit ratings agencies Fitch and S&P downgraded Chile s debt rating this year. While investors see Pinera as a safe pair hands for the economy, his previous term was marred by massive student protests seeking an education overhaul. His responses were often seen as out of touch and grassroots groups still oppose him. Early on Sunday, a group of young protesters stormed Pinera s campaign headquarters before being arrested by police, TV images showed. ",worldnews,"November 19, 2017 ",1

Greece to give millions in compensation to flood victims,"ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece said on Monday it would offer emergency compensation worth millions of euros to hundreds of households affected by flash flooding west of Athens that killed at least 20 people on Nov. 15. Hundreds of homes and businesses were extensively damaged in the coastal towns of Mandra and Nea Peramos when a torrent of mud and water smashed into the settlements, built along dry gullies on the foothills of a mountain range. Twenty people died and two remain missing from the early-morning deluge, the worst casualty toll from flooding since 1977 when more than 30 people died. The disaster has prompted recriminations and finger-pointing over a perceived inability of Greek authorities to act on prior warnings that areas with poor infrastructure and unlicensed construction were vulnerable to flooding. Critics also asked why flood prevention projects had been delayed. Authorities will offer flood victims up to 5,000 euros  ($5,896.50) for households and 8,000 euros for businesses, government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos said. It was not immediately clear how much the state had budgeted for compensation. Tzanakopoulos told Reuters the amount would come from the national budget. That assistance would be over and above compensation residents were entitled to, comprised of 60 percent government aid and 40 percent interest-free loan, he said. The flash flooding hit many areas of the country, including housing settlements where town planning regulations are often flouted.       ",worldnews,"November 20, 2017 ",1

Putin plan to rejuvenate Russian politics makes slow progress,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Poised to run for a fourth term, President Vladimir Putin has started clearing out the old Russian political elite and says he s bringing in young people with  fire in their eyes.   But a Reuters analysis shows that he has made limited progress so far.  In the run up to March elections that are expected to hand him a mandate to stay in power until he is 70, Putin says he is promoting a new generation of officials to drive Russia s economic and political future. One fifth of the country s 85 regional governors have been replaced this year and almost half of the lower house of  parliament changed in elections last year after Putin brought in a new chief of staff. The Reuters analysis of political appointments shows, however, that in the cabinet, the upper house of parliament, the Security Council and the presidential administration, the pace of change has slowed and the average age is almost three years higher than when he began his third term in 2012. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment on the findings. He said it would take too long to check the data.  With no change expected at the very top, critics say the lack of fresh blood translates into a dearth of fresh ideas to stimulate politics and the economy.  There are similarities with the era of (Soviet leader Leonid) Brezhnev in that we ve fallen into a malign stability from which there s no way out,  Dmitry Oreshkin, an independent political analyst, told Reuters. Opposition protesters are fond of photoshopping Putin s face onto Brezhnev s torso on placards, implying that Putin and the system he has built is as stagnant as Brezhnev s Soviet Union, a charge the Kremlin rejects.  For Putin there are no risks because the system works and obeys him,  said Oreshkin.  The risks are for the country and the economy. The model of stability is underpinned by a system of loyalty and corruption. Outside Moscow, which is rich, there is stagnation.        Weighed down by Western sanctions for its 2014 annexation of Ukraine s Crimea and backing for a pro-Russian uprising in east Ukraine, the Russian economy, though recovering, remains fragile and vulnerable to oil fluctuations and new sanctions. Russia's aging political elite: tmsnrt.rs/2zRTpRY Reuters compared the profiles of 784 current regional governors, members of the upper and lower houses of parliament, the government, the Security Council, and the presidential administration   to 768 who were in power in May 2012. It found little sign of renewal in the cabinet, the upper house of parliament, the Security Council and the presidential administration.  Of the 784 positions, 314 had changed hands in the last two years, fewer than in May 2012 when that figure was 368. Often when officials left their posts, they showed up in other jobs.   There were fewer changes in the cabinet, the upper house of parliament, the Security Council and the presidential administration. The average age of all the officials rose from 52.6 in 2012 to 55.5 now. In the Security Council, which Putin chairs, the average age stands at 60.4. It has seen only two changes in its 12-strong permanent makeup in the last two years.  In the presidential administration, which Putin uses to devise and implement his ideas, the average age is 57 compared to 53.2 in 2012, and in the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, the average age has risen to almost 53 from 51 five years ago. This month Putin told 10 governors, that  as a rule  they were being replaced with  young people.   You have probably noticed the fire in their eyes,  he said. Putin has said his aim is to create  a new governors corps of young promising modern people who will think about the future of the region and all of Russia.   Critics say the Kremlin s emphasis on youth is window-dressing designed to create the illusion of political change in a system bereft of real competition. Up to two thirds of Russians want some kind of societal or political change that would raise living standards, some opinion polls show, and turnout in last year s parliamentary election fell to a post-Soviet low.         In the Kremlin, the thinking goes that a fresh face in the governor s seat may reduce the population s unhappiness and increase turnout in the election,  Natalya Zubarevich, an academic, wrote in a paper for the Carnegie Moscow Center. Putin has received a succession of newly-minted regional governors in his Kremlin office live on state TV and hosted two groups of glum-looking ex-governors.  Rotation is a natural and self-evident process,  he told one group of five ex-governors in February. Putin s aides are also touting a program for new leaders.  Applicants must be under 50 years of age and parts of the 9-month training program for top regional officials emphasize fitness and courage. Videos leaked to the RBC online news portal have shown participants leaping from a cliff into a river seven meters below and undergoing weapons and parachute training.     Some Kremlin watchers say the newcomers are all Putin loyalists whom he can easily influence if he exits office in 2024 and assumes a father-of-the-nation role.  He s training up 30- and 40-year olds for whom he ll become a political father,  Sergei Dorenko, the prominent head of a Moscow radio station, told the Komsomolskaya Pravda daily.  He ll smooth their passage and give them the earth.  ",worldnews,"November 20, 2017 ",1

Security Council sanctions and has made no secret of its plans to develop a missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland. It has fired two missiles over Japan. The reclusive state appears to have carried out a recent missile engine test while brisk movements of vehicles were spotted near known missile facilities, Yi Wan-young, a member of South Korea s parliamentary intelligence committee which was briefed by Seoul s National Intelligence Service, said.  No sign of an imminent nuclear test had been detected, Yi noted. The third tunnel at the Punggye-ri complex remained ready for another detonation  at any time , while construction had recently resumed at a fourth tunnel, making it out of use for the time being.   The agency is closely following the developments because there is a possibility that North Korea could fire an array of ballistic missiles this year under the name of a satellite launch and peaceful development of space, but in fact to ratchet up its threats against the United States,  the lawmakers told reporters after a closed-door briefing by the spy agency. North Korea defends its weapons programs as a necessary defense against U.S. plans to invade. The United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean war, denies any such intention. Pyongyang is also carrying out a sweeping ideological scrutiny of the political unit of the military for the first time in 20 years, according to Kim Byung-kee, another lawmaker in the committee.  The probe was led by the ruling Workers  Party s Organisation and Guidance Department and orchestrated by Choe Ryong Hae, who once headed the General Political Bureau of the Korean People s Army himself until he was replaced by Hwang Pyong So in May 2014.  As a result, Hwang and Kim Won Hong, who Seoul s unification ministry said was removed from office in mid-January as minister of the Stasi-like secret police called  bowibu , had been punished, the lawmaker said. He did not elaborate.  Choe, who was subjected to political  reeducation  himself in the past, appears to be gaining more influence since he was promoted in October to the party s powerful Central Military Commission.  The National Intelligence Service indicated that Choe now heads the Organisation and Guidance Department, a secretive body that oversees appointments within North Korea s leadership.   Under Choe s command, the Organisation and Guidance Department is undertaking an inspection of the military politburo for the first time in 20 years, taking issue with their impure attitude toward the party leadership,  the lawmaker, Kim, said.  Separately on Monday, South Korea approved a request by a South Korean to attend an event in the North marking the anniversary of the death of his mother who formerly led the Chondoist Chongu Party, a minor North Korean political party. The son, identified only by his surname Choi, will be the first South Korean to visit the North since liberal President Moon Jae-in took office in May.  He is scheduled to arrive in Pyongyang via China on Wednesday and return on Saturday, according to Seoul s unification ministry. A senior Chinese official wrapped up a four-day visit to North Korea on Monday, apparently without meeting the country s leader, Kim Jong Un. Song Tao, head of the international department of the Chinese Communist Party, met senior officials from the Workers Party of Korea and  exchanged views on the Korean peninsula issue , China s official Xinhua news agency said.  The ruling parties of China and the Democratic People s Republic of Korea on Monday pledged to strengthen inter-party exchanges and coordination, and push forward relations,  it added, using North Korea s official name. Song had been in Pyongyang to discuss the outcome of the recently concluded Chinese Communist Party Congress in Beijing. ",worldnews,"November 20, 2017 ",1
Turkey detains 51 teachers over suspected links to coup: Dogan,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish authorities on Monday issued arrest warrants for 107 teachers for suspected ties to the U.S.-based cleric Ankara blames for orchestrating last year s coup, the Dogan news agency said. Fifty-one of the teachers were detained in Ankara after the local prosecutor issued the warrants, Dogan said, adding that operations continued to round-up the remaining teachers.  The teachers were previously suspended from their jobs as part of the ongoing crackdown that followed the attempted coup in July 2016, it said. Turkey blames Fethullah Gulen, a cleric who has lived in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since 1999, for last year s failed coup. Gulen has denied any involvement and denounced the coup. More than 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial in the crackdown, while 150,000 people, including military personnel, teachers and public servants, have been sacked or suspended from their jobs. The government dismisses rights groups  concerns about the crackdown, saying only such a purge could neutralize the threat represented by Gulen s network, which it says infiltrated the judiciary, army, schools and other institutions.

Clamor for justice: Yugoslav court leaves global legacy,"BELGRADE (Reuters) - When a court on the Dutch North Sea coast issues its final verdict this week, it will signal the end of an experiment that has reverberated around the world, from the killing fields of Rwanda to the CIA s secret cells in Europe. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), set up by the United Nations in 1993, marked the biggest leap in the field of international criminal law since the Allies tried the Nazis in Nuremberg. Created in answer to the worst war crimes in Europe since World War Two, it set a precedent of accountability that has since put the Khmer Rouge and Liberia s Charles Taylor in the dock and paved the way for a court with global ambition. Almost 25 years later, its legacy is under threat. The International Criminal Court (ICC), opened in 2002, is undermined by renewed West-Russia rivalry, stone-walling and revolt in Africa, barrel bombs in Syria and a boycott by three of five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. Supporters of the Yugoslav tribunal say it will remain a beacon inspiring a growing demand for justice and creativeness in delivering it   from ad hoc tribunals in Africa to the conviction in one country of a dictator from another and that of a Syrian in Sweden after a post on Facebook. The glass is either half full or half empty, said Alex Whiting, professor of practice at Harvard Law School.  You can say we haven t come far enough and the new institutions, particularly the ICC, have not replicated the success of the ICTY, but you can just as easily say it s remarkable how far we ve come in just 25 years,  he said.  The ICTY is the North Star.  The Yugoslav tribunal owes a debt to history, born as it was between the end of the Cold War and the 9/11 attacks on the United States, when Russia was weak and the West was united in collective action. For decades before, conflicts from Vietnam to Algeria, Afghanistan to Sri Lanka escaped major judicial scrutiny. Backed by the arrest-power of Western peacekeepers and the readiness of the European Union to condition integration with Yugoslavia s successor states on their cooperation, the tribunal issued 161 indictments and secured 83 convictions. Wednesday s verdict in the trial of Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic will be its last, bar appeals. The Yugoslav court was the first to indict a sitting head of state in Serbia s Slobodan Milosevic, recognized sexual violence as a crime of war and advanced the definition of genocide. With the U.N. tribunal for Rwanda, it assembled the hybrid case law used by tribunals in Sierra Leone, Cambodia, Lebanon and ultimately the ICC. Its 2.5 million pages of transcripts offer a forensic and often harrowing account of a state s dissolution that dispels the fog of wartime propaganda. More than 4,500 witnesses took the stand.  I committed myself to speak on behalf of those who did not survive,  said Nusreta Sivac, a former judge in Bosnia who testified to her rape by Bosnian Serb captors.  The tribunal rulings will write history.  Detractors say the court was slow, expensive and damaged by a number of high-profile acquittals. Milosevic died in 2006 while still on trial, while some cases were plagued by witness intimidation. The tribunal was supposed to help with reconciliation, but revisionism is rife and convicted war criminals often feted as heroes. Critics argue the indictment of Milosevic, at the height of NATO air strikes against him, only complicated the conflict and encouraged him to cling on, which he did for another 17 months. Similar arguments have been made against the ICC s pursuit of some African leaders. Established by treaty and boycotted by the United States, China and Russia, the ICC has little of the clout of the ICTY. With only one Arab member, it has found the bulk of its work in Africa. Alleging bias, Burundi quit the court last month. Kenya and South Africa have threatened to follow. The court s credibility has already been tested by the collapse in 2014 of a case against Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta and Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir s eight-year evasion of arrest. Most glaring is its impotence in the face of nearly half a million dead in Syria, its hands tied by Russian and Chinese vetoes in the Security Council, which can refer a case to the court in a non-member state such as Syria. The ICC denies any bias against Africa and is at various stages of investigation in Georgia, Iraq, Ukraine, Colombia and Palestine, though it can expect to make little progress in investigating conflicts involving Russia or the United States. In a watershed moment, prosecutors this month called for a formal investigation into war crimes in Afghanistan, including the mistreatment of detainees by U.S. forces in the country and at CIA  dark sites  in Poland, Romania and Lithuania. Experts say the move is symbolic of the court s ambition, but also of its limitations, given the unlikelihood of any cooperation from the Trump administration. The Yugoslav tribunal demonstrated that,  with strong political and diplomatic support from the international community, justice can be achieved , its chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz told Reuters.  But without that support, the obstacles can be almost insurmountable.  Kevin Jon Heller, law professor at the University of Amsterdam, said of the ICC:  I strongly doubt it is ever going to fulfill the aspirations of the people in the states that created it.  Nevertheless, demands for accountability are multiplying, along with avenues to pursue them. Experts point to the 2016 conviction of Chad ex-dictator, Hissene Habre, in a Senegalese court, the first time universal jurisdiction was used to prosecute the former ruler of one country by a court in another for human rights crimes. The same principle saw a Syrian soldier convicted by a Swedish court last month, partly on the basis of social media posts, while authorities in Sweden and Germany are each investigating more than a dozen individuals for crimes in Syria and Iraq. With the Security Council paralyzed, the U.N. General Assembly has launched its own ad hoc mechanism to investigate war crimes in Syria. A hybrid tribunal is in the works in Central African Republic and another mooted for South Sudan.  What has not ebbed in the last five to seven years, and in fact what has only increased, is the demand for justice, and an expectation that it will translate into action,  said Param-Preet Singh, an associate director at Human Rights Watch. The ICTY and efforts since have  changed the conversation , said Whiting.  It is for that reason this project will never die,  he said.  It will go into dormancy, but it will never die.

"China draws three-stage path for Myanmar, Bangladesh to resolve Rohingya crisis","NAYPYITAW (Reuters) - China called for a ceasefire in Myanmar s Rakhine State so that Rohingya Muslim refugees can return from Bangladesh, proposing a  three-stage approach to the crisis as diplomats from 51 mostly Asian and European countries gathered in Myanmar on Monday. More than 600,000 Muslim Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh since late August, driven out by a military clearance operation in Buddhist majority Myanmar s Rakhine State. Amid a burgeoning humanitarian catastrophe, rights groups have accused the Myanmar military of atrocities, while foreign critics have blasted Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel peace prize winner who leads a civilian administration that is less than two years old, for failing to speak out more strongly. On Monday, Suu Kyi opened an Asia-Europe Meeting for foreign ministers that had been scheduled in Myanmar before the outbreak of the crisis. Speaking in the capital of Naypyitaw on Sunday, having arrived from Dhaka, China s Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China believed Myanmar and Bangladesh could work out a mutually acceptable way to end the crisis.  The first phase is to effect a ceasefire on the ground, to return to stability and order, so the people can enjoy peace and no longer be forced to flee,  China s foreign ministry said in a statement, citing Wang.  With the hard work of all sides, at present, the first phase s aim has already basically been achieved, and the key is to prevent a flare-up, especially that there is no rekindling the flames of war.  During a meeting on Sunday, the ministry said, Wang told Myanmar President Htin Kyaw,  As a friend of both Myanmar and Bangladesh, China is willing to keep playing a constructive role for the appropriate handling of the Rakhine State issue.   Visiting Myanmar last week, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson made many of the same points, but he also called for a credible investigation into reports of atrocities. Once a ceasefire is seen to be working, Wang said talks between Myanmar and Bangladesh should find a workable solution for the return of refugees, and the final phase should be to work toward a long-term solution based on poverty alleviation. Myanmar and Bangladesh officials began talks last month to settle a repatriation process for Rohingya refugees, which Bangladesh expects to take to the next level in coming days. Speaking on the sidelines of the ASEM meeting, European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said,  We believe that stopping the violence, the flow of refugees and guaranteeing full humanitarian access to Rakhine state, and safe, sustainable repatriation of refugees are going to be key.  Mogherini, who also visited Bangladesh over the weekend, said,  There s a real possibility of Myanmar and Bangladesh reaching a memorandum of understanding and agreement for the safe repatriation of refugees to Myanmar.  The European bloc was ready to help with the process, she added. It was unclear, however, whether a safe return was possible, or advisable, for the thousands of Rohingya women and children still stranded on the beaches trying to flee hunger and instability in Rakhine. Myanmar intends to resettle most refugees who return in new  model villages , rather than on the land they previously occupied, an approach the United Nations has criticized in the past as effectively creating permanent camps. Besides restoring peace for Rohingya to return, Myanmar also had to resolve the issue of their citizenship, having treated them as stateless for decades, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, told a news conference in Tokyo. The UNHCR was ready to assist both countries with repatriation, he said, adding that it could help Myanmar with the citizenship verification of the Rohingya. Until now it has not been invited to participate in either.  Much as resources are needed in Bangladesh to respond to the crisis, the solutions to this crisis lie in Myanmar,  Grandi said. The crisis erupted after the military launched a brutal counter-insurgency operation against the militants after attacks on an army base and 30 police posts in Rakhine on Aug. 25. Myanmar s military has said that all fighting against the Rohingya militants died out on Sept.5. The group behind those attacks, Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), had declared a one-month ceasefire on Sept.10, which was rejected by the Myanmar government. But there have been no serious clashes since. The United States and other Western countries have become more engaged with Myanmar since it began a transition to civilian government after nearly 50 years of military rule. Myanmar s generals retain autonomy over defense, internal security and border issues in the current power-sharing arrangement. China, with close ties to both Myanmar and Bangladesh, has long been a key player in lawless borderlands where rebel ethnic groups have battled Myanmar s government for decades in a conflict driving thousands of refugees to seek shelter in China.

China upset as Indian president visits disputed border region,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Monday criticized a visit by Indian President Ram Nath Kovind to the remote state of Arunachal Pradesh, which China claims, saying China opposed any activities by Indian leaders in disputed areas. The latest row over Arunachal Pradesh suggests the Asian giants remain far apart, despite recent attempts to defuse tension over a region that China claims as southern Tibet. The Indian president went over the weekend, inaugurating a new state assembly building. For India, the state is where the sun first rises - being its easternmost region - each day, and from here light is spread across the country, he said in a speech to the state assembly. He also remarked on several steps taken by the federal government to advance the state s transport links. Speaking at a daily news briefing in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said that China had never recognized Arunachal Pradesh, but that China s position on the border issue was clear, which was to seek a solution both could accept via talks.   Before the border issue is resolved, both sides should jointly work hard to protect the peace and tranquility of the border region. China resolutely opposes Indian leaders  activities in disputed regions,  Lu said. Sino-India ties are at an important stage in development, and China hopes India does not do anything to complicate the border issue but should instead  create conditions  for border talks and the healthy, stable development of relations, he added. China and India have tried to develop two-ways ties in recent years but there is still deep distrust over the border dispute. In April, China slammed India s decision to host Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama in the same region, saying it could cause serious damage to relations. ",worldnews,"November 20, 2017 ",1
U.N. urges Japan to resettle more refugees after taking just three in first half,"TOKYO (Reuters) - The U.N. refugee agency has urged Japan to resettle more asylum seekers, its chief said on Monday, pressuring the country to  help solve a global crisis after giving refugee status to just three people in the first half of the year. Japan is one of the developed world s least welcoming countries for asylum seekers. It accepted 28 in 2016, despite applications from a record 10,091 people. It has since 2008 given home to limited numbers of refugees through a so-called third-country resettlement scheme, resettling a total of 152 people - mostly ethnic Karen people from Myanmar living in Thai and Malaysian camps.  That program is very small, about 20-30 refugees a year,  U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi told a news conference in Tokyo.  I have asked the government to consider whether it could be expanded.  Japan s reluctance to accept refugees mirrors a wider caution towards immigration in a nation where many pride themselves on cultural and ethnic homogeneity.  Its record at home has drawn sharp criticism from international human rights groups, and has been at odds with its traditional status as a major international donor on refugees.  But Japan s donations to the UNHCR have slipped: in the year to Oct. 2, it was the fourth-largest donor, giving $152 million, compared to the second-largest four years ago.      Contributions from the government to the UNHCR have been declining a little bit every year since 2013,  Grandi said.  What I asked the government to consider is that the needs of refugees and displaced people are increasing.  More than 2 million people fleeing wars or persecution have joined the ranks of the world s refugees this year. At the end of last year, the latest figure available, 17.2 million refugees fell under the UNHCR s mandate. Japan says that many people claim asylum in Japan to find work, encouraged by access to renewable work permits for people applying for refugee status. It officially rejects unskilled migrant workers, even as a fast-shrinking and ageing population blunts the potency of government efforts to rouse the economy from over two decades of sluggish growth and deflation. The Justice Ministry, which oversees refugee recognition, is weighing steps including restrictions on work permits for asylum seekers to curb what it deems  abusive  applications.

Indonesia parliament speaker taken into custody by anti-graft agency,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia s parliament speaker, Setya Novanto, has been taken into custody by the anti-corruption agency after being arrested over his alleged role in causing state losses of $170 million linked to a national electronic identity card scheme. Novanto, clad in an orange vest worn by detainees of the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK), was transferred from a hospital on Sunday night into a KPK detention facility. He is one of the most senior politicians to be detained by the agency, popular among ordinary Indonesians for targeting members of the establishment suspected of abuse of power.  Novanto was arrested on Friday night but his detention was postponed while he received treatment for injuries suffered in a car crash the day before.  Delay of the arrest is no longer needed,  as a medical statement showed Novanto did not need further hospital treatment, Laode Muhammad Syarif, the deputy head of the agency, said in a video on its official Periscope page.   On Sunday night, Novanto told reporters he was still suffering from vertigo after the crash that he said had injured  a leg, an arm and his head.  I thought I would be given time for recovery, but I obey the law,  Novanto was quoted by news website Kumparan.com as saying. Novanto will be held for 20 days for questioning, said KPK spokesman Febri Diansyah. He will be detained in a sparsely-furnished holding cell with some mattresses and a shared toilet. Graft agency officials tried to arrest Novanto, the chairman of Golkar, Indonesia s second-largest party and partner in the ruling coalition, at his house in Jakarta late on Wednesday. But they failed to find him, sparking speculation that he had gone into hiding. Later, Novanto was involved in a car accident and his lawyer, Fredrich Yunadi, said a journalist was driving the vehicle and interviewing his client at the time. The car crash was found to be an accident, media cited Jakarta s deputy director of traffic police as saying, dismissing speculation that the mishap was staged.      Novanto has denied wrongdoing but has repeatedly missed summonses for questioning by the agency in recent months, saying he was ill and needed heart surgery. The agency is investigating state losses of about $170 million after allegations that sums ranging from $5,000 to $5.5 million, generated by marking up procurement costs for the ID cards, were divided up among politicians in parliament. Novanto was named a suspect on Nov. 10 again after he had used a controversial legal maneuver, a pre-trial motion, to get earlier charges dropped last month. President Joko Widodo told reporters on Monday that he had asked Novanto to  follow the legal process .  The KPK has been collaborating with the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation on the case, said agency spokesman Diansyah. The FBI has been investigating the activities of Johannes Marliem, a U.S.-based contractor for the ID card scheme, who later committed suicide in Los Angeles.    The parliament speaker s legal battle with the graft agency has gripped Indonesia, with newspaper front pages splashing the story and social media circulating memes mocking him. Novanto gained a measure of international fame in September 2015 when Donald Trump, then a U.S. presidential candidate, hailed him as a  great man  at a news conference.  Do they like me in Indonesia?  Trump asked after introducing Novanto to reporters at Trump Tower.  Yes, highly,  Novanto replied. ",worldnews,"November 20, 2017 ",1

Twenty Chinese Uighurs use blankets to escape Thai cell,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - Twenty ethnic Uighur Muslims from China broke out of a detention center near the Thai-Malaysia border, Thai officials said on Monday, after digging holes in the wall and using blankets as ladders. The 20 were part of the last remaining group of more than 200 Uighurs who were detained in 2014. Members of the group identified themselves as Turkish citizens and asked to be sent to Turkey but more than 100 were forcibly returned to China in July 2015, a move that sparked international condemnation, including from rights groups who feared they could face torture in China. Hundreds of people have died in recent years in China s troubled far western region of Xinjiang due to violence between majority Han Chinese and Uighurs, who speak a Turkic language. Over the years, hundreds, possibly thousands, of Uighurs have escaped unrest in Xinjiang by traveling clandestinely via Southeast Asia to Turkey.  Twenty-five Uighurs dug through their cell wall using broken tiles and then used blankets to climb out of the cell to make their dramatic escape from the detention center in Thailand s southern Songkhla province, immigration officials said. Five were caught but the rest fled, officials said.  Twenty are still at large,  Police Captain Prasit Timmakarn, sub-inspector of the detention center, told Reuters, adding:  Heavy rain helped to mask the loud escape noises.  Prasit said authorities have set up checkpoints along the border. In August 2015, a bomb planted at Bangkok s Erawan shrine killed 20 people, most of them foreign tourists. Thai police  arrested two Uighur men who are still on trial. Authorities said the attack was prompted by an earlier crackdown on human smuggling networks but many analysts and diplomats said it was likely an act of revenge for Thailand s deportation to China of the more than 100 Uighurs. The Chinese government has blamed much of the Xinjiang unrest on separatist Islamist militants, though rights groups and exiles say that anger over tightening Chinese controls on the religion and culture of Uighurs is more to blame. China routinely denies any repression in Xinjiang. ",worldnews,"November 20, 2017 ",1
Philippines' Duterte keeps open pit mining ban in policy clash,"MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has not lifted a ban on open pit mining, his spokesman said on Monday, going against the stance of a government panel and the environment minister who are seeking to reverse the policy. Open pit mining is allowed under the laws of the Southeast Asian country, the world s top nickel ore exporter. But, the former environment minister Regina Lopez banned it during her 10 months in office, saying the environmental degradation ruined the economic potential of places where it was done. The Mining Industry Coordinating Council (MICC), an inter-agency panel that makes recommendations on mining policy, last month asked the Department of Environment and Natural Resources to lift the ban. Roy Cimatu, the new Environment and Natural Resources Secretary, supports removing the ban. Cimatu replaced Lopez when she stepped down in May after the Philippine Congress voted not to confirm her.  I assure you that this is one of the instances when I personally asked the President if there s been a change in policy. And he says that s there s still no new policy on this, there s still a ban on new open pit mining,  Harry Roque, Duterte s spokesman, told a media briefing. Roque said he was unsure whether the MICC recommendation has reached Duterte. The MICC is co-chaired by Cimatu and Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez. Calls and messages to Cimatu seeking comment were not immediately returned. But Finance Undersecretary Bayani Agabin, who is an alternate for Dominguez on the MICC, said the policy on open pit mining is under Duterte s authority.  The President has the final say on the matter,  Agabin told Reuters in a text message. The ban would only affect new projects. Lifting the ban could open the door for some big-ticket ventures including the $5.9 billion Tampakan copper and gold mine. The Tampakan project in South Cotabato province on the island of Mindanao is the nation s biggest stalled mining venture. Operator Glencore Plc to quit the project in 2015 but development was first halted after South Cotabato banned open-pit mining in 2010.  Lopez has said the project would cover an area the size of 700 soccer fields in what otherwise would be agricultural land. Duterte said in September he agreed with the open-pit mining ban given the environmental damage it causes, but would give mining firms time to find other ways to extract minerals.

Three dead after suspected gas leak at PetroChina refinery: media,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Three workers were killed and six others injured during a suspected gas leak at a PetroChina-operated refinery in Dalian on Saturday evening, state media said on Monday. The men working for Henan Yanling Jingshun Petrochemical Machinery Equipment Co Ltd were carrying out maintenance at the West Pacific Petrochemical Corp (WEPEC) plant, in northeast Liaoning province.

President Mugabe stuns Zimbabwe by defying pressure to resign,"HARARE (Reuters) - President Robert Mugabe stunned Zimbabwe on Sunday by making no mention of resignation in a television address, defying his own ZANU-PF party, which had sacked him hours earlier, and hundreds of thousands of protesters who had already hailed his downfall. Two sources - one a senior member of the government, the other familiar with talks with leaders of the military - had told Reuters Mugabe would announce his resignation to the nation after ZANU-PF dismissed him as its leader in a move precipitated by an army takeover four days earlier. But in the speech from his State House office, sitting alongside a row of generals, Mugabe acknowledged criticisms from ZANU-PF, the military and the public but made no mention of his own position. Instead, he said the events of the week were not  a challenge to my authority as head of state and government , and pledged to preside over the congress scheduled for next month. Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai was dumbstruck.  I am baffled. It s not just me, it s the whole nation. He s playing a game,  he told Reuters.  He is trying to manipulate everyone. He has let the whole nation down.  ZANU-PF had given the 93-year-old, who has led his country since independence in 1980, less than 24 hours to quit as head of state or face impeachment, an attempt to secure a peaceful end to his tenure after a de facto military coup. Chris Mutsvangwa, the leader of the liberation war veterans who have been spearheading an 18-month campaign to oust Mugabe, said plans to impeach him in parliament, which next sits on Tuesday, would now go ahead, and that there would be mass protests on Wednesday. He also implied that Mugabe, who spoke with a firm voice but occasionally lost his way in his script during the 20-minute address, was not aware of what had happened just hours earlier.  Either somebody within ZANU-PF didn t tell him what had happened within his own party, so he went and addressed that meeting oblivious, or (he was) blind or deaf to what his party has told him,  Mutsvangwa said. ZANU-PF s central committee had earlier named Emmerson Mnangagwa as its new leader. It was Mugabe s sacking of Mnangagwa as his vice-president - to pave the way for his wife Grace to succeed him - that triggered the army s intervention. On Saturday, hundreds of thousands had taken to the streets of the capital Harare to celebrate Mugabe s expected downfall and hail a new era for their country. In jubilant scenes, men, women and children ran alongside armoured cars and the troops who stepped in to target what the army called  criminals  in Mugabe s inner circle. Many heralded a  second liberation  and spoke of their dreams for political and economic change after two decades of deepening repression and hardship. They, like the more than 3 million Zimbabweans who have emigrated to neighbouring South Africa in search of a better life, are likely to be bitterly disappointed by Mugabe s defiance. Speaking from a secret location in South Africa, his nephew, Patrick Zhuwao, had told Reuters that Mugabe and his wife were  ready to die for what is correct  rather than step down in order to legitimise what he described as a coup. Zhuwao, who was also sanctioned by ZANU-PF, did not answer his phone on Sunday. However, Mugabe s son Chatunga railed against those who had pushed out his father.  You can t fire a Revolutionary leader!  he wrote on this Facebook page.  ZANU-PF is nothing without President Mugabe.  The huge crowds in Harare have given a quasi-democratic veneer to the army s intervention, backing its assertion that it is merely effecting a constitutional transfer of power, rather than a plain coup, which would risk a diplomatic backlash. But some of Mugabe s opponents are uneasy about the prominent role played by the military, and fear Zimbabwe might be swapping one army-backed autocrat for another, rather than allowing the people to choose their next leader.  The real danger of the current situation is that, having got their new preferred candidate into State House, the military will want to keep him or her there, no matter what the electorate wills,  former education minister David Coltart said. The United States, a longtime Mugabe critic, said it was looking forward to a new era in Zimbabwe, while President Ian Khama of neighbouring Botswana said Mugabe had no diplomatic support in the region and should resign at once. Besides changing its leadership, ZANU-PF said it wanted to change the constitution to reduce the power of the president, a possible sign of a desire to move towards a more pluralistic and inclusive political system. However, Mnangagwa s history as state security chief during the so-called Gukurahundi crackdown, when an estimated 20,000 people were killed by the North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade in Matabeleland in the early 1980s, suggested that quick, sweeping change was unlikely.  The deep state that engineered this change of leadership will remain, thwarting any real democratic reform,  said Miles Tendi, a Zimbabwean academic at Oxford University.

Satellite calls yield no clues on missing Argentine submarine,"MAR DEL PLATA, Argentina (Reuters) - A storm on Sunday complicated efforts to find an Argentine navy submarine missing in the South Atlantic with 44 crew members, while satellite calls thought to come from the vessel did not help searchers identify the vessel s location.  The defense ministry has said the ARA San Juan appeared to try to make contact through seven failed satellite calls on Saturday between late morning and early afternoon. The vessel was 432 km (268 miles) off Argentina s coast when its location was last known early on Wednesday. As waves of up to 8 meters (20 feet) and winds reaching 40 knots complicated the search by sea, authorities spent Sunday trying to trace the submarine s location through data from the satellite calls without significant progress, a navy official told reporters.  We analyzed these signals, which as we know were  intermittent and weak,  said Gabriel Galeazzi, a naval commander.  They could not help determine a point on the map to help the search.  U.S. satellite communications company Iridium Communications Inc, which was brought in to help analyze the calls, said they did not originate with its device aboard the vessel and may have been from another satellite communications company s equipment.  It said the last call it detected from its device was on Wednesday, the same day the government said the vessel vanished. More than a dozen boats and aircraft from Argentina, the United States, Britain, Chile and Brazil had joined the effort. Authorities have mainly been scanning the sea from above as the storm made the search difficult for boats, navy Admiral Gabriel Gonzalez told reporters.   Unfortunately these conditions are expected to remain for the next 48 hours,  Gonzalez said from the Mar del Plata naval base, about 420 km (240 miles) south of Buenos Aires where the submarine had been heading toward before vanishing. A search of 80 percent of the area initially targeted for the operation turned up no sign of the submarine on the ocean s surface, but the crew should have ample supplies of food and oxygen, Balbi said. The navy said an electrical outage on the diesel-electric-propelled vessel might have downed its communications. Protocol calls for submarines to surface if communication is lost. Three boats left Mar del Plata on Saturday with radar detection probes and were following the path that the submarine would have taken to arrive at the base in reverse, Balbi said.   Those probes allow the boats to sweep the ocean floor during their journey and try to make a record of the floor in three dimensions,  Balbi said. The U.S. Navy said its four aircraft were carrying a submarine rescue chamber designed during World War II that can reach a bottomed submarine at depths of 850 feet and rescue up to six people at a time. The chamber can seal over the submarine s hatch to allow sailors to move between the vessels. It said it also brought a remote-controlled vehicle that can be submerged and controlled from the surface  The dramatic search has captivated the nation of 44 million, which recently mourned the loss of five citizens killed when a truck driver plowed through a bicycle path in New York City. Crew members  relatives gathered at the Mar del Plata naval base, where the submarine had once been expected to arrive around noon on Sunday from Ushuaia. However, it would not be unusual for storms to cause delays, Balbi said. At the entrance of the base, locals hung signs with messages in support of the crew members and their families on a chain-link fence.   Strength for Argentina. We trust in God. We are waiting for you,  read a message inscribed on a celestial blue-and-white Argentine flag hanging on the fence.   Let s go, men of steel. We are waiting for you at home,  read a message written on a picture of the submarine. Argentine-born Pope Francis mentioned the missing vessel in his Sunday noon prayer.  I also pray for the men of the crew of the Argentine military submarine which is missing,  the pontiff said. The ARA San Juan was inaugurated in 1983, making it the newest of the three submarines in the navy s fleet. Built in Germany, it underwent maintenance in 2008 in Argentina. That maintenance included the replacement of its four diesel engines and its electric propeller engines, according to specialist publication Jane s Sentinel. ",worldnews,"November 19, 2017 ",1
China's Chongqing renews attacks on former disgraced leaders,"BEIJING (Reuters) - The government of the southwestern Chinese city of Chongqing renewed its attacks on two of its disgraced former leaders on Monday, saying one had set up an  independent kingdom  while the other was a lazy deceiver. Chongqing, one of China s most important cities, is perhaps best known outside China for its association with its one-time party boss, Bo Xilai, once himself a contender for top leadership before being jailed for life in 2013 in a dramatic corruption scandal. In July, another of its party chiefs, Sun Zhengcai, was sacked after he was accused of corruption. Sun, who has yet to face a court, had also been seen as a contender for promotion to the highest echelons of power in China. Chongqing is now run by Chen Miner, a close ally of President Xi Jinping, who has made fighting deeply ingrained corruption a cornerstone of his administration. Chen has vowed to root out graft in the city. In a front page commentary, the official Chongqing Daily said there could be no excuses for ignoring party instructions, especially on party discipline issues.  Bo Xilai raised his own flag, started something new in order to be different, and set up an independent kingdom,  the paper wrote, in apparent reference to his  Chongqing model  policy of more equal growth and flashy infrastructure projects. Bo, a former commerce minister, turned the sprawling, haze-covered municipality into a showcase for his mix of populist policies and bold spending plans that won support from leftists yearning for a charismatic leader. His campaign against crime was also crucial in making him the country s most prominent provincial-level leader, and a popular one at that. But he was ousted after his wife murdered a British businessman and later jailed for a litany of crimes, including bribery, corruption and abuse of power.  Sun, though, has yet to be formally charged. The party has accused him of leaking secrets as well as bribery and abuse of power. The Chongqing Daily did not reveal any other details of what Sun is suspected of, only leveling further broad accusations against him.   Sun Zhengcai practiced lazy and indolent politics, bullied those below and hoodwinked those above, and was passively handled enforcement of decision from the party center,  it added. The actions of Bo and Sun seriously harmed the party and had a malign influence on Chongqing, the paper said. Efforts need to redoubled to root out their  residual poison , it wrote.

Beijing orders safety checks after apartment block fire kills 19,"BEIJING (Reuters) - A fire in a Beijing apartment block that killed 19 people and injured eight has prompted authorities to order city-wide safety checks, state news agency Xinhua reported. The fire broke out on Saturday evening at a three-storey apartment block in Beijing s southern Daxing district, and a probe in to its cause was underway, Xinhua reported, adding that anyone found to be responsible would be punished.  Preliminary investigation showed there was a refrigeration facility in the basement of the apartment, where the fire was likely to have started,  Xinhua said late on Sunday.  Fire fighters said there was heavy smoke in the building but no large flames.  Following the blaze, Beijing s Communist Party boss Cai Qi ordered safety checks throughout the capital, including its outlying villages.  We must take actions and protect people s lives and safeguard the safety and stability of the capital,  Cai said, according to Xinhua. ",worldnews,"November 20, 2017 ",1

China proposed three-phase plan for Rohingya issue,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China has proposed a three-phase plan for resolving the Rohingya crisis, starting with a ceasefire, that has won the support of Myanmar and Bangladesh, the Foreign Ministry said. More than 600,000 Muslim Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh since late August driven out by a military clearance operation in Buddhist majority Myanmar s Rakhine State. The Rohingyas  suffering has caused an international outcry. Visiting the Myanmar capital Naypyitaw, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China believed that the issue could be addressed by a solution acceptable to neighbors Myanmar and Bangladesh through consultations. A ceasefire should be followed by bilateral dialogue to find a workable solution, the ministry website reported late on Sunday. The third and final phase should be to work toward a long-term solution. Wang said a ceasefire was basically in place already, and the key now was to prevent a flare-up. He hoped the two sides could soon sign and implement an agreement already reached on repatriation. The international community and the United Nations Security Council should give encouragement and support to both countries  to create the necessary conditions and a good environment , it quoted Wang as saying at a joint press conference with Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar s de facto leader. Myanmar was supportive of the Chinese plan, as was Bangladesh, where Wang visited earlier in the weekend. In Dhaka Wang said the international community should not complicate the situation.

Israeli minister reveals covert contacts with Saudi Arabia,"JERUSALEM/RIYADH (Reuters) - An Israeli cabinet minister said on Sunday that Israel has had covert contacts with Saudi Arabia amid common concerns over Iran, a first disclosure by a senior official from either country of long-rumoured secret dealings. The Saudi government had no immediate response to Israeli Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz s remarks. A spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also did not respond immediately to a request to comment. Both Saudi Arabia and Israel view Iran as a main threat to the Middle East and increased tension between Tehran and Riyadh has fuelled speculation that shared interests may push Saudi Arabia and Israel to work together. Saudi Arabia maintains that any relations with Israel hinge on Israeli withdrawal from Arab lands captured in the 1967 Middle East war, territory Palestinians seek for a future state.  U.S. President Donald Trump s peace envoys, seeking an Israeli-Palestinian agreement with regional support, have visited Saudi Arabia several times since he took office. In an interview on Army Radio, Steinitz, a member of  Netanyahu s security cabinet, did not characterise the contacts or give details when asked why Israel was  hiding its ties  with Saudi Arabia. He replied:  We have ties that are indeed partly covert with many Muslim and Arab countries, and usually (we are) the party that is not ashamed.   It s the other side that is interested in keeping the ties quiet. With us, usually, there is no problem, but we respect the other side s wish, when ties are developing, whether it s with Saudi Arabia or with other Arab countries or other Muslim countries, and there is much more ... (but) we keep it secret.  In an interview with Reuters on Thursday, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel Jubeir, asked about reports of cooperation with Israel, cited a Saudi peace initiative, first adopted in 2002 by the Arab League, as key to forging any relationship.  We have always said that if the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is resolved on the basis of the Arab peace initiative that Israel would have enjoyed normal relations, economic, political, diplomatic relations with all of the Arab countries, and so until that happens, we don t have relations with Israel,  he said. That plan makes those relations contingent on a full withdrawal by Israel from territory it captured in the 1967 Middle East war, including East Jerusalem. Netanyahu has expressed tentative support for parts of the initiative, but there are many caveats on the Israeli side. Hussein Ibish, senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington, said Steinitz s remarks  won t surprise anyone who s been paying attention to the budding courtship between Israel and Saudi Arabia, which is being especially pushed by the Israeli side . Last week, the Israeli military chief, Lieutenant General Gadi Eizenkot, told an Arabic language online newspaper that Israel was ready to share  intelligence information  with Saudi Arabia, saying their countries had a common interest in standing up to Iran. Saudi Arabia has ratcheted up pressure on Iran, accusing Tehran of trying to expand its influence in Arab countries, often through proxies including the Lebanese Shi ite Hezbollah group. Ibish said that given the mutual threat perceptions shared by Israel and Gulf Arab countries, it is unlikely that covert ties aren t developing. But he said Israeli officials have tended to exaggerate such interactions in a bid to  drive down the price they may have to pay, especially on Palestinian issues, to expand strategic relations and ties with Arab countries . In public remarks in September, Netanyahu pointed to covert relationships with Arab states, saying, without mentioning any by name, that cooperation exists  in various ways and different levels .  Also in September, Israel Radio reported that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had secretly met officials in Israel that month, drawing an official denial from Riyadh. Last month, Saudi former intelligence chief Prince Turki bin Faisal shared a stage with ex-Israeli Mossad spy agency director Efraim Halevy at a debate on Iran in a New York synagogue. In 2016, former Saudi general Anwar Eshki visited Israel, where he met Israeli legislators, to promote - as he has at various academic forums - the Saudi peace initiative.

Greek centrists elect alliance leader to boost popularity,"ATHENS (Reuters) - Greek centrists elected politician Fofi Gennimata on Sunday to lead a center-left party alliance, hoping to win back voters disillusioned after seven years of crisis and boost their popularity as the country emerges from bailouts. Past attempts by centrists to form parties and alliances have not fared well and the latest bid is seen as a last-ditch effort to restore unity and attract voters, many of whom defected to the ruling leftist Syriza party over the years of painful bailout reforms. The new alliance includes Greece s once-powerful Socialist PASOK party, which Gennimata already leads, the Democratic Socialist Movement, the Democratic Left and the To Potami party. Gennimata won about 58 percent of the vote.  PASOK ruled Greece for decades but has seen its popularity sliding to single-digit figures since 2010, when it signed up to Greece s first bailout from the EU and the International Monetary Fund in return for draconian austerity. It has 19 seats in the 300-member parliament. The centre-left Potami, which was founded in 2014 and first entered parliament with 6.1 percent in a 2015 national election  now ranks eighth in opinion polls with 1.5 percent. It has six MPs. Greece s leftist-led Syriza government was catapulted to power in January 2015 promising to end austerity. It was forced to sign up to a new rescue package, the country s third bailout a few months later. That bailout expires in August.  Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras  term ends in 2019 and he says he will seek a new four-year mandate then. But his ratings have been sagging in opinion polls behind the main opposition, the conservative New Democracy party.     ",worldnews,"November 19, 2017 ",1
"Saudi Arabia and Arab allies push for unity against Iran, Hezbollah meddling","CAIRO (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia and other Arab foreign ministers criticized Iran and its Lebanese Shi ite ally Hezbollah at an emergency meeting in Cairo on Sunday, calling for a united front to counter Iranian interference. Regional tensions have risen in recent weeks between Sunni monarchy Saudi Arabia and Shi ite Islamist Iran over Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri s surprise resignation, and an escalation in Yemen s conflict. Hariri, a Saudi ally, resigned on Nov. 4 from Riyadh, accusing Iran and Hezbollah of spreading strife. But Lebanese President Michel Aoun and other politicians accused Saudi Arabia of holding Hariri hostage and said he had been coerced into resigning. Saudi Arabia and Hariri both deny that. Hezbollah, both a military force involved in Syria s war and a political movement, is part of a Lebanese government made up of rival factions, and an ally of Aoun. Saudi Arabia also accuses Hezbollah of a role in the launch of a missile towards Riyadh from Yemen this month. Iran denies accusations that it supplies Houthi forces there.   The kingdom will not stand by and will not hesitate to defend its security,  Saudi Arabia s Foreign Minister Adel Jubeir told the assembly.  We must stand together.  The emergency Arab foreign ministers  meeting was convened at the request of Saudi Arabia with support from the UAE, Bahrain, and Kuwait to discuss means of confronting Iranian intervention. In a declaration after the meeting, the Arab League accused Hezbollah of  supporting terrorism and extremist groups in Arab countries with advanced weapons and ballistic missiles.  It said Arab nations would provide details to the U.N. Security Council of Tehran s violations for arming militias in Yemen.  Lebanon s Arab League representative objected to the declaration accusing Hezbollah of terrorism and said it is part of Lebanon s government, the Hezbollah-affiliated al-Manar television channel reported.  United Arab Emirates  Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash said on Twitter later that the declaration was a  clear message  about joint Arab action against Iran. Yemen s civil war pits the internationally recognized government, backed by Saudi Arabia and its allies, against the Houthis and forces loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh.  Iranian threats have gone beyond all limits and pushed the region into a dangerous abyss,  Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Aboul Gheit said.  Unfortunately countries like the Saudi regime are pursuing divisions and creating differences, and because of this they don t see any results other than divisions,  Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told Iranian state media on Sunday on the sidelines of a meeting in Antalya. Egypt s foreign minister received a call from U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Sunday when they also discussed regional tensions over Lebanon, the foreign ministry said in a statement. After French intervention, Hariri flew to France and met President Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Saturday. He will arrive in Cairo for a visit on Tuesday, his office said. Speaking in Paris, Hariri said he would clarify his position when he returns to Beirut in the coming days. He said he would take part in Lebanese independence day celebrations, scheduled for Wednesday. ",worldnews,"November 19, 2017 ",1
Israel president rejects pardon appeal of soldier who killed prone Palestinian assailant,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel s president on Sunday turned down a pardon request by an ex-conscript who is serving an serving a 14-month jail term for killing an incapacitated Palestinian assailant. In September, Israel s military reduced by four months the 18-month jail term of Elor Azaria who was caught on videotape shooting dead a Palestinian who was lying wounded after taking part in a stabbing attack on other Israeli soldiers in the occupied West Bank city of Hebron in March 2015. A statement issued by President Reuven Rivlin s office said that he had reviewed the plea and after Azaria had already received reductions to his sentence, it would not be right to grant a pardon.  The president believes ... that an additional reduction in punishment would undermine the strength of the military, its values, and of the state of Israel,  part of the statement read. It added that the president understood that Azaria was due to face a parole board shortly and could be released in three months  time.   Azaria became a right-wing cause celebre in Israel, where most Jewish men and women are drafted at 18 for military service. One poll found that nearly half of Israeli Jews believe any Palestinian attacker should be killed on the spot. Azaria said he shot Abd Elfatah Ashareef because he feared the Palestinian could carry out another attack, but a court-martial found contradictions in the testimony and convicted him of manslaughter. The verdict was upheld on appeal. Right-wing ministers and lawmakers, including Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman, criticized Rivlin s decision, saying he should have pardoned Azaria.  President Rivlin had an opportunity to end an affair that has rocked Israeli society,  Lieberman wrote.   Beyond the price that the soldier and his family have paid ... I believe ... that (there is a need) to heal the rifts in society ... we must not forget that this was a case of (Azaria), an exemplary soldier (facing) a terrorist who came to kill.  After being discharged from the military, Azaria went to prison in August and appealed to the armed forces chief, Lieutenant-General Gadi Eizenkot, to reconsider his sentence, citing the cost to his family of the acrimonious trial. In a response letter, the military informed Azaria that Eizenkot had decided to cut the jail term  on grounds of compassion and mercy ... taking into account your past as a combat soldier in an operational theater . But the letter also faulted the former soldier over  grave actions for which you did not take responsibility and for which you did not express regret,  adding that  the important messages in the court rulings should be heeded . The Palestinian government said Azaria s jail term had given Israeli soldiers a  green light  to kill with impunity. Under Israeli law, manslaughter can carry a maximum 20 years behind bars. Military prosecutors had asked the appeals court to impose a three- to five-year sentence on Azaria, but were turned down. ",worldnews,"November 19, 2017 ",1

Palestinians say they won't be blackmailed by U.S. move to close PLO office,"RAMALLAH/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Palestinian officials expressed surprise on Saturday at a U.S. decision to close the Palestine Liberation Organization office in Washington unless the group enters peace negotiations with Israel, and said they would not surrender to blackmail. A U.S. State Department official said that under legislation passed by Congress, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson could not renew a certification that expired this month for the PLO office,  given certain statements made by the Palestinian leaders about the International Criminal Court.  The law says the PLO, the main Palestinian umbrella political body, cannot operate a Washington office if it urges the ICC to prosecute Israelis for alleged crimes against Palestinians. In an address to the United Nations General Assembly in September, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said the Palestinian Authority called on the ICC  to open an investigation and to prosecute Israeli officials for their involvement in settlement activities and aggressions against our people.  The State Department official added that restrictions on the PLO in the United States, including the operation of its Washington office, could be waived after 90 days if U.S. President Donald Trump  determines the Palestinians have entered into direct, meaningful negotiations with Israel.   We are hopeful that this closure will be short-lived,  said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. According to the official Palestinian news agency WAFA, the Palestinian presidency expressed surprise at the U.S. move, which was first reported by the Associated Press. WAFA quoted Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad Al-Maliki as saying that Palestinian leaders would not give in to blackmail or pressure regarding the operation of the PLO office or negotiations on an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement. The agency quoted a spokesman for Abbas, Nabil Abu Rdainah, expressing surprise, given that meetings between Abbas and Trump had been  characterized by full understanding of the steps needed to create a climate for resumption of the peace process.      A Palestinian official who spoke on condition of anonymity told Reuters the State Department had informed the Palestinians of the decision on Wednesday.  It was not immediately clear what effect the State Department s move might have on the Trump administration s efforts to revive peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians, which are led by Jared Kushner, the U.S. president s son-in-law and senior adviser.    Abbas  spokesman called the U.S. move an unprecedented step in U.S.-Palestinian relations that would have serious consequences for the peace process and U.S.-Arab relations, according to WAFA. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement on Saturday:  This is a matter of U.S. law. We respect the decision and look forward to continuing to work with the U.S. to advance peace and security in the region.  The State Department official said the U.S. move did not amount to cutting off relations with the PLO or signal an intention to stop working with the Palestinian Authority.  We remain focused on a comprehensive peace agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians that will resolve core issues between the parties,  the official said.

Lebanon's Hariri to visit Egypt on Tuesday: Hariri's office,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Saad al-Hariri, who announced his resignation as Lebanese prime minister in a televised broadcast from Saudi Arabia on Nov. 4, will visit Egypt on Tuesday to meet Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, Hariri s office said on Sunday. Hariri has since Saturday been in Paris, where he met French President Emmanuel Macron, and has said he will return to Lebanon by Wednesday for its Independence Day celebrations. Lebanese President Michel Aoun has said he will not accept Hariri s resignation until it is delivered in person and all sides in Beirut have called for his speedy return. A leader in Hariri s Future Movement had earlier told Reuters Hariri would visit Egypt on Monday. The resignation sparked a political crisis in Lebanon and put it on the front line of a regional power struggle between Saudi Arabia and Iran.  Hariri criticized Iran and its ally Hezbollah, which is in Lebanon s coalition government, in his resignation statement, and said he feared assassination. Apart from a brief trip to Abu Dhabi, he remained in Saudi Arabia until he flew to France. His stay in the kingdom led to accusations from Lebanese officials and politicians that Saudi Arabia had coerced him to resign, which he and Riyadh denied.  On Friday, Hariri tweeted that his presence there was for  consultations on the future of the situation in Lebanon and its relations with the surrounding Arab region . On Sunday, Arab League foreign ministers held an emergency meeting in Cairo, requested by Saudi Arabia, to discuss ways to confront Iran and Hezbollah over their role in the region.  In a statement afterwards, the ministers accused Hezbollah of supporting terrorism in Arab countries.  Lebanese Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil did not attend. ",worldnews,"November 19, 2017 ",1
Zimbabwe's Mugabe defies expectations of immediate resignation,"HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe s President Robert Mugabe defied expectations he would resign on Sunday, pledging to preside over a ZANU-PF congress next month even though the ruling party had removed him as its leader hours earlier. ZANU-PF had given the 93-year-old less than 24 hours to quit as head of state or face impeachment, an attempt to secure a peaceful end to his tenure after a de facto coup. Mugabe said in a address on state television that he acknowledged criticism against him from ZANU-PF, the military and the public, but did not comment on the possibility of standing down.

Algeria picks up 286 boat migrants en route to Europe,"ALGIERS (Reuters) - Algeria s coastguard has picked up 286 illegal migrants heading across the Mediterranean to Europe by boat, the Defence Ministry has said. The migrants were detained on several boats between Thursday and Saturday, according to a ministry statement carried on Sunday by the state news agency, APS. Algeria has so far seen relatively few attempts to cross to Europe by boat, compared to the hundreds of thousands of mostly African would-be migrants who have set off in search of prosperity or security from elsewhere along the north African coast, mostly from Libya. Most illegal crossings from Algeria take place in summer, when sailing conditions are more favorable. Neighboring Tunisia has recently seen a surge in such departures as young unemployed people seek work in Italy. Algeria s economy is also suffering as its vital energy revenues have been hit by a sharp fall in prices. ",worldnews,"November 19, 2017 ",1
EU's Tusk says alarmed that Poland's policy resembles 'Kremlin's plan',"WARSAW (Reuters) - European Council President Donald Tusk said on Sunday he was alarmed by the similarity of policies pursued by Poland s right-wing government to what he described as  Kremlin s plan . Poland s ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party has been increasingly at loggerheads with the EU and Tusk since coming to office in late 2015, although the acrimony between Tusk and PiS dates back many years. The PiS is locked in disputes with the bloc over immigration, logging of an ancient forest and putting courts and media under more  government control. Tusk, Poland s former prime minister and the arch-rival of PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski, won a second term in March as chairman of EU summit meetings - with Poland the only country to vote against his extension.  Alarm! A vehement dispute with Ukraine, isolation in the European Union, departure from the rule of law and independent courts, attack on non-governmental sector and free media - PiS strategy or Kremlin s plan?  Tusk tweeted.  Too similar to rest easy.      Tusk was referring to, among other things, the fact that Ukraine summoned the Polish ambassador in Kiev on Saturday after Poland denied entry to a Ukrainian official in an escalation of a diplomatic spat over the two neighbors  troubled past. Tusk did not provide details of what he described as the  Kremlin s plan . In May, Tusk urged Group of Seven leaders on to stick to their sanctions policy on Russia over the Ukraine crisis. Tusk also sided with member nations such as Poland and the Baltic states in their efforts to oppose a new pipeline connecting Russia and Germany.  The Polish government denies all charges from Brussels that it is undermining the rule of law or isolating Poland in Europe, saying it needs to overhaul Poland s ineffective legal system and stand up for Poland s interests in the EU. A majority of EU lawmakers on Wednesday demanded punishment for the eurosceptic government in Poland, saying it was undermining the rule of law and promoting intolerance. In a response to Tusk s comment, Prime Minister Beata Szydlo tweeted:   @donaldtusk as @eucopresident has done nothing for Poland. Today, using his position to attack the Polish government, he is attacking Poland.  In March, Poland s defense minister accused Tusk of working with Russian President Vladimir Putin to harm Polish interests following the 2010 plane crash that killed President Lech Kaczynski - Jaroslaw s twin brother - and 95 others.  In April, Tusk testified for eight hours in a separate intelligence probe by Warsaw s right-wing government that he described as a smear campaign to discredit him. ",worldnews,"November 19, 2017 ",1
"As Canada prepares for legal pot, ex-cops get into the business","TORONTO (Reuters) - A former Canadian police chief and several colleagues who fought against making marijuana use legal have switched sides and embraced the looming legalization of cannabis with a leap into business. With Canada s legalization of a multi-billion dollar marijuana industry set for next year, former police officers who once argued for mandatory jail time for minor marijuana offences are among those in line to capitalize on the change. The most high profile is Julian Fantino, a former Toronto police chief and Conservative cabinet minister who fought against the legalization of pot and who said he now sees the value of a legal medical pot industry.  For a lot of us, until you get into this thing, all we know is the stigma associated with marijuana. And there is that, of course, but ... it s only a matter of time, before it becomes a recognized, therapeutic, prescribed drug,  Fantino said in an interview. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised to legalize recreational marijuana use in his 2015 election campaign and new legislation will let adults grow, buy or possess small amounts of marijuana as of July 1, 2018. Under the new law, private or government retailers will be able to sell marijuana and licensed producers will be able to grow it. The Canadian cannabis black market is estimated to be worth between C$7 billion ($5.77 billion) and C$10 billion a year, with rates of youth use among the highest in the world. Analysts expect it will take time for legal trade to push aside unsanctioned competition. Fantino and his partners - a former Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer, a former fire chief and a former member of parliament - are promoting their company Aleafia, which provides patients with authorizations for medical marijuana, as well as other medical services. Medical marijuana is already legal. Fantino said he would  absolutely  be pursuing the business even if Canada was not legalizing the lucrative recreational industry. But his change of heart has met with skepticism in some circles. Toronto Star newspaper columnist Royson James wrote  the hypocrisy stinks to high heaven.  On Twitter, pot activist Jodie Emery called the news  infuriating.   The Canadian Broadcasting Corp introduced an interview with Fantino by noting he had  once compared weed to murder.  Fantino said the quote was taken out of context and he  did what I could to apply the laws of the land with conscience.  Other ex-cops are getting into the business side of marijuana. Former deputy Toronto police chief Kim Derry has been involved in medical marijuana businesses since 2012. Derry is president of Met-Scan Canada, which he said provides security for about half a dozen marijuana growers. He expects that number to grow once recreational production becomes legal.  From a background of criminal activity, I certainly know how (grow operations) operated in the past,  Derry said.  I know all the pieces, through a chain of supply, where there s weaknesses.  The government s effort to legalize marijuana is headed up by another former Toronto police chief, Bill Blair, who succeeded Fantino in 2005 before they both turned to politics. Blair said retired police officers have been getting calls for advice on medical marijuana production since related laws came into effect in 2013.   I think many are being sought out for their expertise in public service and regulatory law and security around these things,  he said, adding he does not think its unseemly for police officers to make money off cannabis.  For me, it s entirely consistent with my life s work and I wouldn t comment on anyone else s history or motives.  Pot possession remains illegal until July and Canadians continue to be prosecuted for it - 17,733 people in 2016, according to Statistics Canada. Studies have found marginalized communities are disproportionately targeted. The government is developing ways to track each marijuana plant from seed to point of sale and test for quality. It has yet to draft detailed advertising rules or finalize tax levels. ",worldnews,"November 17, 2017 ",1
"Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander, another fighter, killed in Syria: Iranian media","BEIRUT (Reuters) - A commander in Iran s elite Revolutionary Guards and a lower-ranking Iranian fighter have been killed fighting Islamic State in Syria in recent days, Iranian media reported on Sunday. The Revolutionary Guards, Iran s most powerful military force which also oversees an economic empire worth billions of dollars, have been fighting in support of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad for several years. An Iranian official told the Tasnim news agency last year that more than 1,000 Iranians have been killed in Syria. Senior members of the Guards have been among those killed. Kheyrollah Samadi, a Guards commander in charge of a unit in Syria, died on Thursday in fighting in the Albu Kamal region, bordering Iraq, according to Fars News. Samadi was killed in clashes with Islamic State, according to the Ghatreh news site. Iranian media have previously reported on fighting in that area between Iran s Shi ite militia allies and Islamic State. The Syrian army and its allies took complete control over Albu Kamal, Islamic State s last significant town in Syria, a military news service run by Hezbollah said on Sunday. Samadi, who fought in the Iran-Iraq war during the 1980s and had retired from the Iranian military before signing on to go to Syria, was killed by a mortar explosion, Fars News, a news agency, said. Iranian news sites posted pictures on Sunday of Samadi with Qassem Soleimani, head of the Guards branch responsible for operations outside Iran. The lower-ranking Iranian fighter, Mehdi Movahednia, was killed on Saturday in clashes with Islamic State in the town of Mayadin in eastern Syria, Fars News reported. The Revolutionary Guards initially kept quiet about their role in the Syria conflict. But in recent years, as casualties have mounted, they have been more outspoken about their engagement, framing it as an existential struggle against the Sunni Muslim fighters of Islamic State who see Shi ites, the majority of Iran s population, as apostates. On web sites linked to the Guards, members of the organization killed in Syria and Iraq are praised as protectors of Shi ite holy sites and labeled  defenders of the shrine . U.S. President Donald Trump last month gave the U.S. Treasury Department authority to impose economic sanctions on members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard in response to what Washington calls its efforts to destabilize and undermine its opponents in the Middle East.

Britain to submit 'Brexit bill' proposal before December EU meeting,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will submit proposals on how to settle its divorce bill with the European Union before an EU summit next month and is expected to negotiate hard, finance minister Philip Hammond said on Sunday. The EU told Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday that there was more work to be done to unlock the Brexit talks, repeating its early December deadline for her to flesh out Britain s opening offer on the financial settlement.  We will make our proposals to the European Union in time for the Council,  Hammond told the BBC, referring to the Dec. 14-15 meeting of EU heads of government. He was speaking three days before he sets out Britain s budget plan, where he will have to find room within tight fiscal constraints to help May convince voters that the Conservative government is tackling Britain s domestic problems at the same time as negotiating its exit from the EU.    Last week, May met fellow EU leaders to try to break a deadlock over how much Britain will pay on leaving the bloc, an issue threatening to derail British hopes for a negotiated exit and an agreement on a new trading relationship by March 2019.  May has signalled she would increase an initial offer that is estimated at some 20 billion euros ($24 billion) - about a third of what Brussels wants. But Hammond, who has been criticised by supporters of Brexit for being too conciliatory towards Brussels and lobbying for a  softer  exit, said Britain would take a tough stance about how much it owes.  There are some things that we re very clear we do owe under the treaties, other things where we dispute the amounts or even whether something should be included,  Hammond said in a separate interview with ITV television.  Of course we ll negotiate hard to get the very best deal for the British taxpayer.  Asked about the prospect of Brexit without a trade deal, Hammond said he was  increasingly confident  that an agreement could be reached because it was in the interests of both parties. Despite scepticism in Brussels over the tight timetable, May and her chief negotiator David Davis have been clear they want to have a full post-Brexit free trade deal sealed by the time Britain leaves.  However, Hammond set out a softer stance on the timing of the trade deal.  We hope that it will be agreed, certainly in principle, that the big elements of it will be agreed before March 2019 so that everybody knows where we are going,  he told ITV.

"Turkish capital bans LGBT cinema, exhibitions","ISTANBUL (Reuters) - The Turkish capital Ankara has banned the public showing of films and exhibitions related to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) issues, the governor s office said on Sunday, citing risks to public safety. The move is likely to deepen concern among rights activists and Turkey s Western allies about its record on civil liberties under President Tayyip Erdogan s Islamist-rooted AK Party.  Starting from Nov. 18, 2017, concerning our community s public sensitivity, any events such as LGBT... cinema, theater, panels, interviews, exhibitions are banned until further notice in our province to provide peace and security,  the governor s office said in a statement. It said that such exhibitions could cause different groups in society to  publicly harbor hatred and hostility  toward each other and therefore pose a risk to public safety.  Authorities in Ankara had already banned a German gay film festival on Wednesday, the day before it was due to start, citing public safety and terrorism risks.  In addition, gay pride parades have been banned in Istanbul for the last two years running. Unlike in many Muslim countries, homosexuality is not a crime in Turkey, but there is widespread hostility to it. Civil liberties in Turkey have become a particular concern for the West following the attempted military coup in July 2016. Since then, more than 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial on suspicion of links to the coup. Some 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended from their jobs. Human rights groups and Turkey s Western allies fear Erdogan is using the coup as a pretext to quash his opponents. Ankara says the measures are necessary, given the extent of the security threat it faces. ",worldnews,"November 19, 2017 ",1
Bangladesh says it's in talks with Myanmar on Rohingya repatriation deal,"DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh is in negotiations with Myanmar aimed at a deal to repatriate displaced Rohingya and Dhaka s foreign minister will address the matter at talks in Myanmar this week, the Bangladeshi foreign ministry said on Sunday. More than 600,000 Muslim Rohingya have fled to neighboring Bangladesh since late August, driven out by a military clearance operation in Buddhist majority Myanmar s Rakhine State. The Rohingyas  suffering has caused an international outcry.  Bangladesh and Myanmar are in the process of negotiation for a bilateral agreement for repatriation of displaced people and expect to form a Joint Working Group to facilitate the repatriation,  said a ministry statement, quoting remarks by Foreign Minister Abul Hasan Mahmood Ali at a meeting with his Japanese counterpart in Dhaka on Sunday. A senior aide to Ali said he would leave for Myanmar late on Sunday to attend an Asia-Europe (ASEM) meeting on Monday and Tuesday and would stay on another couple of days for bilateral talks on the Rohingya. The official said Ali hoped for an agreement on allowing Rohingya to return to Myanmar.  Both countries have almost reached an understanding on this issue and there are a few points (still) to be agreed ... We hope to reach an agreement.  There was no immediate comment from Myanmar. On Nov. 1,  Myanmar insisted it was ready to set up a repatriation process but voiced fears Bangladesh was delaying an accord to first get international aid money. A senior Bangladesh home ministry official described the accusation as outrageous. Stung by international criticism and accusations of ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya, Myanmar s de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, has said Rohingyas who can prove they were resident in Myanmar would be accepted back. Last week a United Nations General Assembly committee called on Myanmar to end military operations that have  led to the systematic violation and abuse of human rights  of Rohingya. The move revived a U.N. resolution that was dropped last year due to Myanmar s progress on human rights. However, in the past three months there has been a Rohingya exodus to Bangladesh after the Myanmar military began an operation against Rohingya militants who attacked 30 security posts and an army base in Rakhine on Aug. 25. Myanmar s army released a report on Monday denying all allegations of rapes and killings by security forces, days after replacing the general in charge of the military operation. Top U.N. officials have denounced the violence as a classic example of ethnic cleansing. The Myanmar government has denied these allegations. Rohingyas have been denied citizenship in Myanmar, where many Buddhists see them as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. A U.S. congressional delegation, European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini and the foreign ministers of Germany, Sweden and Japan visited Rohingya camps in Cox s Bazar at the weekend to raise awareness of their plight.  We support Bangladesh s efforts toward a lasting solution, including the repatriation of displaced persons,  Japan s Taro Kona told Ali at their meeting, where Tokyo pledged $18.6 million in aid to ease the Rohingya crisis. Mogherini told reporters:  More than putting pressure, our approach has always been and will continue to be to offer a negotiating space, encourage the taking care of a situation that is not going to disappear.

Kenyan police fire teargas to break slum protests after four murdered,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenyan police fired teargas to disperse a crowd that was protesting on Sunday against the overnight murder of four people in a slum in the capital Nairobi. Parts of the city have been gripped by tension since Friday when at least five people were killed in violence involving the police and opposition supporters who were accompanying their leader Raila Odinga after a trip abroad.  Japheth Koome, the police commander in the city, said investigations had started after four bodies were found in the Mathare Area Four slum on Sunday morning.   We went there and found those bodies with injuries,  he told a news conference, describing the murders as a criminal act rather than ethnic-driven violence. The violence took place a day before the Supreme Court rules on two cases seeking to nullify the re-election of President Uhuru Kenyatta in a repeat election held last month. Odinga, who successfully petitioned against Kenyatta s initial victory in the Aug. 8 vote and subsequently boycotted the repeat poll, visited the scene of the murders on Sunday and accused the government of being behind the killings.  Those who are doing these acts are the ones who already lost and want to hold onto power by force but we will remove them using the power of the people,  he told a crowd of his supporters. Police fired teargas and used water cannons to disperse protesters for the better part of the morning until calm was restored in the area in the afternoon. The broadcast industry regulator, Communications Authority of Kenya, said it had banned live broadcasts of political rallies, after all the main TV stations showed hours of live footage of the chaos that greeted Odinga s return. A source at the authority told Reuters on Sunday the ban was put in place to help manage the tension in the country. ",worldnews,"November 19, 2017 ",1
"Helping the poor is a 'Passport to Paradise,' Pope says","VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis welcomed the poor, homeless and unemployed as guests of honor for a Mass and gourmet meal in the Vatican on Sunday, saying that helping the needy was one way of obtaining a  passport to paradise . Francis celebrated a Mass marking the Roman Catholic Church s first yearly World Day of the Poor, which the pope established to draw the attention of the world s 1.2 billion Catholics to the neediest. Volunteers from charity organizations brought about 7,000 needy people to St Peter s Basilica for a special Mass celebrated by the pope, who has made defense of the poor, immigrants and downtrodden a major plank of his papacy. About 1,500 of them were having lunch with the pope in the Vatican s large audience hall and others were being taken to eat as guests in nearby pontifical colleges. Most of the needy people were from Rome and other parts of Italy but charity groups also brought groups from France, Spain, Germany and Poland.  If in the eyes of the world they (the poor) have little value, they are the ones who open to us the way to heaven; they are our  passport to paradise . For us it is an evangelical duty to care for them ...,  he said in his homily.  God will not ask us if we felt righteous indignation, but whether we did some good,  he said, labeling indifference as a sin of omission. The pope said this  is when we say,  that doesn t concern me; it s not my business, it s society s problem.   It is when we turn away from a brother or sister in need, when we change channels as soon as a disturbing question comes up, when we grow indignant at evil but do nothing about it.  The menu for the poor was selected by Sergio Dussin, the same chef who prepares meals for visiting dignitaries at Vatican conferences. It consisted of dishes the poor can only dream of: mini gnocchi, fish with tomatoes, olives, Venetian cheese, veal with vegetables and Venetian-style tiramisu for dessert. Three days after his election in 2013, Francis said:  Oh, how I would like a poor Church, and for the poor.  He since given up some of the trappings of the papacy, shunning the spacious papal apartments in the Vatican s Apostolic Palace for a modest residence in a guest house.  He also has put aside the papal limousine and is driven around Rome in a simple blue Ford Focus. ",worldnews,"November 19, 2017 ",1
"Syrian army, allies take back Albu Kamal from Islamic State","BEIRUT (Reuters) - The Syrian army and its allies took complete control over Albu Kamal, Islamic State s last significant town in Syria, a military news service run by Hezbollah said on Sunday.  The army had declared victory over Islamic State in Albu Kamal earlier this month but the jihadists then staged a counter-attack using sleeper cells hidden in the town.  Driving Islamic State from Albu Kamal means only a few villages along the Euphrates and patches of nearby desert, as well as isolated pockets in other parts of the country, remain in Syria of the caliphate it declared in 2014.  Most of the forces battling Islamic State in Syria and Iraq have said they expect it to go underground and turn to a guerrilla insurgency using sleeper cells and bombings.  Western intelligence agencies have said it will still be able to inspire attacks on civilians around the world.   The Syrian Army and its allies in the axis of resistance have expelled Daesh from its last stronghold on Syrian soil,  the Hezbollah news service reported.  The  axis of resistance  is used by those in it to describe the alliance of Iran, Syria and Shi ite militias including Hezbollah.  The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Sunday that most IS members withdrew from the town, with fighting continuing in the perimeter of Albu Kamal. Islamic State s area of rule in Syria has crumbled this year under two rival military campaigns.  The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias, backed by a U.S.-led coalition has driven it from much of its territory in the north, including its former Syrian capital Raqqa. Syria s army and its allies have waged an offensive across central and eastern Syria backed by Russian air and missile power.  The two offensives have mostly avoided conflict with each other through communication between the United States and Russia. However, Syrian and Iranian officials have said that Damascus seeks to regain control over areas held by the SDF. ",worldnews,"November 19, 2017 ",1

"Zimbabwe's ruling party set to sack Mugabe, sources say","HARARE (Reuters) - The leaders of Zimbabwe s ruling ZANU-PF party will meet on Sunday to approve the dismissal of President Robert Mugabe, the only leader the southern African nation has known since independence 37 years ago, two party sources have said. An extraordinary meeting of the party s central committee is expected to convene around 10:30 a.m. (0830 GMT) to consider removing the 93-year-old, four days after a military seizure of power ostensibly aimed at  criminals  within his entourage. Separately, state television said Mugabe would meet military commanders on Sunday, quoting the Catholic priest who has been mediating in negotiations with the president. On Saturday, hundreds of thousands of people flooded the streets of Harare, singing, dancing and hugging soldiers in an outpouring of elation at Mugabe s overthrow. ZANU-PF s central committee is also expected to reinstate Emmerson Mnangagwa as party vice-president, resurrecting the political career of the former security chief, nicknamed The Crocodile, whose sacking this month triggered the military s intervention. Mugabe s wife, Grace, will be fired as head of the ZANU-PF Women s League, the sources told Reuters, completing the demise of a 52-year-old former government typist who just a week ago stood in pole position to succeed her husband after Mnangagwa s dismissal. The pair s stunning downfall is likely to send shockwaves across Africa, where a number of entrenched strongmen, from Uganda s Yoweri Museveni to Democratic Republic of Congo s Joseph Kabila, are facing mounting pressure to step aside. In scenes reminiscent of the downfall of Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in 1989, men, women and children ran alongside the armored cars and troops who stepped in this week to oust the man who has ruled since independence from Britain in 1980. Under house arrest in his lavish  Blue Roof  compound, Mugabe has refused to stand down even as he has watched his support from party, security services and people evaporate in less than three days.   His nephew, Patrick Zhuwao, told Reuters the elderly leader and his wife were  ready to die for what is correct  rather than step down in order to legitimize what he described as a coup.  But on Harare s streets, few seemed to care about the legal niceties as they heralded a  second liberation  for the former British colony and spoke of their dreams for political and economic change after two decades of deepening repression and hardship.  These are tears of joy,  said Frank Mutsindikwa, 34, holding aloft the Zimbabwean flag.  I ve been waiting all my life for this day. Free at last. We are free at last.  The crowds in Harare have so far given a quasi-democratic veneer to the army s intervention, backing its assertion that it is merely effecting a constitutional transfer of power, which would help it avoid the diplomatic backlash and opprobrium that normally follow a coup. The United States, a long-time Mugabe critic, said it was looking forward to a  new era  in Zimbabwe, while President Ian Khama of neighboring Botswana said Mugabe had no diplomatic support in the region and should resign at once.

"Argentina says signals detected, likely from missing submarine","MAR DEL PLATA, Argentina/BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Hopes that 44 crew members of a missing Argentine navy submarine may be found alive rose after the defense ministry said the vessel likely tried to communicate via satellite on Saturday as an international search mission was underway in the stormy South Atlantic. The ministry said seven failed  satellite calls  that it believes came from the ARA San Juan submarine were detected in a likely sign the crew was trying to reestablish contact. The signals, in the late morning and early afternoon, lasted between four and 36 seconds, the ministry said. Argentina is working on tracing the location with an unnamed U.S. company specialized in satellite communications, the ministry said. The satellite communications were believed to have failed because of foul weather, a source in the defense ministry who was not authorized to speak publicly told Reuters. It was not immediately clear what type of calls the vessel may have tried to make but submarines that are stricken underwater can float a location beacon known as an EPIRB to the surface that can then emit emergency signals via satellite. Whipping winds and more than 20-foot waves in the South Atlantic hindered the international search for the submarine. The last confirmed location of the German-built ARA San Juan was 432 km (268 miles) off Argentina s southern Atlantic coast early on Wednesday. The U.S. Navy said it was deploying a deep-sea rescue mission to Argentina from California to support the effort, with a remotely operated vehicle and two vessels capable of rescuing people from bottomed submarines set to arrive in coming days. As nations from Chile to South Africa offered help, Argentine sea vessels and planes scoured the southern sea. But a storm pitching powerful winds and waves more than 6 meters (20 feet) high has disrupted visibility and movement in the area, navy spokesman Enrique Balbi said. The submarine s color and design, which aim to camouflage the vessel in the ocean s surface, also posed a challenge.  The idea is to continue through the night and the early morning, depending on weather conditions,  Balbi told reporters. The weather was expected to be somewhat improved on Sunday, he said. A search of 80 percent of the area initially targeted for the operation turned up no sign of the vessel, but the crew should have ample supplies of food and oxygen, Balbi added. The dramatic search has captivated the nation of 44 million, which recently mourned the loss of five citizens killed when a truck driver plowed through a bicycle path in New York City. In the resort and fishing city of Mar del Plata, where the submarine had been destined to arrive before vanishing, a Catholic Mass was held in honor of the crew members. Many relatives of the crew members awaited news at the city s naval base.  We re hopeful this will end soon to remain only as a bad memory,  Maria Morales, mother of crew member Luis Esteban Garcia, told journalists. Messages of support poured in from around the world. Pope Francis, an Argentine, was praying  fervently  for the crew to return home soon, his office said. The Argentine navy said an electrical outage on the diesel-electric-propelled vessel might have downed its communications. Protocol calls for submarines to surface if communication is lost. The episode could hold political implications for President Mauricio Macri. His center-right government has set an ambitious target for cutting government spending and told Reuters in March it had few funds available to replace an outdated military fleet beyond buying aircraft for training pilots. The ARA San Juan was inaugurated in 1983, making it the newest of the three submarines in the navy s fleet. Built in Germany by Nordseewerke, it underwent mid-life maintenance in 2008 in Argentina that required cutting its hull in half and sealing back it together again, according to state news agency Telam. Nordseewerke now belongs to German industrial group Thyssenkrupp AG (TKAG.DE), which could not be reached for comment outside of regular business hours.

More than 30 rescued in Afghan raid on Taliban prison,"LASHKAR GAH, Afghanistan (Reuters) - Afghan and foreign special forces raided a Taliban prison in southern Helmand province on Sunday and rescued at least 30 people, according to army and provincial officials. Those rescued in the raid in Helmand s Nawzad district included four children under the age of 12 and two policemen, the officials said.

The Taliban said in a statement that the people rescued were criminals accused of robbery, kidnapping, personal disputes and other crimes and were awaiting trial.  There wasn t anyone belonging to the enemy in that prison and there wasn t enough security for it,  Taliban spokesman Qari Yousuf Ahmadi said in the statement. ",worldnews,"November 19, 2017 ",1
"China military sets up website to report leaks, fake news","BEIJING (Reuters) - China s military on Sunday launched a website inviting the public to report leaks and fake news, as well as illegal online activities by military personnel, the latest step in a push to ensure Communist Party control over the internet. Beijing has been ramping up measures to secure the internet and maintain strict censorship, a process that accelerated ahead of the party s five-yearly National Congress that took place in October. The new website is an effort to implement the guiding spirit of the Congress and will help maintain a  clear internet space  surrounding the military, according to 81.cn, the military s official news portal. Citizens are encouraged to use the platform to report online content that attacks the military s absolute leadership and distorts the history of the military and the Communist Party, the website said.  Cases of military personnel illegally opening online social accounts and publishing unauthorized information should also be reported, it said.  President Xi Jinping has made China s  cyber sovereignty  a top priority in his sweeping campaign to bolster security. He has also reasserted the ruling Communist Party s role in limiting and guiding online discussion. ",worldnews,"November 19, 2017 ",1
"After Macron meeting, Hariri says will clarify position in Lebanon","PARIS (Reuters) - Saad al-Hariri, who resigned as Lebanon s prime minister this month while in Saudi Arabia, said on Saturday he would clarify his position when he returns to Beirut next week.  Hariri s resignation on Nov. 4 threw Lebanon into political crisis and put it center-stage in the Middle East s overarching rivalry between Sunni Saudi Arabia and its allies and a bloc led by Shi ite Iran.  With regard to the political situation in Lebanon, I will go to Beirut in the coming days, I will participate in the independence celebrations, and it is there that I will make known my position on these subjects after meeting President (Michel) Aoun,  Hariri said after holding talks with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris. Hariri declined to take questions, but is set to return to Beirut by Wednesday when Lebanon celebrates its independence day. He thanked Macron, who has been mediating as part of French efforts to try to ease tensions across the region, for his help.  Macron had leveraged France s close relations with both Lebanon and Saudi Arabia to secure a deal that saw Hariri travel to Paris and open the door to a resolution of the crisis. Hariri, who arrived at his residence in Paris in the early hours of the morning, told Aoun in a phone call from Paris that he would be in Lebanon on Wednesday for the celebrations, the Lebanese president said on Twitter.  Lebanon is being shaken so it s important Hariri comes to Paris for us to work with him on the best way out of the crisis,  said a senior French diplomat.  We re trying to create the conditions for a de-escalation in the region. We want to avoid a proliferation of crises that could get out of control.  Hariri s abrupt resignation and continued stay in Saudi Arabia has caused fears for Lebanon s stability.  Okab Saqr, a member of parliament for Hariri s Future Movement, said after Hariri s visit to France he would have  a small Arab tour  before traveling to Beirut. A French presidential source said Macron had reiterated that Paris wanted Hariri to return to Lebanon to ensure the country s political system continued to function and that it was imperative it remained  disassociated  from regional crises.  The source said Macron would continue to be active on the dossier in the coming days and that France was considering whether to host a meeting of the International Lebanon Support Group to discuss the political crisis. The crisis has thrust Lebanon into the regional rivalry pitting Saudi Arabia and its allies against a bloc led by Iran, which includes the heavily armed Lebanese Shi ite Hezbollah group. Aoun has called Hariri a Saudi hostage and refused to accept his resignation unless he returns to Lebanon. Saudi Arabia and Hariri say his movements are not restricted. Lebanon maintains a delicate sectarian balance after Sunnis, Shi ites, Christians and Druze fought a civil war between 1975 and 1990, with factions often backed by regional rivals. Hariri, a Sunni Muslim, is a long-time ally of Saudi Arabia. Aoun, a Christian, is a political ally of Hezbollah. Hariri s government, a power-sharing coalition formed last year, includes Hezbollah. France, which controlled Lebanon between the world wars, has sought to play a key role in defusing tension with Macron personally getting involved and putting him at the heart of a regional power struggle that will test his diplomatic skills.   That was evident since the outbreak of the Lebanese crisis over the last week with a surprise visit to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh, followed by a flurry of calls, sending his foreign minister to Saudi Arabia and then the invitation to Hariri, which caught many diplomats unawares.  While undoubtedly a diplomatic coup for Macron, some regional and French diplomats have cautioned that his strategy to try to appease all sides in the region may backfire. On Saturday, U.S. President Donald Trump spoke with Macron about the situation in Lebanon and Syria. The White House said the leaders agreed on the need to work with allies to counter Hezbollah s and Iran s destabilizing activities in the region. Paris has intensified its rhetoric over Iran s regional activities. On Thursday, Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, speaking alongside his Saudi counterpart, denounced Tehran s  hegemonic temptations . Iran responded by accusing France of taking sides and Macron on Friday said Iran should clarify its ballistic missile program. That was met by a rebuke in Tehran. On Saturday, Ali Akbar Velayati, a senior adviser to Iran s supreme leader, said Macron should stay out of its affairs. ",worldnews,"November 18, 2017 ",1
Haitian army set to make controversial return after two decades,"CAP-HAITIEN/PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - Haiti s president on Saturday heralded the re-establishment of the country s military after 22 years, a divisive issue in the impoverished Caribbean nation which has a history of bloody coups and political instability. Haiti has been without military forces since 1995, when former president Jean-Bertrand Aristide disbanded the army after returning to power following a coup, leaving the national police responsible for security.       The army s comeback has been a divisive topic in a country still suffering from a catastrophic earthquake and a fierce hurricane in recent years, with critics and activists concerned that armed forces would meddle in politics and rob essential resources from education and health care. Haitian President Jovenel Moise on Thursday named former army colonel Jodel Lesage as acting commander-in-chief, moving troops closer to full operation. The appointment still needs to be approved by Haiti s senate. On Saturday, Moise welcomed the army s anticipated return with a parade featuring dozens of camouflaged soldiers toting rifles in the northern coastal city of Cap-Haitien, calling on Haitians to recall the Battle of Vertieres won against French colonialists exactly 214 years ago.  The army is our mother,  he said.  When your mother is sick and wears dirty clothes, you do not kill her. You take her to the hospital. So let us join forces to provide needed care to our mother.      After Haiti s independence, the military mounted dozens of coups and its forces were accused of rampant human rights abuses. Moise acknowledged that history, but vowed that the new military would be different.  The United Nations has called for increased support for the Haitian National Police (HNP) with about 15,000 members.  A U.N.-backed mission to aid Haiti s justice system and law enforcement arrived in October, replacing a much larger peacekeeping mission that had focused on stability efforts since 2004.  Having demonstrated its ability to maintain stability and guard against security threats, the HNP has emerged as one of the most trusted governmental institutions in Haiti,  U.N. spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement last month. Haitian defense minister Herve Denis told Reuters the army will begin with 500 soldiers in engineering, medical and aviation corps, but is still working to fill its ranks. A recruiting process was well underway by last July, attracting many young men in a country that is the poorest in the Americas. Denis said the government plans to ultimately expand to 5,000 troops working to protect Haitian borders, fight terrorism, curb illegal trade and aid Haitians affected by natural disasters. Government opponents fear the Moise administration could use the military to crack down on foes despite the president s claims that troops will steer clear of politics.  I don t believe the Moise regime really wants to reinstate the army, but instead set up a political militia to persecute political opponents,  said Andre Michel, spokesman for an opposition coalition that has called for Moise s resignation.

"Lebanese FM may not attend Arab League meeting, to decide Sunday: senior Lebanese official","BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon s foreign minister may not attend an Arab League meeting in Cairo on Sunday and a final decision will be taken in the morning, a senior Lebanese official told Reuters on Saturday. The official said Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil wanted to avoid an anticipated confrontation at the meeting with Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies over the regional role of the Iran-backed Lebanese Shi ite group Hezbollah. The emergency Arab foreign ministers meeting is being convened at the request of Saudi Arabia with support from the UAE, Bahrain, and Kuwait  to discuss means of confronting Iranian intervention in the internal affairs of Arab states,  the Egyptian state news agency MENA said. Hezbollah is part of the Lebanese government and a political ally of Lebanese President Michel Aoun.  The Sunni Muslim monarchy of Saudi Arabia and Shi ite Islamist Iran are at loggerheads across the region, and tensions between them have recently escalated in both Lebanon and Yemen. Lebanon was thrust to the forefront of the regional struggle when Saad al-Hariri resigned as prime minister on Nov. 4 in a surprise announcement from Riyadh. Aoun has accused Saudi Arabia of holding Hariri hostage. Senior Lebanese politicians close to Hariri have also said he had been held in Saudi Arabia against his will and coerced into resigning. Saudi Arabia and Hariri both deny this. After French intervention, Hariri flew to France overnight and met French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Saturday. Hariri, speaking in Paris, said he would clarify his position when he returns to Beirut in the coming days. He said he would take part in Lebanese independence day celebrations, which are scheduled for Wednesday. Hariri, long a political ally of Saudi Arabia, cited fear of assassination and accused Iran and Hezbollah of sowing strife in the Arab world during his resignation speech.

Gerry Adams: Face of IRA who helped cement Northern Ireland peace,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - As the public face of the Irish Republican Army during its bombing campaigns, then peacemaker and mainstream politician, Gerry Adams has been a defining figure of Northern Ireland s 50-year journey from sectarian torment to relative stability. Adams announced his intention to step down as leader of the Irish nationalist Sinn Fein party on Saturday with his ultimate goal of a united Ireland still elusive. But the party he leaves is not only the dominant Irish nationalist force in the British-ruled province, but also strong enough across the border in the Irish Republic to have a chance of entering government there, too. During the 1970s and 80s, at the height of an IRA bombing campaign to end British rule over Northern Ireland, Sinn Fein operated as the IRA s political wing. As its leader from 1983 onwards, Adams thus became, for many in Britain and Northern Ireland, the face of the IRA. As a result, he was loathed by pro-British unionists and the British government, but lionized in equal measure by Irish nationalists. Yet when the prospect of political progress arose, he showed himself ready to compromise, working with late former IRA commander Martin McGuinness to swing the IRA and the province s Roman Catholic minority behind a 1998 deal with the pro-British Protestant majority. The Good Friday agreement gave the province s Catholics a share of power and largely ended a conflict in which some 3,600 people had been killed, many at the hands of Irish republican groups such as the IRA, and others by pro-British unionist paramilitaries and British security forces.  Since then, Adams has helped to build Sinn Fein into the dominant Irish nationalist party in Northern Ireland, overseeing its agreement in 2007 to share power with its bitter rival, the Democratic Unionist Party and, in recent months, its efforts to restore power-sharing after it collapsed in January.  Adams also announced on Saturday that he would not stand for re-election to the Dublin parliament, where he has sat since 2011, moving Sinn Fein from the fringes to become the Irish Republic s third party and its main left-wing force.  Adams was born into a Belfast family steeped in revolutionary politics, several of his relatives having been involved in armed republicanism. At 20, he left his job as a barman to help defend fellow Catholics from what they saw as a hostile British state, and to fight for Northern Ireland to split from the United Kingdom and unite with the Irish Republic.   Like his father, Adams was interned - held without trial - on suspicion of being a senior IRA commander.  He has always denied membership of the IRA, although accusations from former IRA fighters that he was involved in its campaign of killings have dogged him throughout his career.  Between 1988 and 1994, Adams was banned from speaking on British airwaves. While his oversized glasses and red-tinged beard were instantly recognizable, his voice was unknown as broadcasters had actors dub his words. Former British conservative prime minister John Major, one of the architects of peace in Northern Ireland, once said the thought of sitting down to talk with Adams had  turned my stomach .  But Adams was at the time walking a political tightrope - between IRA  hawks  who argued that only a continuation of violence would chase Britain from the island, and  doves  who said that negotiations were the route to a united Ireland. He emerged from the political cold in October 1997 when he shook hands with the new Labour prime minister, Tony Blair, at their first meeting. Sinn Fein had polled 17 percent in Northern Ireland s elections and returned Adams to the British parliament, although he refused to take his seat.  Within a year, Adams and McGuinness had helped to broker a peace deal that largely ended the violence in the province. Since that deal, his role as statesman has grown, and he has made several visits to the White House.  He was arrested in 2014 as part of an investigation into one of the province s most controversial murders, but no charges were brought. Latterly he has used social media to create a grandfatherly image in the Irish Republic, with posts about his dog and his taste in cartoons. ",worldnews,"November 18, 2017 ",1
Official photo released to mark 70th wedding anniversary of Queen Elizabeth,"LONDON (Reuters) - Buckingham Palace issued a new photographic portrait of Queen Elizabeth and her husband Prince Philip on Saturday to mark their upcoming 70th wedding anniversary. The couple married at London s Westminster Abbey on Nov. 20, 1947, just two years after the end of World War Two, in a lavish ceremony attended by statesmen and royalty from around the world. The portrait, taken earlier this month, showed the queen wearing the same dress which she chose for a service of thanksgiving to mark their diamond wedding anniversary held at the Abbey where they were married. She is also wearing a  Scarab  brooch in yellow gold, carved ruby and diamond which Philip gave her in 1966. Elizabeth has been married for far longer than any other royal, and the newly-released picture showed the couple framed by Thomas Gainsborough s 1781 portraits of George III and Queen Charlotte, who were married for 57 years - the second longest royal marriage.

Turkey launches investigation into U.S. prosecutors over Zarrab case: Anadolu,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish authorities have opened an investigation into the U.S. prosecutors who brought charges against a Turkish gold trader facing trial in New York, state media said on Saturday, after Ankara said the case was based on fabricated documents. The Istanbul prosecutor s office is investigating former U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara and acting U.S. Attorney John H. Kim, the state-run Anadolu news agency said, following allegations that their case was based on documents Turkey says were fabricated. When asked for comment, Bharara referred Reuters to the Southern District of New York s Attorney s Office. James Margolin, a spokesman for the Attorney s Office, declined to comment.  Reuters was not immediately able to reach anyone at the Istanbul Prosecutor s office for comment. The reported move comes after Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu on Friday said the U.S. case was based on documents fabricated by followers of the cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Ankara blames for last year s attempted coup. Cavusoglu also accused Bharara of being  very close  to Gulen s network.  Following those allegations, Bharara responded on Friday on Twitter, saying:  Turkey FM is a liar. Now let s see what happens in court . The case against the wealthy, Iran-born gold trader Reza Zarrab has complicated already strained relations between the United States and Turkey, both members of the NATO military alliance. Zarrab, together with alleged co-conspirators, has been charged with handling hundreds of millions of dollars for Iran s government and Iranian entities from 2010 to 2015, in a scheme to avoid sanctions. He has pleaded not guilty and is due to go on trial in New York on Nov. 27. Under a previous Turkish investigation that became public in 2013, Turkish prosecutors accused Zarrab and high-ranking Turkish officials of involvement in facilitating Iranian money transfers via gold smuggling, leaked documents at the time showed. President Tayyip Erdogan, then prime minister, cast that investigation as a coup attempt orchestrated by his political enemies. Several prosecutors were removed from the case, police investigators were reassigned, and the investigation was later dropped. Erdogan, who has not been accused of any wrongdoing, has said U.S. prosecutors have  ulterior motives  by including references to him and his wife in court papers relating to the trial in New York.

"Party set to sack Mugabe, Zimbabweans celebrate expected downfall","HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe s ruling party will dismiss President Robert Mugabe on Sunday and reinstate Emmerson Mnangagwa, the vice-president he fired, two party sources told Reuters on Saturday, as ecstatic crowds celebrated the expected downfall. Mugabe s 37-year rule has been effectively at an end since the army seized control on Wednesday, confining him to his residence, saying it wanted to target the  criminals  around him. State television said Mugabe would meet military commanders on Sunday, quoting Catholic priest Fidelis Mukonori, who has been mediating in negotiations with the president. But hundreds of thousands of people had no need for a formal signal that his time had ended as they flooded the streets of Harare, singing, dancing and hugging soldiers. In scenes reminiscent of the downfall of Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in 1989, men, women and children ran alongside the armoured cars and the troops who stepped in this week to oust the only ruler Zimbabwe has known since independence in 1980. Others marched towards his lavish  Blue Roof  residence, but were kept away by soldiers. Under house arrest in his compound, the 93-year-old has watched support from his party, security services and people evaporate in less than three days. The sources said a ZANU-PF party central committee meeting scheduled for 10:30 a.m. (0830 GMT) would also dismiss 93-year-old Mugabe s preferred successor, his wife Grace, from her role as head of the ZANU-PF Women s League. Mugabe s nephew Patrick Zhuwao, speaking from an undisclosed  location in South Africa, told Reuters the leader and his wife were  ready to die for what is correct  rather than step down in order to legitimise what he described as a coup.  Zhuwao also said that only Mugabe, who had hardly slept since the military took over but was otherwise in  good  health, could call a meeting of the central committee. It was not clear from reading the party s constitution who is empowered to call such a meeting - but events appeared to have made the issue irrelevant. On Harare s streets, Zimbabweans spoke of a second liberation for the former British colony, alongside their dreams of political and economic change after two decades of deepening repression and hardship.  These are tears of joy,  said Frank Mutsindikwa, 34, holding aloft the Zimbabwean flag.  I ve been waiting all my life for this day. Free at last. We are free at last.  Mugabe s downfall is likely to send shockwaves across Africa, where a number of entrenched strongmen, from Uganda s Yoweri Museveni to Democratic Republic of Congo s Joseph Kabila, are facing mounting pressure to step aside. The crowds in Harare have so far given a quasi-democratic veneer to the army s intervention, backing its claims that it is merely effecting a constitutional transfer of power, which would help it avoid the diplomatic backlash and opprobrium that normally follows a coup. The military had been prompted to act by Mugabe s decision to sack Mnangagwa, Grace Mugabe s main rival to succeed her husband. The next presidential election is due next year.  Zimbabweans abroad were also hailing the end of Mugabe s rule, not least the hundreds living in Britain who gathered outside their embassy in central London.  I m ecstatic to see people give Mugabe a reality check because he has been in his echo chamber for too long, lying to himself that people still want him,  said Ruva Kudambo, 37, who came to study technology and ended up staying. Tasa, a 36-year-old who refused to give his family name, said he had brought his four young children, aged 5 to 9, to the protest  because they are the future of Zimbabwe . NO DIS-GRACE For some Africans, Mugabe remains a nationalist hero, the continent s last independence leader and a symbol of its struggle to throw off the legacy of decades of colonial subjugation. But to many more at home and abroad, he was reviled as a dictator happy to resort to violence to retain power and to run a once-promising economy into the ground. Political sources and intelligence documents seen by Reuters said Mugabe s exit was likely to pave the way for an interim unity government led by Mnangagwa, a life-long Mugabe aide and former security chief known as  The Crocodile . Stabilising the free-falling economy will be the number one priority, the documents said. The United States, a long-time critic of Mugabe, said it was looking forward to a  new era  in Zimbabwe, while President Ian Khama of neighbouring Botswana said Mugabe had no diplomatic support in the region and should resign at once. The Herald, the state newspaper that has served as Mugabe s loyal mouthpiece, said ZANU-PF had called on Friday for him to go. It said ZANU-PF branches in all 10 provinces had also called for the resignation of Grace, the first lady whose ambitions to succeed her husband outraged the military and much of the country. To many Zimbabweans, she is known as  Gucci Grace  on account of her reported dedication to shopping, or - in the wake of an alleged assault in September on a South African model -  Dis-Grace . The scenes in Harare reflect the anger and frustration that has built up among Zimbabwe s 16 million people in nearly two decades of economic mismanagement that started with the seizure of white-owned farms in 2000, the catalyst of a wider collapse. The central bank tried to print its way out of trouble by unleashing a flood of cash but that only made matters worse, leading to hyperinflation that topped out at 500 billion percent in 2008. At least 3 million Zimbabweans emigrated in search of a better life, most of them to neighbouring South Africa. After stabilising briefly when Mugabe was forced to work with the opposition in a 2009-2013 unity government, the economy has collapsed again, this time due to a chronic shortage of dollars. In October, monthly inflation leapt to more than 50 percent, according to some economists, putting basic goods beyond the means of many in a country with 90 percent unemployment.  Mugabe s only public appearance since the military took over was at a university graduation ceremony on Friday morning. Decked out in blue and yellow academic gowns, he appeared tired, at one point falling asleep in his chair. A senior member of ZANU-PF said it was only a matter of time before he agreed to go.  If he becomes stubborn, we will arrange for him to be fired on Sunday,  the source said.  When that is done, it s impeachment on Tuesday.  ",worldnews,"November 18, 2017 ",1
Egyptian activists detained by court for protesting Red Sea islands transfer,"ALEXANDRIA, EGYPT (Reuters) - A court in Alexandria has ordered the detention of leading rights activist Mahienour el-Massry over charges of illegally protesting in June against the Egyptian government s decision to transfer two Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia. El-Massry was detained in Egypt s second largest city along with activist Moatasim Medhat and both will be held pending their trial for illegal assembly on Dec. 30, the misdemeanour court said. The pair s lawyer, Taher Abo Nasser, said they denied the charges, adding that there was no evidence of a protest taking place.  The decision came as a shock for us but Mahienour is remaining strong and accepting,  Abo Nasser said. The plan to cede the islands to Saudi Arabia was announced last year and has become mired in political protest and legal action. Opponents of the plan say Egypt s sovereignty over the islands dates back to 1906, before Saudi Arabia was founded. Saudi and Egyptian officials say the islands belong to the kingdom and were only under Egyptian control because Riyadh had asked Cairo in 1950 to protect them. ",worldnews,"November 18, 2017 ",1

Ukraine summons Polish envoy as diplomatic row between neighbours deepens,"WARSAW (Reuters) - Ukraine has summoned the Polish ambassador in Kiev after Poland denied entry to a Ukrainian official in an escalation of a diplomatic spat over the two neighbours  troubled past. Poland s decision to refused entry on Saturday to the head of Ukraine s commemoration commission, Svyatoslav Sheremet, was in response to a ban imposed earlier this year by Kiev on the exhumation of Poles killed in Ukraine during World War Two, Polish state news agency PAP reported.     The Ukrainian side has complained that Mr Sheremet was not allowed into Poland,  Poland s ambassador to Kiev Jan Pieklo told PAP after the meeting with Ukrainian authorities.  I have been also informed that this is a problem that concerns the restarting of exhumations because Sheremet is the person responsible for this,  Pieklo said, adding that both sides had agreed that the exhumations should be restarted. In an apparent effort to mend ties, representatives of the Polish and Ukrainian presidents said on Friday that they  reconfirmed their commitment to strengthening the strategic partnership .  The parties agreed that the ban on the search and exhumation works in Ukraine should be lifted,  the statement published on Friday said.  The denial of entry to Sheremet came after the Polish foreign minister said earlier in November that Poland would bar Ukrainians with  anti-Polish views . [L8N1N84EF]    Poland last year passed a resolution that declared the World War Two-era killing of about 100,000 Polish men, women and children by units in the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA)  genocide .  Ukraine rejects that label, saying the killings were a result of bilateral hostilities. ",worldnews,"November 18, 2017 ",1
German parties regroup for last-ditch coalition push,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany s three would-be coalition partners went deep into overtime in talks on Saturday as they sought enough common ground in climate and migration policy to form a government and stave off the prospect of a repeat election. Incumbent chancellor Angela Merkel s only realistic hope of securing a fourth term after suffering losses in September s election is an awkward three-way conservative-liberal-Green alliance. But after four weeks of talks, the parties remained far apart as they adjourned for the night. The biggest sticking points are climate change, where the Greens want emissions cuts that the other parties see as economically ruinous, and immigration, where Merkel s arch-conservative allies in Bavaria insist on stricter rules.  With the pro-business, tax-cutting Free Democrat (FDP) liberals freshly returned to parliament after four years in the wilderness, and the Greens out of office for 12 years, neither is keen to give ground. A self-imposed deadline of Thursday for wrapping up exploratory talks and starting formal coalition negotiations passed without agreement, forcing the conservatives to promise further concessions on emissions cuts to the Greens. FDP leader Christian Lindner said the talks now had to be wrapped up by 1700 GMT on Sunday. But President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, a former foreign minister who now plays an apolitical role, said brinkmanship was to be expected.  Before the formal talks start, there are always attempts by parties to drive prices up,  he told the weekly Welt am Sonntag.  What we ve seen in the past weeks isn t so different from previous coalition negotiations.  Greens chairwoman Simone Peter said much that had earlier been agreed on emissions policy had been undone, without giving details. Bavaria s Christian Social Union (CSU) faces regional state elections next year, and fears the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) could unseat it after 60 years if it fails to secure tough immigration rules - which are anathema to the left-leaning Greens. Among its demands are a cap of 200,000 per year on the number of refugees Germany will take, and an end to the practice of allowing successful asylum seekers to bring their immediate families to join them. All parties are anxious to avoid a repeat election, which they fear could boost the AfD, which surged into parliament for the first time in September s national election. But the heterogeneous three-way coalition, made necessary after the conservatives and the centre-left suffered punishing election losses, is untested at national level.

Saudi Arabia recalls ambassador to Germany over Gabriel comments,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has summoned its ambassador in Germany home for consultations over comments by German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel about the political crisis in Lebanon. The Saudi foreign ministry said the government also handed Germany s representative in Riyadh a protest note over what it said were  shameful  comments Gabriel made after a meeting with his Lebanese counterpart. After a meeting in Berlin with Lebanese Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil, Gabriel told reporters that Europe  could not tolerate the adventurism that has spread there . It was not clear from a Reuters television recording that the remark was targeted at Saudi Arabia. Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri resigned while in Saudi Arabia on Nov. 4.  Such remarks provoke the surprise and disapproval of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia which considers them as aimless and based on false information that would not help bring about stability in the region,  the Saudi ministry said. The ministry later said on its Twitter account it had summoned the German ambassador in Riyadh and handed him  a protest memorandum over the shameful and unjustified remarks made by the German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel.  Hariri s abrupt resignation has raised concern over Lebanon s stability. He met French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Saturday, several hours after he left Saudi Arabia. Lebanon s President Michel Aoun said on Twitter Hariri had told him in a phone call from Paris he would be in Lebanon on Wednesday for Independence Day celebrations. The German foreign ministry welcomed Hariri s departure from Saudi Arabia for Paris and impending return to Lebanon.  We are very concerned about regional stability and call on sides to reduce tensions,  the statement read.  We aim this message at all actors in the region.  ",worldnews,"November 18, 2017 ",1
"China wants Bangladesh, Myanmar to solve Rohingya crisis bilaterally","DHAKA (Reuters) - Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Saturday urged Bangladesh and Myanmar resolve the Rohingya crisis through bilateral negotiations instead of an international initiative.  The international community should not complicate the situation,  Wang said in a press briefing at the Chinese Embassy in Dhaka.   Actions in the United Nations Security Council must help Bangladesh-Myanmar bilateral cooperation to resolve the problem peacefully , the minister told reporters. Wang arrived in Bangladesh on Saturday for a two-day visit and from there he will go to Myanmar to attend the Asia-Europe  Meeting. (ASEM)  China supports resolving the crisis peacefully, bilaterally with mutual consultation between Bangladesh and Myanmar,  he said. More than 600,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh since late August driven out by a military clearance operation in Buddhist majority Myanmar s Rakhine State.  It is a complex situation and needs a comprehensive solution. Economic development of Rakhine State is needed. China is ready to help,  Wang said. Earlier in the day Wang also met with Bangladesh s Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina at her official residence in Dhaka and assured her of China s support in solving the crisis.  Myanmar will have to take back their nationals ensuring their safety, security and dignity for a durable solution to the crisis,  Hasina s private secretary Ihsanul Karim quoted the prime minister as saying.  We will not allow the land of Bangladesh to be used by any terrorist group to commit any act of insurgency in neighboring countries,  Hasina added, according to Karim. Bangladesh s Foreign Minister Abul Hassan Mahmood Ali told Wang that Bangladesh is trying to resolve the issue both bilaterally and internationally as it could not afford the huge burden of the refugees. A statement from Bangladesh foreign ministry said that when the issue of displaced Myanmar nationals was raised, Wang stated that China would help resolve the issue and will not be partial to any side. He acknowledged that Bangladesh is facing the brunt of continuing influx of Rohingya refugees, the Bangladeshi foreign ministry statement said. A delegation of U.S. Congressmen is visiting Bangladesh to study the Rohingya crisis on Saturday. Sweden s foreign minister Margot Wallstrom, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini, Germany s foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel and  Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kona will also visit Bangladesh this week.

Cambodian court charges two journalists with espionage,"PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - A Cambodian court on Saturday charged two journalists with espionage for filing news reports to a U.S.-funded radio station, which can carry a prison term of up to 15 years. Prime Minister Hun Sen, the strongman who has ruled Cambodia for more than three decades, has taken a strident anti-American line in an increasingly tense run-up to a 2018 election and there has been a crackdown on critics, rights groups and independent media. The United States announced it was ending funding for the election, and promised more  concrete steps , after the Supreme Court dissolved the main opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) on Thursday at the request of the government, on the grounds it was plotting to seize power. The party denied the accusation.     The two journalists, Uon Chhin and Yeang Sothearin, had in the past worked for the Washington-based Radio Free Asia (RFA) which broadcast in the Khmer language until it shut down in September. The two were charged with  providing information that is destructive to national defense to a foreign state , when they were caught filing stories to RFA, said Ly Sophana, a spokesman at Phnom Penh Municipal Court.  They will be sent to an investigating judge for further procedures,  Ly Sophana told Reuters. RFA has said it had no ties to the two journalists since it shut its Phnom Penh office in September.  In charging two former RFA journalists with espionage, Cambodian authorities have opened the door to more serious forms of intimidation worthy of despots and dictators,  RFA spokesman Rohit Mahajan said in emailed comments. A lawyer for the two said the charges were too serious and they had merely been doing their jobs as journalists.  This is not dangerous to the country,  said the lawyer, Keo Vanny.   The charges carried up to 15 years in prison if the men were convicted, he said. Hun Sen has been fighting a deepening war of words with the U.S. embassy and State Department over his government s crackdown on the opposition. CNRP leader Kem Sokha was arrested on Sept. 3 and charged with treason for an alleged plot to take power with U.S. help. He denied any such pot. The U.S. State Department called on Friday for Cambodia to release him and reverse the decision to ban his party. Western countries, which for decades supported Cambodia s emergence from war and isolation, have shown little appetite for sanctions in response to the government s crackdown, but the European Union has raised the possibility of Cambodia losing vital trade preferences.

Vatican says investigating alleged abuser who became priest,"VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The Vatican said on Saturday it had opened an investigation into  reports that a former teenage altar boy, who allegedly repeatedly forced a dormitory mate to have sex with him, went on to become a priest. The allegations concerning the St. Pius X Institute, known as a pre-seminary, were made in a recent book and in Italian television reports. The pre-seminary is a residence inside the Vatican for altar boys who serve at masses in St. Peter s Basilica mostly presided over by priests, bishops and cardinals. At times they also participate in papal liturgies.  The boys go to Italian schools while they live in the Vatican, a sovereign city-state surrounded by Rome. The reports said that despite complaints to superiors against the teenager, he was accepted into what is known as a major seminary when he became an adult. He was later ordained a priest and is now serving in a parish in northern Italy, they said. The statement said an initial investigation in 2013 had resulted in  no adequate confirmation . A new investigation had been opened following the latest reports in order to try to shed  full light on what really happened , it added. ",worldnews,"November 18, 2017 ",1

Sri Lanka arrests 19 after Buddhist-Muslim violence; four injured,"COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lankan police arrested 19 people after a clash between  extremists  from the majority Buddhist and minority Muslim communities in which four people were injured, a spokesman said on Saturday. Tension has been growing between the two communities this year, with some hardline Buddhist groups accusing Muslims of forcing people to convert to Islam and vandalizing Buddhist archaeological sites. Some Buddhists nationalists have also protested against the presence in Sri Lanka of asylum seekers from mostly Buddhist Myanmar s persecuted Rohingya Muslim minority. Police said the late Friday violence in the southern coastal town of Ginthota was triggered by rumors and fake messages on social media.  This was a clash between a small fraction of extremists in the both ethnic groups,  police spokesman Ruwan Gunasekera told Reuters.  One of those arrested was a woman who falsely spread news that Muslims were about to attack a Buddhist temple, he said.  We ve decided to arrest those who have been spreading false messages and rumors on social media.  Later police said all 19 suspects have been remanded until Nov. 30 and a local curfew had been imposed in the clash area for 12 hours to 0600 hours (0300 GMT) on Sunday.  Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayaka said  some political groups are now on a desperate mission to turn this minor brawl into a Sinhala-Muslim clash .   I urge the public not to be misled by their false propaganda,  he said. Additional police battalions, elite police forces, the anti-riot squad and the military were called late on Friday to bring the situation under control.  Buddhists make up about 70 percent of Sri Lanka s population of 21 million, compared with about 9 percent for Muslims. President Maithripala Sirisena s government, after coming under fire from rights groups and diplomats for not doing enough to crack down on hardline Buddhist groups, acted against anti-Muslim attackers in June this year.  That response came after more than 20 attacks on Muslims, including arson at Muslim-owned businesses and petrol-bomb attacks on mosques, were recorded in two months. In 2014, three Muslims were killed in riots stirred up by hardline Buddhist groups. ",worldnews,"November 18, 2017 ",1

"Selfies with soldiers as Zimbabweans hail ""second independence""","HARARE (Reuters) - Helen Kwambana has lived in fear of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and his security forces her whole life. On Saturday she chanted on the streets of the capital for the 93-year-old to step down and took a selfie with a soldier.   Kwambana and tens of thousands of others joined anti-Mugabe marches in Harare, singing and dancing as military helicopters flew overhead and grinning soldiers made token attempts to control the revelers who rushed to embrace them. Though Mugabe has not agreed to stand down, the crowds oozed with confidence that his time would soon be up, in scenes of jubilant defiance most had never witnessed.  I have never known freedom,  Kwambana, 23, told Reuters, draped in the Zimbabwean flag and waving to passing cars as drivers honked their horns in celebration.  It s like a baby opening its eyes for the first time.  Mugabe is under house arrest after the army seized power on Wednesday in what it said was an attempt to weed out the  criminals  in his government who helped remove vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa and his allies this month. Mugabe s wife, Grace, was seen as being behind the purge as she pursued her own presidential ambitions. Some of the demonstrators held placards emblazoned with Mnangagwa s face or covered with the words:  No to Mugabe Dynasty . Mugabe is accused by many Zimbabweans of ruling like a dictator, destroying a once-promising economy and of numerous human rights abuses during his nearly four decades in power. Contempt for the  Grand Old Man of Africa  brought together young and old, black and white, in the aptly named Robert Mugabe Street before they marched on to State House - the first time anyone has demonstrated outside the presidential offices without Mugabe s permission.  He is an evil man. Very, very wicked,  said Tendai, a 40-year-old laborer who was leading chants of  Freedom! .  Mugabe may be under house arrest but we have been living under country arrest our whole lives.  Many protesters spoke of their hopes for a better life in a country that has lurched from one crisis to the next and where most of the 16 million people live in poverty, as Mugabe and his family have amassed huge wealth. The crumbling buildings, boarded up shops and twisted figures of disabled beggars in Harare s streets bear witness to the poverty many hope will be tackled after Mugabe leaves.  We were praying for this day to come. Life has been very painful but we have been liberated,  said Kevin Mugwampi, who lost his job as a banker during a 2008 recession.  Today marks our second independence.  ",worldnews,"November 18, 2017 ",1

Freeport evacuating Indonesian mine worker families after shootings,"TIMIKA, Indonesia (Reuters) - U.S. miner Freeport-McMoRan Inc is evacuating spouses and children of workers from its giant Indonesian copper mine after a string of shootings in the area raised security concerns. The move follows efforts by Indonesian authorities on Friday to evacuate villages near Freeport s Grasberg mine in the eastern province of Papua that authorities said had been occupied by armed separatists. Since August at least 12 people have been injured and two police officers have been killed by gunmen with suspected links to separatist rebels. Freeport has asked family and household members of its employees to prepare over the weekend for a temporary relocation from the mining town of Tembagapura, about 10 km (6.2 miles) from Grasberg, company sources said. Workers have been asked to stay behind and maintain their work schedule, they said. Details of the evacuation or the number of people impacted were not immediately clear.

Egypt-Gaza border opens under PA control for first time in a decade,"GAZA (Reuters) - The Egypt-Gaza border opened under control of the Western-backed Palestinian Authority for the first time since 2007 on Saturday, raising residents  hopes for easier passage in and out of the impoverished enclave. An Egyptian-brokered reconciliation deal last month formally restored Palestinian President Abbas s administrative control of Gaza, including its border crossings with Israel and Egypt, after a 10-year schism with Islamist Hamas. Palestinians hope the pact will ease Gaza s economic woes and help them present a united front in their drive for statehood, although the details of implementation of the deal have yet to be worked out fully. Citing security concerns, Egypt and Israel maintain tight restrictions at their Gaza borders. Hamas, regarded by the West as a terrorist group, seized the enclave in 2007 after fighting forces loyal to Abbas. Hamas quit positions at three Gaza crossings and handed them over to Palestinian Authority employees on Nov. 1, in a step seen as vital to encouraging Israel and Egypt to ease their restrictions on the movement of goods and people. Witnesses said at least five buses loaded with passengers crossed over to the Egyptian side of the Rafah border crossing on Saturday. Hamas-appointed policemen had checked travellers  documents in a separate hall outside Rafah.  Egypt has not yet signaled any change to its present policy under which it opens the border crossing three times a week. Palestinians are hoping the crossing will operate full-time, as it had been doing until 2007. About 30,000 Gazans have applied for entry to Egypt in the past few months, according to the Palestinian Interior Ministry. Egypt will host further talks with Hamas, Fatah and other factions next week on Nov. 21 to discuss major reconciliation issues, including security arrangements and a possible date for Palestinian presidential and parliamentary elections. Responsibility for security remains an open issue in Gaza, where Hamas, which still polices the territory, has what analysts say are at least 25,000 well-equipped fighters. The group refuses to disarm, as demanded by Israel and the United States. ",worldnews,"November 18, 2017 ",1
Venezuela opposition leader Ledezma flees to Spain,"CARACAS/BOGOTA (Reuters) - Veteran Venezuelan opposition leader Antonio Ledezma, under house arrest since 2015 for alleged coup plotting, escaped across the border to Colombia on Friday and later flew to Spain. With a 2018 presidential election looming, an array of major Venezuelan opposition figures are now in exile, detention or are barred from holding office. They say Maduro has turned Venezuela into a dictatorship, while the government accuses them of joining forces with a U.S.-led global plot to topple him. Ledezma, the best-known detained opponent of leftist President Nicolas Maduro after Leopoldo Lopez, had spearheaded street protests against Maduro in 2014 that led to months of violence and 43 deaths.  In Spain today I feel free,  he said at Madrid s Barajas airport, where he arrived in the early hours of Saturday. He was cheered by a small crowd including his wife and two daughters, who were already in Spain. Supporters chanted the Venezuelan anthem.  Let s not permit that Venezuela dies in our hands,  he also said, adding that he would soon meet with Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy. The 62-year-old former Caracas metropolitan mayor said he had gone past 29 police and army controls during a clandestine, overland journey that he kept secret from his loved ones.  I ask my wife and daughters to understand. They have suffered long hours of anguish without knowing where I was,  he told reporters in the Colombian border town of Cucuta after crossing a bridge from San Antonio in Venezuela.  It was my decision alone.    Welcome to freedom!  tweeted former Colombian President Andres Pastrana, who is close to Venezuela s opposition and the families of other jailed activists. Ledezma was mocked by Maduro as  The Vampire,  and accused by officials of helping violent hardliners, including dissident military officers plotting to topple the president via air strikes. Ledezma said those charges were trumped up.  I hope they never send him back, they can keep the Vampire,  Maduro said on Friday evening.  The people of Madrid will have to be careful at night, the Vampire (is going) to Madrid.  Before boarding a private plane to Bogota, Ledezma said he was planning a  global pilgrimage  to fight for political freedom in Venezuela. He thanked Colombia s government, which also recently gave asylum to another high-profile Venezuelan dissident, former state prosecutor Luisa Ortega.  It s time for him (Maduro) to step aside and allow a transition government,  said Ledezma.  Maduro cannot keep torturing the Venezuelan people, he s killing Venezuelans with hunger.  The OPEC nation of 30 million people is suffering a fourth year of brutal recession, with the highest inflation in the world, shortages of food and medicines, and many people having to skip meals or suffering preventable illnesses. Government supporters have long vilified Ledezma for supporting a brief 2002 coup and accused him of corruption. State media repeatedly show a video where a jailed student radical lauds him as  an old fox ... the politician who most supported the resistance.  Ledezma, along with another opposition leader, Maria Corina Machado, has been part of the more militant wing of Venezuela s opposition coalition. Both oppose a planned new political dialogue between the opposition and government scheduled for early December in the Dominican Republic.  I left my flag with Maria Corina Machado, in whom I trust completely,  Ledezma told reporters. Ledezma won the Caracas mayoralty in 2008, but some of his functions and funding were quickly transferred to a new, pro-government office. Upstaged by younger opposition leaders, Ledezma was not viewed as a future presidential candidate. Intelligence agents took him from his office in Caracas in February 2015. He was originally held at the Ramo Verde military prison before being granted house arrest.   Machado told reporters Ledezma had been under increasing pressure from authorities and had faced threats to return him to Ramo Verde due to his opposition to the political dialogue.  We believe in real negotiations, but only ones that lead to the exit of the dictatorship,  she told reporters. ",worldnews,"November 17, 2017 ",1

France should not interfere in Iran's missile program: adviser to Iran's supreme leader,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - France should not interfere in Iran s missile program, Ali Akbar Velayati, a senior adviser to Iran s supreme leader, said on Saturday according to state media. French President Emmanuel Macron said on Friday that Tehran should be less aggressive in the region and should clarify the strategy around its ballistic missile program.  It does not benefit Mr. Macron and France to interfere on the missile issue and the strategic affairs of the Islamic Republic, which we have great sensitivities about,  Velayati said.  What does this issue have to do with Mr. Macron? Who is he at all to interfere? If he wants relations between Iran and France to grow then he should try not to interfere in these issues.  U.S. President Donald Trump has said Iranian missile activity should be curbed. Iranian officials have repeatedly said the Islamic Republic s missile program is for defense purposes and is not up for negotiation. The program was not part of the 2015 nuclear deal with Western powers under which Iran agreed to curb its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of some sanctions. France said on Wednesday it wanted an  uncompromising  dialogue with Iran about its ballistic missile program and a possible negotiation over the issue separate from Tehran s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.

Lebanon's Hariri leaves Saudi Arabia for France on Friday,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Saad al-Hariri, who sparked a crisis by resigning as Lebanese prime minister on Nov. 4 during a visit to Saudi Arabia, is on his way to the airport, he said early on Saturday, before his flight from Riyadh to France.  Hariri s abrupt resignation while he was in Saudi Arabia and his continued stay there caused fears over Lebanon s stability. His visit to France with his family to meet President Emmanuel Macron is seen as part of a possible way out of the crisis.   I am on the way to the airport,  he said in a Tweet.  However, Okab Saqr, a member of parliament for Hariri s Future Movement, said that after Hariri s visit to France, he would have  a small Arab tour  before traveling to Beirut. Macron, speaking in Sweden, said Hariri  intends to return to his country in the coming days, weeks . The crisis has thrust Lebanon into the bitter rivalry pitting Saudi Arabia and its allies against a bloc led by Iran, which includes the heavily armed Lebanese Shi ite Hezbollah group.  In Lebanon, Hariri has long been an ally of Riyadh. His coalition government, formed in a political deal last year to end years of paralysis, includes Hezbollah.  President Michel Aoun, a political ally of Hezbollah, has called Hariri a Saudi hostage and refused to accept his resignation unless he returns to Lebanon. Saudi Arabia and Hariri say his movements are not restricted. On Wednesday, Macron invited Hariri to visit France along with his family, providing what French diplomats said might be a way to reduce tensions surrounding the crisis by demonstrating that Hariri could leave Saudi Arabia. Lebanese politicians from across the political spectrum have called for Hariri to return to the country, saying it is necessary to resolve the crisis.  Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil, who heads President Aoun s political party, said on Thursday Beirut could escalate the crisis if Hariri did not return home.  We have adopted self-restraint so far to arrive at this result so that we don t head towards diplomatic escalation and the other measures available to us,  he said during a European tour aimed at building pressure for a solution to the crisis. Saudi Arabia regards Hezbollah as a conduit for Iranian interference across the Middle East, particularly in Syria, Yemen and Bahrain. It says it has no problem with Hezbollah remaining a purely political party, but has demanded it surrender its arms, which the group says are needed to defend Lebanon.  Although Riyadh has said it accepted Hariri s decision to join a coalition with Hezbollah last year, after Hariri announced his resignation Saudi Arabia accused Lebanon of declaring war on it because of Hezbollah s regional role. Lebanon, where Sunni, Shi ite, Christian and Druze groups fought a 1975-1990 civil war, maintains a governing system intended to balance sectarian groups. The prime minister is traditionally from the Sunni community, of which Hariri is the most influential leader. On Friday, Hariri said in a tweet that his presence in Saudi Arabia was for  consultations on the future of the situation in Lebanon and its relations with the surrounding Arab region .  His scheduled meeting with Macron in Paris on Saturday, and a lunch that his family will also attend, comes the day before Arab foreign ministers meet in Cairo to discuss Iran.  Maha Yahya, director of the Carnegie Middle East Centre in Beirut, says it appears Saudi Arabia hopes the ministers will adopt a  strongly worded statement  against Iran. But she said not all the countries share Riyadh s view that one way to confront Iran is to apply pressure on Lebanon.  There is quite a widespread understanding that there is only so much Lebanon can do and it doesn t serve anybody to turn Lebanon into your next arena for a fight between Iran and Saudi Arabia,  said.

Syria toxic gas inquiry to end after Russia again blocks U.N. renewal,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - An international investigation into who is to blame for chemical weapons attacks in Syria will end on Friday after Russia blocked for the third time in a month attempts at the United Nations to renew the inquiry, which Moscow has slammed as flawed.  In the past two years, the joint U.N. and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) inquiry has found the Syrian government used the nerve agent sarin in an April 4 attack and has also several times used chlorine as a weapon. It blamed Islamic State militants for using mustard gas. Russia vetoed on Friday a Japanese-drafted U.N. Security Council resolution to extend the inquiry for one month. It was an eleventh-hour bid to buy more time for negotiations after Russia blocked U.S.-drafted resolutions on Thursday and Oct. 24 to renew the investigation, which the council created in 2015. Syrian ally Russia has cast 11 vetoes on possible Security Council action on Syria since the country s civil war began in 2011. The Japanese draft received 12 votes in favor on Friday, while China abstained and Bolivia joined Russia to vote no. After Friday s vote, the council moved to closed-door discussions at the request of Sweden s U.N. Ambassador Olof Skoog to  ensure we are absolutely convinced we have exhausted every avenue, every effort  to try and renew the investigation. After a brief discussion, Italian U.N. Ambassador Sebastiano Cardi, council president for November, told reporters:  The council will continue to work in the coming hours and days, constructively, to find a common position.  Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the council earlier on Friday that the inquiry could only be extended if  fundamental flaws in its work  were fixed. He said that for the past two year the investigators had  rubber-stamped baseless accusations against Syria.  The council voted on a rival Russian-drafted resolution on Thursday to renew the inquiry, but it failed after only garnering four votes in favor. A resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the United States, France, Russia, Britain or China to be adopted.   Russia is wasting our time,  U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told the council on Friday.  Russia s actions today and in recent weeks have been designed to delay, to distract and ultimately to defeat the effort to secure accountability for chemical weapons attacks in Syria,  Haley said. While Russia agreed to the creation of the inquiry two years ago, it has consistently questioned its work and conclusions. The April 4 sarin attack on Khan Sheikhoun that killed dozens of people prompted the United States to launch missiles on a Syrian air base. Haley warned on Thursday:  We will do it again if we must.  Despite the public deadlock and war of words between the United States and Russia at the United Nations, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on Thursday that President Donald Trump believed he could work with Russian President Vladimir Putin on issues like Syria. Syria agreed to destroy its chemical weapons in 2013 under a deal brokered by Russia and the United States. ",worldnews,"November 17, 2017 ",1
"Greeks march to mark 1973 student revolt against junta, clashes break out","ATHENS (Reuters) - Greek police clashed with hooded youths in Athens on Friday after thousands marched to mark a bloody 1973 student uprising that helped topple the military junta which then ruled the country.  More than 10,000 people marched peacefully to the embassy of the United States, which some Greeks accuse of having supported the seven-year military dictatorship. About 5,000 police were deployed in the streets of central Athens. At the tail-end of the demonstration, hooded youths hurled stones and petrol bombs at police in the Exarchia district in central Athens, often the setting for such clashes. Police used teargas to disperse them. Earlier on Friday, Greeks laid flowers at the Athens Polytechnic University to honor those killed during the revolt. The junta collapsed less than a year later. The annual protest often becomes a focal point for protests against government policies and austerity measures mandated by the country s international lenders in exchange for bailout funds. The crisis that broke out in 2010 has left hundreds of thousands of people unemployed.   Protesters held banners reading:  We will live freely  and  No pensioner will be fired!   After seven years of belt-tightening Greeks hope that they will emerge from lenders  supervision in August 2018, when the country s third international bailout expires.

The asylum seekers have shut themselves inside the Australian-run Manus Island Centre for the past 18 days, defying attempts by Australia and Papua New Guinea (PNG) to close it in a standoff the United Nations describes as a  looming humanitarian crisis . Australia has shut access to the center, and staff, including doctors, have left, leaving the men without sufficient food, clean water, power or medical care. Members of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) voted unanimously on Saturday to call on the government to grant access to the center so doctors could assess the men s health, wellbeing and living conditions.  The AMA has made many representations on this matter, both publicly and in private but, with a worsening and more dangerous situation emerging on Manus, the federal council strongly believes that urgent action and answers are needed,  AMA President Michael Gannon said.  It is our responsibility as a nation with a strong human rights record to ensure that we look after the health and wellbeing of these men, and provide them with safe and hygienic living conditions.  Government spokesmen were not immediately available for comment. Australia s  sovereign borders  immigration policy, under which it refuses to allow asylum seekers arriving by boat to reach its shores, has been heavily criticized by the United Nations and human rights groups but has bipartisan political support in Australia. The 421 asylum seekers on Manus island say they fear violent reprisals from the community if they move to transit centers, pending possible resettlement to the United States. Sudanese refugee Abdul Aziz said via text message on Saturday that PNG officials had started to dismantle the center s perimeter fences and food was running low.  We are waiting drinking from the rainwater ... it s tense feeling, we don t have any idea what PNG will do to us. Their attitude toward us they are really aggressive,  Aziz said. PNG s Supreme Court ruled last year that the center breached its laws and fundamental human rights, leading to the decision to close it. New Zealand has offered to accept 150 of the men, but Australia has declined the offer saying the priority was an existing refugee swap deal negotiated with former U.S. President Barack Obama last year.   Under that deal, up to 1,250 asylum seekers could be sent to the United States and Australia will in turn accept refugees from Central America. ",worldnews,"November 18, 2017 ",1
China says will work with North Korea to boost ties as envoy visits,"BEIJING/SEOUL (Reuters) - Traditional friendship between China and North Korea represents  valuable wealth  for their people, China said after its special envoy met a high-ranking North Korean official, but there was no mention of the crisis over North Korea s weapons. Song Tao, who heads the ruling Chinese Communist Party s international department, is visiting Pyongyang to discuss the outcome of the recently concluded Communist Party Congress in China, at which President Xi Jinping cemented his power. In a brief statement dated Friday but reported by Chinese media on Saturday, the international department said Song, who is there representing Xi, reported to North Korean official Choe Ryong Hae the outcome of the congress. Song and Choe also talked about relations between their parties and countries, the department said.  They said that the traditional friendship between China and North Korea was founded and cultivated by both countries former old leaders, and is valuable wealth for the two peoples,  it said.  Both sides must work hard together to promote the further development of relations between the two parties and two countries to benefit their two peoples.  The department made no mention of North Korea s nuclear or missile programs, which are strongly opposed by China. The North s official KCNA news agency said Song informed Choe about China s 19th National Congress  in detail , and stressed China s stance to steadily develop the traditionally friendly relations between the two parties and countries. Song arrived on Friday but it is not clear how long he will be in North Korea. China has repeatedly pushed for a diplomatic solution to the crisis over North Korea s development of nuclear weapons and missiles to carry them, but in recent months it has had only limited high-level exchanges with North Korea.  The last time China s special envoy for North Korea visited the country was in February last year. Song s trip comes just a week after U.S. President Donald Trump visited Beijing as part of an Asia tour, where he pressed for greater action to rein in North Korea, especially from China, with which North Korea does 90 percent of its trade. The influential state-run Chinese tabloid the Global Times said in an editorial that it was unwise to expect too much from his trip, saying his key mission was to inform North Korea about the party congress in Beijing.  Song is not a magician,  the newspaper said.   The key to easing the situation on the peninsula lies in the hands of Washington and Pyongyang. If both sides insist on their own logic and refuse to move in the same direction, even if Song opens a door for talks, the door could be closed any time.  It is not clear whether Song will meet North Korea s youthful leader Kim Jong Un. Kim and President Xi exchanged messages of congratulations and thanks over the Chinese party congress, but neither leader has visited the other s country since assuming power. Song s department is in charge of the party s relations with foreign political parties, and has traditionally served as a conduit for Chinese diplomacy with North Korea. China s new special envoy for North Korea, Kong Xuanyou, who took up his position in August, is not believed to have visited the country since assuming the job. ",worldnews,"November 17, 2017 ",1
Argentina intensifies search for missing submarine with 44 crew,"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - An Argentine submarine with 44 crew on board was missing in the South Atlantic two days after its last communication, prompting the navy to step up its search efforts late on Friday in difficult, stormy conditions.  The ARA San Juan was in the southern Argentine sea 432 km (268 miles) from the Patagonian coast when it sent its last signal on Wednesday, naval spokesman Enrique Balbi said.  The emergency operation was formally upgraded to a search-and-rescue procedure on Friday evening after no visual or radar contact was made with the submarine, Balbi said.   Detection has been difficult despite the quantity of boats and aircraft  involved in the search, Balbi said, noting that heavy winds and high waves were complicating efforts.   Obviously, the number of hours that have passed - two days in which there has been no communication - is of note.  The navy believes the submarine, which left Ushuaia en route to the coastal city of Mar del Plata in Buenos Aires province, had communication difficulties that may have been caused by an electrical outage, Balbi said. Navy protocol would call for the submarine to come to the surface once communication was lost.   We expect that it is on the surface,  Balbi said.  The German-built submarine, which uses diesel-electric propulsion, was inaugurated in 1983, making it the newest of the three submarines in the navy s fleet, according to the navy. President Mauricio Macri said the government was in contact with the crew s families.  We share their concern and that of all Argentines,  he wrote on Twitter.  We are committed to using all national and international resources necessary to find the ARA San Juan submarine as soon as possible.  Argentina accepted an offer from the United States for a NASA P-3 explorer aircraft, which had been stationed in the southern city of Ushuaia and was preparing to depart to Antarctica, to fly over the search area, Balbi said. A Hercules C-130 from the Argentine Air Force was also flying over the operational area. Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, Peru, Britain and South Africa had also formally offered assistance.

Zimbabwe's ruling party to hold rally as anti-Mugabe tide rises,"HARARE (Reuters) - President Robert Mugabe s own ruling ZANU-PF party wants him to step down and plans to hold a rally in Zimbabwe s capital Harare on Saturday to make the point. Mugabe, at Zimbabwe s helm since independence from Britain in 1980, faces the starkest challenge ever to his rule after the army seized power on Wednesday, saying it was targeting  criminals  around the nonagenarian leader. ZANU-PF called on Friday for Mugabe to resign, the main state newspaper The Herald reported, a clear sign that the aging leader s authority has collapsed after the army takeover. The newspaper said that ZANU-PF branches in all 10 provinces had met and had also called for Mugabe s wife Grace, whose ambitions to succeed her husband triggered the political crisis, to resign from the party.  A senior member of ZANU-PF earlier told Reuters the party wanted their long-time president gone.   If he becomes stubborn, we will arrange for him to be fired on Sunday,  the source said.  When that is done, it s impeachment on Tuesday.   The Herald reported that ZANU-PF would convene a special Central Committee meeting on Sunday to  realign the revolutionary party with current political developments . Pointedly, the military said it  fully supports  a  solidarity march  - apparently separate from the ZANU-PF event - in Harare on Saturday, part of an apparent groundswell of anti-Mugabe sentiment unleashed by the dramatic events of the past few days. The army said it had been  approached by several private volunteer organizations seeking to freely move and express their desires  and they could do so if they were orderly and peaceful.    Harare has been calm as the coup has unfolded but the armed forces also said in a statement that  people have been warned against looting .  The army appears to want Mugabe to go quietly and allow a transition to Emmerson Mnangagwa, whose sacking last week as vice president sparked the army action. A goal of the generals is to prevent Mugabe handing power to his wife, Grace, 41 years his junior, who appeared on the cusp of power after Mnangagwa was pushed out. Mugabe, 93, who calls himself the grand old man of African politics, looks to be running out of options. The army is camped on his doorstep. Grace Mugabe is under house arrest and her key political allies are in military custody.  All the main pillars of Mugabe s rule have turned on him or have offered no support.  The police have shown no resistance, while Chris Mutsvangwa, the leader of Zimbabwe s influential war veterans, said on Friday that Mugabe would not be allowed to resist the military and remain in power. And ZANU-PF, which built a cult of personality around its leader, has now deserted him. Mugabe is revered by some as an elder statesman and independence leader but also reviled by many in Africa and abroad who accuse him of resorting to violence to retain power while running a once promising economy into the ground. The economy collapsed after the seizure of white-owned farms in 2000. Unemployment is now running at nearly 90 percent and chronic shortages of hard currency have triggered inflation, with the prices of imports rising as much as 50 percent a month.

Venezuela's Maduro offers to help Trump fight drugs,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, whose top political allies have been accused by Washington of dealing in illegal narcotics, on Friday offered to help U.S. President Donald Trump in fighting the drug trade. Top Venezuelan officials including Vice President Tareck El Aissami and Interior Minister Nestor Reverol have been blacklisted by the U.S. Treasury on allegations they have helped move drugs from neighboring Colombia into North America. Maduro calls those charges a smear campaign, and insists that the United States must do more to reduce drug consumption.   President Trump, if you really want to fight drug trafficking that has destroyed U.S. youth and filled the country with drugs from Colombia, you have an ally in me,  Maduro said in a televised broadcast.  Come find out about our experience, we can join forces.  He did not provide further details. Maduro has repeatedly excoriated Trump for sanctions against Venezuela, which range from restrictions on U.S. banks buying newly issued debt to barring American citizens from having any dealings with specific individuals in his government. The Trump administration slammed Maduro s decision to create an all-powerful legislature called the Constituent Assembly in August. The opposition and the international community decried that move as the consolidation of a dictatorship. Maduro, who is himself under U.S. sanction, has in the past requested meetings with Trump. The White House responded to one such entreaty this year by saying it will meet with Venezuela s president when the country returns to democracy. ",worldnews,"November 18, 2017 ",1
U.S. urges passage of Japan proposal to extend probe of chemical weapons attacks in Syria,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department on Friday urged passage of a U.S.-drafted United Nations Security Council resolution to renew an international inquiry into chemical weapons attacks in Syria for one month.

Russia blocks bid to briefly extend Syria chemical weapons inquiry,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Russia vetoed on Friday a Japanese-drafted U.N. Security Council resolution to extend by one month an international inquiry into who is to blame for chemical weapons attacks in Syria, just a day after Moscow blocked a U.S. push to renew the investigation. The mandate for the joint inquiry by the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which was unanimously created by the 15-member Security Council in 2015, ends on Friday.  Syrian ally Russia has now cast 11 vetoes on possible Security Council action on Syria since the country s civil war began in 2011.  The U.N./OPCW investigation found that the Syrian government used the banned nerve agent sarin in an April 4 attack and has also used chlorine as a weapon several times. It blamed Islamic State militants for using mustard gas.   ",worldnews,"November 17, 2017 ",1

Hariri, who sparked a crisis by resigning as Lebanese prime minister on Nov. 4 during a visit to Saudi Arabia, tweeted,  To say that I am held up in Saudi Arabia and not allowed to leave the country is a lie. I am on the way to the airport...    Earlier a member of his party said Hariri will leave Riyadh for France on Friday, but will not return directly to Beirut after the visit.  Hariri s abrupt resignation while he was in Saudi Arabia and his continued stay there caused fears over Lebanon s stability and thrust it into the bitter rivalry between Riyadh and Iran.

Lebanese Sunni politician warns of Arab sanctions over Hezbollah,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon could face economic sanctions from Arab countries or worse if Hezbollah does not stop meddling in regional conflicts, a Lebanese Sunni politician said on Friday.  Former Justice Minister Ashraf Rifi, who rose to prominence with vocal opposition to Shi ite Hezbollah, is closely aligned to the Saudi position in Lebanon and more hawkish than long-established Sunni leaders.   We can expect economic repercussions. At the political level too, at the level of our Lebanese-Arab relations. And it s open to all the possibilities, unfortunately,  he said. His comments to Reuters echo recent statements by Saad al-Hariri, who quit abruptly as Lebanese prime minister in a broadcast from Saudi Arabia two weeks ago.     The shock resignation thrust Lebanon into a regional rivalry between Riyadh and its allies against an Iranian bloc, which includes the Hezbollah militant group and political party.     Rifi said he has been in touch with Saudi officials recently over Lebanon s crisis and is familiar with Riyadh s thinking.       A political rival of Hariri, Rifi defeated a Hariri-backed list in local elections in the mostly Sunni city of Tripoli last year, though he lacks the premier s country-wide standing.   Today, Lebanese officials have a big responsibility. All the Lebanese officials have to be careful about good relations with the Arab world,  Rifi told Reuters.  There is no more leniency towards Hezbollah...using its illegitimate arsenal  in Middle East conflicts.   Lebanon s heavily armed Hezbollah, a part of the political fabric, wields great influence in the country. It also has sent thousands of fighters into Syria to battle alongside the Damascus government against mostly Sunni rebels and militants.  Lebanese politicians and bankers have said they fear Saudi Arabia corralling Arab allies to economically blockade Lebanon as they did with Qatar.      Lebanon cannot live without the Arab countries,  Rifi said.  We know how many Lebanese work in Saudi Arabia or in the Gulf and how much revenue they bring...to the Lebanese economy.       Up to 400,000 Lebanese work in the Gulf, and remittances flowing into the country are a vital source of cash to keep its economy afloat and the heavily-indebted government functioning. Political sources have said that potential sanctions include a ban on flights, visas, exports and transfer of remittances.    Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies have now drawn a line in the sand, Rifi said.  That there is no place for (Hezbollah) in (Lebanon s) future government, if it keeps choosing to be a security and military arm for Iran.  The Lebanese state will have to distance itself in  a real and practical  way from regional wars  so that we don t bear the repercussions of Hezbollah s acts,  he added.  In his resignation speech, Hariri said he feared assassination, railing against Iran and Hezbollah. A Sunni Muslim leader and long-time Saudi ally, Hariri has yet to return to Beirut. In his public comments after quitting, Hariri warned of possible Arab sanctions and a danger to the livelihoods of Lebanese in the Gulf. Hezbollah must stop intervening in regional conflicts, particularly Yemen, he said.   Lebanon s President Michel Aoun has called Hariri a Saudi hostage, refusing to accept his resignation unless he returns to Beirut, and stressing that the government still stands. Saudi Arabia and Hariri say he is a free man. Hariri became prime minister last year in a power-sharing deal that made Aoun, a Hezbollah political ally, president and his coalition government includes Hezbollah.  Rifi criticized Aoun s stance, as well as other Lebanese accusations that Riyadh forced Hariri to quit, as  surprising and unprecedented.  He considered Hariri s resignation constitutional and said Lebanon would have to form a new,  more balanced  government in the near future.  Rifi, a former police chief, resigned as justice minister in 2016 in protest at what he described as Hezbollah s dominant role. He had also heaped criticism on Hariri for nominating another Hezbollah ally to fill the vacant presidency.  From the moment the prime minister uttered his desire to quit, the government became a resigned one,  he said.",worldnews,"November 17, 2017 ",1
Chile's presidential hopefuls wrap up campaigning ahead of Sunday vote,"SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile s presidential hopefuls wrapped up campaigning on Thursday in a race that has pitted billionaire Sebastian Pinera s promise for change against center-left candidate Alejandro Guillier s defense of a recent raft of progressive reforms. With their six rivals trailing far behind, Pinera and Guillier are widely expected to place first and second, respectively, in Sunday s election, allowing them to move on to an eventual Dec. 17 run-off. Pinera, a 67-year-old former president, has portrayed himself as the best bet for reviving growth that has slowed in recent years in the world s No.1 copper producer. He has vowed to cut the corporate tax rate and scale back outgoing President Michelle Bachelet s tax, labor and education reforms that Guillier has vowed to deepen. Bachelet cannot run for office again because of term limits.  Chileans face an important decision. They re going to have to choose between change or continuity,  Pinera told journalists on Thursday on the last day for campaigning before the election. Guillier, a bearded former journalist-turned-Senator, has tapped concerns that Pinera would mark a setback for gains made in Bachelet s government for students, women and workers - from lowered university fees to laws that have empowered unions.  This is an election to define the two Chiles,  Guillier said.  Support for education, health care and rights, or a return to the market.  Neither candidate marks a sharp departure from the historically moderate leaders that have governed Chile since the country s transition to democracy from dictatorship in 1990. But if Pinera wins as expected, this year s election would mark another rightward shift in South America following the rise of conservative leaders in Peru, Argentina and Brazil. Pinera s and Guillier s rivals passed out leaflets and chatted up voters in a final bid to shore up support, or at least help their parties win seats in the next Congress. Analyst group Tresquintos said leftist candidate Beatriz Sanchez, a distant third in opinion polls, has zero chance of catching up to Guillier. The probability of Pinera securing at least 50 percent of votes needed to avoid a runoff election was only slightly better at 0.001 percent, it added in an email. Still, riding high with more than double Guillier s support in recent polls, Pinera urged Chileans to  make it short  and vote for him on Sunday to give him an outright win.

Factbox - Pot Nation: Canada's plans for legal marijuana,"(Reuters) - Recreational marijuana is on track to be legalized in Canada by July 2018, making Canada the first Group of Seven country to allow the drug nationwide and the second in the world after Uruguay. While the federal legislation proposed by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau s Liberal government will regulate cannabis production, the details of who can sell it and who can buy it will be largely left up to the country s provinces. The following are details of some key factors of how legal marijuana is shaping up in Canada.  So far, five of Canada s 10 provinces have come forward with frameworks for retail marijuana sale. In Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick, cannabis sales will be run by provincial government-owned entities. The western provinces of Manitoba and Alberta have said they will license private retailers.  The federal government set the minimum legal age for buying marijuana at 18, but the provinces can raise that if they wish. In Ontario, Canada s most populous province, the legal age will be 19. The federal government s proposed law also permits adults to grow up to four marijuana plants at home, although Quebec announced Thursday it will not allow residents of the province to grow their own marijuana.  Federal and provincial governments are tightening the rules around impaired driving and bringing in a roadside saliva test to check for drug impairment. The federal government is setting up systems to track all cannabis from seed to sale, to license non-medical producers and to test marijuana for potency and quality control. The federal government has already issued more than 70 licenses for producing medical marijuana, which has been legal in Canada since 2001. MJIC Inc s equal-weighted Canadian Marijuana Index, which tracks stocks of major legal cannabis companies, is up 28 percent this year. The Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences ETF, the first exchange traded fund in North America to focus on the legal market, is up more than 20 percent since it launched in April. Canopy Growth Corp, Aurora Cannabis and Aphria, three of Canada s four biggest marijuana producers by market cap, have gained 89 percent, 137 percent and 71 percent respectively this year. MedReleaf Corp, the fourth, which listed in June, is up 107 percent since its debut.  Marijuana stocks listed have surged since Oct. 30, when U.S. alcohol company Constellation Brands bought a nearly 10 percent stake in Canopy for about C$245 million ($192.05 million). A battle is brewing between the federal government and some provinces over how tax revenue is divided between the two levels of government. The federal government said last week it wants an excise tax on all cannabis products of C$1 (78 cents) per gram (0.04 ounce), or 10 percent of the retail price, whichever is higher.  The government proposed splitting the tax 50-50 with the provinces, drawing criticism from Ontario which says it will face higher costs related to enforcement and establishing a system for sales.

Zimbabwe's Mugabe digs in heels as ruling party moves to depose him,"HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe s ruling ZANU-PF party called on Friday for President Robert Mugabe to resign, the main state newspaper The Herald reported, the latest sign that the aging leader s authority has collapsed after an army takeover. The newspaper said that ZANU-PF branches in all 10 provinces had met on Friday and had also called for Mugabe s wife Grace, whose ambitions to succeed her husband triggered the unfolding political crisis, to resign from the party.  Mugabe appeared in public on Friday for the first time since the army took charge, as the ruling party made plans to force him to step down after almost four decades in power. The president, who is 93, opened a graduation ceremony at Zimbabwe Open University in Harare. He wore blue and yellow academic robes and a mortar board hat and appeared to fall asleep in his chair as his eyes closed and his head lolled. Mugabe led the country s liberation struggle and has dominated its politics since independence in 1980. A senior member of the ZANU-PF ruling party said it wanted him gone.  If he becomes stubborn, we will arrange for him to be fired on Sunday,  the source said.  When that is done, it s impeachment on Tuesday.  The Herald reported that ZANU-PF would convene a special Central Committee meeting on Sunday to  realign the revolutionary party with current political developments.  The military, which seized power on Wednesday, has so far treated Mugabe carefully. It said in a statement on national television it was  engaging  with Mugabe, referred to him as Commander in Chief and said it would announce an outcome as soon as possible. ZANU-PF has also called for a mass meeting in the capital on Saturday to show its support for the War Veterans group in their bid to remove Mugabe. The veterans, Mugabe s former comrades from the liberation war, who enjoyed a privileged position under his rule for decades, had chafed in recent years as his wife Grace positioned herself to succeed him. They finally turned on him decisively after he sacked Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa last week. The Herald newspaper on Friday said that ZANU-PF wanted Mnangagwa reinstated as vice president because he was dismissed  without endorsement of the central committee . Many Zimbabweans suspect the military s plan is to hand power to Mnangagwa, a long-serving Mugabe confidant and liberation war veteran nicknamed  the Crocodile . If so, the generals may be waiting until Mnangagwa can be reinstated as vice president before arranging for Mugabe to resign. Mugabe is revered as an elder statesman and independence leader but he is also viewed by many in Africa as a president who crippled his country by remaining in power too long. He calls himself the grand old man of African politics. Zimbabwe s official newspaper, the Herald, ran photographs late on Thursday showing Mugabe grinning and shaking hands with military chief General Constantino Chiwenga, who led the army takeover. The images stunned Zimbabweans who said it meant Mugabe was managing to hold out against Chiwenga s coup. Some political sources said he was trying to delay his departure until elections scheduled for next year. The ZANU-PF source said he would not be able to stay that long. Anxious to avoid a protracted stalemate, party leaders were drawing up plans to dismiss Mugabe at the weekend if he refused to quit, the source said.  There is no going back,  the source told Reuters.  It s like a match delayed by heavy rain, with the home side leading 90-0 in the 89th minute.  The army is camped on his doorstep. Grace Mugabe is under house arrest and her key political allies are in military custody. The police, once a bastion of support for Mugabe, have showed no signs of resistance to the army. Furthermore, he has little popular backing in the capital, a stronghold of support for opposition parties that have tapped into the anger and frustration at his handling of the economy, which collapsed after the seizure of white-owned farms in 2000. After stabilising briefly when Mugabe was forced to work with the opposition in a 2009-2013 unity government, the economy has collapsed again. Unemployment is now running at nearly 90 percent and chronic shortages of hard currency have triggered hyperinflation, with the prices of imports rising as much as 50 percent a month. Mugabe has won a series of elections but his critics in Africa and the West say his handling of the economy has been disastrous and he has used violence to maintain power. Botswana s President Ian Khama told him to resign.  I don t think anyone should be President for that amount of time. We are Presidents. We are not monarchs. It s just common sense,  Khama said. Still, African states are keen that whatever outcome is achieved in Zimbabwe, it happens within the framework of the constitution, which may give Mugabe some leverage over the terms of his departure.  We note with great concern the unfolding political development in Zimbabwe and we hope that they will not lead to unconstitutional change of government,  South African President Jacob Zuma said at a Southern African Development Community meeting in Botswana s capital Gaborone. Dumiso Dabengwa, a Zimbabwean liberation war veteran and KGB-trained former intelligence chief, said Mugabe s fate was sealed but old age was causing him to dig in his heels.  At his age, everybody becomes very stubborn and he would be no exception,  he told reporters in Johannesburg.   He certainly will not do it easily, but I think the people will show him that he s no longer wanted.  U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Friday urged  a quick return to civilian rule  in Zimbabwe.  Zimbabwe has an opportunity to set itself on a new path, one that must include democratic elections and respect for human rights,  Tillerson told African foreign ministers ahead of a meeting in Washington.

Qatar foreign minister decries 'reckless leadership' in region,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Qatar s foreign minister on Friday criticized  reckless leadership  in the Gulf for a number of crises including the Gulf rift and Lebanon, taking apparent aim at Saudi Arabia. The diplomatic crisis, in which Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt have boycotted Qatar, has been brewing since the summer after the four countries cut diplomatic, transport and trade ties with Qatar, accusing it of financing terrorism. Doha denies the charges. Saudi Arabia and its allies are fighting for sway across the region against a bloc led by Iran, which includes the heavily armed Lebanese Shi ite Hezbollah group. Attention on the dispute has shifted recently especially in the wake of Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri s shock resignation announcement this month while in Saudi Arabia. Hariri s abrupt resignation and his continued stay in Riyadh have caused fears over Lebanon s stability and thrust it into the bitter rivalry between Riyadh and Iran. Saudi Arabia and Hariri - whom Riyadh backs - say his movements are not restricted. Riyadh also denies accusations it forced Hariri to resign.  We see a pattern of irresponsibility and a reckless leadership in the region which is just trying to bully countries into submission,  Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said in Washington.  What we are witnessing now in the region ... it s something we just witness(ed) in recent history, bullying small countries into submission.  Exactly what happened to Qatar six months ago is happening now to Lebanon. The leadership in Saudi Arabia and the UAE need to understand ... there is no right for any country to interfere in other countries  affairs,  he told a group of reporters. Asked to comment on those remarks, the Saudi Embassy in Washington s spokeswoman, Fatimah Baeshen, said:  The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia s foreign policy has always been premised on regional stability, peace, and security. The Kingdom does not interfere with its neighbors  domestic affairs.  Riyadh says Qatar backs terrorism and cozies up to Iran. Qatar rejects the accusation and says it is being punished for straying from its neighbors  backing for authoritarian rulers. Since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman rose to power less than three years ago, Riyadh has struck a more aggressive posture towards Iran, launching a war in Yemen, leading the boycott of neighboring Qatar, and ratcheting up its rhetoric against Hezbollah. U.S. efforts to bring an end to the dispute have yet to bear fruit. Qatar hosts the largest U.S. air base in the region which is used in the international coalition fighting Islamic State. Thani said Qatar s Boeing C-17 transport aircraft, used by Doha for logistical support within the coalition, were forced to fly over Iran given that Saudi Arabia and the UAE have blocked Qatari planes from flying over their airspace.  So if we imagine that any emergency will happen, those C-17 planes which might have U.S. troops will land in Iran.  So this is the impact of this blockade ... on the global coalition and on U.S. military operations there,  Thani said. A spokesman for the U.S. Air Forces Central Command said the Qataris have flown  nearly 30 mobility missions in support of  Coalition operations to defeat ISIS, moving more than a million pounds of cargo, including parts and supplies  since Doha recommitted its C-17 fleet to Operation Inherent Resolve in July.  At this time, we are aware of no Qatari C-17 flights having traversed Iranian airspace while carrying Coalition cargo,  Lt. Colonel Damien Pickart told Reuters. ",worldnews,"November 17, 2017 ",1
Iraqi forces recapture last Islamic State-held town,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi forces on Friday captured the border town of Rawa, the last remaining town under Islamic State control, signaling the collapse of the group s self-proclaimed caliphate. Rawa s capture marks the end of Islamic State s era of territorial rule over a so-called caliphate that it proclaimed in 2014 across vast swathes of Iraq and Syria. Iraqi forces  liberated Rawa entirely, and raised the Iraqi flag over its buildings,  Lieutenant General Abdul Ameer Rasheed Yarallah said in a statement from the Joint Operations Command. Syria s army has also declared victory against Islamic State, but last week militants re-infiltrated Albu Kamal, near the border from Iraq, and are still fighting there, as well as in some villages and desert areas nearby.  All the forces fighting Islamic State in both countries  expect a new phase of guerrilla warfare, a tactic the militants have already shown themselves capable of. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi congratulated Iraq s armed forces and people, saying Rawa was retaken in record time and that Iraq would soon completely defeat Islamic State.  I congratulate our heroic forces and the Iraqi people on the liberation of Rawa. The success of our forces, in record time and with excellent planning, shows their strength. Our armed forces continue to secure the Jazira and desert area and the Iraqi border. Total victory is near,  he said. A map published by the military showed zero areas under Islamic State control and a spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition fighting the group in both Iraq and Syria said on Twitter it had  crumbled . A video issued by the military showed Iraqi forces sending a message to Rawa s residents via radio which said:  Daesh has ended for good, and now the age of Iraq begins,  referring to the Sunni militant group by an Arabic acronym. Another showed a convoy of military vehicles sporting Iraqi flags and blasting out the national anthem. State television played patriotic songs and aired footage of troops in Rawa.  With the liberation of Rawa we can say all the areas in which Daesh is present have been liberated,  a military spokesman said. Iraqi forces will now focus on routing the militants who fled into the desert and exert control over Iraq s borders, the spokesman said. Rawa borders Syria, whose army seized the last substantial town on the border with Iraq, Albu Kamal. Albu Kamal shares a border crossing with al-Qaim in Iraq. The militants lost control of the border crossing earlier this month, dealing a critical blow to the organization, which had long relied on the route to move its fighters and equipment. The group s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, is believed to be hiding in the stretch of desert which runs along the border of both countries.    Driven this year from its two de facto capitals   Iraq s Mosul and Syria s Raqqa   Islamic State was progressively squeezed into an ever-shrinking pocket of desert, straddling the frontier between the two countries, by enemies that include most regional states and global powers. In Iraq, Islamic State faced the army and the Shi ite paramilitary groups, backed both by the U.S.-led international coalition and by Iran.  Iraq has been carrying out its final campaign to crush the Islamic State caliphate while also mounting a military offensive in the north against the Kurds who held an independence referendum in September. However, Islamic State s defeat does not mean civilians are now safe, the International Rescue Committee said. Nearly 3.2 million people are unable or unwilling to return home after years of displacement and over 11 million are in need of vital humanitarian assistance, it said.  Today marks a historic day for the people of Iraq. It is, however, vital that the international community does not view the end of (Islamic State) territorial control as the end of their responsibility to the Iraqi people who have endured years of conflict and face a long, difficult recovery,  the group s Iraq Country Director Wendy Taeuber said in a statement.

U.N. pleads for end of Yemen blockade or 'untold thousands' will die," (This story from November 16 corrects paragraph 15 to say Aden port only partially open and Sanaa airport remains closed, not open for commercial flights) By Stephanie Nebehay and Tom Miles GENEVA (Reuters) - The heads of three U.N. agencies urged the Saudi-led military coalition on Thursday to lift its blockade of Yemen, warning that  untold thousands  would die if it stayed in place. The coalition closed all air, land and sea access to Yemen on Nov. 6 following the interception of a missile fired towards the Saudi capital, saying it had to stem the flow of arms from Iran to its Houthi opponents in the war in Yemen. Yemen already has 7 million people on the brink of famine, but without the reopening of all ports that number could grow by 3.2 million, the heads of the World Food Programme, UNICEF and the World Health Organization said in a joint statement.  The cost of this blockade is being measured in the number of lives that are lost,  the statement from David Beasley, Anthony Lake and Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.  Together, we issue another urgent appeal for the coalition to permit entry of lifesaving supplies to Yemen in response to what is now the worst humanitarian crisis in the world.   U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres wrote to Saudi U.N. Ambassador Abdallah Al-Mouallimi to warn him that the blockade was  already reversing the impact of humanitarian efforts,  U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said on Thursday.   The Secretary-General is very much disappointed we ve not seen a lifting of the blockade. The Secretary-General and his humanitarian team are heartbroken at the scenes we re seeing from Yemen,  Dujarric told reporters.  Saudi Arabia has since said that aid can go through  liberated ports  but not Houthi-controlled Hodeidah, the conduit for the vast bulk of imports into Yemen.  For months, the U.N. has warned that the closure of Hodeidah would dramatically escalate the crisis.  As of Wednesday, 29 vessels, with 300,000 tonnes of food and 192,000 tonnes of fuel, had been blocked, while U.N. ships carrying $10 million of health and nutrition supplies and 25,000 tonnes of wheat were waiting to berth at Hodeidah, according to another U.N. statement.  Without fuel, the vaccine cold chain, water supply systems and waste water treatment plants will stop functioning. And without food and safe water, the threat of famine grows by the day,  the U.N. agency heads said. At least one million children are at risk if a fast-spreading diphtheria outbreak is not stopped in its tracks, and the lives of 400,000 pregnant women and their babies are under threat because of the lack of medicines.  There is also the risk of a renewed flare-up in cholera, which was on the wane after the most explosive outbreak ever recorded - with over 900,000 cases and 2,200 deaths in the past six months. The number of new cholera cases has declined for the last eight weeks, Sherin Varkey, UNICEF deputy representative in Yemen, said in a telephone interview from Sanaa on Thursday. The government-controlled port of Aden has partially re-opened for limited shipments of aid, while Sanaa airport remains closed for commercial and humanitarian flights. Humanitarian access is inadequate as  needs are so huge , he said.  There is a fuel crisis. Some estimates say fuel will only last in the country for 20 days because of the blockade and challenges of getting fuel into the country,  Varkey said. UNICEF is helping provide clean water to 6 million Yemenis by ensuring fuel is delivered to water pumping stations in cities, he said.  Our worry is with the fuel shortage this could affect and even we assume reverse the declining trend (in cholera),  he said. ",worldnews,"November 16, 2017 ",1
German justice ministry urges ban on Kuwait Airways over Israel issue,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The German government should revoke landing rights for Kuwait Airways given its ban on Israeli passengers, a senior Justice Department official said on Friday, saying such discrimination was intolerable. Christian Lange, parliamentary state secretary in the ministry, appealed to Chancellor Angela Merkel to personally advocate a ban on Kuwait Airways  operations in Germany. A German court ruled on Thursday that the airline had the right to refuse to carry an Israeli passenger due to his nationality, a verdict that Jewish groups said condoned anti-Semitism. Lange told Merkel in the letter that he had received countless phone calls from members of the Jewish community and from others in Israel, expressing shock about the court ruling, made just days after Germany solemnly marked the anniversary of the Nov. 9, 1938 Nazi pogroms against the Jews.  We cannot say  Never again  at a remembrance ceremony, but then remain silent when activists in Germany call for a boycott of Israel, or, as in this case, when an airline refuses to carry Israeli citizens,  Lange said.  Especially the German government must make clear that we reject this form of discrimination and hate, and that we stand by the side of our Israeli friends,  he told the chancellor. The Lawfare Project, the legal group that represented the plaintiff in the case, has vowed to appeal against the ruling.  To see a Jewish person banned from exercising his freedoms in Germany in 2017 is chilling enough. To see that discrimination whitewashed and legitimized by a German judge is grotesque,  said the group s executive director, Brooke Goldstein. Deputy German Foreign Minister Michael Roth also criticized the airline s policy, telling Die Welt newspaper that he had contacted the Kuwaiti ambassador in Germany about the issue. German Transport Minister Christian Schmidt told Bild newspaper that it was not acceptable to discriminate against airline passengers because of their nationality, and said the German government would address the matter with the Kuwaiti government.  This requires contacts at the ministerial level,  Schmidt told the newspaper in an interview to be published on Saturday.  We will do all we can within our legal means to prevent something like this in the future,  Schmidt told the paper. There was no immediate response to a request for comment emailed to the airline.

Dividend-seeking investors should check out technology: Epoch,"(Reuters) - Investors seeking steady income flows may have ignored the technology sector and the unexpected impact technology is having on companies in other industries, Kera Van Valen, a portfolio manager at Epoch Investment Partners, said on Friday.   People have overlooked technology in terms of dividends and the changes some companies have made regarding the cash they generate, Van Valen told the Reuters Global Investment 2018 Outlook Summit in New York.  Within the tech sector you have seen a slight shift in appreciation towards the discipline of returning cash to shareholders. That s something people don t expect,  she said. Texas Instruments Inc (TXN.O) is now part of Epoch s high-dividend-based  shareholder  yield strategy as the chipmaker has committed to returning 100 percent of free cash flow through dividends and share buybacks, she said. The company targets free cash flow to be somewhere in the range of 20 percent to 30 percent of their revenue, said Van Valen, who helps oversee Epoch s U.S. and global dividend strategies, which account for half of its $48.6 billion in assets under management. Epoch s Shareholder Yield strategy is invested in a number of companies that use technology to improve their productivity, asset utilization and to reduce capital requirements. The result is an increase in return on equity and a company s ability to return more capital to shareholders in the form of dividends, share repurchases and debt reduction.  Increased efficiency through technology also has been unrecognized by investors in unforeseen places such as utilities, where Epoch owns utility holding company PPL Corp (PPL.N).   PPL is spending $500 million on a smart meter replacement program that will modernize the power grid to make it smarter and more resilient, Van Valen said. PPL can be more efficient when deploying people to deal with outages as a result of smart meters, she said. They will no longer need people to look for the outages.  Another technology play investors may have missed is McDonald s Corp (MCD.N), which has partnered with UberEATS and the use of a mobile app offer delivery in 3,700 restaurants, Van Valen said. McDonald s is touting its technology to increase efficiency, which flows to a company s bottom line, she said.   You don t necessary think of a large global fast food chain as a technology company,  she said.  It s helping with the growth in the revenues, profits and cash flows, which, from our perspective, that means growth in the dividends.  Epoch is  quite constructive  on the outlook for 2018 as the  market shifts from a period of central bank-driven low interest rates to one focused on profit growth and margins. Another overlooked stock is Red Electrica (REE.MC) in Spain, where the utility is unlikely to see changes in the regulatory environment and Epoch expects the dividend to grow 7 percent to 8 percent a year, Van Valen said.   It s a regulated utility so it falls within that boring mantra that we like so much,  she said. Another name Epoch likes is Altria Group Inc (MO.N) because of the strong pricing power and tremendous cash flows enjoyed by tobacco companies, she said. Altria is  very consistent about returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks and debt reduction,  she said. ",worldnews,"November 17, 2017 ",1

"The boss is dead but the mafia lives, magistrate and mobster say","ROME/PALERMO (Reuters) - The death of Sicilian Mafia boss Salvatore  Toto  Riina on Friday does not mark the end of Cosa Nostra, but the crime group is unlikely to allow one man such power ever again, a top magistrate and former mobster said. The 87-year-old Riina died in a hospital in Parma, the northern Italian city where he had been serving 26 life sentences for murders committed between 1969 and 1992.  The end of Riina isn t the end of Cosa Nostra,  the chief magistrate in Sicily s capital of Palermo, Francesco Lo Voi, told Reuters.  What remains to be understood is whether the men of Cosa Nostra will seek a direct successor or a new organizational structure,  Lo Voi said.  Gaspare Mutolo, who admits to having strangled some 20 people, agrees. Mutolo, now 77, turned state s witness in the early 1990s at the age of 51, and became a key witness in dozens of mafia cases. He shared a jail cell with Riina in the 1960s, and became his trusted bodyguard and driver afterward. Mutolo, who still wears a balaclava to hide his identity from cameras, felt  pity  when he heard his former friend and cell mate had died, he said.  He was a friend. He helped me. He even saved my life. I saw him a little bit as a father figure,  Mutolo told foreign reporters in Rome. Riina s death changes little in Sicily, he said:  Palermo still has the mafia.  BACK-ROOM DEALS As several recent cases show, the mob still extorts business owners on the island, and it still seeks to win lucrative public contracts through back-room deals with corrupt politicians and bureaucrats.  I can t imagine politics without the mafia,  Mutolo said. But the future of Cosa Nostra without Riina, whose brutality undermined the trustworthiness of the organization by driving mafiosi like Mutolo into the hands of the state, is uncertain.  The Calabrian mob, known as the  Ndrangheta, has had few turncoats and has taken over drug routes once dominated by Cosa Nostra.  The Calabrians now are major importers of cocaine from South America to Europe and to North America. Even politicians are wary of doing deals with the Sicilian mob now, Mutolo said.  Cosa Nostra is not the same as it was in the 1980s mainly because of the turncoats,  Mutolo said.  The Calabresi have taken over because they are more trusted.  Cosa Nostra has always had a military-like structure, but before Riina there was no single  boss of bosses . Power was divvied up by territory, and the local bosses met together in a so-called  Commission  to discuss strategy and settle disputes. But Riina made himself the dictator of Cosa Nostra.  It s not a given that Cosa Nostra will see a charismatic leader as a necessity  in the future, Lo Voi said, returning to  a decentralization of operations and decision making  as there was before Riina took over.

Lebanon FM says Hariri crisis an attempt to create regional chaos,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon s Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil said on Friday a crisis triggered by the resignation of its prime minister was part of an  attempt to create chaos in the region , in an interview with Russia Today. Saad al-Hariri quit as prime minister in a broadcast from Saudi Arabia two weeks ago, saying he feared assassination and criticizing the Saudis  regional arch-rival Iran along with its Lebanese ally Hezbollah.  The actions of Hariri, a Sunni Muslim leader and long-time Saudi ally, plunged Lebanon into a political crisis, putting the country center stage in the rivalry.  He has yet to return to Beirut and is expected to leave Saudi Arabia this weekend for France, where he will meet with President Emmanuel Macron. Bassil is touring European and other capitals seeking diplomatic help to end the crisis.    We will respond and we have the full capacities to do so, but we hope it doesn t get to that,  Bassil said in Moscow. His comments to Russia Today were reported earlier on Friday by Lebanese broadcasters al-Jadeed, al-Manar and LBC without attribution.  French officials said they did not know how long Hariri would stay before returning to Beirut, but hoped his visit would help ease the crisis by demonstrating he was not being held in Saudi Arabia.

German parties head into long weekend of coalition talks,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany s would-be coalition partners continued talks on Friday after all-night negotiations failed to produce a breakthrough, with Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives saying they would compromise further on climate change policies to secure a deal. The conservatives, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the Greens remained divided on climate policy and immigration, but agreed to press on past their self-imposed deadline into the weekend. Party leaders on Friday discussed their different stances on foreign, defense, trade and European policy in various formats and they were expected to continue on Saturday, haggling about climate protection, immigration, transport and agriculture. Speaking to reporters when she arrived for the talks in the morning, Merkel said:  I go into these negotiations with the intention, despite all the difficulties, of carrying out the task voters gave us of forming a coalition... It will be tough, but it s worth going into round two.  Volker Kauder, the parliamentary floor leader of her Christian Democrats (CDU), said they were prepared to compromise further on reducing emissions from coal-fired power stations to assuage Green concerns.  I feel readiness by all sides and everyone has to make concessions,  he told reporters as officials scheduled further talks to run to Sunday afternoon.  I believe that the exploratory talks must end this weekend.  Failure to agree could lead to new elections, something the mainstream parties fear could lead to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) making further gains after surging into parliament in September. A new election could also weigh heavily on the euro. Merkel could still approach her previous coalition partner, the Social Democrats (SPD), but they have said they want to stay in opposition after suffering their worst election result since 1933 in the Sept. 24 poll. A third option, a government without a parliamentary majority, would be unprecedented in Germany s post-war history. Merkel has been forced to explore the tricky option of a three-way  Jamaica coalition  - so-called because the parties  colors match the island nation s flag - after her camp lost votes to the far right. The smaller parties are under pressure from their rank-and-file supporters not to give ground as they haggle over concessions needed for a government program. To the right, Merkel s Bavarian allies in the Christian Social Union (CSU) want a coalition accord limiting immigration to shore up support in their home state, where the AfD threatens to unseat them after 60 years in power in a regional election next year. That is anathema to the left-leaning Greens, who want to preserve the right of successful asylum seekers to bring their families to join them in Germany - a position backed by two thirds of voters, according to a poll for ZDF television. The Greens fear giving way on their demand to close down 10 gigawatts of polluting coal-fired power stations would alienate their voters. They rejected Merkel s previous compromise offer of seven gigawatts. The FDP has only just returned to parliament after four years in the wilderness. Its deputy leader, Wolfgang Kubicki, sounded the most pessimistic after the talks, telling ARD TV the parties were  still so far apart on key issues such as migration, fighting climate change, finances and domestic security, that I can t imagine how we can get together in the short time available . In the evening, Kubicki said a new deadline to reach a provisional agreement was now Sunday at 6 pm (1700 GMT). FDP Party Secretary General Nicola Beer added:  We move forward a few inches each day.  The FDP wants tax cuts to please its small and medium-sized business supporters - a tall order, given competing fiscal demands. A booming economy could come to the parties  aid as the Ifo institute on Friday sharply raised its forecast for the German economy to grow by 2.3 percent from 1.9 percent this year, meaning Berlin can count on a higher tax take. A report by the German Chambers of Commerce and Industry on Friday found that rising tax revenues meant the government would have 76 billion euros ($89.63 billion) spare to spend over four years - twice an earlier finance ministry estimate.  ($1 = 0.8480 euros) ",worldnews,"November 17, 2017 ",1
At least five killed in Kenya as violence greets opposition leader's return,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - At least five people were killed on Friday as Kenyan police tried to disperse supporters accompanying opposition leader Raila Odinga from the airport to central Nairobi, police said.     Police fired tear gas at the convoy in which Odinga was traveling and used water cannon as they tried to stop it reaching the capital s main business district. Some protesters threw stones at police. Two vehicles, including a police truck, were set on fire. A Reuters photographer saw two bodies with gunshot wounds as police and protesters fought on one of the main roads leading to the business district. Police said five people were stoned to death by angry mobs after they were caught stealing and denied they had used excessive force against the opposition supporters.  These incidences occurred before the police arrived at the various scenes,  the police service said in a statement. Police retreated several times along the route after the protesters were unmoved by the teargas and water cannon spray. They finally held their ground near the city s main park, where Odinga, just returned from the United States, intended to address a rally that had been banned. He blamed President Uhuru Kenyatta for the violence.  My anger is with that guy called Uhuru Kenyatta. I went abroad... After you welcomed me well, he sent policemen to teargas you, to beat my people, to fire bullets at them. Isn t this barbaric?,  he told his supporters after driving to safety. Odinga has called for a  National Resistance Movement  to protest against the outcome of a repeat presidential election last month which saw Kenyatta win a second, five-year term with 98 percent of the vote after Odinga boycotted the contest. Only 39 percent of registered voters took part. The repeat poll was ordered by the Supreme Court after it annulled the results of the August election, won by Kenyatta, over procedural irregularities. The court will rule on Monday on cases that seek to nullify the rerun election.  The political crisis has stirred fears for the stability of Kenya, a regional hub for trade, diplomacy and security.  Earlier on Friday, demonstrators threw up burning barricades on Mombasa Road, the highway that links Nairobi s downtown business district and the airport. Despite a partial police ban on protests in the capital, hundreds of people had gathered in the morning near Jomo Kenyatta International Airport to await Odinga s return. Police fired into the air to disperse them. Once Odinga landed, motorcycle taxi drivers and people on foot shouted their support as the motorcade, which included lawmakers from Odinga s opposition coalition, began moving toward central Nairobi. Dozens of international flights depart and arrive daily at Nairobi s main airport. The national airport authority said on Twitter just before midday that operations were running normally.  Kenya Airways said it had been  impacted  by the disruptions around the airport and offered to book travelers who missed their flights on subsequent ones.   Kenya s prolonged election season has disrupted its economy. Human rights groups say at least 66 people have died in bloodshed surrounding the two elections. Ahead of Monday s Supreme Court ruling, Kenya Airways  chairman told an investor briefing on Friday:  Hopefully we don t have another presidential election so we can get on with life.

Turkey says Gulen network behind U.S. case against Turkish trader,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - The U.S. case against a Turkish gold trader accused of evading U.S. sanctions on Iran is based on evidence fabricated by the network of the Muslim cleric Ankara blames for last year s coup attempt, Turkey s foreign minister said on Friday. Mevlut Cavusoglu said the case against the trader, Reza Zarrab, showed the extent to which followers of the U.S.-based cleric, Fethullah Gulen, had infiltrated American state institutions, including its judiciary and overseas missions. The Zarrab case has complicated already strained relations between the United States and Turkey, both members of the NATO military alliance. U.S. prosecutors have charged the wealthy Iranian-born Zarrab and his alleged co-conspirators of handling hundreds of millions of dollars for Iran s government and Iranian entities from 2010 to 2015, in a scheme to evade U.S. sanctions. While nine people have been criminally charged, only Zarrab and a banker from Turkey s Halkbank, Mehmet Hakan Atilla, are in U.S. custody. Both are due to go on trial on Nov. 27, and have pleaded not guilty.  When you look at the indictment of Mr Zarrab it is exactly the same one that FETO actually prepared here in Turkey in 2013,  Cavusoglu told reporters at a briefing in Istanbul, using the government s term for Gulen s network.   So this case is very much a FETO-motivated one, this is for sure. All those indictments and files they fabricated here were taken back to the United States.  Under a Turkish investigation that became public in 2013, prosecutors accused Zarrab and high-ranking Turkish officials of involvement in facilitating Iranian money transfers via gold smuggling, leaked documents at the time showed.  Erdogan, then prime minister, cast the case as a coup attempt orchestrated by his political enemies. Several prosecutors were removed from the case, police investigators were reassigned, and the investigation was later dropped. Turkey blames Gulen s followers for the July 2016 failed coup, when a group of rogue soldiers attempted to overthrow the government and killed more than 250 people. Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in the United States since 1999, has denied any involvement and condemned the coup.  Turkey has repeatedly requested Gulen s extradition, but U.S. officials have said the courts require sufficient evidence before they can extradite the elderly cleric.  The United States says its judiciary is independent of any political or other interference. Cavusoglu said he had informed U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson of what Ankara sees as the Gulenists  attempts to spread their influence.  I told him very openly that I believe that FETO has infiltrated his missions here in Turkey through the local staff, and the Halkbank case and the Zarrab case are very much FETO-motivated ones. I am very open. He didn t make a comment on this,  Cavusoglu said. Last month Turkey arrested a local employee working at the U.S. consulate in Istanbul over alleged links to Gulen s network, prompting an angry reaction from Washington that led to both countries scaling back visa services they provide for each other s nationals. On Nov. 6, Ankara and Washington said they would resume visa services on a limited basis, although ties remain strained. [nL8N1NM6XB] ",worldnews,"November 17, 2017 ",1
Education sought by EU to help build European identity,"GOTHENBURG, Sweden (Reuters) - European Union leaders, wary of the rise of populism and xenophobia, are turning to one of their more successful programs, the Erasmus student exchange scheme, to help foster cross-border education and European unity. Over lunch in the Swedish city of Gothenburg on Friday, they discussed and gave political support to a European Commission proposal to create a European Education Area, in which the EU could help promote studies across its various nations. The idea is to foster a European identity by  letting more people study in countries across the bloc, emphasizing language learning and engendering more cooperation between universities, including on curricula.   During our meeting today, we established political support for these ideas,  the chairman of the leaders  meeting Donald Tusk told a news conference. The initiative comes as the Union, about to lose its second biggest economy Britain, seeks to make itself more appealing to European citizens, many of whom find the often highly technical or legal issues, which the EU deals with, disconnected from their everyday lives. The Erasmus exchange program of studying abroad is one of the most recognizable and popular EU policies. It has already been used by 9 million Europeans. Appreciation for it is growing fast, the Commission said, adding that 90 percent of Erasmus students, who typically spend a year at a university in another EU country, come back with an increased awareness of common European values.  As we look to Europe s future, we need ... a driver for unity. Education is key, because it is education that ...helps us... develop a European identity,  Commissioner for Education Tibor Navracsics said. Scaling up the scheme could see 2 million more people taking part in Erasmus over the next 2 years, the Commission said, although leaders were cautious about the funding this would require. Talks on the money would start with discussions on the next seven-year EU budget that starts from 2020. EU leaders also backed the idea that by early 2019, students in the EU should have an electronic student card enabling secure exchange of data like student records and academic attributes and access to services like course materials, enrolment services, online libraries in host institutions and countries.  By 2025 we should live in a Europe in which learning, studying and doing research is not hampered by borders but where spending time in another Member State to study, learn or work is the norm,  Commission Vice-President Jyrki Katainen said. The Commission wants to set a goal that all university students should speak two languages in addition to their mother tongue by 2025, improve computer literacy and create a network of world-class European universities that can work together. The Commission also wants all EU governments to invest, by 2025, a minimum 5 percent of their GDP in education   today s average rate, which Germany, Italy, Ireland, Greece, Spain, Bulgaria or Romania do not meet.

"Two weeks to unlock Brexit, EU tells May","GOTHENBURG, Sweden (Reuters) -  There is more work to be done  to unlock Brexit talks, British Prime Minister Theresa May was told on Friday, as the European Union repeated an early December deadline for her to move on the divorce bill and border with Ireland. May met fellow leaders on the sidelines of an EU summit in Gothenburg, Sweden, to try to break the deadlock over how much Britain will pay on leaving the bloc in 16 months. She signalled again that she would increase an initial offer that is estimated at some 20 billion euros, about a third of what Brussels wants. But without any immediate plans to detail which financial commitments Britain was planning to cover and with a growing row with Ireland over their shared border, European Council President Donald Tusk, who coordinates Brexit for the bloc s other 27 leaders, concluded Britain must take further steps. He increased the pressure on May to make progress by early  December, in time for the EU to react at a summit on Dec. 14-15, or risk losing a chance to push the talks to a discussion of future trade ties, something London desperately wants so it can offer some certainty to nervy businesses. Asked about Brexit minister David Davis complaining that Britain had made  all the running  in finding compromises on the third key divorce issue   the rights of expatriate citizens, Tusk said pointedly:  I can say only that I really appreciate Mr. Davis s English sense of humour.   He told the news conference:  While good progress on citizens has been made, we need to see much more progress on Ireland and on the financial settlement.  In order to avoid any ambiguity about our work calendar, I made it very clear to prime minister May that this progress needs to happen at the beginning of December at the latest.  It was an echo of the ultimatum issued by the EU s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, who a week ago gave Davis until the end of the month to detail the British approach to the financial settlement   and effectively increase the money on the table. But Tusk, who met May earlier on Friday, added another demand - more progress on the future status of the border between EU member Ireland and Northern Ireland, which Britain says is almost impossible to make without discussing the future trade deal as that would determine the kind of customs needed. Under pressure at home from members of parliament in her own party who are concerned she is preparing for Britain to walk away with no deal and from the EU, May has tried to gloss over the differences and emphasise how far the talks have come.  We ve agreed that good progress has been made. More does need to be done. But we re clear, and I m clear, that what we need to do is move forward together and that is how we can ensure that we are going to get the best deal for the United Kingdom and the European Union,  May told reporters. But a growing row with Ireland broke into the open on Friday, with Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney saying Dublin was not ready to allow the talks to move onto a discussion of future trade next month. Prime Minister Leo Varadkar went further.  I can t say in any honesty that it s close on the Irish issue or on the financial settlement,  he told Sky News.  After 40 years of marriage, most of them good, now Britain wants a divorce but an open relationship the day after.  With German Chancellor Angela Merkel absent from the summit because of government formation talks in Berlin, it was left to French President Emmanuel Macron to speak for the heavyweight powers which are taking a tough line with London:  We won t change the agreed process in any way, and we won t open talks on the future relationship as long as the conditions set in the first phase have not been met,  he said Sweden. But May, weakened after losing her Conservative Party s majority at a June election she did not need to call, has little room for manoeuvre.

"EU's Tusk: no deadlock on Brexit, very cautious but optimistic","GOTHENBURG, Sweden (Reuters) - There is no deadlock in divorce talks between Britain and the European Union, EU summit chair Donald Tusk said on Friday, adding he was very cautious, but optimistic that negotiations could move on to the next phase in December. The EU wants to have the main elements of a divorce agreement with Britain on the financial settlement, citizen s rights and the lack of a physical border between Northern Ireland and Ireland before it moves on to talks on a future trade agreement which is key for British-based businesses. So far progress in the three areas has been insufficient, raising the prospect that divorce talks will drag on to next year without starting discussions on a future relationship, as companies need to make strategic business decisions now.  There is no deadlock,  Tusk told reporters on the sidelines of an EU leaders meeting in the Swedish city of Gothenburg where he also held talks with British Prime Minister Theresa May.  I feel much better, safer after my meeting with Theresa May, everything is possible,  Tusk said.  There was very visibly goodwill on both sides. We still have a chance to achieve our first goal   to achieve the finalization of the first phase of negotiations. I am very cautious, but optimistic.  He said he will meet May again next Friday, Nov. 24, to consult on progress during another EU meeting in Brussels. ",worldnews,"November 17, 2017 ",1
"Britain to pay 400 million-pound debt to Iran soon, Iranian envoy says","LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will soon repay a decades-old debt of over 400 million pounds ($527 million) to Iran, the Iranian ambassador said on Friday, adding that the payment was not linked to the case of a British-Iranian charity worker jailed in Iran.  An outstanding debt owed by the U.K. to Tehran will be transferred to the Central Bank of Iran in the coming days. The payment ... has nothing to do with Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe s case,  Hamid Baeedinejad wrote on his Telegram channel. Zaghari-Ratcliffe was detained in April 2016 in Tehran as she tried to leave Iran after a visit with her two-year-old daughter. She was sentenced to five years in prison after an Iranian court convicted her of plotting to overthrow the clerical establishment. She denies the charges, and Britain has called for her release. Iran does not recognize dual citizenship for its nationals.    Britain s debt to Iran dates from the 1970s, before the Islamic Revolution of 1979 toppled the U.S.-backed Shah. Iran paid up front for 1,750 Chieftain tanks and other vehicles, but most were never delivered because of sanctions imposed on Tehran after the revolution.  A British government official, who asked not to be named, said on Friday it was  speculation  that the money would be paid. The Treasury said in a statement the money was frozen by a British court and could not be paid because of sanctions.   The Telegraph newspaper reported on Thursday that Britain was working on a plan to pay Iran the debt, as part of efforts to secure the release of Zaghari-Ratcliffe. On Thursday, British Prime Minister Theresa May s spokesman denied there was any link between the debt and the charity worker s case. Tehran also dismissed the Telegraph report. Zaghari-Ratcliffe is a project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, a charity organization that is independent of Thomson Reuters. It operates independently of Reuters News. In 2009, the International Chamber of Commerce ordered Britain to repay Iran for the undelivered vehicles, but UN and EU sanctions prevented that.  Under a deal between Iran and six major powers in 2015, most sanctions on Iran were lifted last year, in exchange for Tehran curbing its nuclear program.  Iran s Foreign Ministry spokesman said that a range of issues would be discussed with Britain during a visit to Tehran this month by Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, Iranian media reported on Thursday.

Iran says 'biased' French stance threatens Middle East stability,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Iran accused France on Friday of fuelling tension in the Middle East by taking a  biased  stance on Tehran s regional policy, and President Emmanuel Macron said Tehran misunderstood its  balanced  position.     It seems that France has a biased view toward the ongoing crises and humanitarian catastrophes in the Middle East,  Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi was quoted as saying by state TV.  This view fuels regional conflicts, whether intentionally or unintentionally.  French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Thursday France was worried about Iran s involvement in the Middle East crisis and its disputed ballistic missile program.   Iran s role and the different areas where this country operates worries us,  Le Drian told a joint news conference with his Saudi counterpart Adel Jubeir in Riyadh.  I am thinking in particular of Iran s interventions in regional crises, this hegemonic temptation and I m thinking of its ballistic program,  he said. Iran has repeatedly rejected France s call for talks on its missile program, saying it is defensive and unrelated to its 2015 nuclear agreement with world powers. Asked at an EU summit in Gothenburg about Iran s accusations, Macron said Tehran misunderstood France s  balanced  position of talking to everyone and not taking sides between Sunni and Shi ite Muslims.  Our wish is that Iran has a less aggressive strategy in the region and that we can clarify its ballistic missile strategy which seems to be uncontrolled,  he said.  Iran is a power that we wish to have a dialogue with and that we will continue to talk to.  Paris suggested this week that new European Union sanctions against Iran could be discussed over its missile tests. But EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini seemed to dismiss that idea on Tuesday. Shi ite-dominated Iran and its regional arch-rival Sunni Saudi Arabia are involved in proxy wars across the region, backing opposite sides in Syria, Yemen, Iraq and Lebanon. Jubeir told Reuters on Thursday that the kingdom s actions in the Middle East were a response to what he called the  aggression  of Iran. Qasemi said Jubeir was repeating baseless claims, the state news agency IRNA reported on Friday.   Saudi Arabia s foreign minister s gestures and his blame game will definitely not reduce the responsibility of this country in undermining the regional stability and security,  Qasemi said.

Ireland says not ready to let Brexit talks move on to trade,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Britain and Ireland clashed over Brexit on Friday with Dublin saying it was not ready to allow talks to move on to trade issues next month and London ruling out the much longer transitional period preferred by its neighbour. The border between EU-member Ireland and Northern Ireland, which will be the UK s only land frontier with the bloc after its departure, is one of three issues Brussels wants broadly solved before it decides in December whether to move the talks onto a second phase about trade, as Britain wants. Meeting in Dublin, Britain s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and his Irish counterpart Simon Coveney struck an amicable tone but remained far apart on several key aspects.  Yes we all want to move onto phase two of the Brexit negotiations but we are not in a place right now that allows us to do that,  Coveney said.  We have very serious issues, particularly around the border, that need more clarity.  He said Ireland s preference was that Britain as a whole would share the same regulations as the EU post-Brexit but if that was not possible, then London effectively needed to commit to allowing a tailor-made solution for Northern Ireland  In the absence of that, from an Irish persecutive, there is a sense of jumping into the dark,  Coveney said. Speaking before a meeting with his counterpart on the sidelines of a European Union summit in Sweden, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said Dublin would need those assurances written into the conclusions of phase one.  What we want to take off the table before we even talk about trade is any idea that there would be a physical border,  he told reporters.  Once those parameters are set, then we d be happy to move onto phase two, provided the other issues are resolved as well.  However Johnson said talks would have to move onto the next stage before the border issue could be resolved as many of the questions around it were bound up with Britain s future customs arrangement with the European Union. While he said London has absolutely no interest in seeing any kind of hard border, any room for compromise is complicated by the fact that his government are propped up by Northern Ireland s pro-Brexit Democratic Unionist Party, which responded on Friday by saying Dublin was  trying to block  the talks.   It is clear now that the Irish government are fully signed up with the European establishment to thwart the referendum result in the United Kingdom to leave the EU,  DUP MP Sammy Wilson said in a statement. Johnson added that he understood why Ireland wants a four to five-year post-Brexit transition period for Britain to allow businesses in Ireland time to adjust to any new arrangements, but said this was possible within a much tighter timescale.

Belgian judge defers ruling on warrant for ex-Catalan leader: lawyer,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A Belgian judge made no ruling on Friday on a European arrest warrant issued by Spain for ousted Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont, his lawyer said after a court hearing in Brussels. The Belgian prosecutor demanded the warrant to be exercised, but the case for Puigdemont s defense will be made at a hearing early next month.  We will make our case on December 4. The prosecutor has asked for the extradition warrant to be exercised. Nothing has been decided today,  Paul Bekaert told reporters outside the main Brussels court. The prosecutor had determined that according to Belgian law Puigdemont and four of his former ministers who traveled with him to Brussels were charged with conspiracy by public officials, Bekaert added. Under the Spanish warrant, all five faced charges of rebellion and sedition. They had left Spain after Puigdemont s regional government was sacked by Madrid for unilaterally declaring Catalonia independent following a referendum on secession that court authorities in Madrid had ruled was illegal. The European arrest warrant system in place since 2004 makes it easier for EU countries to demand the extradition from other EU states of people wanted for crimes, and removes political decision-making from the process. EU countries issue thousands of such warrants each year. The Oct. 1 referendum and subsequent turmoil have plunged Spain into its gravest political crisis since the return of democracy four decades ago. Puigdemont has since said he might consider a solution that did not involve secession. ",worldnews,"November 17, 2017 ",1
Pakistan issues 'last warning' to Islamists blocking route into capital,"ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistani authorities issued a final warning on Friday to members of an Islamist party blocking a main road into the capital, raising fears of a violent clash. Hundreds of supporters of the Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan party have been blocking the route into Islamabad for nearly 10 days, demanding the minister of law be sacked for what they say is blasphemy.  You all are being given a last warning,  the Islamabad deputy commissioner said in the order. A court had already ordered the party to end the protest, the order added.  After this final announcement, you all are being warned to end the illegal sit-in immediately.        Tehreek-e-Labaik blames the minister, Zahid Hamid, for changes to an electoral oath that it says amount to blasphemy. The government puts the issue down to a clerical error. Pakistan s blasphemy law is a lightning rod for Islamists, especially since 2011 when the liberal governor of Punjab province, Salman Taseer, was murdered by a bodyguard for questioning it. The law mandates the death penalty for insulting Islam or the Prophet Mohammad. A spokesman for the Labaik party, Ejaz Ashrafi, said the group would not comply with the deputy commissioner s ultimatum.   We re not moving,  he told Reuters by phone from the sit-in.  Pakistan s Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal appealed to the protesters to end the sit-in before a delegation of Chinese investors arrived in Islamabad on Monday, making a last offer to negotiate on their demands. But he added:  If some group tries to hold the state hostage, that behavior will not be tolerated.   A government official, Khalid Abbasi, said protesters on the road were carrying rods and sticks. Since they were given the warning, he said, hundreds more party workers had joined the sit-in.     The government has blocked several roads with shipping containers in an effort to corral the protesters, causing hours-long traffic jams in and around the capital. In 2007, a confrontation between authorities and supporters of radical preachers at an Islamabad mosque led to more than 100 deaths.  All resources can be used to break this sit-in,  the deputy commissioner s warning said.  ",worldnews,"November 17, 2017 ",1
Killer of South African anti-apartheid leader Hani denied parole,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa s Justice Minister Michael Masutha on Friday denied parole to the killer of anti-apartheid leader Chris Hani, saying he had not expressed remorse for the murder. Janusz Walus has served more than 20 years of a life sentence for the assassination of Hani, who was a senior member of the now-ruling African National Congress (ANC) and head of the South African Communist Party. Walus, 64, emigrated from communist Poland in 1981 and became involved in far-right politics in South Africa.  He shot Hani outside the anti-apartheid activist s home in 1993. The killing triggered nationwide riots that threatened to derail South Africa s 1994 transition to multi-racial democracy after decades of white apartheid rule. Masutha also blocked Walus  parole application in 2015, a decision that triggered several court challenges. The Supreme Court of Appeal referred the matter back to the justice minister for reconsideration.  Masutha said on Friday a psychologist s report had highlighted Walus  political ideology as a risk factor. The report said Walus  expressed remorse for the fact that the victim s children are fatherless and the wife is a widow .  However, he showed no remorse for murdering Chris Hani. He still rationalizes his actions and insists that they were politically motivated. His ideas about communism still stand.  ",worldnews,"November 17, 2017 ",1
UK Lords appoint first woman to historic 'Black Rod' role,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain s upper parliamentary chamber, the House of Lords, has appointed a woman to the role of  Black Rod  for the first time in the office s 650-year history. Sarah Clarke, currently responsible for the organization of the annual Wimbledon tennis championships, will be known as The Lady Usher of the Black Rod. In charge of the major ceremonial events in the Palace of Westminster, Black Rod is best known for having the door to the House of Commons slammed in the official s face at the State Opening of Parliament to symbolize the independence of the lower House. Black Rod traditionally reacts to the historic insult by banging three times on the door with his symbol of office, an ebony staff topped with a golden lion. The door is then opened and all Members of Parliament follow Black Rod back to the Lords Chamber to hear the Queen s Speech. The earliest known reference to the role is in letters patent from 1361 which refer to one Walter Whitehorse performing the role. There are thought to have been 60 holders of the position since then, while there are also Black Rods in the parliaments and legislative assemblies of Canada, Australia and New Zealand.  In a statement, Clarke, who will start early next year,  said she was honored to be invited to take up the role.   The House of Lords is a place where the smallest detail is as important as the big picture and the depth of heritage and tradition is second to none,  she said. Lord Fowler, Speaker of the House of Lords said it was a historic moment for the House.  People are most familiar with Black Rod for the part they play at State Opening, but the job is much more than that,  he said. ",worldnews,"November 17, 2017 ",1
Kosovo court jails four for 2016 parliament rocket attack,"PRISTINA (Reuters) - A court in Kosovo on Friday sentenced four people, including a member of parliament, to prison terms ranging from 2 to 8 years for taking part in a grenade attack against the parliament building last year. The four were found responsible for throwing a rocket propelled grenade at the building in August last year in order to halt adoption of a border deal with Montenegro. No one was injured in the attack. Tensions between opposition parties and the then-ruling coalition rose last summer as the parliament was getting ready to adopt border deal with Montenegro, key for Kosovo to get visa-free travel regime with the European Union.  Opposition parties opposed the deal saying the country of 1.8 million is losing land by handing over some 8,000 hectares (19,700 acres)of Kosovo territory to Montenegro.  In a protest over the deal, opposition deputies released tear gas in the parliament chamber, while its supporters clashed with the police during street protests.  Frasher Krasniqi, parliament deputy of the biggest opposition party Vetevendosje was found guilty and sentenced to 8 years in prison.  Adea Batusha, 23, a niece of Vetevendosje s leader, was sentenced to two years in prison.  One of the defendants was found dead in his cell in November 2016 before the trial started. Vetevendosje blamed the authorities for this death but police said he killed himself.  For all these unjust judgments, sooner or later, those criminals who ordered these fabricated trials will be held accountable, before the law and before the history,  Frasher Krasniqi wrote in his Facebook page after the verdict. Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, nearly a decade after NATO bombing drove Serb forces from its territory. ",worldnews,"November 17, 2017 ",1

Russian long-range bombers strike Islamic State targets in Syria: agencies,"MOSCOW/BEIRUT (Reuters) - Russian long-range bombers struck Islamic State on Friday in Albu Kamal in eastern Syria, where the jihadists have staged a counter-attack after the Syrian army declared victory over them.  Six TU-22M3 bombers took off from bases in Russia and overflew Iran and Iraq before launching the strike, the Russian defense ministry said in a statement reported by Russian news agencies. Albu Kamal, a small town on the border with Iraq, was Islamic State s last Syrian stronghold, along with some neighboring villages and desert areas.  The Syrian army said it and its allies, including the Lebanese Hezbollah group, took it from the militants on Nov. 9 and declared  the fall of the terrorist Daesh organization s project in the region .  Islamic State fighters hidden in Albu Kamal launched a counter-attack days later and forced the army and its allies to pull out of Albu Kamal, residents said on Nov. 13.  The army, which has driven Islamic State from huge swathes of central and eastern Syria in a multi-pronged campaign this year, re-entered the town soon afterwards, a war monitor said.  TASS cited the ministry as saying the planes had bombed Islamic State fortified positions, militants, and armored vehicles. Satellite and drone surveillance had confirmed that all of the designated targets had been destroyed, it said. ",worldnews,"November 17, 2017 ",1
Finnish police rap deputy minister for hiding in car boot in government crisis,"HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finnish police reprimanded a man for traveling in a car boot to hide his meeting with Prime Minister Juha Sipila during a government crisis last summer, saying this was breach of the traffic code. A police statement did not name the man in the boot, but in effect indicated the traveler was State Secretary Samuli Virtanen, who is also the deputy to Foreign Minister Timo Soini. The meeting took place in June, a day after Virtanen s co-ruling Finns party had elected anti-immigration hardliners as its new leaders. The government was close to collapse until a group of politicians, including Virtanen and Soini, in the following week walked out of the Finns party and announced they would form a new group. The Finns party was thrown out of the government and the new  Blue Reform  group kept its cabinet seat. Virtanen has not commented on the case, but lawmaker Tiina Elovaara from Blue Reform said in a blog that Virtanen climbed into the boot to keep the meeting secret at a critical moment.  He avoided media attention when the situation was most serious, and the risk of leakage about the parliamentarians  transition was too big,  Elovaara said. Police said that the man had traveled a few tens of meters in the back of the car, failing to use a safety belt. He had admitted the act to the police. The road from the Prime Minister s residency has little traffic, and only the man was at risk of harm, the police said.  The given notification is considered as a sufficient sanction,  Inspector Pekka Seppala said. He added that the police had been asked to investigate the case based on information in media reports.

Turkey pulls troops out of NATO exercise over 'enemy' list,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey is pulling 40 soldiers out of a NATO exercise in Norway, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday, after his name appeared in a list of enemies on a poster at the drill, an incident that drew an apology from both the military alliance and Oslo. Turkey has the second largest army in the alliance after the United States, and it borders Syria, Iraq and Iran, lending it great strategic importance for NATO. But the relationship has become increasingly fractious as Ankara drifts away from the alliance and the European Union, alarming the West. Erdogan said an  enemy poster , featuring his name on one side and a picture of modern Turkey s founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, on the other, was unfurled at the training exercise in Norway, prompting a decision by Turkey s military chief and European Union minister to pull the troops out.  They said they had decided to pull our troops out and will do so, so we told them to not stop and go ahead ... take our 40 soldiers out of there,  Erdogan told members of his ruling AK Party in Ankara. Commenting on the incident at the alliance s Joint Warfare Centre in Stavanger, Norway, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said:  I apologize for the offense that has been caused.   The incidents were the result of an individual s actions and do not reflect the views of NATO,  said Stoltenberg, who is a former Norwegian prime minister, in a written statement. The individual involved, a civilian contractor seconded by Norway and not a NATO employee, was immediately removed from the exercise, Stoltenberg said. It would be up for the Norwegian authorities to decide on any disciplinary action, he added.  Turkey is a valued NATO Ally, which makes important contributions to Allied security, Stoltenberg said. In a separate statement, Norwegian Defence Minister Frank Bakke-Jensen said the offending message had been published on a computer network used during the exercise.  The message does not reflect Norway s views or policies and I apologize for the content of the message,  he said, adding there would be a thorough investigation followed by  appropriate measures .

Grace Mugabe: the office worker who wanted to rule Zimbabwe,"HARARE (Reuters) - The spectacular rise and fall of Zimbabwe s uncompromising First Lady, Grace Mugabe, had an unusual beginning: an office affair. It was the early 1990s when President Robert Mugabe s eye fell upon one of his shy young typists. She would become his wife, a ferociously ambitious politician and, more than two decades later, a contributor to the downfall of her 93-year-old husband. President Mugabe is trying to cling to power after the military took over this week in response to his purge of vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa, 75, a liberation war fighter and Grace s sworn enemy. Mnangagwa s aides even accused her of trying to poison him with ice cream from her dairy farm this year. She denies this. Grace, now 52 and under house arrest in Harare, had been calling for Mnangagwa s removal for weeks as the two fought an increasingly bitter winner-takes-all contest to succeed the man who has led Zimbabwe since independence from Britain in 1980. It wasn t the first time Grace had wielded influence over her husband. When it appeared former vice president Joice Majuru was in line to succeed Mugabe in 2014, he fired her following public rallies at which Grace derided Majuru. This time she appears to have gone too far. The purge of Mnangagwa and many of his comrades irked the military, who had no intention of allowing Grace and her youthful Generation 40 (G40) faction of the ruling ZANU-PF to take over the political reins. Deeply unpopular among much of the Zimbabwean public due to her alleged corruption and volatile temper, Grace does not have the liberation credentials the military believe are required to be a Zimbabwean ruler. The lavish lifestyle that earned her the nickname  Gucci Grace  and the political ambition that almost propelled her to the presidency were not evident when she met her future husband.  He just started talking to me, asking me about my life,  she told a South African journalist in 2013.  I didn t know it was leading somewhere. I was quite a shy person, very shy.  At the time, they were both married. President Mugabe s wife, Sally, was desperately ill and died in 1992. Grace and Robert were married in 1996 and have three children.  DIS-GRACE  At first Grace stayed out of politics and was better known for her spending habits, including buying mansions in South Africa, rare diamond jewelry, and Rolls-Royce limousines for her playboy sons. Then there are the repeated allegations of violence. In Singapore in 2009, photographer Richard Jones says Grace flew into a rage when he tried to take her picture. She ordered her bodyguards to hold his arms back while she punched him repeatedly in the face. Grace denies the assault. In August this year, Grace was accused of beating a young South African model who was partying with her sons. According to Gabriella Engels, Grace burst into a hotel room where she was talking with friends and whipped her with an electric cable as bodyguards looked on. Grace says she acted in self-defense after Engels tried to stab her with a knife. The reports of lavish spending and explosive temper earned her the title  Dis-Grace  back home in Zimbabwe, where an economic crisis had left most of the 16 million population mired in poverty and unemployment. Zimbabweans also question Grace s credentials. Eyebrows were raised in 2014 when she gained a PhD in three months. Her thesis, on the changing role of the family, has never been published. This hasn t stopped her trying to reach the political summit. When Majuru was removed, Grace became head of the ZANU-PF Women s League, giving her a seat at the party s top table. She used her political platform to take on Mnangagwa and his allies and made a push to succeed her frail husband.  They say I want to be president. Why not? Am I not a Zimbabwean?  Grace said at a recent rally. ",worldnews,"November 17, 2017 ",1

Lebanon's Middle East Airlines lifts electronics ban on London flights,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon s national carrier Middle East Airlines (MEA) on Friday lifted restrictions on carry-on electronic devices on planes traveling from Beirut to London, the airline said.

The driver of the bus, which was taking a group of blind people back home after an excursion to the town of Dryanovo, was among the dead and some of the injured were in a critical condition. The accident occurred soon after noon (1000 GMT) on the highway connecting Bulgaria s capital Sofia and the Black Sea city of Varna, near the village of Mikre, some 130 kilometers (81 miles) west of Sofia. The ministry said the injured were taken to hospital, but did not say how many of them were in a critical condition. The causes of the accident have yet to be established but Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov ordered the transport ministry to carry out a full inspection of the minibus involved, the ministry said. Local media reported that there had been at least eight serious car crashes, killing 10 people, on the same stretch of road near Mikre since 2014. Bulgaria, which has a population of 7.1 million, has the highest road death rate in the European Union. A total of 535 people died in accidents on Bulgarian roads in the first 10 months of 2017, interior ministry data showed. ",worldnews,"November 17, 2017 ",1
"Egypt orders suspected Libyan militant, 14 others be held over desert attack","CAIRO (Reuters) - The Egyptian public prosecutor ordered that a suspected Libyan militant and 14 others be held for 15 days pending an investigation of their role in a deadly attack in Egypt s western desert last month, state news MENA reported on Friday. The Interior Ministry said on Thursday that Abdelrahim Mohamed al-Mesmari, from the Libyan city of Derna, was captured by Egyptian forces following an air raid in response to the attack. Security sources initially said at least 52 policemen were killed when militants attacked a patrol, firing rockets and detonating explosives in a remote part of the desert. The Interior Ministry refuted those figures and said 16 were killed. Charges against Mesmari will include premeditated murder of police officers, possession of firearms and joining a terrorist organization, MENA reported.    A new and little-known group called Ansar al-Islam claimed responsibility for the October attack, posing a new threat to Egyptian security forces, which have been battling an Islamic State insurgency in the Sinai peninsula since 2013. The military last month killed 15 militants in an air raid directed at the group it blamed for the desert attack, according to the Interior Ministry, which said that all of those killed had been trained in Derna.  Mesmari escaped the air raid but was later arrested along with 29 Egyptians who had been recruited to join the group, according to the Interior Ministry. (This version of the story corrects final paragraph to clarify that 29 suspects were arrested later, after the air strike in which 15 were killed) ",worldnews,"November 17, 2017 ",1
ECHR orders Greece to pay damages over probe of death in wiretap case,"ATHENS (Reuters) - Europe s top human rights court has faulted Greece for failing to fully investigate the death of a telecoms engineer in 2005 during a scandal over wiretapping of the country s political leadership. Costas Tsalikidis, 38, was found hanged in his apartment in Athens in March 2005, around the time that Vodafone Greece told authorities of widespread wiretapping of much of the government, including the prime minister, via Vodafone s network. Tsalikidis had worked for Vodafone.  On two occasions, Greek judicial authorities ruled out foul play related to Tsalikidis s death. He did not leave a note and his family said he was not suicidal. They took the case to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).      The Court considers that the national authorities failed to carry out an adequate and effective investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of Mr Tsalikidis,  the Strasbourg-based court said in a ruling dated Nov. 16. It ordered Greece to pay Tsalikidis s family 50,000 euros in damages for the state s failure to clarify circumstances surrounding his death.  The Court observes, in particular, that the difficulty in determining whether there was any substance in the applicants  claim that their relative was unlawfully killed rests with the failure of the authorities adequately to investigate the circumstances of the death,  it said.  A Greek prosecutor would investigate whether the case needed to be reopened, Greek court sources told Reuters on Friday. Then Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis and the foreign, defense and public order ministers were among about 100 people whose mobile phones were tapped for months around the time of the 2004 Athens Olympics. Unauthorized installed software allowed calls to and from scores of mobile phones to be recorded from June 2004 until March 2005. It stopped when Vodafone discovered the incident and reported it to authorities, Reuters reported at the time. Who was behind the wiretap is unclear. In 2006 and 2007, Vodafone Greece was fined a total of 95 million euros by Greek regulators for breaching privacy rules. A forensic expert contracted by Tsalikidis s family called the initial autopsy probe  grossly inadequate , while a second investigation launched after exhumation in 2012 revealed inconsistencies which should have been investigated further, the ECHR said in its verdict.  (The) Court notably bore in mind that the public prosecutor, during the initial investigation, had mentioned that the death had been causally linked to the wiretapping case. It had therefore been all the more important to take every measure necessary to investigate Costas Tsalikidis  death,  the court said. It noted Tsalikidis s family had at no point contended Greek authorities were responsible for his death or implied Greece was aware he was at risk.  ",worldnews,"November 17, 2017 ",1

"Serbian, U.S. army paratroopers jump together to boost ties","BELGRADE (Reuters) - Paratroopers from Serbia and the United States jumped side-by-side just north of Belgrade on Friday as part of a training tailored to bolster ties between the Balkan country and NATO. The exercise dubbed Winter 2017, may raise eyebrows in Moscow which wants to keep Serbia, a Slavic and Orthodox Christian ally under its umbrella, and is worried over possible NATO expansion in the Balkans. It is also a long way from 1999 when NATO bombed what was then Yugoslavia because of its policies toward Kosovo. Although the European Union is Serbia s single largest trade partner and investor, Russia controls its oil and gas supplies. Moscow has also sought to bolster military ties with Belgrade with the donation of six MiG-29 fighter jets. Serbia is one of the few Balkan countries not in the 28-member NATO which is hugely unpopular there due to its 1999 bombing campaign. Alliance troops are still deployed in Kosovo, Serbia s former southern province, whose 2008 independence has not been accepted by Belgrade, Russia, China and some EU members. But joint exercises take place anyway. After more than 100 paratroopers from Serbian elite brigades and the U.S. Army 173rd Airborne Brigade landed on a grassy runway of a small airport near Belgrade, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic dubbed the drill part of confidence-building activities.   The other (goal) is the creation of cooperation, partnerships and friendships (in areas that) we were not always able to boast about in the past,  Vucic told reporters. In 2006 Serbia, which maintains military neutrality, joined NATO s Partnership for Peace program and in 2015 it signed the Individual Partnership Action Plan - the highest level of cooperation for countries not aspiring to join.  Although it strives for a balance between Moscow and the West, rejecting calls from U.S. officials to pick its side, Serbia in 2017 had 13 military drills with NATO or its members, seven with the U.S. and only two with Russia.

New Israeli draft laws seen protecting PM under criminal probe,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Two of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s closest allies have initiated legislation in what opponents say is a rearguard action to try to shield him from a police probe into corruption allegations against him. Netanyahu is a suspect in two cases, one into alleged meddling in the media industry and the other into gifts he received from rich businessmen. He denies any wrongdoing. But, if charged, he would come under heavy pressure to resign or could call an election to test whether he still had a mandate. Two lawmakers who want Netanyahu to stay in power have proposed two new draft laws that have alarmed the attorney-general and the police. One would bar police from providing prosecutors with the investigators  conclusions on whether charges should be brought against suspects. The second, known as the  French Law  because of similarities with legislation in France, would delay any investigation of a prime minister until he or she leaves office. Netanyahu, a right-wing leader now in his fourth term, has said he has no interest in promoting personal legislation, but he has not ordered his coalition head, David Bitan and his co-sponsor of the bills, David Amsalem, to withdraw the bills. Bitan said that once police publish their findings, suspects are convicted in the court of public opinion even if they are eventually cleared. Those who oppose the draft bills are more worried about toppling Netanyahu than about democracy, he said.  They (the bills) protect democracy. Suspects have rights too,  Bitan told Reuters.  The  French Law  has not yet been brought before parliament. Coalition partners are at odds over its phrasing but Bitan says he will not shelve the legislation.  The bill, he said, would not apply to the present investigations against the prime minister. But if passed, it could potentially affect any future legal moves affecting Netanyahu in at least one other case in which he is currently not a suspect. [L5N1ND240] Parliament passed the first draft in an initial reading this month but both drafts may ultimately fall through before being written into law. The  French Law  would not apply to any investigations under way, but the other proposed law would.  In comments leaked to the media, Attorney-General Avichai Mandelblit complained about  a multitude of proposals that are meant to harm us all .  Lawmakers and cabinet ministers have a right to propose bills, he said in remarks broadcast on Army Radio. But, in comments suggesting they were politically motivated, added that   this batch is not innocent .  I m being attacked on all fronts with means that are not within the rules of the democratic game,  Mandelblit said.      Police also said, in a statement to Reuters, that they had come under pressure from politicians.   Police will keep with its determined fight against crime and corruption, keep serving the public and will not be deterred by any attempt to weaken it,  the statement said. The two investigations in which Netanyahu is a suspect are  known as Case 1000 and Case 2000. Case 1000 revolves around gifts he received from businessmen, including cigars and champagne. Netanyahu s lawyers say they were simply presents from long-time friends, with no quid pro quo. Case 2000 focuses on suspicions Netanyahu negotiated with the publisher of Israel s best-selling newspaper for better coverage in return for curbs on the competition. The prime minister s lawyers say Netanyahu never seriously considered any such deal.    Netanyahu has described himself as a victim of a political witch hunt and said of the cases against him:  There will be nothing because there is nothing.   The prime minister is under no legal obligation to step down if indicted, but some political analysts predict he would opt for new elections to renew his public mandate if charged. All four prime ministers of the past two decades have been suspects in police investigations but only Ehud Olmert was charged and convicted. He spent 16 months in jail for accepting bribes from real estate developers.   In high-profile cases such as these, police usually say if they have gathered sufficient evidence against the suspects, before handing over to the Justice Ministry, where the Attorney-General and prosecutors decide whether to file charges. Mordechai Kremnitzer, a law professor and vice president of the Israel Democracy Institute, said Netanyahu s governing coalition was abusing  the power of legislation  to try to extricate him from his legal problems.  This has set a record and reflects a complete loss of restraint and total shamelessness,  he said. ",worldnews,"November 17, 2017 ",1
"Governor of Yemen's interim capital resigns, accuses PM of corruption","ADEN (Reuters) - The governor of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi s interim capital Aden has resigned, citing what he said was government corruption that had undermined his efforts to restore basic services to the city. Abdulaziz al-Muflehi s resignation just six months after his appointment deals a blow to Hadi s government as it pushes its fight against the Iran-aligned Houthis who have seized much of northern Yemen since late 2014, forcing Hadi into exile. Officials from Prime Minister Ahmed Obeid bin Daghr s office did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The government denies charges of corruption and says it operates according to high standards of transparency. In a lengthy letter sent to Hadi, Muflehi said he had intended to focus on infrastructure building and activating state bodies such as the judiciary and police when he assumed office in May.  Unfortunately, I found myself caught in a bitter war against a huge camp of corruption whose brigades are well trained and fortifications are protected by guards led by Prime Minister Dr. Ahmed Obeid bin Daghr,  Muflehi wrote in his resignation letter, a copy of which was sent to Reuters. The letter was also published by local media, including online newspapers Aden News and Aden al-Ghad. As an example, he said bin Daghr had transferred more than 5.787 billion riyals ($13.4 million) from the province s account to the Communications Ministry, saying he wanted to give Yemen an internet service that rivals advanced countries. Muflehi said the country first needed to restore electricity services to areas like Aden, and said the move  hides avidities and corruption .  Muflehi had spent much of his time outside Aden since he was appointed by Hadi in May to replace Aydaroos al-Zubaydi, a local militia commander who had thrown his weight behind secessionists demanding the restoration of the former South Yemen that merged with the tribal north in 1990. Southerners have regularly complained of the domination of the more populous north in the union, including allegations of seizure of real estate and forced retirement of civil servants and military personnel under former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who was forced to step down after mass protests in 2011. Hadi s government had pledged to restore sacked civil servants and military personnel and pay back salaries they had complained had been denied to them, but the outbreak of civil war in 2015 has derailed the plans.

He said that the main aim now is that Hariri can return to Lebanon without any conditions or restrictions on his freedom and, once back in Lebanon, that he can decide whether to step down as the prime minister, the news agency reported. He said, according to the agency, that Hariri should still be considered as Lebanon s serving prime minister. Hariri s visit to France was aimed solely at securing his return to Lebanon, the agency reported. Bassil said earlier on Friday that some forces are trying to oust the Lebanese leader.

Exclusive: North Korea rules out negotiations on nuclear weapons,"GENEVA (Reuters) - North Korea on Friday ruled out negotiations with Washington as long as joint U.S-South Korea military exercises continue, and said that Pyongyang s atomic weapons program would remain as a deterrent against a U.S. nuclear threat. In an interview with Reuters, Han Tae Song, North Korea s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, brushed off the new  sanctions which the Trump administration has said it is preparing, as well as the possibility of North Korea being added to a U.S. list of states sponsoring terrorism. South Korea and the United States agreed on Friday to keep working for a peaceful end to the North Korean nuclear crisis, but a U.S. envoy said it was difficult to gauge the reclusive North s intentions as there has been  no signal . Han, asked about those bilateral talks in Seoul, replied:  As long as there is continuous hostile policy against my country by the U.S. and as long as there are continued war games at our doorstep, then there will not be negotiations.    There are continued military exercises using nuclear assets as well as aircraft carriers, and strategic bombers and then...raising such kinds of military exercises against my country,  he said. He, who is ambassador to the U.N. s Conference on Disarmament, was speaking at the Democratic People s Republic of Korea (DPRK) mission in Geneva, where the DPRK and the United States secured a 1994 nuclear deal which later fell apart.  He said he had no information on when North Korea might test a ballistic missile again, after the last one two months ago.   The DPRK, my country, will continue to build-up its self-defense capability, the pivot of which is nuclear forces and capability for a triumphant...strike as long as U.S. and hostile forces keep up nuclear threat and blackmail,  Han said.   Our country plans ultimate completion of the nuclear force,  he said. China said on Thursday that a  dual suspension  proposal to handle North Korea was still the best option, after U.S. President Donald Trump said he and Chinese President Xi Jinping had rejected a  freeze for freeze  agreement. Han, asked about China s latest appeal for a freeze, said  the situation is far from those things . Han said that U.S. administrations had  never accepted  halting joint military exercises, adding:  So if they accept such things, then we will think what we do in the future.  North Korea could not consider abandoning its nuclear program, he said, adding:  This is the deterrent, the nuclear deterrent to cope with the nuclear threat from America.  Han said that Trump was expected to announce further sanctions against North Korea. Existing sanctions have constituted  large-scale human rights violations  that had delayed delivery of aid and consumer goods, he said.  It is obvious that the aim of the sanctions is to overthrow the system of my country by isolating and stifling it and to intentionally bring about humanitarian disaster instead of preventing weapons development as claimed by the U.S. and its followers,  he said. Han, asked whether new U.S. sanctions were expected against North Korean individuals or financial structures, said:   The media is saying the Americans and Trump are considering such things.  But that is their business and then we don t mind what they want to do against my country since the aim is quite clear.  So we are ready for such kinds of measures taken by  America against my country,  he said. ",worldnews,"November 17, 2017 ",1
Saudi Arabia swapping assets for freedom of some held in graft purge: sources,"BEIRUT/RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi authorities are striking agreements with some of those detained in an anti-corruption crackdown, asking them to hand over assets and cash in return for their freedom, sources familiar with the matter said. The deals involve separating cash from assets like property and shares, and looking at bank accounts to assess cash values, one of the sources told Reuters. Dozens of princes, senior officials and businessmen, including cabinet ministers and billionaires, have been detained in the graft inquiry at least partly aimed at strengthening the power of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. These include billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, one of the kingdom s most prominent businessmen. One businessman had tens of millions of Saudi riyals withdrawn from his account after he signed. In another case, a former senior official consented to hand over ownership of four billion riyals worth of shares, the source said.   The Saudi government earlier this week moved from freezing accounts to issuing instructions for  expropriation of unencumbered assets  or seizure of assets, said a second source familiar with the situation. There was no immediate comment from the Saudi government on the deals and the sources declined to be identified because these agreements are not public. Analysts said the deals may help end uncertainty about the anti-corruption crackdown but could have an impact on Saudi Arabia s risk perception among investors.   Eliminating uncertainty about what the Saudi authorities are going to do goes a long way toward giving the market comfort that the regime is getting its house in order, and plugging its deficit,  said Louis Gargour, founder and senior portfolio manager at London-based hedge fund LNG Capital. Riyadh has been cutting spending while raising taxes and fees to curb a state budget deficit caused by low oil prices. The deficit, which hit $98 billion in 2015, is shrinking but at a high cost to the economy - data in late September showed Saudi Arabia in recession during the second quarter. The Saudi government has in recent years been pressing wealthy individuals to invest more in the kingdom and bring home some of their wealth from overseas. The United States is closely watching the situation in Saudi Arabia, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Friday. Asked about agreements to hand over wealth for detainees  freedom, Mnuchin told CNBC:  I think that the Crown Prince (Mohammed bin Salman) is doing a great job at transforming the country.  Gargour said:  From a civil liberties point of view obviously incarcerating people doesn t give us comfort, and that s why we ve seen spreads on Saudi bonds go 50 basis points or so wider.  Funds started selling Middle East bonds early this month after Saudi Arabia detained dozens of senior officials and businessmen in an unprecedented crackdown on graft. Credit spreads and the cost of insuring debt against default have increased not only for Saudi Arabia and Lebanon, but across the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, which includes Qatar, Kuwait and Abu Dhabi.  From a trading point of view you want to identify the private companies most impacted and short or sell them, and conversely public sector companies will benefit,  said Gargour. The market value of the portfolio of Saudi equities held by the Public Investment Fund, the kingdom s sovereign wealth fund, has gained, even as the arrest or questioning of more than 200 people in the inquiry caused stocks in many privately controlled firms to slump. Reuters could not immediately verify a Financial Times report that in some cases the government is seeking to appropriate as much as 70 percent of suspects  wealth to channel hundreds of billions of dollars into depleted state coffers. The Saudi authorities have help from international auditors, investigators and people with experience in tracing assets. Bank representatives are on hand to execute the decisions immediately, one of the sources said. Saudi authorities have said they have questioned 208 people in an anti-corruption investigation and estimate at least $100 billion has been stolen through graft, an official said last week as the inquiry expanded beyond the kingdom s borders into the United Arab Emirates. Those detained include other high-profile businessmen such as Mohammad al-Amoudi, whose wealth is estimated by Forbes at $10.4 billion, with construction, agriculture and energy companies in Sweden, Saudi Arabia and Ethiopia; and finance and healthcare magnate Saleh Kamel, whose fortune is seen at $2.3 billion. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is trying to use the anti-corruption purge as a way of boosting his popularity with the Saudi population, said Jason Tuvey, Middle East economist at Capital Economics.  But he may have realized that by doing this he s gone a step too far and ruffled too many feathers, and he is maybe trying to find a way out that means these people don t end up in prison forever and can carry on their business operations as before.

Italy holds funeral for 26 Nigerian women drowned in Mediterranean,"SALERNO, Italy (Reuters) - Italy held a mass funeral on Friday for 26 young Nigerian women who drowned while trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea. A Roman Catholic bishop and a Muslim imam both said prayers at the simple ceremony in the southern city of Salerno, with 26 wooden coffins laid out on a stone dais. A single white rose was placed on the lid of each. Just two of the women were identified.  It is very likely that these girls were victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation,  said Federico Soda, director UN migration agency IOM for the Mediterranean. A recent IOM report had estimated that 80 percent of Nigerian girls arriving in Italy by sea might be trafficking victims. The 26 bodies were retrieved from the sea on Nov. 3 by a Spanish rescue ship, while some 64 people were unaccounted for and feared lost, bringing the total dead to around 90, said Flavio Di Giacomo, an IOM spokesman. Survivors found on nearby rubber boats said the women were all Nigerian and had left Libya hoping to make it to Italy. The only two identified were named as Marian Shaka, who was married, and Osato Osaro. Both were pregnant. Some of those who died were believed to have been as young as 14. Almost 115,000 migrants, mainly African men, have reached Italy so far this year, according to government data released on Friday, against just over 167,000 in the same period last year. IOM said at least 2,925 people died trying to cross the Mediterranean from Jan 1.-Nov. 5 against 4,302 last year. The Italian government has worked with Libyan authorities to block migrants from leaving the north African state, leading to a sharp fall in new arrivals since the summer. The government says its policy has cut the number of sea deaths, while critics say it has left thousands of refugees and migrants trapped in appalling conditions in Libya.

Ukraine prosecutors open case as inter-agency conflict escalates,"KIEV (Reuters) - Ukrainian prosecutors said on Friday they were investigating a case that could involve the head of the national anti-corruption bureau, the latest in a merry-go-round of law enforcement officials taking action against each other.  Prosecutors are checking an audio recording of a man reading out a wiretapping transcript to unknown persons, which could constitute the illegal sharing of classified information.  They are trying to establish whether the voice belongs to bureau director Artem Sytnyk. Contacted for comment, a spokeswoman for the bureau said Sytnyk was traveling abroad. Ukraine s political leaders want to convince their international backers they are serious about tackling entrenched corruption but have made only limited progress, delaying billions in new loans.  An investigation into the possible disclosure of secret documents has been registered,  General Prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko said in a televised briefing.  If it is confirmed that this document s status was secret and if it is confirmed that it was done by that law enforcement official, then he will have problems with the law,  he said. The bureau, known by its acronym NABU, and a sister anti-corruption agency known as NAZK were both set up after pro-Western leaders took charge of Ukraine in 2014, following a wave of unrest and the escape into exile of a Kremlin-backed former leader.  Lutsenko s statement caps a week of allegations flying around between different agencies.  On Monday, a senior prosecutor told Reuters that senior political leaders were trying to bury corruption investigations through a change to the criminal code that would result in NABU being overloaded with case work.  On Tuesday, NABU said it HAD opened a case against NAZK after allegations by a whistleblower, who also accused President Petro Poroshenko s office of exerting improper influence over the agency. The president s office denies the allegation. On Friday, as well as prosecutors announcing an investigation into NABU, NABU said it had opened a case in October against Lutsenko at the behest of a court, but gave no details of the investigation.   The investigation continues,  NABU spokeswoman Svitlana Olifira told 112 channel about Lutsenko s case.  There are no conclusions. The task is to check the facts.  Lutsenko dismissed the case as illogical, saying it concerned whether he should have declared two parking places belonging to his adult son in an online registry of officials  income and property.  I am confident in the legality of my position,  he said. Conflict between NABU and the general prosecutor s office is nothing new. In August 2016 prosecutors raided NABU offices and then later interrogated two NABU officials, sparking a protest from anti-corruption campaigners. Lutsenko said infighting between the agencies was unacceptable.  It seems to me that healthy cooperation between all law enforcement bodies is being destabilized,  he said.

EU leaders proclaim European social standards to woo voters,"GOTHENBURG, Sweden (Reuters) - European Union leaders proclaimed a set of 20  social rights  on Friday in an attempt to make the EU more appealing to voters and counter rising eurosceptic sentiment across the bloc. The set of social rights, supported by all EU governments and institutions, spells out what the EU believes are the foundations of fair and well-functioning modern labor markets and welfare systems. It encompasses principles ranging from equal access to jobs and fair working conditions and wages to social protection and unemployment benefits and training.  Our Union has always been a social project at heart. It is more than just a single market, more than money, more than the euro. It is about our values and the way we want to live,  European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said.  Today we assert our common values and commit ourselves to a set of 20 principles and rights. From the right to fair wages to the right to health care; from lifelong learning, a better work-life balance and gender equality to minimum income,  he said. Recent elections in Germany, France, Austria and the Czech Republic, in which populist parties have performed well, have shown citizens have lost confidence in governments or in the European Union.  There is certainly a need to respond,  a senior EU official said. Britain s decision last year to leave the EU served as a wake-up call for the bloc and made it reflect on the way forward, including putting more emphasis on social policies.  I think people believe there s been maybe an excessive focus in recent years on economic matters, banking, and we want to re-fire the engine of social Europe, advancing things like equality, workers rights, pension rights and other things,          Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said. Juncker and Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven will now produce a report that will allow leaders meeting again next month to see how the principles should be followed. Some eastern European countries are wary that the push for social rights could be used by some nations to undermine current rules that allow their citizens to work elsewhere in the EU at salaries lower than the local labor force. The proclaimed set of rights - known as the European Pillar of Social Rights - says everybody has the right to quality education throughout their lives and that men and women must have equal opportunities in all areas and be paid the same. The unemployed have the right to  personalized, continuous and consistent support , while workers have the right to  fair  wages that provide a  decent standard of living . Minimum wages should be ensured to satisfy the needs of  workers and their families, the leaders agreed. While the rights would not be directly enforceable by the EU, except where they already exist in national laws and therefore subject to national courts, they establish a common EU standard and language for discussion of social issues. Trade unions and business associations backed the set of European social rights, saying a particular effort was needed to boost the employment chances of young people.  We want Europe to continue to have the most highly developed social systems in the world,  the business and trade union organizations said in a joint statement. ",worldnews,"November 17, 2017 ",1

Hariri's Paris meeting to boost Lebanon stability: top aide,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon s Saad al-Hariri, who resigned as prime minister on Nov. 4, will see France s president on Saturday in Paris and the meeting will help resolve the Lebanese crisis and boost stability, a senior Hariri aide said. Hariri quit as prime minister in a broadcast from Saudi Arabia two weeks ago, saying he feared assassination and railing against Riyadh s foe Iran along with its Lebanese ally Hezbollah. Hariri, a Sunni Muslim leader and long-time Saudi ally, has yet to return to Beirut.  His decision to quit threw Lebanon into a political crisis. It also put the country center stage in the Middle East s overarching rivalry between Saudi Arabia and its allies and a bloc led by Iran.  Prime Minister Hariri has a meeting tomorrow at the Elysee with the French president, and Lebanon will have overcome this big obstacle,  said Lebanese Interior Minister Nohad Machnouk, a senior member of Hariri s political party on Friday.   The door will open to more stability and to the ability to face all the difficulties that we have gone through,  Machnouk said after meeting with Lebanese President Michel Aoun.  A Elysee Palace source has said Hariri would fly to Paris on Saturday and meet President Emmanuel Macron the same day. [nL8N1NM3WN] French officials said they did not know how long Hariri would stay before returning to Beirut but hoped his visit would help soothe the crisis by demonstrating he was not being held in Saudi Arabia. Aoun has refused to accept the resignation unless the premier returns to Lebanon, and has accused Riyadh of holding Hariri hostage. The president said this week on Twitter he hoped  the crisis is over  and the France visit would open the door to a solution. Top Lebanese government officials and senior politicians close to Hariri say he was forced to quit and was being held by Saudi. Politicians from all sides in Lebanon have called for his return to Beirut. Riyadh has denied forcing Hariri to resign or detaining him. In a TV interview on Sunday, his first public comments since quitting, Hariri said he is free to leave and would return home soon to formally submit his resignation. Hariri became Lebanon s prime minister last year in a power-sharing deal in which Aoun, a political ally of Hezbollah, became head of state. His coalition government includes Hezbollah, the heavily armed Shi ite Muslim militant group and political party. ",worldnews,"November 17, 2017 ",1

"U.S. envoy says no communication, no signal from North Korea amid nuclear crisis","SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea and the United States agreed on Friday to keep working for a peaceful end to the North Korean nuclear crisis, but a U.S. envoy said it was difficult to gauge the reclusive North s intentions as there has been  no signal . North Korea is under heavy international pressure to end its nuclear and missile programs, pursued in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions, but has vowed never to give up its nuclear arsenal which it says it needs to counter perceived U.S. aggression. Lee Do-hoon, South Korea s special representative for Korean  peace and security affairs, and his U.S. counterpart, Joseph Yun, met on the southern resort island of Jeju, following a summit between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and U.S. President Donald Trump in Seoul last week.  There is no doubt that both of the presidents want to find a peaceful way in regard to North Korea s nuclear issue,  Yun told reporters, according to Yonhap news agency.  So we discussed them and we agreed the pressure campaign has to be a central element.  Trump has said the time for talk is over but he took a softer tone on his trip to Seoul. North Korea s last missile test was on Sept. 15 but Lee and Yun did not seem to put much emphasis on the lull, Yonhap said, as they were unable to gauge its intentions.  I hope that they will stop forever. But we had no communication from them so I don t know whether to interpret it positively or not. We have no signal from them,  Yun said. Lee drew significance from the fact that China, the North s lone major ally, had sent a special envoy to Pyongyang, saying that South Korea was closely watching what would come out of the visit. The envoy arrived on Friday. Trump has traded insults and threats with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as North Korea races toward its much publicized goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the United States. The United States stations 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean war. It denies North Korea s persistent accusation that it is planning to invade.

"After ditching Taiwan, China says Panama will get the help it needs","BEIJING (Reuters) - China will provide Panama with whatever help it needs after the Central American country ditched long-standing ties with self-ruled Taiwan in June, a senior Chinese diplomat said on Friday after talks between the two countries  presidents. Panama s decision to end ties with Taiwan was a major victory for Beijing, as it lures away the dwindling number of countries that have formal relations with the island China claims as its own. Taiwan s government said at the time it was sorry and angry over the decision, and it would not compete with China in what it described as a  diplomatic money game . Speaking to reporters after Chinese President Xi Jinping and Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela signed 19 deals, including a feasibility study on a free trade agreement, Zhao Bentang, who heads the Chinese foreign ministry s Latin America department, said their ties were not based on money.  China and Panama establishing ties is a political decision made by both sides on the basis of political principles and looking at long term benefits. There were no economic or financial strings attached,  Zhao said.   If our Panamanian friends need, in the spirit of friendship and South-South cooperation the Chinese side is willing to assist Panama s economic and social development to the best of our capacity.  China and Taiwan have tried to poach each other s allies for years, often dangling generous aid packages in front of developing nations, though Taipei now struggles to compete with an increasingly powerful Beijing. Beijing says Taiwan has no right to diplomatic recognition because it is part of China. Defeated Nationalist forces fled to Taiwan at the end of China s civil war in 1949. Varela told Chinese state television in September the decision to switch recognition to China had nothing to do with  chequebook diplomacy . Xi said Varela had shown strategic vision and political courage in recognizing China and that China wanted to draw up a  fine blueprint  for the development of relations.   This sends an important message to the world, which is that a brand new page has been opened in China-Panama relations,  Xi told Varela in Beijing s Great Hall of the People.  The development of ties has been delayed for many years, but that history has passed,  Xi added. Last month, a group including China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd (CHEC) began building a $165 million port in Panama for cruise ships, the first project announced between China and Panama since they established diplomatic ties. China is deeply suspicious of Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, who it thinks wants to push for the island s formal independence, although she says she wants to maintain peace with Beijing.

Injured defector's parasites and diet hint at hard life in North Korea,"SEOUL (Reuters) - Parasitic worms found in a North Korean soldier, critically injured during a desperate defection, highlight nutrition and hygiene problems that experts say have plagued the isolated country for decades. At a briefing on Wednesday, lead surgeon Lee Cook-jong displayed photos showing dozens of flesh-colored parasites - including one 27 cm (10.6 in) long - removed from the wounded soldier s digestive tract during a series of surgeries to save his life.  In my over 20 year-long career as a surgeon, I have only seen something like this in a textbook,  Lee said. The parasites, along with kernels of corn in his stomach, may confirm what many experts and previous defectors have described about the food and hygiene situation for many North Koreans.     Although we do not have solid figures showing health conditions of North Korea, medical experts assume that parasite infection problems and serious health issues have been prevalent in the country,  said Choi Min-Ho, a professor at Seoul National University College of Medicine who specializes in parasites.  The soldier s condition was  not surprising at all considering the north s hygiene and parasite problems,  he said. The soldier was flown by helicopter to hospital on Monday after his dramatic escape to South Korea in a hail of bullets fired by North Korean soldiers.  He is believed to be an army staff sergeant in his mid-20s who was stationed in the Joint Security Area in the United Nations truce village of Panmunjom, according to Kim Byung-kee, a lawmaker of South Korea s ruling party, briefed by the National Intelligence Service.  North Korea has not commented on the defection. While the contents of the soldier s stomach don t necessarily reflect the population as a whole, his status as a soldier   with an elite assignment - would indicate he would at least be as well nourished as an average North Korean.   He was shot in his buttocks, armpit, back shoulder and knee among other wounds, according to the hospital where the soldier is being treated. Parasitic worms were also once common in South Korea 40 to 50 years ago, Lee noted during his briefing, but have all but disappeared as economic conditions greatly improved. Other doctors have also described removing various types of worms and parasites from North Korean defectors. Their continued prevalence north of the heavily fortified border that divides the two Koreas could be in part tied to the use of human excrement, often called  night soil.   Chemical fertilizer was supplied by the state until the 1970s, but from the early 1980s, production started to decrease,  said Lee Min-bok, a North Korean agriculture expert who defected to South Korea in 1995.  By the 1990s, the state could not supply it anymore, so farmers started to use a lot of night soil instead.  In 2014, supreme leader Kim Jong Un personally urged farmers to use human faeces, along with animal waste and organic compost, to fertilize their fields. A lack of livestock, however, made it difficult to find animal waste, said Lee, the agriculture expert. Even harder to overcome, he said, is the view of night soil as the  best fertilizer in North Korea,  despite the risk of worms and parasites.  Vegetables grown in it are considered more delicious than others,  Lee said. The medical briefing described the wounded soldier as being 170 cm (5 feet 5 inches) and 60 kg (132 pounds) with his stomach containing corn. It s a staple grain that more North Koreans may be relying on in the wake of what the United Nations has called the worst drought since 2001. Imported corn, which is less preferred but cheaper to obtain than rice, has tended to increase in years when North Koreans are more worried about their seasonal harvests. Between January and September this year, China exported nearly 49,000 tonnes of corn to North Korea, compared to only 3,125 tonnes in all of 2016, according to data released by Beijing.  Despite the drought and international sanctions over Pyongyang s nuclear program, the cost of corn and rice has remained relatively stable, according to a Reuters analysis of market data collected by the defector-run Daily NK website. Since the 1990s, when government rations failed to prevent a famine hitting the country, North Koreans have gradually turned to markets and other private means to feed themselves. The World Food Programme says a quarter of North Korean children 6-59 months old, who attend nurseries that the organization assists, suffer from chronic malnutrition. On average North Koreans are less nourished than their southern neighbors. The WFP says around one in four children have grown less tall than their South Korean counterparts. A study from 2009 said pre-school children in the North were up to 13 cm (5 inches) shorter and up to 7 kg (15 pounds) lighter than those brought up in the South.  The main issue in DPRK is a monotonous diet   mainly rice/maize, kimchi and bean paste   lacking in essential fats and protein,  the WFP told Reuters in a statement last month.

"Germany, France disagree with Russia on how to deploy peacekeepers in Ukraine: Gabriel","MINSK (Reuters) - There is a substantial difference between how Germany and France envisage the possible deployment of U.N. peacekeepers in eastern Ukraine and Russia s position, German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel told journalists on Friday. Both Kiev and Moscow have proposed U.N. peacekeepers be deployed to help resolve Ukraine s pro-Russian separatist conflict but the sides disagree on whether the troops should be positioned on the rebel-controlled part of the Ukraine-Russia border.  Germany, France, Russia and Ukraine have previously held talks in an effort to end the fighting that has killed more than 10,000 people despite a notional ceasefire.  Germany and France s idea and Russia s idea on how a blue helmets (peacekeeping) mission would be shaped are still very far apart,  Gabriel said during an official visit to Belarus. Nevertheless Gabriel said the deployment would represent a real chance for peace in the war-torn Donbass region.  Although our ideas are still far apart, it would be inadvisable to close this window of opportunity,  he said. ",worldnews,"November 17, 2017 ",1

Mob boss and mass murderer Riina dies of natural causes,"ROME (Reuters) - Salvatore  Toto  Riina, the Sicilian Mafia s most powerful boss of the 20th century who was convicted for ordering dozens of murders, died of natural causes early on Friday after almost a quarter of a century in jail. Riina, who turned 87 on Thursday, died in the prison ward of a hospital in Parma, the northern Italian city where he had been serving 26 life sentences for homicides committed between 1969 and 1992. His victims included the two magistrates who led the campaign to bring mob bosses to justice. He had fallen into a coma after complications during surgery a few days ago, and his family had been given permission to be by his side on Thursday, the Justice Ministry said. Nicknamed  the Beast ,  Riina began his violent criminal career on the streets of Corleone after World War Two and became the Sicilian Mafia s boss of bosses when it reached its 20th century apex. Riina oversaw a flourishing economic period for organized crime group Cosa Nostra, or  Our Thing , when it was trafficking heroin to the eastern United States and pulling the levers of political power in Palermo and Rome. But due to Riina s savagery, hundreds of mobsters broke their code of silence in the 1980s and 1990s and testified against him, allowing magistrates Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino to uncover the long-hidden secrets of Cosa Nostra and prosecute its leaders for the crimes of its soldiers. Riina s January 1993 arrest, after more than 20 years as a fugitive, came just months after Falcone and Borsellino were blown up on his orders, and coincided with the tumultuous downfall of Italy s corrupt post-war political system. Since then, Riina has been held under high security with little access to his family in accordance with a law written to prevent bosses from commanding from prison. However, he remained a powerful figure within the mob even behind bars and refused to cooperate with investigators until the end.  Matteo Messina Denaro, a Riina ally who has been a fugitive for 25 years, is the highest ranking boss still at large, but it is unlikely he will be able take power, John Dickie, a British historian and author of the book  Cosa Nostra , told Reuters.  Cosa Nostra is internally and politically divided in a way that makes it almost ungovernable, and this division dates back to Riina s campaign for power in the 80s,  Dickie said.  Riina s surviving foes within Cosa Nostra had close ties to North America, and they are the ones most likely to seek a shift in the crime syndicate s balance of power.   Because the Sicilian Mafia is struggling, it needs to renew its access to the United States, which has been crucial to the organization since the 1880s,  Dickie said. Given various nicknames over the years - Toto, Shorty, the Beast among them - Riina was 19 when he shot a man dead during a gang fight in Corleone and spent six years in prison, a rite of passage for a mafioso.   When he returned to Corleone, he and his childhood friend Bernardo Provenzano, who would lead Cosa Nostra after Riina s arrest, fell under the sway of Luciano Leggio. Leggio took over the Corleone mafia with Riina and Provenzano at his side by killing the town s wartime mafia boss, medical doctor Michele Navarra, in 1958. U.S. author Mario Puzo would later name the main character in  The Godfather  after the town.  In 1969, Riina and Provenzano led a hit squad against feared boss Michele  the Cobra  Cavataio, ambushing him inside an office in Palermo, killing the Cobra, another mafioso and two innocent bystanders. The so-called  Lazio Street Massacre  gave the Corleone clan a foothold in Sicily s capital and a post on Cosa Nostra s governing body, the  Commission , and the arrest of Leggio in 1974 made Riina the acting boss of the Corleone crime family. The 1981 murder of mob boss Stefano Bontate signaled the beginning of a two-year killing spree known as  The Slaughter , in which Riina sought to annihilate his many rivals. Fearing for their lives and for those of their families, hundreds of mobsters broke their code of silence, or omerta, and cooperated with investigators.  The turncoat testimony was a key component in Falcone and Borsellino s landmark case against Cosa Nostra, which in January 1992 ended by holding mob bosses responsible for crimes committed by their underlings.  Two months later, mafia assassins gunned down Salvo Lima,  Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti s right-hand man in Sicily, sending a clear message about what Riina thought of the court ruling and Rome s failure to stop it. In May of the same year, a massive bomb that blew apart a motorway near Palermo killed Falcone, his wife and three bodyguards. In July, Borsellino was blown up by another car bomb along with his five bodyguards. Riina was arrested in Palermo six months after Borsellino s murder, but he never broke his code of silence, leaving a shroud of mystery over suspected negotiations between Cosa Nostra and Rome said to have taken place after Falcone s assassination. The law-enforcement crackdown that followed the 1992 bombings severely hobbled Cosa Nostra, whose presence in Sicily is still felt, but whose economic and political might has faded.  Today, Calabria s  Ndrangheta is considered by investigators to be Italy s most powerful organized crime group thanks to its role as the biggest European importer of South American cocaine. The mafia tradition has been carried forward by Riina s two sons, Giovanni and Giuseppe, who remained loyal to their father. Giovanni has been sentenced to life in prison for four murders, and Giuseppe spent several years in jail on mafia charges, though he is now free. Riina is also survived by two daughters, Maria Concetta and Lucia, and his wife Antonietta. His funeral is likely to be a private ceremony in Corleone, police said. ",worldnews,"November 17, 2017 ",1

Erdogan says Turkey must clear Syria's Afrin of YPG militia,"ANKARA (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday that Turkey needed to clear the Afrin region of northwest Syria of Kurdish YPG militia fighters, who have been in the forefront of the battle there against Islamic State insurgents. Erdogan, speaking in Ankara to officials from the ruling AK Party, also expressed disappointment with the United States, which backs the YPG. Ankara views the YPG as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has fought a decades-long insurgency in Turkey and is designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and European Union.  We need to cleanse Afrin of the structure there called the YPG terrorist organization,  Erdogan said. Turkey has long been angered at the United States  support for the YPG and Erdogan has repeatedly accused Washington of violating the alliance between the two countries.  We are greatly disappointed by the United States not keeping its promises. Many issues that we could have resolved easily...were pushed to a dead-end,  he said. Turkey has expressed displeasure at the U.S. stance toward a deal between the YPG and Islamic State under which hundreds of militants withdrew from the Syrian city of Raqqa before it fell to the Syrian Democratic Forces. Erdogan has previously said that Afrin would be on Ankara s agenda after its current operation in Syria s Idlib province, where Turkey and Russia have set up observation points under a  de-escalation  deal agreed by Ankara, Moscow and Tehran to ease the bloodshed in the six-year-old Syrian conflict. Erdogan said considerable progress had been made in Turkey s military operation in Idlib due to the co-operation of the three powers. Russia and Iran back Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Turkey supports rebels opposing him, but all share a common foe in Islamic State. ",worldnews,"November 17, 2017 ",1

"Cambodia faces U.S., EU action after banning opposition","PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - The United States stopped election support for Cambodia with a promise of more  concrete steps  and the European Union threatened vital trade preferences after the main opposition party to Prime Minister Hun Sen was banned. But China said it supported Cambodia in following its own path, making no criticism of the government led by the former Khmer Rouge commander who is one of Beijing s most important allies in Southeast Asia after more than three decades in power. The ban on the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), decreed by the Supreme Court at the government s request, followed the arrest of its leader for treason. Kem Sokha is accused of plotting to take power with American help. Hun Sen s critics called the CNRP dissolution an attempt to steal the election and the death knell for democracy. Western donors have spent billions of dollars since 1993 trying to build a multiparty system following decades of war.  On current course, next year s election will not be legitimate, free or fair,  a White House statement said, promising to take  concrete steps . The first of those was to end support for the Cambodian National Election Committee ahead of the 2018 election, it said. In April, the U.S. embassy announced a $1.8 million grant to assist local elections in 2017 and next year s general election. In Brussels, an EU spokesman said the election could not be legitimate without the opposition and noted that respect for human rights was a prerequisite for Cambodia s access to EU trade preferences under its  Everything But Arms scheme.  That scheme, giving tariff-free access, and similar trade preferences in the United States have helped Cambodia build a garment industry on low-cost labor. Between them, EU and U.S. markets take some 60 percent of Cambodia s exports.  I am very worried after the dissolution of the party,  factory sewer Heng Kheang, 35, said as other colleagues nodded in agreement at their lunch break.  Workers will be most affected, more than the rich.   In a symbolic step, the U.S. Senate passed a resolution calling on the Treasury and State departments to consider placing Cambodian officials implicated in abuses on a watch list for asset freezes and travel bans. Huy Vannak, undersecretary of state at Cambodia s Interior Ministry who is close to Hun Sen, said the U.S. position was  made without consideration to the evidence and court hearing .  We hope that the U.S. will consider the overall bilateral relations with Cambodia and continue to collaborate with common interests of both countries,  he said. In Beijing, foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a news briefing that China supported Cambodia in pursuing its own development path. China is by far the biggest single donor to Cambodia and its biggest investor. Hun Sen has been in a deepening war of words with the U.S. embassy and State Department over a crackdown on his critics, but at the weekend posed with U.S. President Donald Trump at a regional summit and praised his policies of non-interference. The fact that the threat of action came from the White House gave it greater weight than previous statements from the State Department calling for the release of Kem Sokha. So far, Western countries have shown little appetite for sanctions and the opposition itself has shied away from calling for steps to restrict garment exports because of the hundreds of thousands of workers who depend on them. But leaders of the CNRP now say they support some sanctions.  Sanctions are the best leverage for negotiation for free, fair and inclusive elections,  said Mu Sochua, a deputy to CNRP leader Kem Sokha, who fled Cambodia fearing arrest. There have been no protests over the opposition party ban and many people in the capital, Phnom Penh, said they were afraid to speak out. There were no party members at the CNRP headquarters on Friday, only security guards.  They are worried about their safety,  said guard Chin Savy. The central market was full of its usual bustle and one man told Reuters he was glad to see the back of the opposition.  Hun Sen has a lot of help from China. If he just depended on the U.S., we wouldn t be anywhere,  said Khen Kong, 69, a businessman. In a televised address on Thursday, Hun Sen told Cambodians the election would go ahead  as normal  and appealed to politicians from the CNRP who had not been banned to join his Cambodian People s Party. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra ad Al Hussein expressed grave concern about the conduct of credible elections next year as well as a clampdown on civil rights groups and independent media.

Mladic still a hero in dying home village in Bosnia,"BOZANOVICI, Bosnia (Reuters) - The sign nailed to a tree marking one of the few paved roads bears the name of the village s favorite son:  General Mladic Street . In a garage that serves as the makeshift tavern, his portrait looks down on the men who spend the day sharing a bottle of brandy. Ratko Mladic, the former Bosnian Serb military commander who will hear his verdict on charges of war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity next week in the Hague, is one of the highest profile war crimes suspects in Europe since Nuremberg. In the international court where his trial began more than five years ago, he is accused of ordering the killing of 8,000 unarmed Muslim men and boys after the capture of the town of Srebrenica, and raining artillery on civilians during the siege of the Bosnian capital Sarajevo. But here in his home village, where barely two dozen people   mostly his blood relatives   still remain in the hardscrabble countryside of the Bosnian hills, Mladic is, as the slogan on his portrait above the drinkers declares,  a hero .  He did not do such things. Others did it. The general is a colossus, a great and good man,  said Zoran Mladic, one of several villagers who identify themselves as cousins of the ex-general. Mladic, who was captured in 2011 after a decade and a half on the run, is still revered in the Serb sector of Bosnia as a hero and defender of the nation during the 1992-1995 war that killed more than 100,000 people. In his native village of crumbling cabins scattered across the slopes, every home has his portrait. Villagers pay him the ultimate compliment: he was a good worker, who often came back to visit, and a useful hand bringing in the harvest as a reaper in the fields.  He did not kill people. During the war he gathered our Muslim neighbors from a nearby village and warned them in time to leave,  said Dusko Mladic, another cousin, sitting in the tavern, who said he was a childhood playmate of the general.  I still often go to that village, work with Muslims and don t have any problems,  he said. The villagers are mainly farmers who keep cattle and sell produce in Sarajevo, which Mladic s forces kept under a 43-month siege, bombing its citizens daily and depriving them of water, power and food.  Today, as in much of the countryside, the younger generation has largely abandoned the village to go to Sarajevo in search of jobs. Those left behind barely survive on small pensions and the sale of milk and meat, disappointed at the lack of support by the Bosnian Serb authorities. They fear Mladic will be convicted and remembered as a war criminal.  I would be happiest if he died before the judgment,  said another cousin, Mile Mladic. That was the fate of Slobodan Milosevic, the former leader of Serbia, who died four years into his own genocide trial, ending it without a verdict.  We would then raise a large monument for him in the village and write the truth. All this that is happening is not the truth. It is a lie. The general is not guilty.

"Shelling, air strikes as Philippine troops hunt militants in marshland","MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine troops shelled positions held by a small group of pro-Islamic State militants in southern marshland on Friday, as the military pushed on with a new offensive after the country s biggest urban battle in decades. The army estimated 2,000 villagers had been displaced by several days of operations in a region straddling two provinces on the island of Mindanao, as the army went after the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF), a small and splintered rebel group inspired by Islamic State. The latest operation follows the end last month of what was the Philippines  biggest battle since World War Two, in which troops took five months to crush an alliance of Islamic State loyalists including BIFF fighters in Marawi City. The occupation of the city by the militants and their dogged resistance spread alarm in the region about the rise of extremism and radical aspirations to create an Islamic State  caliphate. Captain Nap Alcarioto, spokesman for the 6th Infantry Division, said troops were shelling BIFF gunmen in support of ground attacks in an area of marshland between the provinces of Maguindanao and Cotobato, about 170 km (106 miles) from Marawi.  We are still awaiting results of operations,  he said. The army said it was fighting a BIFF faction led by Abu Toraypie, a man allied with the Maute group, the biggest militant group in an alliance that led the Marawi conflict. Toraypie and some of his men had escaped from Marawi and the army was trying to prevent them from regrouping, the army said. Military aircraft dropped bombs on another BIFF wing in a town close by. The BIFF broke away  from the separatist Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) a decade ago after becoming disillusioned with a protracted process with the government to grant autonomy to what is the mainly Catholic country s only predominantly Muslim region.  Separately, army spokesman Major-General Restituto Padilla said Marawi was clear of militants who had been hiding in the ruins of the pummeled city, but unexploded munitions and booby traps had yet to be cleared.  The last firefight we had was on November 5 when we killed nine terrorists,  he told a news conference, adding all top militant leaders had been killed, although that was subject to DNA confirmation.

Bulgaria's parliament speaker resigns 'to avoid political upheaval',"SOFIA (Reuters) - Bulgaria s parliament speaker Dimitar Glavchev resigned on Friday in a move he said was to avoid political upheaval as the country prepares to take over the six-month rotating European Union presidency in January. The opposition Socialists had demanded Glavchev s resignation and said they would boycott parliament sessions until he stepped down after he banned their leader, Kornelia Ninova, from the chamber over what he called offences to deputies and members of the government on Wednesday. Glavchev, who described his resignation as  a moral act , said it was his intention to restore calm in the parliament and not cast a shadow over Bulgaria s EU presidency.  I have always said that the state and its stability are more important than anything,  said Prime Minister Boyko Borissov. Parliament voted to appoint Tsveta Karayancheva, a senior member of the ruling center-right GERB party, to replace Glavchev.   Glavchev made a mistake, but his resignation is just a preventative measure and it will not lead to a parliamentary crisis or the fall of the government,  Daniel Smilov, an analyst with Bulgaria s Centre for Liberal Strategies, told Reuters.  GERB is trying not to complicate the situation.  The center-right GERB, led by Borissov, returned to power for a third term since 2009 after a snap election in March. His coalition government has a one-seat majority but is also supported by a small populist party. ",worldnews,"November 17, 2017 ",1
Pope denounces healthcare inequality in rich countries,"VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis condemned on Thursday inequality in healthcare, particularly in rich countries, saying governments had a duty to ensure the common good for all its citizens.  Increasingly sophisticated and costly treatments are available to ever more limited and privileged segments of the population,  Francis said in an address to a conference of European members of the World Medical Association.  This raises questions about the sustainability of healthcare delivery and about what might be called a systemic tendency toward growing inequality in healthcare,  he said. The tendency was clearly apparent when you compared healthcare cover between countries and continents, the pope said, adding that it was also visible within more wealthy countries,  where access to healthcare risks being more dependent on individuals  economic resources than on their actual need for treatment.  Francis did not mention any countries. Healthcare is a big issue in the United States, where President Donald Trump has vowed to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, introduced by his predecessor, Barack Obama, which aimed to make it easier for lower-income households to get health insurance. He said healthcare legislation needed a  broad vision and a comprehensive view of what most effectively promotes the common good in each concrete situation.  In speaking of end-of-life issues, Francis re-affirmed the Catholic Church s long-standing teaching that it is morally acceptable for a patient or a family to suspend or reject  disproportionate measures  to keep a terminally ill person alive. But he stressed that this was  different from euthanasia, which is always wrong, in that the intent of euthanasia is to end life and cause death . Regarding end-of-life decisions, the pope said governments had a duty  to protect all those involved, defending the fundamental equality whereby everyone is recognized under law as a human being living with others in society .

North Korea petitions Russia to let workers stay despite sanctions: Ifax,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - North Korea has petitioned the Russian parliament to help 3,500 migrant workers from the isolated Asian country stay in Russia despite new U.N. sanctions, the Interfax news agency reported on Friday, citing a Russian lawmaker. Tougher sanctions on North Korea, imposed by the United Nations Security Council over Pyongyang s ballistic missile and nuclear programs on Sept. 11, banned countries from providing new work permits for North Korean nationals, but allowed existing workers to remain. Most of the around 30,000-40,000 North Korean migrants legally working in Russia were hired before the new sanctions entered into force and the ban will not affect them, Interfax said, quoting an earlier statement from Maxim Topilin, Russia s labor minister.  But the ban could apply to 3,500 workers who only signed their contracts in September, the month when the U.N. Security Council, including Russia, voted for the new sanctions, Interfax reported. It cited Kazbek Taysayev, a lawmaker in the lower house of parliament and a member of a  friendship group  between the Russian and North Korean parliaments, as saying:  North Korea s embassy officially addressed us. We supported them and sent our petitions in order to let these people stay so that they can work.  Even if the workers signed their contracts after the ban took effect, they had started making arrangements and preparing the documents earlier and could be allowed to stay, said Taysayev.  The U.N. resolution said it did not apply to work permits  for which written contracts have been finalized prior to the adoption of this resolution.  North Korea s embassy in Moscow was not available for immediate comment. ",worldnews,"November 17, 2017 ",1
"Suspected of graft, Indonesian parliament speaker under guard in hospital","JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian anti-graft investigators have put the speaker of parliament, who they have identified as a suspect in a $170 million corruption case, under armed guard in hospital after he was involved in a car accident, his lawyer said on Friday. Officers from the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) tried to arrest Setya Novanto, the chairman of Golkar, Indonesia s second-largest party and partner in the ruling coalition, at his house in Jakarta late on Wednesday. But the investigators, watched by television cameras, failed to find him, sparking speculation that he had gone into hiding. The KPK is investigating state losses amounting to about $170 million linked to a national electronic identity card scheme after allegations that sums ranging from $5,000 to $5.5 million - generated by marking up procurement costs - were divided up among politicians in parliament. Novanto was named a suspect in the case again last week after he had used a controversial legal maneuver, a pre-trial motion, to get earlier charges dropped last month. He has denied wrongdoing but has repeatedly missed summonses from the KPK for questioning in recent months, saying he was ill and needed to undergo heart surgery. Late on Thursday, reports emerged that Novanto was involved in a car accident while on his way to turn himself in at KPK headquarters. Novanto s lawyer, Fredrich Yunadi, said a journalist was driving the vehicle and interviewing his client at the time of the accident.  (The driver) was looking back and looking to the side, so he wasn t concentrating on what was in front of him,  Yunadi  said. Novanto was now  very ill  with head and hand injuries, Yunadi said.  He can t even get up yet. He can t talk yet, it s just his eyes   when he opens his eyes the ceiling swirls in circles.  The lawyer said armed KPK officers were guarding Novanto and had ignored requests to leave.   Novanto was taken to a second hospital on Friday for a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, media reported. Novanto gained a measure of international fame in September 2015 when then U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump hailed the Indonesian politician as a  great man  during a news conference.   Do they like me in Indonesia?  Trump asked after introducing Novanto to reporters at Trump Tower.   Yes, highly,  Novanto replied. Indonesian newspapers splashed pictures across their front pages of a black sport utility vehicle that Novanto was said to have been traveling in.  It was resting against an electricity pole, and appeared to have suffered only minor damage to the front fender. Febri Diansyah, a KPK spokesman, said on Thursday the crash happened shortly after the agency had asked the national police chief and Interpol to place Novanto on a wanted list.   The KPK would liaise with doctors to see if Novanto was  fit to stand trial  and would continue its investigation, Febri told Inews TV. Yunadi has said a request for another pre-trial motion had been filed on behalf of his client.  President Joko Widodo on Friday urged Novanto, a political ally, to  follow the legal process . Previously, Widodo has backed the KPK against efforts by some members of parliament to weaken the independent agency s powers.  Vice President Jusuf Kalla, who is also a Golkar member, told reporters on Thursday Novanto should be ready to face any legal process if called upon. Indonesians widely perceive parliament as one of their country s most corrupt institutions, Transparency International says. ",worldnews,"November 17, 2017 ",1

Turkey hunts 42 university staff in post-coup crackdown: source,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish police have launched operations to track down 42 university staff from Istanbul s Marmara University who are alleged to have links to last year s failed coup attempt, a police source said on Friday. So far 22 people have been detained in the operation, the police source said, adding the suspects were believed to be in contact with the network of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Ankara accuses of orchestrating the abortive putsch in July 2016. Gulen has denied involvement and denounced in the coup. Since the failed coup, authorities have arrested around 50,000 people pending trial and some 150,000 people, including teachers, judges and soldiers, have been sacked or suspended from their jobs. The crackdown has alarmed rights groups and some of Turkey s Western allies, who fear the government is using the coup as a pretext to quash dissent. The government says the crackdown is necessary given the severity of the security threat. More than 240 people were killed in last year s coup attempt. ",worldnews,"November 17, 2017 ",1

"Trump discussed free trade pact with Japan's Abe, U.S. envoy says","TOKYO (Reuters) - President Donald Trump discussed a possible free trade agreement (FTA) with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during his trip to Tokyo, the U.S. ambassador to Japan said on Friday, contradicting Japanese officials who had said such talks never took place. Japan has so far shown little interest in pursuing an FTA with the United States, preferring instead to push for a modified version of the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) after Trump pulled his country from the pact. On Nov. 6, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasutoshi Nishimura told reporters Trump had not mentioned an FTA when he met Abe for talks on relations between the two countries. At a news conference in the Japanese capital on Friday, however, the U.S. envoy, William Hagerty, said,  They discussed a full range of trade options including an FTA.  Washington may push Tokyo for an FTA to help reduce what it sees as an unfair trading deficit with Japan, Hagerty added.  An FTA is one of the tools we may need to address that,  he said. Trump returned to Washington this week after his first official visit to Asia, a 12-day tour that started with a two-night stay in Japan.  ",worldnews,"November 17, 2017 ",1
Bones of contention: Australia returns ancient Aboriginal remains for outback burial,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - The 40,000-year-old remains of an Aboriginal man that prompted a drastic rewrite of Australian history were returned to his ancestral homeland on Friday after four decades of examination in the country s capital. The discovery of  Mungo Man  in 1974, named after the dry outback lakebed where the fully intact skeleton was found, doubled the known length of humans  presence on the continent from 20,000 to 40,000 years. But the bones  removal to Canberra for study, roughly 600 km (370 miles) east of Lake Mungo, had angered the indigenous community there.  We ve been waiting all those years to get him back and I m so glad he is back, to put him in his resting place,  said Joan Slade, an elder of the Aboriginal Ngiyampaa people at a ceremony welcoming the remains back to her ancestral country. The skeleton, along with 104 other remains, arrived in a black hearse with the black, yellow and red Aboriginal flag painted on its side. A traditional smoking ceremony, with green gum-leaves burned over a small fire, welcomed the remains back to the red soil and saltbush scrub of Lake Mungo.      This, today, is one of those catalytic moments...it makes us, the traditional owners, custodians of our culture,  said elder Michael Young.  They will be kept in a secret, safe place so that we can pass on to the next generations the legacy that these people have given us.       Though subsequent discoveries have pushed back even further the date of humans  first arrival in Australia, the finding of Mungo Man was at the time a huge advance for understanding human history.     His burial, with limbs stretched out, hands crossed across his groin and covered in an ochre drawn from some 200 km away, helped prove the ancient age of Aboriginal civilization - the world s oldest continuing culture - dating back around the time Neanderthals occupied Europe. The Australian National University, whose researchers removed the remains, issued a formal apology when it turned the remains over to the region s Aboriginal custodians in 2015.  We recognise that the removal of these ancestral remains caused ongoing grief to your communities and we apologise unreservedly,  it said.   While the research undertaken...contributed significantly to the understanding of the history of indigenous Australians, our research in the past has not always been undertaken with your full knowledge and support.

"China, Russia to hold simulated anti-missile drill","BEIJING (Reuters) - The Chinese and Russian militaries will next month hold anti-missile drills in Beijing, China s Defence Ministry said on Friday, amid concern in both countries about the deployment of a U.S. anti-missile system in South Korea. China and Russia have both expressed opposition to the basing of the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) system in South Korea, which Seoul and Washington say is needed to defend against the threat of North Korean missiles. China, along with Russia, has repeatedly expressed opposition to the THAAD deployment, saying it will do nothing to help ease tension with North Korea. China also fears THAAD s powerful radar system can look deep into is territory, undermining its security.  China s Defence Ministry said in a statement a computer drill would take place from Dec. 11 to Dec. 16. The aim of the exercise was to jointly practice defense against missiles and how to handle  sudden and provocative attacks on the two countries  territories by ballistic missiles and cruise missiles , the ministry said.  The drill is not aimed at any third party,  it said, without elaborating. While China and South Korea agreed last month to move beyond their year-long stand-off over THAAD, a dispute that has been devastating to South Korean businesses that rely on Chinese consumers, China has stuck to its opposition to the system. China and Russia have close military and diplomatic ties, and they have repeatedly called for a peaceful, negotiated solution to the North Korea nuclear and missile crisis.

"Amnesty urges independent probe into atrocities, bombings in battle for Philippines Marawi city","MANILA (Reuters) - The war in the Philippine city of Marawi saw Islamist insurgents execute civilians or use them as human shields, while military air strikes killed non-combatants and may have been used in excess, an Amnesty International report said on Friday. The investigation by the rights group on the bloody five-month battle was based on interviews with 48 witnesses from September until early November and called for an independent inquiry. The conflict in Marawi, the only predominantly Muslim city in the mainly Catholic Philippines, was the country s biggest and longest battle since World War Two. More than 1,100 people, mostly insurgents, were killed, including 166 soldiers and 47 civilians, according to the authorities. At least 350,000 people were displaced and large parts of Marawi have been decimated by air strikes.  Witnesses described at least 10 separate incidents where at least 25 people were executed by the Muslim extremists because they were Christians. Amnesty described those as war crimes.  It also said 10 hostages may have been killed in a single bombing run by the armed forces, and said an independent inquiry should include an assessment as to whether the air strikes were proportionate to the threat.   They must initiate a prompt, effective and impartial investigation into whether its bombings of civilian neighborhoods was proportional under international humanitarian law,  Tirana Hassan, Amnesty International s crisis response director, said in a statement.  The Philippine authorities must bring those responsible for torture and other violations to justice and ensure that the victims receive adequate reparations.  Major-General Restituto Padilla, armed forces spokesman, said the military was aware of the report and would respond in full later. He said troops were given strict instructions to observe and respect international humanitarian law and human rights.  We will not tolerate and condone these abuses and will act on them,  he told a regular news briefing on Friday. The 34-page report,  The Battle of Marawi: Death and destruction in the Philippines , quotes a survivor who said he was spared by rebels because he could recite the  shahada , a statement of Islamic faith, but a Christian ambulance driver was shot dead because he could not do the same.  Other survivors said hostages were executed or physically abused, forced into labor and used as human shields.  Some hostages who escaped alleged they were detained and tortured by security forces who suspected them to be militants. Amnesty said it talked to eight men, including seven Christians, who said they were badly treated by the authorities.  I was punched and kicked. They tied our hands and feet with electrical wire,  the report quoted one survivor as saying.  The military was angry because 13 of their men were killed.  Last month, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis praised the Philippine military for ending the war without a single credible human rights abuse allegation. Amnesty noted that the military was responding to concerns about looting by soldiers but  must follow through on promises of compensation . ",worldnews,"November 17, 2017 ",1
Germany to spend 10 million euros to help clear mines in Syria: media,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany will spend an initial 10 million euros to help remove mines from the northern Syrian city of Raqqa, the Handelsblatt newspaper said in Friday editions. The foreign ministry is set to announce the increased funding as part of a pact with the United States on Friday, the paper added. The agreement calls for Germany to help fund Tetra Tech , a U.S. government contractor working to clear mines from Raqqa, where U.S.-backed militias last month declared victory over the Islamic State extremist group. The U.S. military continues to press Germany for additional aid in Syria, but Germany is waiting for measures on how to stabilize Syria, the newspaper said. Norbert Roettgen, a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives, told the paper that financial aid for rebuilding must be  combined with a reliable solution and political stability for Syria . The paper said the German contribution to the effort to de-mine Raqqa could be stepped up if the situation stabilized. ",worldnews,"November 17, 2017 ",1

NZ rules out resettlement of Manus refugees without Australia's support,"WELLINGTON/SYDNEY (Reuters) - New Zealand will not resettle refugees occupying a shuttered Australian-run detention in Papua New Guinea without Australia s agreement, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Friday, rejecting a suggestion to deal with PNG directly. More than 400 asylum seekers have shut themselves inside the Australian-run Manus Island Centre for the past 17 days, defying attempts by Australia and Papua New Guinea (PNG) to close the camp in a standoff the United Nations describes as a  looming humanitarian crisis .      Australia has rejected New Zealand s offer to take in some of the men, but on Thursday New Zealand Immigration Minister Peter Dutton suggested it could approach PNG directly to arrange it.  But Ardern ruled that option out.  It s clearly up to Australia to take up that offer,  she said in a statement.  Australia holds all the critical information on the refugees in Manus Island so any take-up of refugees has to be organized with Australia s assistance,  she said.     The U.N. refugee agency this week urged Australia to accept New Zealand s offer. But Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said on Friday the priority was an existing refugee swap deal he negotiated with former U.S. President Barack Obama last year and that an agreement with New Zealand was  no near-term prospect at all .     Australia s  sovereign borders  immigration policy, under which it refuses to allow asylum seekers arriving by boat to reach its shores, has been heavily criticized by the United Nations and human rights groups but has bipartisan political support in Australia. The asylum seekers on Manus island have been holed up inside the camp without power or running water since it closed on Oct. 31, saying they fear violent reprisals from the community if they move to transit centers, pending possible resettlement to the United States.  Food and medical supplies for the 421 men were running low and they were reliant on three small wells and rain water for drinking, according to people inside the camp.  Today the refugees are watching clouds to collect some rain,  Behrouz Boochani, a Kurdish journalist from Iran who has been detained on Manus island for more than four years told Reuters via text. Papua New Guinea has threatened to forcibly move the men though three deadlines have passed largely without incident. The Papua New Guinea government could not immediately be reached for comment.

Mexican women testify over sexual torture before international panel,"SAN JOSE (Reuters) - Women who were sexually tortured by Mexican security forces over a decade ago testified Thursday before the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, asking for an investigation into the case that happened in the state once run by President Enrique Pena Nieto. Several of the 11 victims told judges at the Costa-Rica based court about the abuse they suffered after they were detained following a protest in May 2006 at the town of San Salvador de Atenco, about 25 miles (40 km) northeast of Mexico City. The town is located in the State of Mexico, which rings the capital.   We ve come here to speak out. In Mexico, justice has not been done,  said Maria Cristina Sanchez, 50, who detailed how she was beaten, sexually abused and how the case languished in Mexico s criminal justice system with no resolution for years. The women, known as the  Women of Atenco , say they were thrown into a police bus, raped and tortured following a two-day protest by a group of flower sellers who had negotiated a labor agreement that allowed them to set up stalls in a nearby downtown area. The women were initially accused of illegally blocking public access, but later acquitted of the charges. Before being elected president in 2012, Pena Nieto was governor of the State of Mexico, heading the country s most populous state from in late 2005 till 2011.  The Mexican government reiterates the recognition of its international responsibility... and its sincere will to fully repair the human rights violations in this case,  said Uriel Salas, an attorney representing Mexico in the case. In the years since the abuses were committed, some police were accused of crimes, but there have been no convictions.  We deserve the recognition that we re telling the truth, that the chain of command be investigated, not only so that justice is done, but so that these events never happen again,  said Norma Jimenez, 33, at the end of her testimony. The court is expected to continue hearing testimony through Friday, while a final ruling in the case could take months. ",worldnews,"November 17, 2017 ",1
Myanmar military trucks hit landmines in troubled Rakhine; one injured,"YANGON (Reuters) - One person was injured when military trucks hit landmines in Myanmar s troubled Rakhine State this week, state media said on Friday, amid ethnic tension following an army crackdown that sent hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims fleeing. More than 600,000 of the refugees have entered neighboring Bangladesh since Aug. 25 attacks by Rohingya militants sparked the army operation. Killings, arson and rape carried out by troops and ethnic Rakhine Buddhist mobs since then amount to ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya, the United Nations says. Three landmine blasts caused extensive damage to three military trucks in Rakhine s central Minbya township on Wednesday morning, the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper said. The landmines were  apparently targeting  army convoys, it added.  Later that day, another landmine exploded near the village of Vethali in central Rakhine as seven military trucks passed, injuring one pedestrian but causing no damage to the vehicles, the paper said.  It was not clear who was responsible for the attacks. Several landmine explosions were reported near the area this year.  United Nations staff and aid workers have said they fear violence in northern Rakhine could spread to new areas as  Buddhist villagers in more peaceful areas enforce a system of local apartheid that punishes people trading with minority Muslims. Many in Buddhist-majority Myanmar see Rohingya Muslims as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, although many of the Rohingya can trace family for generations. After the August attacks on police posts by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), which the government has declared a terrorist organization, security forces unleashed a brutal counteroffensive in Muslim-majority northern Rakhine. Even though Myanmar says military operations ceased on Sept. 5, hundreds of refugees have continued to cross the Naf river separating Rakhine and Bangladesh in recent weeks. Separately, Myanmar security forces have arrested 19 men suspected of involvement in the August attacks and charged them under the anti-terrorism law, the newspaper said on Friday.

Glowing profile cracks door open on private life of China's Xi,"BEIJING (Reuters) - A workaholic keen swimmer with an extensive knowledge of foreign literature   China s state news agency Xinhua on Friday cracked open the door to President Xi Jinping s private life in an unusual and glowing profile. The private lives of senior Chinese leaders have traditionally been shrouded in secrecy, and tell-all books with juicy gossip strictly off limits. But since Xi took power five years ago the government has on occasion released personal details, as it seems both to burnish his image as an approachable man of the people who will lead China to greatness, and control the narrative about who he is. Xi emerged from a twice-a-decade Communist Party Congress last month with his power ever further cemented and key allies appointed to top new positions. In a lengthy story published in Chinese and English in the early hours of Friday, Xinhua hailed Xi as the  unrivalled helmsman , a term more frequently used to refer to the founder of modern China Mao Zedong rather than any other leaders.  Wherever he works, he makes a remarkable impact,  Xinhua said. While some of the anecdotes have previously been reported by state media - like his 2014 stroll around old Beijing alleyways during one of the city s periodic smog crises - others were new. Xi personally reviews every draft of major policy documents, sentence by sentence, Xinhua said.  Sources close to him told Xinhua that all reports submitted to him, no matter how late in the evening, were returned with instructions the following morning.  But he also  takes time out of his busy schedule to swim over 1,000 meters a time , it added, without saying how often he manages to fit this in. Xi can reel off the names of foreign, especially Russian, writers, and his  extensive knowledge of literature and the arts makes him a consummate communicator in the international arena .  Xi treats everyone with sincerity, warmth, attentiveness, and forthrightness,  it said. However, underscoring China s sensitivities about more difficult parts of its recent past, the Chinese version of the profile skipped a description of the suffering inflicted on Xi s father Xi Zhongxun during the chaos of the Cultural Revolution, when Mao declared class war.  In 1962, Xi Zhongxun s 16 years of suffering from political persecution began. However, he never gave in to adversity and ultimately helped clear the names of others who were persecuted,  Xinhua said in its English profile.   When his father was wronged, Xi Jinping went through some tough times,  it added, without elaborating. Public discussion of the Cultural Revolution is generally taboo in China.

Japan health ministry to water down proposal on restaurant smoking: media,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan s health ministry is likely to drastically water down a proposal restricting smoking in restaurants, media said on Friday, a move that risks Tokyo becoming one of the unhealthiest hosts of the Olympic Games hosts in years. Japan ranks at the bottom globally in anti-smoking measures, going by the types of public spaces entirely free of smoke, says the World Health Organization, which has teamed up with global Olympics officials to guarantee smoke-free Games venues. Ahead of the 2020 summer Olympics, the International Olympics Committee (IOC) is among those pressuring the Japanese capital to follow Rio de Janeiro and other recent games hosts in banning smoking in all public areas. IOC Vice President John Coats has said the body cannot force a ban beyond the venues and the Olympic Village, however.  The Health Ministry was forced this year to scale back a proposed bill for a blanket ban on public smoking in the face of opposition by pro-smoking politicians, restaurateurs and Japan Tobacco, which is one-third government owned. But even the weaker bill foundered, due to opposition from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). In August, anti-smoking Health Minister Yasuhisa Shiozaki lost his job in a cabinet reshuffle. Now the ministry contemplates allowing smoking indoors at establishments that have a floor area of up to five times the 30 square meters (323 square feet) and adequate ventilation stipulated in the earlier bill, media said. However, a health ministry official told Reuters the new proposal was still in such an early stage of discussion that none of its content had yet been decided. Fifty years ago, around half of Japanese smoked, a figure that has shrunk to less than a fifth now. Smoking areas have been dramatically restricted, but laws vary among cities. There is still a cigarette vending machine in a Health Ministry annex. Health officials say 15,000 Japanese die every year from second-hand smoke. The new proposal is  terrible,  says anti-smoking activist Manabu Sakuta, since nearly 90 percent of food and beverage establishments in Tokyo are smaller than 150 square meters (180 sq yards). But he is pinning his hopes on Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike, who vowed in July to push for a smoking ban before the Olympics.  There s some possibility here, so we ll have to focus on that,  he said.

German coalition talks flounder as disagreements persist,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel s efforts to forge a three-way ruling coalition dragged into the wee hours of Friday, with some participants warning that differences on climate, migration and finances could still cause the talks to collapse. The conservative leader had set Thursday as a deadline for exploratory talks about forming a coalition with the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the environmentalist Greens - a combination untested at the national level that would allow her to govern for a fourth term as German chancellor. Merkel, 63, had told reporters on Thursday that serious differences remained and the talks could take many hours. Participants girded for a marathon session, or what German media have called the  night of the long knives.  The mood soured noticeably late on Thursday, with parties breaking off to huddle in their respective caucuses before senior negotiators resumed tough discussions on migration. Senior FDP official Alexander Lambsdorff described  serious faces  in a post on Twitter, while FDP deputy leader Wolfgang Kubicki suggested an extension of the talks might be needed. Conservative participants conceded the talks were not going well. The Greens and the Bavarian wing of the conservatives, the Christian Social Union (CSU), even accused each other of blocking an agreement.   Juergen Trittin, a Greens negotiator, used Twitter to illustrate his view of the state of the talks: a clip of reggae star Jimmy Cliff singing,  The harder they come, the harder they fall - one and all.  Failure to clinch a deal could lead to new elections - a scenario none of the negotiating parties wants, for fear the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) could make further gains after surging into parliament in the Sept. 24 national vote. Such an outcome would be seen as a so-called black swan event that could weigh heavily on the euro. Merkel tried to break the logjam, at least on climate protection, by offering to reduce coal power generating capacity by 7 gigawatts (GW), sources familiar with the talks said. That is still shy of the 10 GW cut demanded by the Greens, but above an earlier offer of 5 GW. The chancellor is under pressure from her own conservative bloc, particularly the CSU, not to compromise too much to secure a coalition deal, especially on migrants.  The CSU fears losing further ground in a 2018 state election. At stake is a conservative plan to cap the number of people Germany will accept per year on humanitarian grounds at 200,000, a limit the environmental Greens reject.  I don t know if we can resolve all the discrepancies, all the disagreements,  said Joachim Herrmann, a senior member of the CSU, sister party of Merkel s Christian Democrats (CDU). FDP Secretary General Nicola Beer, in a Twitter posting, urged all sides to remain open to compromise:  Don t ask your counterpart for something he can t give. Otherwise you ll get nothing in the end.  Merkel is a skilled negotiator, renowned at European Union summits for building pressure on her negotiating partners and playing on their fatigue. She must leverage all these skills to secure the three-way  Jamaica  coalition, called that because the parties  colors match those of the Caribbean island country s flag.  A failure of Jamaica would be her failure,  wrote the mass-circulation daily Bild. Merkel s partners in Germany s previous  grand coalition  were the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), who have vowed to return to opposition after suffering their worst election result since 1933 in September s national vote. Alice Weidel, co-leader of the far-right AfD, criticized the would-be coalition partners for failing to reach a deal, telling daily Die Welt:  If the (conservative) Union, FDP and Greens don t reach an agreement soon, there should be new elections.  If negotiators agree to a deal after Thursday s talks, it must still pass muster with lower-ranking party officials. A key test would be a Greens conference on Nov. 25, when the party s rank and file would examine any coalition pact. ",worldnews,"November 16, 2017 ",1

German coalition talks delayed until Friday: sources,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Talks about forming a new three-way German ruling coalition have been delayed until noon on Friday amid continuing differences over climate, migration and finances, sources familiar with the discussions said. Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the environmentalist Greens decided to halt the talks for several hours after failing to make progress during what was to have been the final evening of the talks. The mood had soured noticeably late on Thursday, with parties breaking off to huddle in their respective caucuses, and party officials trading accusations of blame.  We ll continue at noon today,  said Winfried Kretschmann, a Greens negotiator and premier of the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg. ",worldnews,"November 17, 2017 ",1
China minister warns against seduction of values by Western nations,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Western countries are trying to push their culture and political values onto others, seducing them into abandoning their own, China s propaganda chief warned on Friday, saying the country must follow its own path. Chinese President Xi Jinping has overseen a sweeping crackdown against civil society since assuming office five years ago, tightening control over society, media and the internet. Xi has pledged to promote what the ruling Communist Party refers to as core socialist values, which stress patriotism, Chinese traditional culture, rule of law, harmony and prosperity among others. Huang Kunming, who was appointed to the post following last month s key party congress at which Xi further cemented his grip on power, wrote in the official People s Daily that there was an intensifying  surge and collision  in the world between different values.  There are especially some Western countries who use their technological advantages and dominance of discourse that they have accumulated over a long period to peddle so-called  universal values ,  he wrote. Such countries, which Huang did not name,  are trying to seduce people into  beautifying the West  and  being compliant with the West,  weakening or even abandoning their identification with their own spiritual culture,  he added. China s special cultural traditions, unique historical destiny and national situation mean it has to protect its own values rooted in its culture, Huang said. Only by promoting core socialist values can the Chinese people stand tall in the  forest of the world s people , he added. China has long railed against those it says try to impose Western concepts on the country, such as competitive multi-party democracy or the separation of powers, and the Communist Party brooks no challenge to its power. On the eve of the party congress, state news agency Xinhua attacked Western democracy as divisive and confrontational. China s constitution enshrines the party s long-term  leading  role in government, though it allows the existence of various other political parties under what is called a  multi-party cooperation system . But all are subservient to the Communist Party. Activists who call for pluralism are regularly jailed and criticism of China s authoritarian system silenced. ",worldnews,"November 17, 2017 ",1

U.S. wants 'new era' in Zimbabwe: official,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is seeking  a new era  for Zimbabwe, the State Department s top official for Africa said on Thursday, implicitly calling on long-time President Robert Mugabe to step aside as a political crisis mounts. In an interview with Reuters, acting Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Donald Yamamoto appeared to dismiss the idea of Mugabe, who has ruled Zimbabwe for 37 years, remaining in a transitional or ceremonial role.   It s a transition to a new era for Zimbabwe, that s really what we re hoping for,  Yamamoto said. Zimbabwe s army seized power this week, in an apparent effort to prevent Mugabe, 93, from handing power to his wife. He has not resigned or been formally deposed, however, and he was pictured on Thursday shaking hands with the military chief, Constantino Chiwenga. Yamamoto, speaking on the sidelines of a meeting with African Union officials at the State Department in Washington, described the situation in Zimbabwe as  very fluid.  The United States would discuss lifting multiple U.S. sanctions on Zimbabwe if it began enacting political and economic reforms, he said. In a message for Zimbabwe s political leaders, he said:  Our position has always been that if they engage in the constitutional reforms, economic and political reforms, and move forward to protecting political space and the human rights, then we can start the dialogue on lifting sanctions.  The United States has not given aid to Zimbabwe s government for many years, but provides development aid to nongovernmental groups, particularly for healthcare.  Now whether we give to the government, that depends on what happens in Zimbabwe,  Yamamoto said. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is due to meet on Friday in Washington with 37 African foreign ministers.   ",worldnews,"November 16, 2017 ",1
Mexico enacts law to help find thousands missing in gang violence,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico on Thursday undertook to focus more resources on the search for missing people, the number of which has grown dramatically in recent years as gang violence has claimed tens of thousands of lives. President Enrique Pena Nieto signed into law the creation of a national commission dedicated to finding people who have disappeared that in its first stage will add some 469 million pesos ($25 million) to better fund search efforts, officials said. Over the past 50 years, more than 32,000 Mexicans have been reported missing, according to government data. More than half of the disappearances have been during Pena Nieto s six-year term, which began at the end of 2012.  The disappearance of people is one of the greatest challenges facing our human rights ... and one of the most painful experiences anyone can suffer,  Pena Nieto said during the signing ceremony. The law, which also creates new forensic databases and rules on the exhumation of cadavers, goes into force in about 60 days. Raging gangland violence in Mexico has claimed well over 100,000 lives over the past decade. Authorities are often unable to identify bodies found in mass graves, many of which are located in remote areas. ",worldnews,"November 17, 2017 ",1
Images suggest North Korea 'aggressive' work on ballistic missile submarine: institute,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Satellite images taken this month of a North Korean naval shipyard indicate Pyongyang is pursuing an  aggressive schedule  to build its first operational ballistic missile submarine, a U.S. institute reported on Thursday. Washington-based 38 North, a North Korea monitoring project,  cited images taken on Nov. 5 showing activity at North Korea s Sinpo South Shipyard.  The presence of what appear to be sections of a submarine s pressure hull in the yards suggests construction of a new submarine, possibly the SINPO-C ballistic missile submarine - the follow-on to the current SINPO-class experimental ballistic missile submarine,  38 North said in a report. The report said that throughout 2017 there had been continued movement of parts and components into and out of two parts yards adjacent to the constructions halls in the center of the shipyard. It said the Nov. 5 images showed two large circular objects that could be sections of a submarine s pressure hull. It said these appeared larger than those for North Korea s ROMEO-class attack submarine. Images of a test stand indicated continued testing of a  mechanism for ejection launch of missiles from a submarine. However, the report said no activity could be seen suggesting  preparations for a new test of a submarine-launched missile. North Korea has been working to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the United States, sparking a major international crisis in which U.S. President Donald Trump has said that all options are under consideration, including military ones. North Korea is also thought to be working on a solid-fuel missile for submarine launches. Last month, The Diplomat magazine quoted a U.S. government source as saying U.S. military intelligence had detected a new diesel-electric submarine under construction at Sinpo and  dubbed it the Sinpo-C. It said the submarine was likely a larger successor to North Korea s single experimental ballistic missile submarine. North Korea has conducted dozens of missile tests this year and its largest and biggest nuclear test on Sept. 3. The past two months have seen a relative lull and it has not tested a missile since firing one over Japan on Sept. 15. Another article in The Diplomat last month quoted a U.S. government source as saying that North Korea had tested a new solid fuel engine sometime between Oct. 15 and Oct. 21. U.S. intelligence officials have declined to comment on this. ",worldnews,"November 17, 2017 ",1
Saudi crackdown will not hit investments: energy minister Falih,"BONN, Germany (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia s corruption investigations are linked to a just few individuals and will not hinder investments in the kingdom, its energy minister said on Thursday. Khalid al Falih said the crackdown was way overdue and would also not have any impact on plans to float shares in oil giant Saudi Aramco.   Everybody understands that this is a limited, domestic affair that the government is simply cleaning house,  he said on the sidelines of the U.N. climate conference in Bonn, Germany. Saudi Arabia s future king has tightened his grip on power through an anti-corruption purge by arresting royals, ministers and investors including billionaire Alwaleed bin Talal who is one of the kingdom s most prominent businessmen. The move by Prince Mohammed bin Salman against Saudi s political and business elite also targeted the head of the National Guard, Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, who was detained and replaced as minister of the powerful National Guard by Prince Khaled bin Ayyaf. The energy minister said many foreign investors who had been have been doing business in Saudi Arabia for decades  will tell you that they have not seen corruption in their interactions with the Saudi government or with the Saudi entities .  It (the crackdown) has no impact on foreign direct investment. It has no impact whatsoever on the kingdom s openness, capital flows and our wide open investment environment,  he added. Saudi Arabia s plan to float around 5 percent of Aramco in an initial public offering (IPO) is a centerpiece of Vision 2030, a wide-ranging reform plan to diversify the Saudi economy beyond oil. Falih said a decision is yet to be made on where the listing would be made.  On the upcoming meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna at the end of the month to decide the fate of a global oil production cut, Falih said an extension beyond the March 2018 expiry was needed to rebalance the oil market. OPEC and ten other oil producers led by Russia agreed last year to curb production by some 1.8 million barrels per day to get rid of an oversupply in the market.  ",worldnews,"November 16, 2017 ",1
China's Xi offers support for Saudi amid regional uncertainty,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China supports Saudi Arabia s efforts to safeguard national sovereignty and achieve greater development, President Xi Jinping told Saudi Arabia s King Salman, at a time of regional tensions between Saudi Arabia, Iran, Lebanon and Yemen. China has traditionally played little role in Middle East conflicts or diplomacy, despite its reliance on the region for oil. But it has been trying to raise its profile, with Salman visiting China in March. Speaking by telephone, Xi told Salman that China s determination to deepen strategic cooperation with Saudi Arabia will not waver, no matter how the international and regional situation changes, China s Foreign Ministry said late on Thursday. Remarking on the importance of maintaining close communication between the two countries  heads of state, Xi said    China and Saudi Arabia are comprehensive strategic partners whose strategic mutual trust is deepening.  China supports Saudi Arabia s efforts to safeguard national sovereignty and realize greater development,  the ministry cited Xi as saying, without elaborating. The statement made no specific mention of issues like the resignation as Lebanon Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri while in Saudi Arabia, railing against Riyadh s bitter foe Iran and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah. Saudi-led forces, which back the government in Yemen, have also been targeting the Iran-allied Houthis in a more than two-year war there. China has had to tread a fine line between Riyadh and Tehran as Beijing has close ties with Iran as well. The ministry statement said Xi and Salman also exchanged views on international and regional issues of common concern, but gave no details. ",worldnews,"November 17, 2017 ",1
Factbox: Where Chile's top presidential candidates stand on reforms,"(Reuters) - Conservative frontrunner Sebastian Pinera and center-left Alejandro Guillier lead a crowded field of candidates in Chile s presidential election on Sunday, widely seen as a referendum on the reforms of outgoing President Michelle Bachelet. The following are the main policies supported by Pinera and Guillier: - A billionaire businessman who served as president from 2010 to 2014, Pinera has promised to make Chile the first country in Latin America to achieve  developed nation  status in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a Paris-based club of wealthy nations. - Pinera, the market favorite, would cut corporate taxes to increase investments and said his policies would double economic growth in his term. - Pinera s $14 billion, four-year spending plan includes an overhaul of Bachelet s tax reform that would cost $2.7 billion in new investments in infrastructure and hospitals. Pinera said he would pay for his proposals by cutting  unnecessary  government spending and simplifying the tax code. - Pinera s $3 billion plan to revitalize Chile s pension system, which is criticized as delivering small payouts, includes new subsidies to raise pensions for women and the middle class, as well as incentives to encourage workers to retire later. - To help revive cash-strapped state miner Codelco, the world s No. 1 copper producer, Pinera has committed to overturn a dictatorship-era law that transfers 10 percent of the company s export sales to the military. He also wants Codelco to deploy a  realistic investment plan using existing resources  and to focus on existing assets rather than new projects. - Guillier, a former journalist elected to the Senate in 2013, has pledged to diversify Chile s economy away from the dominant copper industry. He wants to add value to commodities exports by processing more copper at home and give communities outside Santiago a stronger say in decision-making. - Following the lead of ally Bachelet, Guillier has called for rewriting Chile s constitution to formally recognize indigenous communities and to codify the rights of workers to collective bargaining and to strike.  - To boost payouts from the pension system, Guillier has proposed raising fiscal spending on pensions and introducing a new, mandatory contribution from employers. Guillier would also increase regulation and oversight of private pension fund administrators. - Like Pinera, Guillier has called for the repeal of Codelco s mandatory contribution to the military, but wants the state-run miner to stay active abroad to ensure it remains the world s top copper producer. He has also signaled he would seek to maintain Codelco s relations with workers that has spared the company the strikes that have hit private miners under Bachelet. ",worldnews,"November 17, 2017 ",1
Egypt says captured fighter involved in deadly desert attack is Libyan,"CAIRO (Reuters) - A foreign fighter captured during a raid on Islamist militants blamed by Egypt for a deadly attack in its western desert last month is a Libyan national, the Egyptian interior ministry said on Thursday.  The captured fighter, Abdelrahim Mohamed al-Mesmari, 25, is from the eastern Libyan town of Derna, an interior ministry statement said.  A little-known group called Ansar al-Islam claimed responsibility for the Oct. 21 attack. Three security sources said at the time that at least 52 police officers and conscripts were killed but the interior ministry refuted that figure the next day and said only 16 policemen had been killed. The new militant group risks opening up another front for security forces far beyond the remote northern Sinai, where they have battled an Islamic State insurgency since 2014. The Egyptian air force killed the 15 militants responsible for the deadly attack and later arrested 29 others for adopting the same ideology, the statement said.  The militants were being trained in Derna, it added.  ",worldnews,"November 16, 2017 ",1
"Russia casts 10th U.N. veto on Syria action, blocking inquiry renewal","UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Russia on Thursday cast its 10th veto of United Nations Security Council action on Syria since the war began in 2011, blocking a U.S.-drafted resolution to renew an international inquiry into who is to blame for chemical weapons attacks in Syria. The mandate for the joint inquiry by the U.N. and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which found the Syrian government used the banned nerve agent sarin in an April 4 attack, expires on Friday. A resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the United States, France, Russia, Britain or China to be adopted. The U.S. draft text received 11 votes in favor, while Russia and Bolivia voted against it and China and Egypt abstained. The vote sparked a war of words between Russia and the United States in the council, just hours after White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said President Donald Trump believed he could work with Russian President Vladimir Putin on issues like Syria. The April 4 sarin attack on Khan Sheikhoun that killed dozens of people prompted the United States to launch missiles on a Syrian air base. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley warned after the council vote on Thursday:  We will do it again if we must.  Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said the U.S. draft resolution was not balanced.  We need a robust, professional mechanism that will help to prevent the proliferation of the threat of chemical terrorism in the region and you need a puppet-like structure to manipulate public opinion,  Nebenzia said. Syrian ally Russia withdrew its own rival draft resolution to renew the inquiry, known as the Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM), after unsuccessfully pushing for its proposal to be considered second and not first, as council rules required. However, following the vote on the U.S. draft, Bolivia then requested a vote on the Russian text. It failed, receiving only four votes in favor, seven against and four abstentions. Nebenzia said he was  deeply disappointed  and that those who voted against the Russian draft  bear the full brunt of responsibility for the cessation of operation of the JIM.   After the meeting ended Japan circulated a draft resolution to roll over the mandate for the inquiry for one month, diplomats said. It was not immediately clear when the council could vote. Ahead of the council votes on Thursday, Trump urged the Security Council in a Twitter post to renew the inquiry, saying it was needed to prevent Assad from using chemical weapons. While Russia agreed to the 2015 creation of the JIM, it has consistently questioned its findings, which also concluded that the Syrian government used chlorine as a weapon several times. Russia has now vetoed 10 resolutions on Syria, including blocking an initial U.S. bid on Oct. 24 to renew the JIM, saying it wanted to wait for the release two days later of the inquiry s report that said the Syrian government used sarin.  Russia has killed the Joint Investigative Mechanism,  Haley said.  In effect Russia accepts the use of chemical weapons in Syria. How then can we trust Russia s support for supposed peace in Syria?  Syria agreed to destroy its chemical weapons in 2013 under a deal brokered by Russia and the United States.  We condemn the use of chemical weapons by anyone,  Nebenzia said.

Bullets and burns: Portraits of injured Rohingya refugees,"COX S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - The two Rohingya Muslim brothers, six-year-old Mohamed Heron and four-year-old Akhter, held each other as they showed burns on their arms and torsos that their uncle says resulted from Myanmar s armed forces firing rockets at their village. Two of their siblings, one seven years old and the other a 10-month-old infant, died in the attack, according to their uncle, Mohamed Inus. Their father was held by the military and has not been heard of since.   These two children survived when our village was fired on with rockets,  Inus told Reuters at Kutupalong refugee camp, near Cox s Bazar in Bangladesh. They were among a number of Rohingya who showed their wounds to a Reuters photographer who visited Kutupalong and the nearby camps at Balukhali, Leda and Nayapara. (Click reut.rs/2hBZZoK to view the photo essay) Fleeing along with other villagers who abandoned their scorched homes, the boys reached Bangladesh after a three-day trek. At Kutupalong, they were treated for three weeks for their burns at a M decins Sans Fronti res (MSF) clinic. Since the ethnic violence erupted in late August, thousands of Rohingya have crossed the border each week, often travelling for days and even weeks, trekking through forests and over mountains, with many making a hazardous river or sea crossing on the last leg of their flight to fellow-Muslim Bangladesh. Bangladeshi hospitals and international aid agencies are struggling to provide medical care for all the refugees, many of whom have suffered horrific injuries and psychological trauma. Since the crisis began, Chittagong Medical College Hospital has received 261 casualties suffering wounds from gunshots or explosions, according to its director, Brigadier General Jalal Uddin.  Sixteen have died from their wounds and some have been crippled.  We have had to amputate the limbs of some patients,  Jalal Uddin said. Sadar Hospital in Cox s Bazar had treated 1,467 Rohingya since the exodus began for injuries including bullet wounds, broken bones, and cuts inflicted by knives or machetes, residential medical officer Shaheen Abdur Rahman Chowdhury said.  More than 600,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh since Myanmar s military launched what it described as  clearance operations  following a series of attacks by Rohingya militants on security posts in Rakhine state in late August. Rights monitors and fleeing Rohingya say the army and Rakhine Buddhist vigilantes have mounted a campaign of arson aimed at driving out the Muslim population. The U.N. rights agency said it was  a textbook example of ethnic cleansing . Myanmar, an overwhelmingly Buddhist nation, rejects the charge, saying its forces targeted insurgents of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, whom it has accused of setting fires and attacking civilians.   At the camps in Bangladesh, other Rohingya victims of the violence recounted the horrors they had lived through.   Anwara Begum, 36, said she woke to find her home in Maungdaw township, in the northernmost part of Rakhine state, in flames. Before she could get out the burning roof caved in on her and her nylon clothes melted onto her arms. Her husband carried her for eight days to reach the Kutupalong camp in Bangladesh.   I thought I was going to die. I tried to stay alive for my children,  she said, adding she was still waiting for treatment for her burns.  His right arm swathed in bandages from the knuckles of his hand to well above the elbow, Imam Hossain, 42, lay exhausted on the roadside near the Kutupalong camp. He was returning home after teaching at a madrassa in his village when three men attacked him with knives.   The next day, he made his wife and two children leave with other villagers fleeing to Bangladesh. He reached Cox s Bazar later. He was still searching for his family.  I want to ask the Myanmar government why they are harming the Rohingya,  he said.  Why do Buddhists hate us? Why do you torture us? What is wrong with us?   Suffering burns to his limbs and torso, Mohamed Jabair, 21, had feared that he had also lost his sight in an explosion that ripped through his village home.    Knocked unconscious and badly burned, Jabair was carried by his brother and others for four days to Cox s Bazar.    I was blind for many weeks and admitted to a government hospital in Cox s Bazar for 23 days. I was frightened that I would be blind forever,  he said.   Jabair said money sent by relatives in Malaysia had run out and he could no longer afford treatment.    Bowing to show deep cuts arcing across his scalp, 17-year-old Nur Kamal described how soldiers assaulted him after they found the young shopkeeper hiding in his home in Kan Hpu village in Maungdaw.    They hit me with a rifle butt on my head first and then with a knife,  Kamal said.    His uncle found him unconscious in a pool of blood. It took them two weeks to get to Bangladesh.    We want justice,  Kamal said.  We want the international community to help us obtain justice.     Her husband, daughter and one son were killed when soldiers fired on Kalabarow s village in Maungdaw. The 50-year-old woman was hit in her right foot. For several hours, she lay where she fell, pretending to be dead, before a grandson found her. During their 11-day journey to Bangladesh, a village doctor amputated her infected foot and four men carried her on a stretcher made of bamboo and a bedsheet.   As we walked through the forest, we saw burnt villages and dead bodies. I thought we would never be safe,  she said.   Abdur Rahaman, a 73-year-old merchant from Maungdaw, was ambushed while walking on a mountain path with other refugees.  A machete thrown at his feet severed three toes as he ran from his attackers. With his foot bleeding through a tourniquet made from his longyi, or sarong, Rahaman walked for two more hours, before his nephew and friends carried him across the border.  Our future is not good,  he said.  Allah must help us. The international community has to do something.    Curled up in a ball, 11-year-old Ansar Allah shows a large, livid scar on his right thigh - the result of a gunshot wound.   They sprayed us with bullets, as our house was burning,  his mother Samara said.  It was a bullet half the size of my index finger,  she said, before adding,  I can t stop thinking, why did God put us in that dangerous situation?    Setara Begum, 12, was among nine siblings in their home in Maungdaw when it was hit by a rocket.    I saved eight of my nine children from the burning house, but Setara was trapped inside,  said her mother, Arafa.    I could see her crying in the middle of the fire, but it was difficult to save her. By the time we could reach her, she was badly burned,  Arafa said.   Setara s father carried her for two days to Bangladesh.    The young girl received no treatment for the severe burns to her feet. Her feet healed. But she has no toes. The trauma has scarred her psychologically.    She has been mute from that day, and doesn t speak to anyone,  her mother said.  She only cries silently.  Her face heavily bandaged, Momtaz Begum told how soldiers came to her village demanding valuables.    I told them I was poor and had nothing. One of them started beating me saying,  If you have no money, then we will kill you .    After beating her, they locked her in her home and set fire to the roof. She escaped to find her three sons dead and her daughter beaten and bleeding.   Momtaz fled to Bangladesh, where she spent 20 days at the MSF clinic being treated for burns to her face and body.    What can I say about the future, if now we have no food, no house, no family. We cannot think about the future. They have killed that as well.  ",worldnews,"November 16, 2017 ",1

China says 'dual suspension' proposal still best for North Korea,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Thursday a  dual suspension  proposal to handle North Korea was still the best option, after U.S. President Donald Trump said he and Chinese President Xi Jinping had rejected a  freeze for freeze  agreement. North Korea s rapid progress in developing nuclear weapons and missiles has fueled a surge in regional tensions as United Nations-led sanctions appear to have failed to bite deeply enough to change its behavior. China and Russia have proposed that the United States and South Korea stop major military exercises in exchange for North Korea halting its weapons programs. Beijing formally calls the idea the  dual suspension  proposal. Speaking upon his return from Asia on Wednesday, Trump said he and Xi had agreed that they would not accept a  freeze for freeze  idea, which China s foreign minister announced in March. Asked how China understood Trump s remarks and whether he agreed with the characterization of what Trump said he agreed to with Xi, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said only through talks that addressed all sides  legitimate security concerns could there be a peaceful resolution.  We believe that the  dual suspension  proposal is the most feasible, fair and sensible plan in the present situation,  Geng told a daily news briefing.  Not only can it relieve the present tense situation, it can also resolve all parties most pressing security concerns, and provide an opportunity and create conditions to resume talks, and find a breakthrough point to get out of trouble,  he added.  The  dual suspension  is just a first step and not the end point, Geng added.  We hope that all sides can conscientiously treat and proactively consider China s proposal, and at the same time we welcome relevant parties to put forward proposals that can benefit the promotion of a peaceful resolution for the peninsula nuclear issue.  Asked at a regular briefing if Trump stood by his remarks as to what he had agreed with Xi, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders on Thursday replied:  Both sides made their positions clear. They are different, but we agreed that there are going to be different positions and therefore it s not going to move forward.  North Korea has said it needs to develop its weapons to protect itself from what it sees as U.S. military aggression. It also sees U.S.-South Korean military exercises as joint preparations for invasion. South Korea and the United States, which has about 28,000 troops based in South Korea, say their exercises are  defensive in nature.  ",worldnews,"November 16, 2017 ",1

Davis told a business conference in Berlin he hoped the European Commission would be able by Christmas to proceed to the next stage of Brexit negotiations - on future ties between Britain and the EU. Davis added that he expected Prime Minister Theresa May to remain in office for the duration of the Brexit negotiations  and beyond.  ",worldnews,"November 16, 2017 ",1
U.S. judge declines to say whether Turkish trader Zarrab will face trial,"NEW YORK/ANKARA (Reuters) - The U.S. judge presiding over the trial of a Turkish gold trader accused of evading U.S. sanctions against Iran on Thursday refused to say if the wealthy businessman would be on trial with one of his co-defendants later this month. U.S. prosecutors have charged the trader, Reza Zarrab, and his alleged co-conspirators of handling hundreds of millions of dollars for Iran s government and Iranian entities from 2010 to 2015, in a scheme to evade U.S. sanctions. Nine people have been criminally charged, but only Zarrab and a banker from Turkey s Halkbank, Mehmet Hakan Atilla, are in U.S. custody. Both deny the charges. The case has complicated relations between the United States and Turkey, both members of the NATO military alliance. While the two are due to go on trial on Nov.27, Zarrab has not appeared in court or submitted any filings since September, sparking speculation in Turkish media that he has reached an agreement with U.S. authorities. U.S. District Judge Richard Berman refused to say whether Zarrab would be on trial alongside Atilla when asked by Victor Rocco, one of Atilla s lawyers, at a court hearing on Thursday.  The one perk that comes with being a judge is you don t have to answer questions as witnesses and lawyers do,  Berman said. Rocco told reporters after the hearing that he expected to know more about Zarrab in the next few days. U.S. prosecutors have alleged that Zarrab, a dual Turkish and Iranian citizen, sought support from and invoked the name of Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan to advance his business. Erdogan has not been accused of wrongdoing. The president  has accused U.S. prosecutors of having  ulterior motives  by including references to him and his wife in court papers. U.S. authorities informed Turkey that Zarrab had been moved to a different location and was in good medical condition, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said earlier on Thursday.  They responded after Turkey sent two diplomatic notes to ask about Zarrab s condition after the U.S. Federal Bureau of Prisons website showed Zarrab had been released last week and his lawyers said they had not heard from their client in five days.

"Zimbabwe's Mugabe, coup chief meet with smiles and handshakes","HARARE (Reuters) - A smiling President Robert Mugabe was pictured shaking hands with Zimbabwe s military chief a day after the army seized power, throwing confusion over predictions that the 93-year-old s nearly four-decade rule had come to an end. Mugabe unexpectedly drove from his lavish  Blue Roof  Harare compound in Harare, where he had been confined since troops took to the streets, to State House, where official media pictured him meeting military chief Constantino Chiwenga and South African ministers sent to mediate the crisis. The official Herald newspaper carried no reports of the outcome of the meeting, leaving Zimbabwe s 13 million people in the dark as to what was happening as night fell on Thursday. Mugabe is insisting he remains Zimbabwe s only legitimate ruler and is refusing to quit, but pressure was mounting on the former guerrilla to accept offers of a graceful exit, sources said on Thursday. Earlier, a political source who spoke to senior allies holed up in the compound with Mugabe and his wife Grace said he had no plans to resign voluntarily ahead of elections due next year.  It s a sort of stand-off, a stalemate,  the source said.  They are insisting the president must finish his term.  The army s takeover signaled the collapse in less than 36 hours of the security, intelligence and patronage networks that sustained Mugabe through 37 years in power and built him into the  Grand Old Man  of African politics. A priest mediating between Mugabe and the generals, who seized power on Wednesday in what they called a targeted operation against  criminals  in Mugabe s entourage, has made little headway, a senior political source told Reuters. Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai called for Mugabe s departure  in the interest of the people . In a statement read to reporters, Tsvangirai pointedly referred to him as  Mr Robert Mugabe , not president. The army may want Mugabe, who has ruled Zimbabwe since independence in 1980, to go quietly and allow a smooth and bloodless transition to Emmerson Mnangagwa, the vice president Mugabe sacked last week triggering the political crisis. The main goal of the generals is to prevent Mugabe from handing power to his wife Grace, 41 years his junior, who has built a following among the ruling party s youth wing and appeared on the cusp of power after Mnangagwa was pushed out. The last of Africa s state founders still in power from the era of the struggle against European colonization, Mugabe is still seen by many Africans as a liberation hero. But he is reviled in the West as a despot whose disastrous handling of the economy and willingness to resort to violence to maintain power pauperized one of Africa s most promising states. Once a regional bread-basket, Zimbabwe saw its economy collapse in the wake of the seizure of white-owned farms in the early 2000s, followed by runaway money-printing that catapulted inflation to 500 billion percent in 2008. Millions of Zimbabweans, from highly skilled bankers to semi-literate farmers, emigrated, mostly to neighboring South Africa, where an estimated 3 million still live. After briefly stabilizing under a 2009-2013 power-sharing government, when Mugabe was forced to work with the opposition, the economy has once again cratered, with dollars scarce, inflation surging, imports running out and queues outside banks. A fighter, both literally and figuratively during a political career that included several assassination attempts, Mugabe may now have reached the end of the road. With the army camped on his front door and the police - once seen as a bastion of support - showing no signs of resistance, force is not an option. Similarly, he has little popular backing in Harare, where he is widely loathed, and his influence in the ruling ZANU-PF party is evaporating. ZANU-PF youth leader Kudzai Chipanga, a vocal Mugabe supporter, publicly apologized for opposing the army after being marched by soldiers into the state television headquarters to read out a statement, sources at the broadcaster said. He was then taken back to the army s main KGVI (pronounced KG Six) barracks in Harare, where Finance Minister Ignatius Chombo is also being held, an army source said. Video footage obtained by Reuters from the houses of two key allies of Grace Mugabe - cabinet ministers Jonathan Moyo and Saviour Kasukuwere - indicated that the army was also prepared to use force if necessary. Moyo s front door was blown open with explosives, scattering glass across the entrance hall, while the inside walls of Kasukuwere s house were pocked with bullet holes. The pair managed to escape on the evening of the coup and make it to Mugabe s compound, where they remain under effective house arrest, one political source said. Zimbabwean intelligence reports seen by Reuters suggest Mugabe s exit was in the planning for more than a year. Mnangagwa, a former security chief and life-long Mugabe confidant known as  The Crocodile , is the key player. According to the files and political sources in Zimbabwe and South Africa, once Mugabe s resignation is secured Mnangagwa would take over as president of an interim unity government that will seek to stabilize the imploding economy. Fuelling speculation that this plan might be rolling into action, 65-year-old Tsvangirai, who has been receiving cancer treatment in Britain and South Africa, returned to Harare late on Wednesday. Ex-finance minister Tendai Biti added to that speculation, telling Reuters he would be happy to work in a post-coup administration as long as Tsvangirai was also on board.  If Morgan says he s in, I m in,  said Biti, who earned international respect during his time as finance minister in the 2009-13 government.  The country needs a solid pair of hands so one might not have a choice.  South Africa said Mugabe had told President Jacob Zuma by telephone on Wednesday that he was confined to his home but was otherwise fine. The military said it was keeping him and his family, including Grace, safe. Despite admiration for Mugabe among older African leaders, there is little public affection for 52-year-old Grace, an ex-government typist who began an affair with Mugabe in the early 1990s while his first wife Sally was dying of kidney failure. Dubbed  DisGrace  or  Gucci Grace  on account of her reputed love of shopping, she enjoyed a meteoric rise through the ranks of ZANU-PF in the last two years, culminating in Mnangagwa s removal. Zimbabweans, including the Mnangagwa camp and the military, interpreted the vice president s ouster as a move to clear the way for her to succeed her husband. In contrast to the high political drama unfolding behind closed doors, the streets of the capital remained calm, with people going about their daily business, albeit under the watch of soldiers on armored vehicles at strategic locations.

Russia casts 10th U.N. veto on U.N. action on Syria,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Russia cast its 10th veto on Thursday of United Nations Security Council action on Syria since the war began in 2011, blocking a U.S.-drafted resolution to renew an international inquiry into who is to blame for chemical weapons attacks in Syria.  The mandate for the joint inquiry by the U.N. and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which found the Syrian government used the banned nerve agent sarin in an April 4 attack, expires at midnight Thursday. A resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the United States, France, Russia, Britain or China to be adopted. Russia withdrew its rival draft resolution to renew the inquiry shortly before the council vote on the U.S. draft.  ",worldnews,"November 16, 2017 ",1
Lebanon's Hariri to fly to Paris within 48 hours: source close to Hariri,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon s Saad al-Hariri is expected to leave Saudi Arabia for France within 48 hours, before flying home to Beirut to officially submit his resignation as Lebanese prime minister, a source close to Hariri told Reuters on Thursday. Hariri announced his resignation in a televised broadcast from Saudi Arabia on Nov. 4, and has not yet returned to Lebanon. He said on Wednesday he would return soon. Lebanese President Michel Aoun tweeted on Thursday that he hoped the country s political crisis was over following Hariri s acceptance of the French invitation.  I await the return of PM Hariri to Beirut so we can decide on the situation of the government - if he wants to resign or rescind his resignation,  Aoun said, according to presidential sources. Aoun has previously said he will not accept Hariri s resignation until he returns to Beirut to tender it and explain his reasons. The resignation of Hariri pushed Lebanon to the center of an intensifying regional rivalry between Shi ite Muslim Iran and Sunni Saudi Arabia. Lebanese presidential sources quoted Aoun on Thursday as saying Lebanon remained committed to its policy of  disassociation, especially among Arab states . The disassociation policy is generally known in Lebanon to mean staying out of regional conflicts. In his interview on Sunday, Hariri repeatedly called for disassociation to be respected. French President Emmanuel Macron said in a statement on Wednesday that he had invited Hariri to France after speaking to him and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The invitation is to visit for a few days and is not an offer of political exile, Macron said, speaking in Germany. Hariri is expected to go to France with his family, the source close to Hariri said. Hariri traveled to Riyadh on Nov. 3 before abruptly resigning a day later, and he has remained in the Saudi capital since then. Top Lebanese officials and senior politicians close to Hariri have told Reuters he was forced to quit. Hariri and Saudi Arabia have both denied he is being held in Riyadh or was coerced to resign.

Lebanese president hopes Hariri visit to France will end crisis,"BEIRUT/PARIS (Reuters) - Lebanon s president said on Thursday he hoped the crisis over Saad al-Hariri s resignation as prime minister would end soon, with Hariri due to leave Saudi Arabia for France this weekend. Hariri quit in a broadcast from Saudi Arabia on Nov. 4, railing against Riyadh s bitter foe Iran and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah.  The shock resignation thrust Lebanon into both a domestic political crisis and the Middle East s overarching rivalry that pits Saudi Arabia and its allies against a bloc led by Iran. A Elysee Palace source said Hariri would fly to Paris on Saturday and meet President Emmanuel Macron the same day.  French officials said they did not know how long Hariri would stay before returning to Beirut but hoped his trip would help soothe the crisis by demonstrating he was not being held in Saudi Arabia, as Lebanon s President Michel Aoun has said.  His arrival will ease tensions by showing he s free to move around,  said a French diplomatic source.  There would be consultations before he returns to Beirut to build international support for him to negotiate a new political deal in Lebanon, French officials said.       We re not trying to find a compromise or open dialogue between sides, but trying to create the conditions for a de-escalation in the region. We want to avoid a proliferation of crises that could get out of control.  Hariri accepted an invitation to France on Thursday after meeting French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, who was visiting Saudi Arabia. Aoun, who has refused to accept Hariri s resignation unless he returns to Lebanon, has accused Riyadh of holding Hariri hostage. He said on Thursday on Twitter he hoped  the crisis is over  and the France visit would open the door to a solution. Lebanon maintains a delicate sectarian balance, after Sunnis, Shi ites, Christians and Druze fought a 1975-1990 civil war, with factions often backed by regional rivals. Hariri, a Sunni Muslim, is a long-term ally of Saudi Arabia. Aoun, a Christian, is a political ally of Hezbollah, the heavily armed Shi ite Muslim movement that is backed by Iran. Hariri s government, a power-sharing coalition formed last year, includes Hezbollah.  Since Hariri announced his resignation, Saudi Arabia has  accused Lebanon of declaring war on it, citing Hezbollah s role fighting in other Arab countries. On Thursday, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said Saudi Arabia was consulting with its allies about what leverage to use against Hezbollah.  We will make the decision when the time comes,  he told Reuters in an interview. Top Lebanese officials and senior politicians close to Hariri say he was forced to quit and was being held by the Saudis. Politicians from all sides in Lebanon have called for his return to Beirut.  Saudi Arabia has denied forcing Hariri to resign or detaining him. In an interview on Sunday, his first public comments since resigning, Hariri said he is free to leave and would return home soon to formally submit his resignation. He also warned of possible Saudi action against Lebanon, including sanctions and threats to the livelihood of Lebanese workers in the Gulf, unless Hezbollah is reined in.  Aoun said in a statement that once Hariri returned to Lebanon he would have to stay until a new government was formed.  Lebanese Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil has toured European capitals seeking diplomatic help to end the crisis. On Friday he is to go to Russia, after visiting Germany and Turkey on Thursday.   The issue is one of freedom ... of international conventions related to immunity,  Bassil said in Ankara after meeting with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan.  France s foreign minister, Le Drian, said Paris was working to normalize the situation in Lebanon. After meeting Le Drian, Jubeir described Hezbollah as an arm of Iran s Revolutionary Guards and said it must disarm for Lebanon to be stable.   Whenever we see a problem, we see Hezbollah act as an arm or agent of Iran and this has to come to an end,  he said. ",worldnews,"November 16, 2017 ",1
Venezuela's ex-prosecutor wants Maduro tried at the Hague,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela s sacked former chief prosecutor on Thursday asked the International Criminal Court to capture and try President Nicolas Maduro and other top officials for crimes against humanity over murders by police and military officers. Luisa Ortega, who broke with Maduro this year after working closely with the ruling Socialist Party for a decade, was fired in August after she opposed Maduro s plan to create an all-powerful legislature called the Constituent Assembly. She fled the country and has traveled the world denouncing alleged acts of corruption and violations of human rights. Ortega said her complaint, filed on Wednesday with the Hague-based tribunal, was prompted by some 8,290 deaths between 2015 and 2017 at the hands of officials who received instructions the government.  (They happened) under the orders of the executive branch, as part of a social cleansing plan carried out by the government,  she told reporters in the Hague. The government did not immediately respond to a request for a comment. The accusation refers to incidents of torture, extrajudicial killings and arbitrary arrest. Some of them took place during a crackdown on anti-government protests that rocked the country between April and July and left at least 125 people dead, some of them at the hands of military and police officers. The Maduro government accused Ortega of turning a blind eye to violence by opposition supporters, and has also leveled a raft of corruption charges at her. Ortega s request also makes reference to killings that took place during police raids known as  Operations to Free the People,  which have been heavily criticized by human rights groups since they began in 2015.  Nicolas Maduro and his government must pay for this,  she said. The complaint also accuses top officials such as Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino and intelligence chief Gustavo Gonzalez of involvement in the alleged abuses. Ortega s critics say she was closely allied with Maduro s efforts to crack down on dissent and, before her break with him, had helped jail opposition leaders on trumped-up charges. Maduro s government insists it respects human rights and says opposition demonstrations were Washington-backed efforts to violently overthrow him. Despite their bitter differences, Venezuela s government and opposition agreed on Wednesday to a new round of foreign-mediated talks in the Dominican Republic on Dec. 1.

Suicide bomber kills nine near Afghan political meeting,"KABUL (Reuters) - A suicide bomb attack in the Afghan capital near a meeting of supporters of an influential regional leader on Thursday killed at least nine people and wounded many, the interior ministry said. Islamic State claimed responsibility, according to Amaq, its official news agency. The Taliban denied involvement. Atta Mohammad Noor, governor of the northern province of Balkh and a leader of the mainly ethnic Tajik Jamiat-i-Islami party, was not at the meeting at the time of the attack, members of the party said. Political tensions are rising as politicians have begun jockeying for position ahead of presidential elections expected in 2019 and thousands of civilians have been killed in attacks this year.  The bomber approached the hotel hosting the gathering on foot but was spotted by a police official, Sayed Basam Padshah, as he neared a security checkpoint, an interior ministry spokesman said. The attacker triggered his explosives vest before he could get any further, Kabul police chief Basir Mujahid told Reuters. Padshah was among the seven policemen and two civilians killed.  He saved many lives by sacrificing his life,  Mujahid said. The northern-based Jamiat-i-Islami was for years the main opponent of the Taliban, who draw their support largely from the southern-based ethnic Pashtun community. A witness to Thursday s bombing said:  We are proud to be martyred because of our country and our rights. This gathering was for the sake of our country to raise our voice.  In June, a suicide bomber attacked a meeting of Jamiat-i-Islami leaders, including Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah. Abdullah, who is supported by ethnic minority leaders including Noor who fought against the Taliban s hard-line Islamist regime in the 1990s, formed a coalition government with President Ashraf Ghani after a disputed 2014 presidential election. Ghani on Wednesday sacked the chairman of the Independent Election Commission, raising doubts over whether parliamentary and council ballots scheduled for next year will take place as planned.

Scotland may give Labour another chance at British power,"GLASGOW, Scotland (Reuters) - Britain s opposition Labour Party is poised for a resurgence in Glasgow, raising its hopes that a recovery from a disastrous election performance in Scotland two years ago can help its socialist leader Jeremy Corbyn win power in London. A Labour stronghold for decades until it rejected the party in 2015 in favor of the pro-independence Scottish National Party (SNP), Scotland s largest city is showing signs of returning to its political roots.  With a 41.5 percent share of the overall British vote in recent opinion polling, Corbyn sees himself positioned to form a  government if Prime Minister Theresa May s divided Conservatives falter over Britain s exit from the European Union. Winning back some of Scotland s 59 parliamentary seats is key to his plan. With this in mind, Corbyn toured target Scottish constituencies after June s national election left May s Conservatives severely weakened.  There are still many people who need to be persuaded to put their trust in the Labour Party once again,  Corbyn told a meeting in the Highlands ski-resort of Aviemore last month.  But this is the beginning of the rebirth of Scottish Labour.   Scotland, where the SNP lost seats to Labour in the west and to the Conservatives in the northeast in June, is shaping up to be a major battleground in the next British election, due in 2022. Labour winning in Glasgow, a city of one million people that backed secession from Britain in a referendum in 2014, would make the arrival of Prime Minister Corbyn more likely and  reduce the chances of Scottish independence by damaging the SNP. Labour policies, such as renationalization of the railways and more funding for public services, appeal to Scots on the left though they may scare off more conservative voters with higher taxes and controls over the free market.  Scottish Labour announces a new leader on Saturday, after a contest between trade unionist Richard Leonard, whom many see as favorite because his views align with Corbyn, and more centrist Anas Sarwar, the Glasgow-born son of the UK s first elected Asian lawmaker.  Margaret Young, a 50-year-old nurse, lives in Glasgow East, a central district which, until the 1960s, was an industrial powerhouse and is now one of Scotland s poorest areas. Once the site of massive steel-works it is home to a shopping center called  The Forge,  and around half of residents here are classed by the government as income-deprived. In June, Young switched her vote to Labour from the SNP, because she thinks Corbyn will loosen the government s purse strings. The SNP held Glasgow East by just 75 votes, down from 10,000 two years ago.  Young blames May s Conservatives in London for poor public services and the SNP for failing to mitigate spending cuts.  Austerity is definitely what is hurting us,  she told Reuters, saying it was  disgusting  that struggling families on welfare were being penalized. Of a dozen people interviewed by Reuters in East Glasgow,  10 said they would vote for Labour or consider it seriously. East Glasgow and seven other seats in the Glasgow area are among 21 Scottish constituencies held by the SNP that would need a swing of less than 5 percent for a Labour win, according to pollster Survation. At present Labour has 7 Scottish seats. With just a handful more votes in each marginal area, Scotland could make the difference between a minority and a majority Labour government in Britain s 650-seat House of Commons. As most of Scotland s budget is controlled by the government in London, Young believes only Corbyn can bring real change. Scots like Young now seem to blame the SNP, in power in the devolved Scottish parliament for a decade, rather than the UK government in London for not sending enough money to Scotland.  Glasgow, an industrial center on Britain s northwestern coast, was a hub of left-wing radicalism and a lynchpin of Labour s political success nationwide for nearly a century. Under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, the party took a centrist direction and Labour started to fall out of favor in the north. Labour was spurned by Scottish voters when it campaigned with the rival Conservatives to defend the 300-year-old union of England and Scotland in the 2014 referendum. Scots rejected independence, but in a British election eight months later, Labour lost all but one of its 41 seats in Scotland.  A lot of people who voted  Yes  during the referendum did so because they wanted a sense of change,  said Kate Watson, the Labour candidate in Glasgow East.  Jeremy s given us permission to be heard again.   Corbyn avoids mention of Blair and Brown and namechecks Labour s first leader Keir Hardie as a mentor, appealing to old party values which play well here. Rebecca Hynam, 30, is a primary school teacher who says politicians would be  shocked  by shortages of staff and materials in schools. She backs Corbyn.  In maths, we don t have enough calculators for my class.   Glaswegians interviewed seemed to overlook the weaknesses of Scottish Labour: its flip-flops on the independence question and its wobbles on what it wants from Brexit. Nevertheless many trust Corbyn, whose personal style reminds some people of a kindly schoolteacher, to make amends. One is Andrea, a 55-year-old secretary who voted Labour for the first time in June.  He seems like a neighbor next door, that s what I like about him. He seems to speak from the heart.

Cambodia's main opposition party dissolved by Supreme Court,"PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodia s highest court dissolved the main opposition party on Thursday, leaving authoritarian Prime Minister Hun Sen clear to extend more than three decades of power in next year s election as rights groups decried the death of democracy. The government had asked the Supreme Court to dissolve the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), which was accused of plotting to take power with the help of the United States after the arrest of party leader Kem Sokha on Sept. 3. The court ruling also ordered a five-year political ban for 118 members of the opposition party, which had posed a major election threat for Hun Sen, a former Khmer Rouge commander who is the world s longest-serving prime minister. In a televised address, Hun Sen told Cambodians the election would go ahead  as normal.  The CNRP rejected the accusations against it as politically motivated. It did not send lawyers for the court ruling.  Democracy was brought to trial and it lost,  said Mu Sochua, a deputy to Kem Sokha who fled Cambodia fearing arrest.  The international community must fulfill its commitments to democracy, human rights and freedoms. Sanctions are the best leverage for negotiation for free, fair and inclusive elections.  Western donors, who sponsored elections overseen by the United Nations in 1993 in the hope of founding an enduring democracy, had called for Kem Sokha s release. But they have shown no appetite for sanctions against Cambodia s government, which is now closely allied to China.  The United States and European Union missions in Cambodia declined immediate comment on the court ruling. Senator John McCain, a leading U.S. Republican, said the dissolution of the CNRP meant there was  no way the elections scheduled for 2018 can proceed in a manner that is free or fair,  and the Trump administration should impose sanctions.  The Trump administration should move quickly to sanction all senior Cambodian government officials responsible for violating human rights and subverting freedom in Cambodia,  he said in a statement. U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq said it was up to the government to provide a free environment without fear for fair elections. Despite ramping up anti-U.S. rhetoric and linking the United States to the alleged plot against him, Hun Sen lauded U.S. President Donald Trump at a regional summit at the weekend and said he welcomed his policy of non-interference. Dozens of police manned barriers outside the gold ornamented court in the center of Phnom Penh on Thursday. There was no sign of protests.  Few people on the streets wanted to talk about the ruling, the latest chapter in decades of maneuvering that have kept Hun Sen and his Cambodian People s Party (CPP) in power across all levels in the country of 16 million.  People are scared to talk amongst themselves,  said Seang Menly, 39, a driver of one of the rickety tuk-tuks that ply the streets of Phnom Penh.  In my neighborhood, people who used to give money and food to the CNRP no longer dare to.  Hun Sen and his defenders say only he can ensure peace.  During his rule since 1985, Cambodia has been transformed from a failed state in the wake of Khmer Rouge purges and genocide to a lower middle-income country with growth of about 7 percent a year. Life expectancy has risen from 50 to 70.  The Supreme Court s decision today is not to end democracy but to deter extremists in order to protect the people and the nation from destruction,  said Huy Vannak, undersecretary of state at the interior ministry. Rights groups condemned the decision by the court, which is headed by a judge who is a member of the ruling party s permanent committee. They said it left Cambodia as a de facto one-party state and rendered next year s election meaningless.  This is the death of democracy in Cambodia,  said Phil Robertson of Human Rights Watch.  More than half the CNRP s members of parliament had already fled Cambodia, fearing detention in a crackdown on Hun Sen s critics, civil rights groups and independent media that began last year.  We don t know who is next,  an editor at the Voice of Democracy radio station in Phnom Penh said. It was taken off the air in August, but has continued broadcasting through Facebook. The CNRP s parliamentary seats will be redistributed to other government-aligned parties after its dissolution. The party will also lose control of the councils that it won in local elections in June, when its strong showing in winning more than 40 percent of them made clear the threat it posed to the ruling party next year. Hun Sen appealed to CNRP members to join the CPP, saying:  You cannot even save your party. How will you save yourself?  Evidence presented against the party included a video from 2013 in which Kem Sokha said he had help from unidentified Americans to win power. He said he was talking about a democratic election strategy, not a coup. ",worldnews,"November 16, 2017 ",1
"OSCE watchdog slams Unites States, Russia for ""foreign agent"" media laws","VIENNA (Reuters) - The OSCE s media watchdog said on Thursday moves by the United States and Russia to force some foreign media to register as  foreign agents  were unacceptable and dangerous. Russia s lower house of parliament this week approved a law allowing Moscow to force foreign media to describe news they provide to Russians as the work of  foreign agents  and to disclose their funding sources. Earlier on Thursday Russia named nine U.S. government-sponsored news outlets likely to be labeled  foreign agents . U.S. intelligence officials accuse the Kremlin of using Russian media organizations it finances to influence U.S. voters. Washington has required Russian state broadcaster RT to register a U.S.-based affiliate company as a  foreign agent .  Branding media entities as  foreign agents  is a dangerous practice, as it can narrow the space for freedom of the media,  said Harlem Desir, media freedom chief of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). The OSCE, which also oversees election monitoring, is one of the few security forums which brings Russia and the United States to the same table.

Suicide bombers kill 10 in Nigeria's Maiduguri: emergency official,"MAIDUGURI, Nigeria (Reuters) - Suicide bomb attackers killed 10 people and wounded 30 in the northeast Nigerian city of Maiduguri on Wednesday, an emergency agency official said.  Islamist militant group Boko Haram has killed more than 20,000 people since 2009 as part of its attempt to create an Islamic state in the Lake Chad basin.  No one immediately claimed responsibility for the latest attack, which emergency officials and members of a government-approved vigilante group said was carried out by four female bombers in the Muna Garage district of Maiduguri at about 06:00 p.m. (1700 GMT).  The use of female bombers is a hallmark of Boko Haram attacks.   We have so far recorded 10 people s deaths and about 30 victims injured,  said Bello Dambatta, a spokesman for the State Emergency Agency (SEMA). Maiduguri is the capital of Borno state and the city worst hit by the jihadist insurgency. At least 221 people have been killed in bombings and gun attacks in northeast Nigeria since June, according to a Reuters tally.  ",worldnews,"November 15, 2017 ",1
Trump urges U.N. council to renew Syria chemical arms inquiry,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday urged all members of the U.N. Security Council to back the renewal of the international inquiry into chemical weapons attacks in Syria, saying it was needed to prevent President Bashar al-Assad from using the arms.  Need all on the UN Security Council to vote to renew the Joint Investigative Mechanism for Syria to ensure that Assad Regime does not commit mass murder with chemical weapons ever again,  Trump said in a note on Twitter. The 15-nation council was due to vote on Thursday on rival U.S. and Russian bids to renew the international inquiry, diplomats said on Wednesday, a move that could trigger Russia s 10th veto to block action on Syria.

Britain denies $500 million debt to Iran linked to bid to free jailed aid worker,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain said on Thursday that moves toward paying half a billion dollars to Iran for a debt owed since the 1979 Islamic Revolution had nothing to do with a bid to secure the release of a jailed Iranian-British aid worker. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, was detained in April and sentenced to five years after an Iranian court convicted her of plotting to overthrow the clerical establishment. She denies the charges. Prime Minister Theresa May s government is under intense pressure to secure Zaghari-Ratcliffe s release, in part because Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson made remarks that Iran said justified her conviction. Britain has sought legal advice over whether it could transfer over 400 million pounds ($528 million) which it owes the Islamic Republic in capital and interest for a 1970s arms deal with the then-Shah of Iran, the Telegraph newspaper. Britain owes the money after the Shah paid up front for 1,750 Chieftain tanks and other vehicles, almost none of which were eventually delivered after the Islamic Revolution of 1979 toppled the U.S.-backed leader. British officials did not directly answer requests for comment on whether they were preparing to pay the money to Iran, but May s spokesman said the debt issue was not linked to the attempts to convince Tehran to release Zaghari-Ratcliffe. Talks to resolve the debt matter have been going on for years.  It is wrong to link a completely separate debt issue with any other aspect of our bilateral relationship with Iran,  a government spokesman said, adding that Iran s Defence Ministry remains subject to European Union sanctions.  The debt was paid to a bank account controlled by the High Court in 2002 but has not been released due to sanctions on the Islamic Republic, the spokesman said. Iran rejected media reports associating the debt Britain owed to Iran with the fate of Zaghari-Ratcliffe.  These are two separate matters ... Linking them is wrong. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been tried and sentenced to jail,  TV quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi as saying. British officials told the Telegraph that work on how to pay the debt has intensified in recent months in a bid to improve relations with Iran. When asked about the reports, May s spokesman said the government saw no connection between the debt and the fate of Zaghari-Ratcliffe.  We are clear we don t see any link between these two issues,  the spokesman said.  The reports are speculation, not anything that I recognize.

Greeks in mourning and disbelief after flood that killed at least 15,"MANDRA, Greece (Reuters) - Greeks voiced despair and disbelief on Thursday after a flash flood killed at least 15 people and left hundreds homeless, with many blaming a system that allowed houses to be built on dried up river beds. In the towns of Nea Peramos and Mandra west of the capital Athens, crumpled cars and mangled furniture lay on roads coated in the thick mud left behind by a raging torrent that smashed through homes on Wednesday morning.  We are ruined. My tavern and my house are gone,  said Paraskevas Stamou, a restaurant owner in Mandra.  Everything is gone, the road is gone, the water is still flowing and we were flooded again last night and this morning.  We are expecting another downpour tonight. It s like God hates us,  he told Reuters. To escape the lethal floodwaters, residents took desperate measures.  We had nowhere to sleep. We slept on the roof, we found carpets to cover ourselves,  said a man in Mandra whose house was gutted by the flood but remained standing. Between sobs, his mother added:  Everything went. We don t have anyone to help us. I don t have help from anyone.     Elderly people wandered the streets in muddied clothing, looking bewildered.  What I am concerned about is the indifference - there was no one there by our side to say,  take courage . I didn t want anything else, nothing,  said Mandra resident Maria Kriada.  Did anyone ask me if I had any water to drink? If I had any food to eat? If I had somewhere to sleep? No one came to say this.  Bad weather continued on Thursday. Officials said they were waiting for conditions to improve before giving a clearer picture of the damage. Five people were still missing.  Flags flew at half-mast from state buildings and the Acropolis on Thursday as the government declared three days of national mourning. Newspapers expressed anger.  A Crime,  was the headline in Ta Nea daily, superimposed on a picture of a woman being comforted next to an overturned car.  The Deeds of Man,  wrote the leftist Avgi, referring to unlicensed constructions. Experts blamed haphazard construction which the natural path for water runoff obstructed, and soil erosion on a mountain range hit by fires. Both towns were built along an old motorway linking Athens to the Peloponnese city of Corinth. As building crept closer to the road, streams that would have drained runoff from the nearby Pateras mountains were blocked.  Of course the state wasn t prepared ... we cannot compete with nature,  said Christos Zeferos, head of the research center for Atmospheric Physics and Climatology Academy of Athens, adding that climate change meant people should expect more weather-related disasters.  We should be prepared for more frequent, and different phenomena,  he told Reuters. Many of the victims were elderly. The youngest was a 36-year old truck driver who called his mother as the floodwaters rose around his lorry. The line went dead soon afterwards. ",worldnews,"November 16, 2017 ",1
"EU to press May at summit, UK dismisses Brexit offer talk","GOTHENBURG, Sweden (Reuters) - European Union leaders will press Theresa May to meet their conditions soon for launching post-Brexit trade talks when she holds talks on the sidelines of a summit in Sweden on Friday, EU officials said. The British prime minister dismissed via a spokesman a report on Thursday that she was ready to raise her offer of cash to settle London s obligations to the Union on leaving but a top EU lawmaker said he came away from a meeting with May in London optimistic that Britain was moving towards a deal with Brussels. At the Gothenburg talks devoted to labor and social reform, May will have a chance to speak to her peers on the sidelines   though German Chancellor Angela Merkel will skip the event. A key moment may be May s meeting before lunch with Donald Tusk, the summit chair who is overseeing the withdrawal process. Tusk will remind May, according to an EU source, that  time is short  to deliver on hopes raised at an EU summit in October that sufficient progress would be made toward agreeing divorce terms this month that leaders would give a green light in mid-December to opening talks on the future relationship. The Union s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has said he needs to hear more from Britain on three key divorce conditions, including the financial settlement, by the start of next month if the EU is to be in a position for all 27 other national leaders to trigger the second phase at a summit on Dec. 14-15. EU officials have begun internal preparations to be able to launch trade negotiations after the summit, the source noted, but added:  Tusk will inform May that such a positive scenario is not a given, will require more work and that time is short.   And he will ask May how the UK plans to progress on the three key issues for Phase One.  May s spokesman described as  speculation  a newspaper report that she was planning to spend another 20 billion pounds (26 billion euros) to settle EU demands for Britain to pay its share of spending the EU has already agreed during British membership but will not actually pay out until after it leaves.  I would say it is yet more speculation,  he said.  We want to make progress as quickly as possible and we want to move onto talks about the future relationship as quickly as possible.  A further 26 billion euros would go a long way to meeting a demand that Brussels has put at around 60 billion euros. That is because May has already asked for a two-year transition period after Brexit in March 2019. That would bring in some 20 billion euros as Britain would go on contributing to the budget to retain its full membership of the European single market. A Merkel ally in Brussels, Manfred Weber, the German leader of the center-right bloc in the European Parliament, struck a notably upbeat tone after meeting May and other key British ministers in London on Tuesday. While insisting he had not heard concrete new proposals   that is not his role   he came away believing the British wanted to move toward a divorce deal.  My main message is I am more optimistic,  he told reporters.  There is progress.  As well as the Brexit  bill , Brussels also wants Britain to offer more in the way of rights for EU citizens living there and ensuring that its border with Ireland will remain unobstructed while also not creating a loophole in EU customs arrangements.

Libyans swap jewelry for medical treatment as crisis bites,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - In a square behind Libya s central bank, black market dealers, some of them armed, carry small plastic bags filled with dollars and larger ones with dinars in and out of one of many informal exchanges. Traders buy food and other goods from abroad at the official rate and sell them at the unofficial one, pocketing vast profits; others make equally large sums by smuggling out heavily subsidized fuel. In the back streets of the old city meanwhile, ordinary people have resorted to selling jewelry or dollars hidden at home as six years of post-dictatorship chaos take their toll.  I haven t been paid for four months,  said Fatima, 40, from the southern city of Sabha as she sold three small gold charms to pay for diabetes treatment for her sister, Hasina, who added:  We re helpless, there s nothing else we can do.  In other signs of rising poverty, elderly women beg motorists for cash on Tripoli s streets and families queue for charity food handouts. The U.N. estimated that about 1.3 million people in Libya need humanitarian assistance this year. Their situation took another turn for the worse in the past two weeks after the black market rate of the dinar, which has long languished at record lows, slid again, fuelling inflation that is already around 25-30 percent. The central bank blamed the audit bureau and the U.N.-backed government for restricting letters of credit that fund basic supplies to a divided country where a security vacuum and smuggling networks have destabilized the wider region. Officials had come across suspect requests - one to import tuna worth $120,000, more than the country consumes in a year, according to a Libyan entrepreneur who declined to be named, fearing retribution from Libya s powerful armed groups. Just $2.5 billion of an expected $7.4 billion of credit has been allocated, the trader said, helping knock the dinar from around 8.5 to 9.25 against the dollar on the black market. Its value has fallen by more than 600 percent since early 2014. The economy ministry was not immediately available for comment on a complex credit system that passes through commercial banks and where the audit bureau had documented earlier abuses and lack of oversight.  We re talking about an extremely bad economic and financial situation,  Central Bank Governor Sadiq al-Kabir said in a rare news conference on Tuesday.  Everyone, whether legislative or executive, holds responsibility equally.  Traders and economists say political uncertainty is a major factor weakening the currency, with U.N. talks to broker a deal between rival factions currently suspended. Libya is struggling to fund food imports and defend its foreign reserves, which the World Bank estimates will stand at $67.5 billion at the end of this year, compared to $123.5 billion in 2012. International experts say the only way to resolve the issue is to devalue the dinar from the official exchange rate of 1.37 to the dollar, but agreeing an economic strategy in a country dominated by armed factions with rival governments and no budgets is no simple task. A powerful or well-connected minority who are profiting from a flourishing shadow economy have little interest in change.      The central bank did not comment on devaluation, but economists and diplomats say the bank is reluctant to devalue without a policy plan in place to deal with the resulting shock. Libya managed this year to lift oil production to about 1 million barrels a day, but output is stuck well below the levels before the 2011 uprising that toppled Muammar Gaddafi. Revenues that normally account for about 80 percent of gross domestic product are largely used to pay salaries, including those of armed factions added to the state payroll for their role in the uprising. Subsidies include a $4 billion-plus annual fuel subsidy that is among the most generous in the world. Premiums on the official exchange rate and subsidized fuel make Libya  a criminal and terrorist cross-border funding paradise , said Husni Bey, chairman of HB Group, one of Libya s biggest private firms.  Most instability in Libya today is of a criminal nature... due to the lack of equitable exchange rate for the Libyan dinar and the subsidies that must be changed from goods to direct cash contributions.  Last year Libya spent around $26 billion, but earned just $6 billion.  This year we estimate that revenues should increase to around $14 billion, but spending will likely be more than double this,  said Mark Griffiths, Libya Mission Chief for the International Monetary Fund.  This is not sustainable.   The government has sought to reduce the public salary bill by 5 billion dinars annually, clamping down on abuse by removing some 100,000 people who had been claiming several salaries, according to a finance ministry report. Libyans became used to plentiful public jobs and state handouts as Gaddafi sought to buy loyalty like other Middle Eastern oil producers. Migrant workers used to do the manual work, now Libyans without contacts have taken their place. Salman Rashid, a public servant, said he had received just three months-worth of pay in the past year.  It s not enough for basic needs,  he said.  Now I work on construction sites and in buildings maintenance.  Entrepreneurs have withdrawn deposits from banks for fear of employees leaking word of them to kidnappers and others also prefer to keep money at home. In a second shop in the old city, a woman who gave her name as Karima was changing 500 euros.  I need to go to Tunis for surgery and am selling my foreign currency holdings,  she said.  Times are very difficult now.  Shop owner Salahedin Zarti, 52, said up to 10 people come in daily to sell necklaces, bracelets and rings.  In the beginning it was every day, but now I think people are starting to run out of jewelry,  he said. ",worldnews,"November 16, 2017 ",1
France says Saudi coalition must boost aid efforts to Yemen,"RIYADH (Reuters) - France s foreign minister on Thursday called on the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen to boost humanitarian efforts for the local civilian population who required  urgent  assistance.

U.N. states call for end to Myanmar military operations,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - A United Nations General Assembly committee on Thursday called on Myanmar to end military operations that have  led to the systematic violation and abuse of human rights  of Rohingya Muslims in the country s Rakhine state.  The move revived a U.N. resolution that was dropped last year due to the country s progress on human rights. The General Assembly s Third Committee, which focuses on human rights, voted 135 in favor, 10 against with 26 abstentions on the draft text that also asks U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to appoint a special envoy on Myanmar.  For 15 years the Third Committee annually adopted a resolution condemning Myanmar s human rights record, but last year the European Union did not put forward a draft text, citing progress under the leadership of Aung San Suu Kyi. However, in the past three months more than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh after the Myanmar military began an operation against Rohingya militants, who attacked 30 security posts and an army base in Rakhine state on Aug. 25. This prompted the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation to put forward a new draft U.N. resolution, which will now be formally adopted by the 193-member General Assembly next month. The resolution deepens international pressure, but has no legal consequences. Myanmar s army released a report on Monday denying all allegations of rapes and killings by security forces, days after replacing the general in charge of the military operation in Rakhine state. Top U.N. officials have denounced the violence as a classic example of ethnic cleansing. The Myanmar government has denied allegations of ethnic cleansing. Myanmar is refusing entry to a U.N. panel that was tasked with investigating allegations of abuses after a smaller military counteroffensive launched in October 2016. The draft resolution approved by the Third Committee on Thursday urges Myanmar to grant access. It also calls for full and unhindered humanitarian aid access and for Myanmar to grant full citizenship rights to Rohingya. They have been denied citizenship in Myanmar, where many Buddhists regard them as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. The 15-member U.N. Security Council last week urged the Myanmar government to  ensure no further excessive use of military force in Rakhine state.  It asked Guterres to report back in 30 days. Human Rights Watch accused Myanmar security forces on Thursday of committing widespread rape against women and girls, echoing an allegation by Pramila Patten, the U.N. special envoy on sexual violence in conflict, earlier this week. Patten said sexual violence was  being commanded, orchestrated and perpetrated by the Armed Forces of Myanmar.  ",worldnews,"November 16, 2017 ",1
Turkey 'appalled' by U.S. stance on IS withdrawal from Raqqa: ministry," (This November 15 story was corrected to clarify in paragraph three that not all people evacuated were fighters) ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey on Tuesday said it was appalled by the approach of the U.S. Department of Defense towards an agreement between the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia and Islamic State to withdraw Islamic State militants from the Syrian city of Raqqa. Last month, a YPG militia spokesman said that Syrian Islamic State fighters were set to abandon Raqqa in a withdrawal agreed with U.S.-backed Syrian militias. On Sunday, a report by the BBC said some 4,000 people, including hundreds of foreign nationals, had been evacuated from Raqqa as part of the agreement and spread across Syria and as far as Turkey.  Seeing that statements from the spokespeople of the international coalition against Islamic State and the U.S. Department of Defence have not denied the existence of the given agreement, but to the contrary said they  respected  it is appalling,  Turkey s Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Ankara has been infuriated with Washington over its support of the YPG militia, seen by Turks as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has fought a decades-long insurgency in Turkey and is designated a terrorist group by Ankara, the United States and European Union. The ministry said the withdrawal of Islamic State militants from Raqqa was  extremely troubling , and added that it was a development that  should be noted .   The agreement in question has become an example that if a battle is carried out with a terrorist organization, those terrorist organizations will eventually opt to cooperate with each other,  it said. After Raqqa s fall to the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in October, Syria s army declared victory over Islamic State last week, saying its capture of the jihadists  last town of Albu Kamal marked the collapse of their three-year, hardline reign in the region.

Ukraine investigators fear corruption cases could get buried,"KIEV (Reuters) - Ukrainian investigators fear corruption probes could get buried because the national anti-corruption bureau will soon be flooded by thousands of old cases and recently passed legislation could further hobble their work. Their comments spotlight Kiev s patchy record on fighting corruption, which has delayed billions in aid from international donors who have supported Ukraine since the 2014 Maidan protests brought pro-Western forces to power. They come after the NABU anti-corruption bureau launched an investigation this week into an allied crime-fighting agency over extortion allegations.  From Monday, 3,500 cases that were registered before December 2015 will be transferred from the prosecutor s office to NABU, which include for example investigations that may pertain to former Donald Trump campaign chief Paul Manafort. NABU began life in late 2015 and was given an exemption on investigating cases that opened before its creation, which expires on Monday. NABU wants the exemption extended, saying its 200-strong team of detectives cannot cope with the extra work.  In an interview with Reuters on Thursday, NABU spokeswoman Svitlana Olifira said there was a risk that  all current investigations by (NABU) detectives may be blocked . Serhii Horbatiuk, head of special investigations at the general prosecutor s office, said the old cases would be sent to NABU to ensure no-one looks at them. His investigations include two cases related to Manafort s work in Ukraine.   They will simply lie around and not be looked at,  he said in an interview at his office.  My opinion is that this is done deliberately to ensure that crimes linked to former senior officials are either simply not investigated, or obstacles are created that prevent it (the investigation).   The restructuring (of law enforcement) is being used to ensure investigations don t take place,  he added. Neither NABU nor Horbatiuk accused anyone by name of trying to block investigations.  NABU appealed to President Petro Poroshenko to veto legislation passed in October which it believes will also harm investigations.  The law, according to NABU, will put too strict limits on the time allowed for an investigation before it can be dismissed, while also making it more cumbersome for police to obtain permission from courts to open probes.  We urge the president to examine this bill thoroughly and to refrain from signing the current version,  Olifira said, saying the bill could  bring about the collapse of Ukraine s whole law enforcement system.  The president s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  ",worldnews,"November 16, 2017 ",1
"Wauquiez, tipped to lead French opposition, draws Europe battle lines","STRASBOURG, France (Reuters) - The man expected to become the leader of France s center-right set out his vision for a multi-speed Europe on Thursday, rejecting the deeper integration sought by President Emmanuel Macron. Speaking in Strasbourg, home to the European Parliament, Laurent Wauquiez said some European Union countries should be allowed to limit their commitment to the bloc to free trade, something that theoretically could allow Britain to re-engage. If the 42-year-old is elected next month to lead The Republicans, his challenge will be to rebuild a once-powerful party that was blown apart by Macron s presidential and parliamentary election triumphs. With Macron s fledgling Republic on the Move party dominating the center, Wauquiez is likely to take The Republicans to the right, fishing for support among eurosceptic National Front sympathizers. The Republicans have only 100 lawmakers in the 577-seat National Assembly, after others split to work more closely with Macron, but are the largest opposition group.  With 27 members, Europe isn t working. We have to do something,  Wauquiez told reporters. The EU should have a core of between six and 12 members states that would pursue closer cooperation on matters including tax harmonization and employment rights, he said.  Other members of the euro zone would form a second tier. Countries wanting only free trade would form a third tier, including Britain if it wanted.  I cannot accept that everyone seems to be congratulating themselves that Britain is leaving,  Wauquiez said. In September, Macron painted a sweeping vision for European renewal, calling for the EU to work more closely on defense and immigration and for the euro zone to have its own budget. Describing himself as a  committed European , Wauquiez rejected that as well as any plan to further enlarge the EU further.  Macron s big mistake is to pit French sovereignty against the European project ... to think we need more federalism. I on the other hand believe in a union of nation states,  Wauquiez told Le Figaro. Wauquiez served as the party s interim leader last year after former president Nicolas Sarkozy quit the post to contest the party primary for a second crack at the presidency. One Paris-based senior EU diplomat described him as a  tough politician  whose leadership of The Republicans would squeeze the political space open to the National Front. The National Front suffered its own bruising in the elections, with its leader Marine Le Pen trounced by Macron in the second round of the presidential vote and the party performing weakly in the parliamentary election. Le Pen has softened her anti-EU stance in past weeks as her far-right party, split by deep internal divisions over its view on Europe, seeks to reinvent itself.   ",worldnews,"November 16, 2017 ",1
Colombia's Senate approves peace tribunals for ex-rebels,"BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia s Senate has backed a law to regulate transitional justice under the country s peace deal with Marxist FARC rebels, including special tribunals that will try guerrilla leaders for war crimes.  The law, approved late on Wednesday, is considered the cornerstone of the agreement signed last year between the government and the FARC, known then as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. The measure still needs approval from the lower house of Congress, which is likely to vote on it early next week. The special courts will mete out alternative sentences like landmine removal for ex-guerrilla leaders who are convicted of war crimes. Under the peace deal, those convicted will not serve time in traditional jails. The law can also apply to members of the military and civilians who funded illegal groups like paramilitaries. Congress has until the end of the month to approve the law using the court-approved  fast-track  mechanism to reduce the number of required debates in an effort to implement the peace accord as quickly as possible. In a move that invigorated the previously slow debate in the Senate chamber, the nation s top court ruled this week that the majority of the law, including provisions that allow former rebels to participate in politics, is constitutional.  The court made several modifications however. A provision in the agreement prohibits extradition of former FARC members, but the ruling said that only applied to crimes that occurred before the deal. It said ex-rebels who commit crimes after demobilization would be subject to regular laws that include the possibility of extradition.  That did not sit well with the FARC, which is now officially a political party.  The extradition prohibition as it stands in the final accord is a right and not a benefit,  senior FARC member Ivan Marquez told journalists on Thursday.  Making the prohibition ineffectual constitutes a flagrant and very grave non-compliance with the deal.  Under the agreement the FARC will have 10 guaranteed seats in Congress until 2026. The group has already announced a slate of candidates for elections next year. ",worldnews,"November 16, 2017 ",1
Dublin hopeful Northern Ireland talks can resume in coming weeks,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - The Irish government is hopeful Northern Ireland s political parties will make a fresh attempt at restoring their devolved power-sharing government in the next few weeks, Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said on Thursday. The latest efforts to break a near year-long stalemate collapsed at the start of this month, prompting Britain to begin setting a budget for the province, a major step toward imposing direct rule from London for the first time in a decade.   Many in Northern Ireland fear direct rule would further destabilize a political balance between pro-British unionists and Irish nationalists that has already been upset by Britain s vote to leave the European Union.  I hope in the next few weeks we will be able to get back around the table. I think it is fair to say the parties are trying to move this forward and I hope the governments will be able to facilitate an agreement,  Coveney told parliament. Coveney helped facilitate the talks as Ireland is a co-guarantor of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement which ended 30 years of sectarian violence that killed 3,600 people. He said he still believes a deal is achievable. Irish Nationalists Sinn Fein and the pro-British Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) shared power for a decade until Sinn Fein pulled out of government in January, complaining it was not being treated as an equal partner. DUP leader Arlene Foster has said she hopes talks can resume soon while Sinn Fein has called for greater intervention from the governments in Dublin and London. Analysts say a fresh round of talks is unlikely to be contemplated before the DUP s annual conference on Nov. 25.  ",worldnews,"November 16, 2017 ",1
Italy's Berlusconi wins alimony case; ex-wife told to pay back millions,"MILAN (Reuters) - Silvio Berlusconi need no longer pay his ex-wife 1.4 million euros ($1.7 million) a month, an Italian court said on Thursday, ruling the former prime minister had been unfairly treated in a divorce settlement. The Milan appeals court also told Veronica Lario, a former actress, to hand back to Berlusconi alimony payments totaling some 60 million euros, saying she had no right to the money. The good news for the tycoon politician comes as his political career - considered dead and buried only a year ago - is also back on the rise. The Milan case follows a landmark ruling by Italy s top appeals court in May that said divorce settlements need not guarantee spouses their previous standard of living but rather ensure they were financially independent. Berlusconi, Italy s seventh richest man, according to Forbes, with a wealth estimated at about 7 billion euros, was married to Lario for more than 22 years.  They split in 2009, with the normally reserved Lario writing to Italy s national news agency to denounce her husband s interest in other women. Their divorce was formalized in 2014. Following their separation, Berlusconi was embroiled in scandals over his  bunga bunga  parties and convicted of paying to have sex with a 17-year-old minor. The verdict was later overturned when an appeals court said it could not be proved he knew she was underage. Berlusconi s partner of the last five years is Francesca Pascale, a former television show girl 49 years his junior. A court in 2012 initially awarded Lario alimony of three million euros a month. This was subsequently cut to 1.4 million, but Berlusconi complained it was still too high.

Refugee crisis influx no boon for German integration: study,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The wave of refugees that entered Germany in 2015-2016 has slowed its integration efforts, according to a study that also showed little progress since 2005 in leveling the playing field for immigrants on education, employment and incomes. At the height of Europe s migration crisis, Chancellor Angela Merkel adopted an open-borders policy that drew more than one million refugees into Germany in two years. In the prior decade, education opportunities picked up for newly arrived immigrants and people born in Germany with at least one foreign parent. But the Federal Statistics Office study released on Thursday found the education gap between those categories of migrants and native Germans had since widened again, with the proportion of the former lacking a high school certificate growing between 2014 and 2016. The scale of future immigration has become a major sticking point in three-party talks that Merkel is leading on the formation of a new coalition government, for which she has set an initial deadline of Thursday night. While Germany s unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest since the country s reunification in 1990, more immigrants were unemployed in 2016 than native Germans, the study said. In that year, 13.6 percent of immigrants and 6.2 percent of native Germans had low-paying jobs. Merkel s conservatives have proposed to the coalition talks that a suspension of reunifications between migrants and their family members outside Germany should be extended beyond a March 2018 deadline. Immigration expert Herbert Bruecker, a professor at the Berlin Integration and Migration Institute, said that would worsen the divide.   Our surveys show that people, who are living separated from their families, have a lower life satisfaction and also suffer more often from depression or bitterness,  he said.

U.S. Pacific Commander: Military-backed diplomacy needed to deal with North Korea,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Diplomacy backed by military power is needed to deal with North Korea s missile and nuclear development, the head of the U.S. military s Pacific Command said on Thursday. North Korea has launched dozens of missile tests under the leadership of Kim Jong Un as it accelerates a weapons program designed to give it the ability to target the United States with a nuclear-tipped missile. In recent months, it has fired two missiles over Japan and conducted its sixth and largest nuclear bomb test, stoking regional tension.  Clearly, while diplomacy must be the main effort with North Korea, it has to be diplomacy backed by credible military power,  Admiral Harry Harris said in Japan at the beginning of a meeting with Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera. U.S. President Donald Trump visited China this month seeking its help to rein in North Korea and a senior Chinese diplomat will visit the North from Friday.  China is sending an Envoy and Delegation to North Korea - A big move, we ll see what happens!  Trump wrote on Twitter on Thursday. China has repeatedly pushed for a diplomatic solution to the crisis, but in recent months it has had only limited high-level exchanges with North Korea. The last time China s special envoy for North Korea visited the country was in February last year. On Thursday, China said a  dual suspension  proposal   under which the United States and South Korea would stop major military exercises in exchange for North Korea halting its weapons programs   was the best way forward. Japan s Onodera told Harris that he believed a recent joint military exercise involving Japanese forces and three U.S. aircraft carriers had sent a  very strong message  to North Korea. Harris separately told Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that the joint exercise in the Sea of Japan during Trump s visit to the region was  an example of how our militaries work together . Two Indian warships also took part. ",worldnews,"November 16, 2017 ",1
World Bank approves $150 million to restore services in Yemeni cities,"GENEVA (Reuters) - The World Bank agreed on Thursday to grant war-torn Yemen $150 million to help some of its hardest-hit cities restore basic services and fight a cholera epidemic. An agreement signed by a World Bank official and the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) is funded by the International Development Association (IDA), the World Bank s fund for the world s poorest countries.   The new project will target issues like uncollected trash and untreated sewage water ... and also address access to electricity for critical services and urgent needs for road repair to improve mobility and access,  a statement issued by the UNOPS said. Civil war broke out in Yemen in March 2015, between the Iran-aligned Houthis and the Saudi-backed government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. The agreement covers the Houthi-controlled capital Sanaa and the Red Sea port city of Hodeidah as well as the southern port city of Aden, the temporary capital of Hadi s government. Some 900,000 suspected cholera cases have been recorded in the past seven months, including 2,200 deaths.  The heads of three U.N. agencies issued a fresh plea on Thursday for the Saudi-led military coalition to lift its blockade on Yemen, saying that without aid shipments  untold thousands of innocent victims, among them many children, will die . One million children are at risk from a diphtheria outbreak and millions threatened by hunger, the heads of the World Food Programme, UNICEF and the World Health Organization said in the joint statement.

"Mattis sees opportunity for talks if North Korea halts missile tests, development","COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Thursday there could be an opportunity for talks between North Korea and the United States if Pyongyang stopped testing and developing its nuclear and missile programs.  So long as they stop testing, stop developing, they don t export their weapons, there would be opportunity for talks,  Mattis told reporters on a military plane. While Washington has said that all options, including military, are on the table in dealing with North Korea, it has stressed its preference is for a diplomatic solution. Visiting Seoul last week, U.S. President Donald Trump warned North Korea he was prepared to use the full range of American military power to stop any attack, but also urged Pyongyang to  make a deal.   Trump, who had previously called negotiations with North Korea a waste of time, has offered no clear path to talks. Pyongyang has made clear it has little interest in negotiations, at least until it has developed a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland. The last North Korean missile test was carried out almost two months ago, but U.S. officials say they have seen no signs that Pyongyang has stopped development. Mattis said the U.S. military was closely watching why there had been no missile launches recently, but declined to give potential reasons for it.  There are concerns in South Korea that any potential U.S. strikes against North Korea s nuclear and missile programs could provoke devastating North Korean retaliation against South Korea. Earlier this week, a senior South Korean official said Trump should  under no circumstances  take military action against North Korea without the consent of the government in Seoul. In Colorado, Mattis will visit the U.S. Northern Command and the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), which are responsible for homeland defense, including tracking and potentially intercepting North Korean missiles.

French military says coalition opposed IS withdrawal from Raqqa,"PARIS (Reuters) - France s military said on Thursday the coalition battling Islamic State in Syria had opposed a deal allowing fighters of the militant group to withdraw from their former bastion of Raqqa. The coalition had also been unable to launch air strikes against the fighters because they had mingled with civilians, French army spokesman Patrik Steiger said. A report by BBC television on Sunday said some 4,000 people, including hundreds of foreign nationals, had been evacuated from Raqqa as part of the agreement and spread across Syria and as far as Turkey. Ankara on Tuesday said it was appalled by the approach of the U.S. Department of Defense toward the agreement, struck between the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF)   a U.S.-backed alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias   and Islamic State.  The coalition was not ... for this agreement which enabled Islamic State terrorists to escape without being chased,  Steiger told reporters in a weekly briefing.   It (the convoy) was monitored by drones, (but) the terrorists were mixed in with the population which prevented air strikes being carried out.  France has contributed to strikes against the jihadist group in Syria and has special forces operating in the Raqqa region. Coordinated attacks planned by militants in Raqqa in Paris in November 2015 were the deadliest on French soil since World War Two, killing more 130 people.  With Islamic State losing ground in Iraq and Syria, hundreds of French citizens belonging to Islamic State - and in some cases their children - have started to return to France, officials there say. The BBC report showed one witness claiming that French jihadis were among those allowed to leave Raqqa in mid-October and one suspected militant was recorded saying some French fighters  were heading back to France to carry out attacks.  At the time an SDF spokesman said 275 Syrian militants left along with their family members, but denied foreign fighters had also left. Seeking to allay concerns, French Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said on Wednesday the threat of an attack was no greater than over the last two years and security services were either arresting or monitoring all those who returned to France.  About 400 men, women and children had returned so far.  There is no massive return. We think that 700 people are still in the zone,  he said, referring to French nationals or those who had resided in the country in the past.  (This version of the story corrects paragraph three to clarify people, not fighters evacuated) ",worldnews,"November 16, 2017 ",1
Israeli army chief says ready to share information with Saudi Arabia,"DUBAI (Reuters) - The Israeli army s chief of staff told an Arabic language online newspaper that Israel was ready to share  intelligence information  with Saudi Arabia, saying their countries had a common interest in standing up to Iran. Lieutenant General Gadi Eizenkot told the privately Saudi-owned Elaph in what it said was his first interview with an Arabic newspaper that Israel had no plans to attack Lebanon s Hezbollah group. Saudi Arabia has ratcheted up pressure on arch-foe Iran, accusing Tehran of trying to expand its influence in Arab countries, often through proxies including the Lebanese Shi ite Hezbollah group. Increased tension between Tehran and Riyadh has fueled speculation that shared interests may push Saudi Arabia and Israel to working together against what they see as a common Iranian threat. Saudi Arabia maintains that any relations with Israel hinge on Israeli withdrawal from Arab lands occupied in the 1967 Middle East war.  Asked if Israel had shared any information with Saudi Arabia, Eizenkot said:  We are ready to share information if necessary. There are many shared interests between us.  He said U.S. President Donald Trump s election on a platform that calls for increasing pressure on Iran has provided an opportunity for new alliances in the Middle East. Both Saudi Arabia and Israel view Iran as a main threat to the Middle East.   A major and general strategic plan must be prepared to stop the Iranian danger, and we are ready to exchange expertise with moderate Arab states and exchange intelligence information to face Iran,  he said, according to Elaph, which said the interview was conducted at Eizenkot s office in Tel Aviv by an Israeli Arab journalist. Earlier this month, Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri announced his resignation in a surprise move that had plunged Lebanon into a new political crisis. Hariri s resignation thrust Lebanon into the front line of a regional struggle between Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shi ite Iran that has also buffeted Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Bahrain. It also raised speculation about possible military action against Lebanon by Israel, which sees Hezbollah as a strategic threat. Responding to a question on speculation that Israel may launch a military operation against Hezbollah, Eizenkot said:  We do not have any intention initiating any offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon and reaching a (state of) war. But we will not accept a strategic threat against Israel.  ",worldnews,"November 16, 2017 ",1
Kenya court to rule on presidential election cases on Monday,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya s Supreme Court will rule on Monday on cases that seek to nullify the re-election of President Uhuru Kenyatta last month and the judges could order a fresh vote or clear the way for the incumbent to be sworn in for a second term. The two cases appear to represent a final chance for legal scrutiny of the Oct. 26 election and the ruling could end a protracted political crisis in which more than 60 people have been killed. Kenya is a hub for trade, diplomacy and security in East Africa.  We will deliver judgment on the 20th,  Chief Justice David Maraga told lawyers at the end of a hearing on Thursday. Kenyatta defeated opposition leader Raila Odinga in August but Odinga challenged the election and the court voided it citing procedural irregularities and ordered a fresh vote. The court s decision was the first of its kind in Africa. Odinga boycotted last month s poll, saying the election commission had failed to carry out sufficient reforms. Kenyatta won with 98 percent of the vote. Lawyers for the petitioners, a former lawmaker and two human rights activists, urged the court to nullify the repeat poll due to a lack of fresh nominations for candidates and violence in some areas that prevented voting. Their counterparts for the election board, its chairman and Kenyatta, rejected the petition and urged the court to uphold the result to help end a crisis that has hurt the economy. The Supreme Court was created by a 2010 constitution that followed a crisis over a disputed election in 2007 in which around 1,200 people were killed in ethnic clashes. Analysts said the September ruling by the Supreme Court could embolden other judiciaries in Africa. This month, Liberia s Supreme Court halted a presidential run-off until the election board investigates claims of fraud in the first round of voting. ",worldnews,"November 16, 2017 ",1
U.S.-backed Syria forces say Turkey pressured commander into defecting,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - The U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a leading combatant against Islamic State, on Thursday accused Turkey of pressuring one of its senior commanders into defecting.   Rebel officials said on Wednesday Brigadier General Talal Silo had defected, without giving a reason. It would be the first such departure from the SDF s top ranks. There was no comment from Turkey, which backs Syrian rebel factions and views the SDF, spearheaded by the Kurdish YPG militia, as a security threat.  Silo served as a spokesman for the SDF, an alliance of mostly Kurdish and Arab militias battling Islamic State in Syria with the help of the U.S.-led coalition. The SDF said in a statement they had  lost contact  with Silo, who had resigned from his post.   General Talal Silo was respected and appreciated among our ranks,  it said.  He was subjected to a lot of pressure and extortion from the side of the Turkish state, that amounted at some points to threatening his sons who are in Turkey.   We believe his disappearance is the result of a special operation by Turkish intelligence in collusion with some of his family members.   Kurdish fighters, alongside Arab allies, U.S. advisers and coalition air strikes, have driven Islamic State from swathes of territory including its former headquarters in Raqqa city. The YPG and its allies have carved out autonomous cantons in the north, and now control nearly a quarter of Syria. Their influence angers neighboring Turkey, which considers the YPG an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers  Party, which has fought a decades-long insurgency on Turkish soil. The U.S.-led coalition had said it was  aware of reports of Talal Silo s apparent departure from the SDF, but have no further details on his current status at this time .  Our forces will not be affected by this incident, and we will inform the public of the results of our investigation,  the SDF said on Thursday.  ",worldnews,"November 16, 2017 ",1
Russia names nine U.S.-backed news outlets likely to be labeled 'foreign agents',"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia on Thursday named nine U.S. government-sponsored news outlets likely to be labeled  foreign agents  under a new law  that is being rushed through parliament in response to what Moscow says is unacceptable U.S. pressure on Russian media. Russia s lower house of parliament approved the law - allowing Moscow to force foreign media to brand news they provide to Russians as the work of  foreign agents  and to disclose their funding sources - on Wednesday. The legislation needs approval from the upper house of parliament, which is likely to happen next week, and the signature of President Vladimir Putin before it becomes law. The Russian Justice Ministry on Thursday published a list of nine U.S.-backed news outlets that it said could be affected by the changes, which it said in a statement on its website were likely to become law  in the near future.  It said it had written to the U.S. government-sponsored Voice of America (VOA) and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), along with seven separate Russian or local-language news outlets run by RFE/RL. One of the seven outlets provides news on Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, one on Siberia, and one on the predominantly Muslim North Caucasus region. Another covers provincial Russia, one is an online TV station, another covers the mostly Muslim region of Tatarstan, and the other is a news portal that fact-checks the statements of Russian officials. Russia s broadside against U.S. media is part of the fallout from allegations that the Kremlin interfered in the U.S. presidential election last year in favor of Donald Trump. U.S. intelligence officials accuse the Kremlin of using Russian media organizations it finances to influence U.S. voters, and this week Washington required Russian state broadcaster RT to register a U.S.-based affiliate company as a  foreign agent .  The Kremlin denies meddling in the election and has said the restrictions on Russian broadcasters in the United States amount to an attack on free speech. The new media law in Russia is retaliation, it says.  The draft legislation states that Russian authorities can designate foreign media as  foreign agents , making them subject to the same requirements that are applied to foreign-funded non-governmental organizations under a 2012 law. Under that law,  foreign agents  must include in any information they publish or broadcast to Russian audiences a mention of their  foreign agent  designation. They also must apply for inclusion in a government register, submit regular reports on their sources of funding, on their objectives, on how they spend their money, and who their managers are. They can be subject to spot checks by the authorities to make sure they comply with the rules, according to the 2012 law, which has forced some NGOs to close. RFE/RL said in a statement it did not want to speculate what steps Russia might take against it next, and looked forward to continuing its journalistic work. VOA Director Amanda Bennett has said the station remains committed to providing independent news to global audiences. ",worldnews,"November 16, 2017 ",1

Saudi foreign minister says message to Iran is: 'enough is enough',"RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia s Foreign Minister Adel Jubeir said on Thursday the kingdom s actions in the Middle East were a response to what he called the  aggression  of Iran. Long-standing arch-rivals, Riyadh and Tehran are waging a contest for power on several fronts across the region, notably in Yemen and Lebanon.  Any way you look at it, they (the Iranians) are the ones who are acting in an aggressive manner. We are reacting to that aggression and saying,  Enough is enough. We re not going to let you do this anymore , Jubeir told Reuters in an interview. He said Saudi Arabia was consulting its allies about what leverage to use against Lebanese Shi ite militant group Hezbollah   an Iranian ally   to end its dominance in the small Mediterranean nation and intervention in other countries.  We will make the decision when the time comes,  he said, declining to detail what options were under consideration. Jubeir said Hezbollah, which he described as a subsidiary of Iran s Revolutionary Guard, must disarm and become a political party for Lebanon to stabilize.  Whenever we see a problem, we see Hezbollah act as an arm or agent of Iran and this has to come to an end,  he said after meeting his French counterpart in Riyadh. Saad al-Hariri, a Saudi ally, resigned as Lebanon s prime minister on Nov. 4, citing an assassination plot and accusing Iran and Hezbollah of sowing strife in the region.  In Yemen, where Saudi Arabia is involved in a two-year-old war and has been criticized for blocking humanitarian aid, Jubeir accused the Iran-aligned Houthis of besieging civilian areas and preventing supplies from coming in or out.  That s why you have the starvation that s taking place in Yemen and people need to do a more serious job of holding Houthis accountable for this,  he said. Jubeir said domestic anti-corruption investigations which have netted senior princes, officials and businessmen in the past two weeks were ongoing.",worldnews,"November 16, 2017 ",1
Britain preparing to transfer 400 million pounds to Iran - Telegraph newspaper,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain is preparing to transfer over 400 million pounds ($527 million) to Iran as it seeks the release of a jailed Iranian-British aid worker, The Telegraph newspaper reported, citing unidentified British sources. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, was sentenced to five years after being convicted by an Iranian court of plotting to overthrow the clerical establishment. She denies the charges. Britain has sought legal advice over whether it could transfer the funds which it owes as a result of a disputed arms deal in the 1970s.

Iran factions use earthquake relief effort to pursue power struggle,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Political infighting among Iran s ruling elite has moved on to a new battleground - the relief effort after an earthquake that killed at least 530 people and injured thousands. Hardline media are accusing the government of pragmatist President Hassan Rouhani of reacting too slowly to last weekend s quake, while highlighting aid work by the Revolutionary Guards - a rival power center. While the government said enough help had been sent to the thousands of people left homeless by the devastation, media affiliated to Rouhani s hardline rivals painted a different picture with reports from villages where survivors complained about a lack of shelter from the bitter cold. Rouhani allies say this reflects a long-running struggle between the president and those who oppose his drive to boost the economy by improving relations with the outside world, notably through sealing a nuclear deal with world powers.  Rouhani is very popular,  one Rouhani ally told Reuters.  It is so sad to see that even under these sad circumstances when we need unity, they are attacking his government and trying to say that the government is incompetent to help people.  Shortly after the magnitude 7.3 quake, Iran s worst in more than a decade, state TV aired scenes from the devastated villages in the western Kermanshah province.  Iran has so far declined offers of foreign assistance, saying planeloads of tents, blankets, mattresses and emergency food rations had arrived in areas where at least 30,000 houses have been damaged and several villages completely destroyed.  The hardline semi-official Tasnim and Fars news agencies both carried reports of the role of the Revolutionary Guards - an elite force loyal to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei - and its affiliated Basij militia force in helping the survivors. Khamenei has called on the state agencies to speed up their efforts.  This disaster is a test for authorities to perform their duties,  he said on Tuesday. His representative, cleric Abdolhossein Moezi, told state TV after visiting Kermanshah province that more relief was needed. Editorials in hardline newspapers adopted a sharp tone, accusing the government of failing to learn the lessons of the Bam earthquake in 2003, in which 31,000 people were killed.  State TV covered how the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) had restored some degree of normality in one of the worst hit towns, Sarpol-e Zahab.  Immediately after the quake, the IRGC rushed to the area to help,  said Brigadier General Hossein Salami, deputy head of the Guards.  We set up shelters, field clinics ... We will not leave until all survivors have a permanent shelter. Our commanders have been working around the clock.  Commanders of the IRGC, which also runs a business empire in Iran, have repeatedly criticized Rouhani s failure to improve the economy despite the official lifting last year of most international sanctions under the 2015 nuclear deal.  In some areas, no building was left standing, elsewhere, survivors have left homes that remain standing, fearing they could come crashing down due to aftershocks. Houses in poor Iranian villages are often made of concrete blocks or mudbrick that can quickly crumble and collapse. Many of the heavily damaged buildings in Sarpol-e Zahab were part of an affordable housing scheme, initiated in 2011 by Rouhani s hardline predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.  Angry survivors said the low-quality construction in the Mehr scheme had caused the high death toll in the town, nestled in the Zagros Mountains along the border with Iraq. Rouhani has ordered an investigation.  It s clear there has been corruption in construction contracts,  he told a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, state media reported.  Anyone responsible will be punished.  Ahmadinejad s adviser Ali Akbar Javanfekr denounced the accusations.  Heavy waves of propaganda against Mehr are aimed at covering up the weakness and inefficiency of the (Rouhani) administration in helping quake-hit people,  he said. Major towns and cities in the Kermanshah province appeared to have escaped heavy damage, witnesses said, while many villages were destroyed.   My mother told me to buy yogurt for dinner .... As soon as I left the house everything started to collapse,  13-year-old   Dozan told Reuters by telephone from Sarpol-e Zahab.  I ran back but my parents and sisters were dead - only rubble and dust and no home.   Rouhani has promised more help and low-interest loans to survivors to rebuild their collapsed homes. State TV showed Iranians around the country gathering goods and warm clothes and blankets for the survivors.  We need shelter ... it is getting colder. They have distributed some tents but it was not enough,  Ahmad Irandust, 75, told Reuters from Salas Babajani village by telephone. He said his children have slept outdoor in the freezing cold since Sunday.  Don t leave us alone. Don t forget us.   ",worldnews,"November 16, 2017 ",1
French president's party hit by defections as it picks leader,"PARIS (Reuters) - A revolt by 100 members of French President Emmanuel Macron s governing party has exposed tensions in the fledgling movement as it prepares to elect a leader handpicked by him on Saturday. Created about 18 months ago when Macron was still relatively unknown, En Marche s membership has risen quickly to 360,000   membership is free   but retaining members could be harder as his popularity has waned following his rise to power. The activists who quit this week said the party that helped Macron, a centrist, triumph in this year s presidential election and then won a parliamentary majority had become less open and lost its appeal as a movement that would do things differently. The number of defectors is small, and none is a lawmaker, but their complaints underline the challenges 51-year old government spokesman Christophe Castaner will face as party chief.  We need to reinvent our political movement,  Castaner, the only candidate, told party members ahead of Saturday s party congress.  That is key to accompany the reforms carried out by the government and parliament.  A Socialist for about three decades until he backed Macron s election bid, and a former lawmaker from southeastern France, Castaner will aim to change what opinion polls show is Macron s image of a  president of the rich.  He will also set out to transform En Marche (LREM) into a more established party with the strength and depth required to compete in the next local and national elections.  The next ballot, for the European Parliament, is in 2019 and local elections will be in 2020 at the earliest.   Although mocked as an empty shell by rivals from long established parties, En Marche attracted many newcomers to politics and quickly proved effective in propelling the former economy minister of Socialist President Francois Hollande into the presidency. Supporters set up more than 3,000 local committees across France in the months leading to the presidential election, helping make up for Macron s disadvantage of not having an army of elected officials to promote his candidacy. But some of those who joined En Marche with high hopes now say there is a lack of democracy in the party.  Castaner s election shows an autocratic way of doing things,  said Tiphaine Beaulieu, one of the members who quit this week and issued a strongly worded statement condemning what En Marche has become. Complaining that Castaner is the only leadership candidate, she said arrogance and a lack of democracy were now features of how the party worked.  Opposition parties have also criticized En Marche, and taken Macron to task over the fact that Castaner may keep his role as junior minister for relations with parliament when he becomes party chief.    So the new world according to Macron is choosing (your party leader) alone in your Elysee office,  Socialist lawmaker Luc Carvounas wrote on Twitter, referring to the president s official residence, the Elysee Palace in Paris. Forty-eight percent of voters trust Macron with pursuing the right policies for France, a Harris Interactive poll showed last month, a drop from 57 percent in the same survey when he was elected in May. En Marche officials say that over the last six months, En Marche has gained about 160,000 new members, so the loss of 100 activists is not a significant number.  Once the euphoria of victory has passed, it is quite normal that some may have the blues a bit,  said Laurent Saint-Martin, a 32-year old lawmaker who was not involved in politics before he joined LREM.  But activists are still here. The question is simply how we work together,  he said.  The party was built for the presidential and parliamentary election, many have left to become lawmakers or work in government, so it is normal that we should reconstruct it.

Hanson's 'battler bus' takes the anti-immigrant road in Australia,"TOWNSVILLE, Australia (Reuters) - It was early morning last Thursday when Pauline Hanson s rented  battler  bus started hissing so loudly the election campaign was halted at a petrol station on a stretch of desolate highway near a remote edge of Australia. Unable to get to the rural Queensland state voters she is relying on to deliver her anti-immigration One Nation party its best result in two decades, her supporters came to her. Stranded near the gemstone-mine town of Marlborough, with a population of just a few hundred, Hanson was approached by truckers and travelers, most seeking to get a picture taken with her.  I was actually stopping to get something to eat, and as I was looking across I went,  Oh there s the  battler  bus, I ll have to go say hello to Pauline,  said truck driver Shane Williams, who came over to look at the engine.  I think immigration is a big thing for everybody. I think it s going to be a good thing if Pauline gets some say in parliament   keep the bastards honest.  Hanson is not a candidate in the Queensland state election on Nov. 25, having last year re-entered the federal parliament on a wave of popular support after a near two-decade absence.   But her face is on almost every One Nation party billboard and flyer in Queensland s coal-rich and sugar cane-growing heartland, turning the vote into a test of whether Hanson s resurgence continues, or is pushed back to the fringes.     To Australia s most prominent right-wing nationalist it s not about joining a global populist push; it s that the rest of the world is finally catching up.  I was espousing a lot of this 20 years ago,  Hanson told Reuters in the sunny tropical town of Townsville, a gateway to the Great Barrier Reef marine park.  U.S. President Donald Trump s election victory a year ago, however,  is resonating across the world,  she added.  This is definitely the start. People are starting to wake up. You see people had no one else really to vote for.       With its blown turbo hose fixed, Hanson s bus rolled down the road, three hours behind schedule, stopping at several towns before arriving at a town hall-style event that evening more than 400 kilometers (249 miles) away. Hanson s town halls are a mix of stump speech and off-the-cuff observations, usually involving  battler  stories she s heard from locals on the campaign trail: Claims that foreigners are buying up agricultural land and immigrants are not paying taxes; complaints about crippling energy prices and government handouts to Aboriginals; support for a ban on Muslim migrants. Hanson s rhetoric can be blunt, and draws almost instant condemnation in the cities, where she s often viewed as extreme. But in her rural heartland, where one town can be in drought while another gets hit by cyclonic floods, she is the mainstream.   She s the only one trying to save our country really,  said 20-year-old Jack Roach in Proserpine, a sugar-cane town of 3,500 in Queensland. Polls suggest One Nation might take around 20 percent of the popular vote in Queensland, Australia s third-most populous state, and situated in the northeast. That would mark its biggest electoral success since the 1990s. It s unclear, however, whether that will translate into more than a handful of seats among the 93 parliamentary seats at stake in the election. On the hustings, support appears very strong in towns beyond the black stump - a colloquial term in Australia to describe remote areas - as well as coal-producing areas and sugar cane fields. More vigorous opposition to Hanson s policies comes from more tourist-dependent coastal areas.     To her supporters, Hanson is the plain-speaking, anti-politician who can shake up the Liberal-National and Labor political establishment in Australia.  She speaks like us,  said 24-year-old carpenter Brodie Tophan, who works south of the coastal town of Bowen and approached Hanson for a  selfie .  People call us racist, but we are just telling it like it is.  Australia s modern far right movement was born in 1996 in the city of Ipswich, an inland river port and former coal mining center in Queensland, where Hanson made an unlikely but successful run for political office while managing a fish and chip shop. After using her maiden speech in parliament to warn the country would be  swamped by Asians , she co-founded the One Nation party. It enjoyed early electoral success, before imploding over infighting. The party power struggle and Hanson s 11-week imprisonment for electoral fraud in 2003 - eventually quashed - halted her momentum, and she spent years struggling to regain her once formidable connection to voters. Labor parliamentarian Jennifer Howard, who is contesting the seat of Ipswich, said the mainly white area that fostered Hanson s rise in the 1990s has given way to a more diverse population that will hinder One Nation s success. Howard said she used to take her children to Hanson s shop in the late 1980s.  My daughter used to say to me,  Why is that lady always so angry?  Hanson s rage against her political foes looks likely to continue until a better advocate of her nationalist policies emerges. That is yet to happen, with past changes to the party leadership proving unsuccessful, and newer right-wing parties  unable to attract anywhere near Hanson s popular support. Moreover, an overtly anti-immigration party is swimming against the demographic tide: Census data shows one-in-three Australians today were born overseas, compared to one-in-five  20 years ago. That s evident even at Hanson s old fish and chip shop, now run by Vietnamese immigrant Thanh Huynh, who described her as  interesting  without disclosing who she would vote for. The shop s menu offers most of the same items Hanson used to make, including dagwood dogs - or corn dogs - but has some imported ideas, including Vietnamese spring rolls.

Zimbabwe's Tsvangirai calls on Mugabe to resign,"HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai said on Thursday President Robert Mugabe should resign in the interest of the country after the military seized power. Mugabe is insisting he remains Zimbabwe s only legitimate ruler and has balked at mediation by a Catholic priest to allow the 93-year-old former guerrilla a graceful exit after a military coup, sources said on Thursday.  In the interest of the people, Mr. Robert Mugabe must resign and step down immediately,  Tsvangirai, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change, told a news conference, reading from a statement.

Turkey detains 136 for suspected ties to coup plotters: agency,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey detained 136 people, including former police, teachers and soldiers, in four separate operations on Thursday over suspected links to last year s attempted military coup, the state-run Anadolu news agency said. Authorities detained 60 former security officials in the operation centered in the capital Ankara and spread over 30 provinces, Anadolu said. In a separate operation that began on Wednesday and centered on Diyarbakir and spread over 26 other provinces, 55 soldiers were detained, Anadolu said. Officials were still searching for one more suspect. Six others were detained in the northern provinces of Samsun and Karabuk, as well as 15 teachers in Ankara, Anadolu said. The suspects were alleged to be using the encrypted messaging app, ByLock, which the government says was used by the network of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen. Ankara blames Gulen, for orchestrating the failed coup in July 2016. Gulen has denied involvement and denounced the putsch. More than 50,000 people, including police, military personnel and civil servants, have been jailed pending trial in the aftermath of the July 2016 coup. Some 150,000 people were sacked or suspended. The crackdown has alarmed Turkey s Western allies and rights groups, who say President Tayyip Erdogan is using the coup as a pretext to muzzle dissent. The government says the measures, taken under emergency rule that was imposed after the coup, are necessary due to the security threats Turkey faces. ",worldnews,"November 16, 2017 ",1

Italy's PD drops fast in polls after Sicily flop,"ROME (Reuters) - Italy s ruling Democratic Party (PD) has lost support following its flop in a regional election in Sicily, while Silvio Berlusconi s Forza Italia (Go Italy!) has gained ground, according to a poll released on Thursday. National elections must be held by next May, with all recent opinion polls suggesting that it will end in a hung parliament. IXE pollsters said backing for the center-left PD, which is led by former prime minister Matteo Renzi, dropped to 23.8 percent, down 3.6 percentage points from its last survey in mid-October. The PD slump enabled the maverick 5-Star Movement to establish itself firmly as Italy s most popular party, climbing to 27.9 percent from a previous 27.2 percent. Forza Italia moved into third spot, rising to 15.5 percent from 13.6 percent and jumping ahead of its long-time ally, the far-right Northern League, which dropped 1.6 percentage points to 13.5 percent. Under the terms of an electoral law approved last month, which allows the creation of multi-party coalitions ahead of the national elections, the center-right bloc is expected to emerge from the ballot box as the biggest single force. The bloc won a regional vote in Sicily on Nov. 5, with the victory seen as a personal triumph for Berlusconi, who used the ballot to revive his political career after years of graft trials, sex scandals and ill-health. The 5-Star came second on the Mediterranean island, with the PD limping in a distant third. Renzi s party has been beset by feuding and looks unlikely to reach any pre-election pact with myriad leftist groups, which have accused him of pushing the PD too far to the left. The IXE poll suggested the center-right would take a combined 33.8 percent of the vote. The bloc leaders have said whichever party wins the most votes will decide who should be its prime ministerial candidate. ",worldnews,"November 16, 2017 ",1
"Zimbabwe's army seizes power, Mugabe confined but ""safe""","HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe s military seized power on Wednesday saying it was holding President Robert Mugabe and his family safe while targeting  criminals  in the entourage of the man who has ruled the nation since independence 37 years ago. Soldiers seized the state broadcaster and a general appeared on television to announce the takeover. Armored vehicles blocked roads to the main government offices, parliament and the courts in central Harare, while taxis ferried commuters to work nearby. The atmosphere in the capital remained calm. In his first contact with the outside world since the takeover, Mugabe spoke by telephone to the president of South Africa, Jacob Zuma, and told him he was confined to his home but fine, the South African presidency said in a statement. It was not clear whether the apparent military coup would bring a formal end to the 93-year-old Mugabe s rule; the main goal of the generals appeared to be preventing Mugabe s wife Grace, 41 years his junior, from succeeding him. But whether or not he goes, it may mark the end of the country s dominance by Mugabe, the last of Africa s state founders still in power from the era of the struggle against colonialism, and one of the continent s most polarizing figures. Mugabe, still seen by many Africans as a liberation hero, is reviled in the West as a despot whose disastrous handling of the economy and willingness to resort to violence to maintain power destroyed one of Africa s most promising states. He plunged Zimbabwe into a fresh political crisis last week by firing his vice president and presumed successor. The generals believed that move was aimed at clearing a path for Grace Mugabe to take over and announced on Monday they were prepared to  step in  if purges of their allies did not end.  We are only targeting criminals around him (Mugabe) who are committing crimes that are causing social and economic suffering in the country in order to bring them to justice,  Major General SB Moyo, Chief of Staff Logistics, said on television.  As soon as we have accomplished our mission, we expect that the situation will return to normalcy.  In a sign Grace Mugabe s allies were coming under pressure, the head of the ruling party s youth wing, Kudzanai Chipanga, appeared on state TV on Wednesday evening to apologize for comments he had made criticizing the army a day earlier. He said he was speaking voluntarily. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, the African Union and Western countries called for calm.  South Africa s defense and state security ministers flew into Harare to try to arrange talks between Mugabe and the generals, South African media reported without going into further details.  We cannot tell how developments in Zimbabwe will play out in the days ahead and we do not know whether this marks the downfall of Mugabe or not,  British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told parliament.  We will do all we can, with our international partners, to ensure this provides a genuine opportunity for all Zimbabweans to decide their future.  Finance Minister Ignatius Chombo, a leading member of the ruling party s  G40  faction, led by Grace Mugabe, had been detained by the military, a government source said.     By Wednesday afternoon it was business as usual in Harare s suburbs while there was less traffic than normal in the city center. Residents spoke in awe of events that had previously seemed unthinkable.  I don t support the army but I am happy to see Mugabe gone, maybe this country can start to develop again,  said Rumbi Katepfu, preparing to shut her mobile phone shop early in downtown Harare.  I did not think this would ever happen... We used to think Mugabe and Grace were invincible.  As evening fell there were fewer people on the streets than usual. In one park, a lone couple shared a chocolate bar, seemingly unconcerned by the presence of troops.  What s there to fear? This is a free country,  said Nathan Mpariwa, stroking the hand of his partner. Tanks blocked roads after dark and soldiers with automatic weapons kept up their patrols, but made no effort to stop people streaming home from work. Whatever the final outcome, the events could signal a once-in-a-generation change for the southern African nation, once a regional bread-basket, reduced to destitution by an economic crisis Mugabe s opponents have long blamed on him. Even many of Mugabe s most loyal supporters had come to oppose the rise of his wife, who courted the powerful youth wing of the ruling party but alienated the military, led by Mugabe s former guerrilla comrades from the 1970s independence struggle.  This is a correction of a state that was careening off the cliff,  Chris Mutsvangwa, the leader of the liberation war veterans, told Reuters.  It s the end of a very painful and sad chapter in the history of a young nation, in which a dictator, as he became old, surrendered his court to a gang of thieves around his wife.  The opposition Movement for Democratic Change called for a peaceful return to constitutional democracy, adding it hoped the military intervention would lead to the  establishment of a stable, democratic and progressive nation state .  Zuma - speaking on behalf of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) - expressed hope there would be no unconstitutional changes, and urged Zimbabwe s government and the military  to resolve the political impasse amicably . While most African states gained independence by the end of the 1960s, Zimbabwe remained one of the last European colonies on the continent, ruled by white settlers as Rhodesia until 1980. Mugabe took power after a long guerrilla struggle, and two decades later ordered the forcible seizure of white-owned farms. The collapse in output that followed was one of the worst economic depressions of modern times. By 2007-2008 inflation topped out at 500 billion percent. Mugabe blamed Britain and the United States for sabotaging the country to bring it to heel. His followers used violence to suppress a growing domestic opposition he branded lackeys of former colonial powers. The economy briefly stabilized from 2010-2014 when Mugabe was forced to accept a power-sharing government with the opposition, but since then the recovery has unraveled. In the last year, a chronic shortage of dollars has led to long queues outside banks. Imported goods are running out and economists say that by some measures inflation is now at 50 percent a month. The economic implosion has destabilized the region, sending millions of poor laborers to neighboring South Africa.  It s an amazing thing that is happening. It was about time but it might be 20 years too late,  said Billy, 30, a Zimbabwean working as a marketing officer in South Africa. Asked if he would return to Zimbabwe if the economy was revived, he said:  Definitely, there is no place like home.  The political crisis came to a head last week when Mugabe sacked his presumed heir, Vice President Emerson Mnangagwa, a long-serving former leader of the security forces nicknamed  the Crocodile  for his role as Mugabe s enforcer over the decades. The head of the military held a news conference with top brass on Monday threatening to  step in  if the purge of veterans continued. Soldiers deployed across Harare on Tuesday and seized the state broadcaster after Mugabe s ruling party accused the military chief of treason. According to a trove of intelligence documents reviewed by Reuters this year, Mnangagwa has been planning to revitalize the economy by bringing back white farmers kicked off their land and patching up relations with the World Bank and IMF.

Youth leader of Zimbabwe's ruling party apologizes to military on state TV,"HARARE (Reuters) - The head of the youth wing of Zimbabwe s ruling party on Wednesday publicly apologized on state television to the military, which has seized power saying it aims to isolate  criminals  in President Robert Mugabe s entourage.  Kudzai Chipanga, whose powerful ZANU-PF youth wing has been a strong supporter of Mugabe and his wife Grace, said he had voluntarily given his statement apologizing for denigrating defense forces chief General Constantino Chiwenga. It was an abrupt about-face for Chipanga, who on Tuesday accused the army chief of subverting the constitution.   Defending the revolution and our leader and president is an ideal we live for and if need be it is a principle we are prepared to die for,  Chipanga had said at the party s headquarters in Harare.

A ceasefire between the Turkish state and PKK militants broke down in July 2015 and southeast Turkey subsequently saw some of the worst violence since the group launched its insurgency in 1984. More than 40,000 people, mostly Kurds, have been killed in the conflict. The PKK is designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and the European Union.

Factbox: Likely players in potential post-coup Zimbabwe unity government,"HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe s army appears to be pushing for a quick and bloodless end to 93-year-old President Robert Mugabe s 37 years in power, to be replaced by a national unity government headed by his former deputy, Emmerson Mnangagwa. According to political sources in Harare, Mugabe - now under house arrest in his lavish Harare home - was resisting pressure to stand down voluntarily. [nL8N1NM1N9] Assuming he does, the following are likely to be key players in the expected settlement, according to political sources in Zimbabwe and South Africa and several years of Zimbabwean intelligence documents seen by Reuters: EMMERSON MNANGAGWA (LIKELY PRESIDENT) - A lifelong Mugabe aide and 1970s liberation war veteran known as  The Crocodile , Mnangagwa, 75, was in the pole position to succeed Mugabe until his progress was impeded by the dramatic political ascent of Mugabe s wife, Grace. His sacking as vice-president this month cleared a path for Grace to the presidency and appears to have been the trigger for the army to step in to advance its preferred successor. MORGAN TSVANGIRAI (LIKELY PRIME MINISTER) - A former union leader who founded the Movement for Democratic Change in the late 1990s, Tsvangirai, 65, has been Mugabe s main political rival for two decades. He served as prime minister in a 2009-2013 unity government formed after violence-ridden elections in 2008. Tsvangirai has been undergoing treatment for cancer outside Zimbabwe but returned to Harare late on Wednesday. CONSTANTINO CHIWENGA (POSSIBLE VICE-PRESIDENT) - As the military chief who pulled the trigger on the coup, Chiwenga is expected to win a senior role in the interim administration. Chiwenga, 61, who has served in the armed forces since Zimbabwe s independence in 1980, was sanctioned by the United States and European Union although the latter removed him from its list of restricted individuals in 2014. JOICE MUJURU (POSSIBLE VICE-PRESIDENT) - A liberation war veteran with the nom de guerre  Spill Blood , Mujuru, 62, formed her own political party after being ousted as vice-president in 2014. Her husband, Solomon Mujuru, a general who died in suspicious circumstances in 2011, was regarded as one of the most feared men in Zimbabwe and one of the few people capable of challenging Mugabe. DUMISO DABENGWA (POSSIBLE VICE-PRESIDENT) - Moscow-trained Dabengwa, 77, nicknamed  The Black Russian , fought in the 1970s anti-colonial struggle for ZIPRA (Zimbabwe People s Liberation Army), a rival to Mugabe s ZANLA (Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army). His incorporation in any unity government would ensure it represented both wings of the liberation struggle. TENDAI BITI (POSSIBLE FINANCE MINISTER) - A lawyer by training, Biti, 51, won international plaudits as finance minister in the 2009-2013 government that stabilized the imploding economy. He told Reuters he would be happy to reprise this role if Tsvangirai, his former political mentor, was on board. ",worldnews,"November 16, 2017 ",1
'Missing' British film maker sighted in Papua New Guinea,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - A British explorer reported missing while searching for a remote tribe in Papua New Guinea has been spotted next to an airstrip and is awaiting evacuation, a friend said on Thursday.  Benedict Allen, a documentary film maker, left last month to seek an isolated tribe, the Yaifo, in the north of the remote and rural South Pacific country of Papua New Guinea, but took no means of communication and left no evacuation plan or destination, his friend, Frank Gardner, told Reuters.    According to his blog, Allen aimed to be back in Britain by mid-November.  Don t try to rescue me, please - where I m going in PNG you won t ever find me you know,  he wrote on Twitter on Oct. 11. But after he missed a flight home last weekend, friends and family raised the alarm.  Benedict Allen is not out of danger yet. He is currently marooned in a remote part of Papua New Guinea that is only reachable by air after all the road bridges were cut due to tribal fighting,  Gardner, who is also the BBC s security correspondent, told Reuters.   Urgent efforts are now under way to try to airlift him out as soon as possible in case fighting erupts around him.  Gardner had earlier told the BBC that a PNG tribal commission had been looking for Allen and that he had been sighted by an airstrip. Reuters was unable to independently confirm the sighting.   Allen, who calls himself an  adventurer  on his website, describes being  beaten daily for six weeks  on a previous trip to PNG as part of an initiation ritual.  He also describes trekking a remote section of the Amazon,  during which, dying of starvation and malaria , he was forced to eat his dog. ",worldnews,"November 16, 2017 ",1

"Tillerson, in Myanmar, calls for credible probe of atrocities","NAYPYITAW (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called on Wednesday for a credible investigation into reports of human rights abuses against Rohingya Muslims committed by Myanmar s security forces after a meeting with its civilian and military leaders. More than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh since late August, driven out by a military counter-insurgency clearance operation in Buddhist-majority Myanmar s Rakhine State.  A top U.N. official has described the military s actions as a textbook case of  ethnic cleansing .  We re deeply concerned by credible reports of widespread atrocities committed by Myanmar s security forces and by vigilantes who were unrestrained by the security forces during the recent violence in Rakhine State,  Tillerson told a joint news conference with Aung San Suu Kyi, the head of a civilian administration that is less than two years old and shares power with the military. Tillerson had earlier held separate talks with Myanmar s military chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, whose forces have been accused of atrocities. A senior U.N. official on Sunday leveled allegations of mass rape, killings and torture against the Myanmar military, known as the Tatmadaw, after a tour of refugee camps in the Cox s Bazar region of neighboring Bangladesh. Tillerson called for the Myanmar government to lead a credible and impartial investigation and said those who committed abuses should be held responsible.  The recent serious allegations of abuses in Rakhine state demand a credible and impartial investigation and those who commit human rights abuses or violations must be held accountable,  he said.  In all my meetings, I have called on the Myanmar civilian government to lead a full and effective independent investigation and for the military to facilitate full access and cooperation.  He also said it was the duty of the military to help the government to meet commitments to ensure the safety and security of all people in Rakhine state. A posting on Min Aung Hlaing s Facebook page said Myanmar s military supremo had explained to Tillerson the  true situation in Rakhine , the reasons why Muslims fled, how the military was working with the government to deliver aid and the progress made for a repatriation process to be agreed with Bangladesh. The military launched its clearance operation after an army base and 30 police posts were attacked on Aug. 25 by Rohingya militants, killing about a dozen members of the security forces. Tillerson condemned the militant attacks, but said any response by the security forces needed to avoid to the  maximum extent possible harming innocent civilians . An internal investigation by the military into the  allegations of atrocities that was released this week was branded a  whitewash  by human rights groups. Back in Washington, U.S. senators are pressing for economic sanctions and travel restrictions targeting the Myanmar military and its business interests. Tillerson said he would advise against any broad-based sanctions against Myanmar, as the United States wanted to see it succeed. But he said if there was credible and reliable information on abuses by individuals they could be targeted by sanctions. Tillerson said the United States would work with partners so that those responsible for any atrocities would face consequences,  using all available mechanisms, including those available under U.S. law . Myanmar is undergoing a transition to democracy after decades of rule by the military, but the generals retain extensive powers over security and a veto over reform of a constitution that has barred Suu Kyi from the presidency.  Myanmar s response to this crisis is critical to determining the success of its transition to a more democratic society,  Tillerson said.   It s a responsibility of the government and its security forces to protect and respect the human rights of all persons within its borders and to hold accountable those who fail to do so.  He said the United States would provide an additional $47 million in humanitarian assistance for refugees bringing the total to $87 million since the crisis erupted in August.  The humanitarian scale of this crisis is staggering,  Tillerson said. But he said he was encouraged by talks between Myanmar and Bangladesh to agree on a refugee repatriation process. During the news conference, Suu Kyi was asked to explain why she had not spoken out more strongly over the plight of the Rohingya, as the Nobel peace prize winner s perceived failure to speak up has damaged her international reputation as a stateswoman.  What I say is not supposed to be exciting,  Suu Kyi said, adding that she had aimed to keep the public informed without setting different ethnic, religious communities against each other.  It s important to bring peace and stability to this country and that can only be done on the basis of rule of law and everybody should understand that the role of theirs is to protect peace and stability, not to punish people.

Abducted Swiss aid worker freed in Sudan's Darfur,"KHARTOUM (Reuters) - A 72-year-old Swiss aid worker was freed by security forces early on Wednesday more than a month after she was abducted in Sudan s Darfur region, officials said. Margaret Schenkel later flew back to the capital Khartoum, but did not give details of her ordeal to waiting journalists. She was kidnapped on Oct. 7 in the main city in North Darfur region, El Fasher, a hub for relief workers and U.N./African Union peacekeepers. Security forces launched an operation to free her from a rural area where she was being held outside the southern town of Kutum, a spokesman for the regional government said. The leader and one member of the six-man kidnapping gang had been arrested, Sudan s foreign ministry spokesman, Qarib al-Khidr, said. Neither Switzerland nor Sudan paid a ransom, he added. Khartoum has been at war with rebel groups in Darfur since 2003, but much of the conflict has descended into banditry and gangs have kidnapped people for ransom. The Swiss foreign ministry thanked Sudan for its help in freeing Schenkel. Officials have not named her aid group. ",worldnews,"November 15, 2017 ",1

Fear and loathing in South Korea as university exam postponed by quake,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean test-takers expressed confusion and dejection on Thursday as the country s highly competitive annual university entrance exam, called a  life assignment exam  by some, was postponed a week for the first time ever due to safety concerns.  South Korea postponed the exam after a rare earthquake rattled the country on Wednesday, causing damage to buildings including some schools. The exam is life-defining for many high school seniors, as a prestigious university on one s resume is seen a minimum for securing a place in limited corporate jobs in Asia s fourth-largest economy, which is dominated by conglomerates.  Because the wrong answer to a single question in the roughly 200-question exam can mean dropping in the national ranking and failure to enter one s choice of university, tensions ran high.   It s a bit hellish thinking I have to do this for one more week,  said 20-year-old Cho Hyun-lee, studying at one of Seoul s largest cram schools to take the test again after last year.  People are dispirited, lying with their faces down.   Some scrambled to recover books they d thrown away yesterday or buy new ones, two test-takers told Reuters, while others  gave up , uploading pictures of classmates sleeping or reading online comics on social media. Still others agonized over missing concerts of their favorite singers or South Korea s largest online game exhibition this week.  Meanwhile, South Korean society, geared for the exam s smooth progress, prepared to do it all again next Thursday.   Airplanes, barred from taking off or landing for 35 minutes on Thursday morning to prevent their noise from interfering with the exam s listening section, were allowed to land or take off, the transport ministry said.  But the stock market and banks still opened an hour late on Thursday   a device to help keep roads clear for students getting to test sites.  The defense ministry allowed extra leave for soldiers in mandatory military service who had taken personal leave to sit the exam.  Four police officers were stationed on double shifts at each of the 85 locations exam questions are kept and police patrolled the premises every two hours to prevent their leaking.  As fainter aftershocks continued on Wednesday and Thursday, many Koreans said they support the postponement   but some were inconsolable.   It feels like I was turning the handle on the exit door from hell then returned to square one,  said Lee Yoon-mi, a high school senior in Incheon.   If you re not a test-taker, you could never understand.   ",worldnews,"November 16, 2017 ",1

Angelina Jolie condemns sexual violence against Rohingya women refugees,"DHAKA (Reuters) - Filmstar Angelina Jolie has condemned sexual violence inflicted on Rohingya women in Myanmar s Rakhine State, where a military counter-insurgency operation has sent hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslim refugees across the border to Bangladesh.  More than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled Buddhist-majority Myanmar since late August, driven out by the military s actions that a top United Nations official has described as a classic case of  ethnic cleansing . Jolie, a special envoy of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), told a Bangladesh delegation in the Canadian city of Vancouver that she planned to visit the Rohingya victims of sexual violence.  Later she mentioned accordingly in her keynote speech about the sexual violence faced by almost each female Rohingya who fled to Bangladesh and condemned the armed conflict in Myanmar,  Bangladesh s foreign ministry said in a statement on Thursday. It gave no details of Jolie s proposed trip. On Thursday, New York-based Human Rights Watch accused Myanmar security forces of committing widespread rape against women and girls as part of a campaign of ethnic cleansing. The allegation echoes an accusation this week by Pramila Patten, the U.N. special envoy on sexual violence in conflict, who said sexual violence was  being commanded, orchestrated and perpetrated by the Armed Forces of Myanmar.  Myanmar s army released a report on Monday denying all allegations of rape and killings by security forces, days after replacing the general in charge of the operation. In parliament on Wednesday, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said Bangladesh would overcome obstacles to resolve the Rohingya crisis, with the help of the international community.  I strongly believe we will find a peaceful solution to the unprecedented crisis with the help of the international community, despite various obstacles,  she said. There were already about 300,000 Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh before the most recent exodus. ",worldnews,"November 16, 2017 ",1
China foreign minister to visit Myanmar amid Rohingya crisis,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi will visit Myanmar and Bangladesh from this weekend, his ministry said on Thursday, amid a crisis over Myanmar s treatment of Rohingya Muslims. More than 600,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh since late August, driven out by a military counter-insurgency clearance operation in Buddhist-majority Myanmar s Rakhine State. A top U.N. official has described the military s actions as a textbook case of  ethnic cleansing . Myanmar rejects accusations of rights abuses. China has expressed support for what it calls the Myanmar government s efforts to protect stability. Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters that Wang would go to Bangladesh and Myanmar this weekend where he would meet his counterparts and exchange views on bilateral ties and issues of mutual regional concern. On Monday and Tuesday, Wang would attend a meeting of Asian and European foreign ministers in the Myanmar capital of Naypyitaw, Geng added. He did not say whether Wang would discuss the Rohingya issue. China and Myanmar have for years maintained close economic and diplomatic relations. The United States and other Western countries have become more engaged with Myanmar in recent years, since it began a transition to civilian government after nearly 50 years of military rule. International concern over the Rohingya situation has grown. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called during a visit to Myanmar on Wednesday for a credible investigation into reports of human rights abuses against the Rohingya committed by Myanmar s security forces.

Indonesian parliament speaker not hiding from graft probe: lawyer,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - A lawyer for Indonesia s parliament speaker denied on Thursday that the politician had gone into hiding to avoid being questioned by an anti-corruption agency over a $170 million graft investigation and said his client had a busy schedule. Officers from the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) sought to arrest speaker Setya Novanto at his house in Jakarta late on Wednesday, but failed to find him, sparking speculation about his whereabouts.  He is not hiding,  Novanto s lawyer, Fredrich Yunadi, told Reuters by telephone.   He is very busy, invited to many events and such. If he hears of violations of any law, he will discuss it with other officials,  said Yunadi. Novanto, who is chairman of Indonesia s second-biggest political party, Golkar, was still in Jakarta, he added. Novanto was not available for comment. He has previously denied wrongdoing but has missed repeated KPK summons for questioning in recent months, saying he was ill and needed to undergo heart surgery. The KPK is investigating state losses amounting to about $170 million linked to a national electronic identity card scheme after allegations that sums ranging from $5,000 to $5.5 million - generated by marking up the costs of procurement - were divided up among politicians in parliament. Because of the alleged embezzlement, millions of people have faced long delays in getting cards, or have been issued pieces of paper in place of a proper cards. Novanto was named a suspect in the case again last week after he had used a controversial legal maneuver, a pre-trial motion, to get earlier charges dropped last month. Yunadi said on Thursday his client had been summoned by the KPK 11 times as a witness and as a suspect in the investigation.   We will file another pre-trial motion, but it is still to be decided when,  said Yunadi  Vice President Jusuf Kalla, who is also a Golkar member, told reporters Novanto should be ready to face any legal process if called upon. Officials at the anti-graft agency did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A KPK spokesman Febri Diansyah was quoted in Kompas newspaper as saying the commission had a warrant for Novanto s arrest and called on him to surrender. Novanto has for years been dogged by allegations of corruption, but has never been prosecuted. In late 2015, a parliament ethics committee launched an investigation into allegations by a Freeport Indonesia executive that Novanto had tried to extort $1.8 billion worth of shares from the local unit of the U.S. mining company. Novanto denied the allegations but stepped down temporarily. He was reappointed as speaker a year later, after being cleared by an ethics panel. Indonesians widely perceive parliament as one of their country s most corrupt institutions, Transparency International says. ",worldnews,"November 16, 2017 ",1
"Kurdish YPG aims to conquer Syrian region, not fight Islamic State: Turkish minister","ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Recent developments in Syria s Raqqa show that the Kurdish YPG militia, backed by the United States, is more concerned about capturing territory than fighting Islamic State, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said in a speech on Thursday. Turkey has expressed anger that a convoy of Islamic State fighters were allowed to withdraw from Raqqa last month as part of an agreement with the YPG, saying it was  appalled  by the United States  stance on the issue. [nL8N1NK9RZ] Ankara was also infuriated by Washington s support for the Syria Kurdish fighters, seen by Turks as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has fought a decades-long insurgency in Turkey and is designated a terrorist group by Ankara, the United States and European Union.  Turkish procurement of U.S. defence equipment is being delayed in the United States, according to the text of Cavusoglu s speech, and Turkey is developing alternative solutions for this sector.  We are unfortunately facing important delays in the procurement of defence equipment we urgently need in the fight against terror from the United States due to U.S. internal practices,  the text said, without elaborating.  Evidently, as these periods are prolonged, we are developing alternative means to acquire the equipment and systems we require, primarily through our own national resources.  Turkey recently completed the purchase of Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile systems, a defence deal that Turkey s Western allies see as a snub to the NATO alliance as the weapon cannot be integrated into the alliance s systems. [nL8N1NI0ED] Ankara also said it was making agreements with the Franco-Italian EUROSAM consortium to develop, produce and use its own sources for air defence system.

China pushes Hong Kong not to 'shirk duty' to enact contentious security law,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - A Chinese official admonished Hong Kong on Thursday for failing to introduce a national security law, ramping up pressure on the former British colony to enact the contentious Article 23 that critics say will further choke its freedoms. The global financial hub has been ruled under a  one country, two systems  principle since it returned to China in 1997, guaranteeing freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland, including an independent judiciary and freedom of expression. Those freedoms are outlined in its mini-constitution, the  Basic Law , a document that also demands the city pass its own laws preventing treason, secession and subversion against Communist Party rulers in Beijing. Hong Kong leaders have in the past decade put off passing Article 23, possibly their most sensitive political task, especially as tensions ran high after the months-long pro-democracy demonstrations in 2014. But Beijing officials have not forgotten, and on Thursday Li Fei, who chairs the Basic Law Committee under the Chinese parliament s standing committee, said it was  a duty that cannot be shirked .  I believe we can all see the harmful effects from this legal vacuum,  he said in a speech in Hong Kong.  I d like to emphasize, (Hong Kong should) safeguard national sovereignty and security through legislation and strict implementation of the law.  An earlier planned national security law for Hong Kong was shelved in 2003 after an estimated 500,000 people marched against it. In his hour-long speech, live-streamed in some schools and at times directed at students, Li also lashed out at a nascent independence movement, which has gone largely underground after most of its figureheads were charged for what the government called a  riot  in 2016.  Their behavior is absurd, the nature of it is illegal, and emotionally speaking it s absolutely impermissible,  he said.  We must resist and oppose them without any hesitation.      Li s remarks came after Chinese President Xi Jinping took what some saw as a harder line on Hong Kong s future during his visit in July to mark the 20th anniversary of the 1997 handover. Xi warned then that any attempt to endanger Chinese sovereignty and security, challenge China s power, or use Hong Kong to carry out infiltration or sabotage would be acts that cross  the red line  and were  absolutely impermissible . The city s new leader, Carrie Lam, bent on mending the damaged trust between Beijing and the Hong Kong public, has repeatedly said the timing is not right to introduce security laws, just three years after the youth-led demonstrations directly challenged Beijing s authority.  Even without any new local laws, some Hong Kong lawyers, diplomats and activists believe Beijing may make its own attempt to outlaw independence debates through a formal interpretation of the Basic Law, or extending national laws to cover Hong Kong. Such moves would have to be followed by Hong Kong s courts, deepening fears over the strength of Hong Kong s vaunted rule of law and freedom of speech. Some experts note that Beijing has lowered the threshold for such action after its preemptive interpretation of the Basic Law last year, which effectively disqualified lawmakers who did not take their oaths properly. It also ruled last month to outlaw mockery of the national anthem and decided the law would be extended to Hong Kong, which will take effect after it s been put to the city s legislature.

China says 'friendly policy' toward Zimbabwe won't change,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Thursday its  friendly policy  toward Zimbabwe would not change, after the military said it had seized power and was holding President Robert Mugabe and his family safe while targeting  criminals . China is paying close attention to the situation in Zimbabwe and hoped for stability and a peaceful,  appropriate  resolution, foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a daily news briefing in Beijing. China s cooperation with Zimbabwe was  all round  and benefited both peoples, he added.  China s friendly policy towards Zimbabwe won t change. We will continue to develop friendly cooperation with Zimbabwe on  an equal, mutually beneficial win-win cooperation principle,  Geng said, without elaborating. Influential state-run Chinese tabloid the Global Times said in an editorial on Thursday that Zimbabwe was unlikely to reverse its relations with China.  Since Zimbabwe s independence, there has been no anti-China faction in the country, and it is unlikely to appear in the future,  it said. In contrast to his elevated status on the continent, Mugabe is reviled in the West as a despot whose disastrous handling of the economy and willingness to resort to violence to maintain power destroyed one of Africa s most promising states. China and Zimbabwe have a close diplomatic and economic relationship and Beijing has stood with Mugabe s government in the face of Western economic sanctions, investing in auto, diamond, tobacco and power-station projects. BAIC Motor Corp Ltd (1958.HK), which has a joint venture making pick-up trucks in Zimbabwe, told Reuters there had been no impact on its operations. Neither of two other Chinese companies - Tianze Tobacco and diamond mining Anjin Investments - responded to requests for comment on their operations in Zimbabwe. In August, Zimbabwe s government said a Chinese company planned to invest up to $2 billion to revive operations at Zimbabwe Iron and Steel Company (ZISCO), which ceased production in 2008 at the height of Zimbabwe s economic meltdown. That same year, China vetoed a proposed Western-backed U.N. resolution that would have imposed an arms embargo on Zimbabwe and financial and travel restrictions on Mugabe and 13 other officials, saying it would  complicate , rather than ease, conflict.

Thailand plans joint arms factory with China,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand s defense technology agency plans to set up a joint center with China to produce and maintain military equipment in the latest sign of the strengthening security relationship since a 2014 coup. The plans to establish the facility - and discussions on a Chinese naval center to serve submarines Thailand ordered this year - point to a growing Chinese security presence in the oldest U.S. ally in the region as elsewhere in Southeast Asia. The Thai government s Defence Technology Institute (DTI) will set up Thailand s first commercial joint defense facility with China in the northeastern province of Khon Kaen in July, a defense ministry spokesman said. It will be responsible for assembly, production and maintenance of Chinese land weapon systems for the Thai army.  All our production will be for domestic official usage,  defense ministry spokesman Kongcheep Tantravanich told Reuters, adding that it could become an assembly and maintenance center for all states in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Specific details, he said, were subject to further discussions between the ministry and China North Industries Corporation (NORINCO) - which makes tanks and weapons among other heavy equipment. NORINCO did not respond immediately to an emailed request for comment. Its website describes it as  a pioneer and leader of Chinese military trade, and an important team to implement China s Going Global strategy . Kongcheep said the Chinese would provide training and technology transfer, but details of any Chinese personnel in Khon Kaen were among things being discussed. The Chinese Defense Ministry did not respond when contacted by Reuters for comment. China has become an increasingly important source of weapons for Thailand, particularly since the United States and Western countries downgraded ties after the army seized power in 2014. Major purchases since 2015 include orders for 49 Chinese tanks and 34 armored vehicles worth over $320 million - much more than the army has bought from other countries, although it also ordered helicopters from both Russia and the United States. The biggest Chinese purchase is the Royal Thai Navy s order for three submarines at a cost of over $1 billion. Thai and Chinese armies and air forces have begun joint exercises, complementing Thailand s continuing drills with the U.S. forces. On the civilian front, Thailand and China plan development of a high-speed rail link as part of Beijing s Belt and Road initiative. Relations with the United States are warming again too, however, particularly since new U.S. President Donald Trump hosted junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha at the White House. The joint weapons manufacturing center in Khon Kaen - apparently similar to one in Pakistan - could complement China s growing military presence in neighboring Cambodia, said Paul Chambers, who has researched Thai military and regional security.  It opens the door for the potential of growing Chinese military influence in mainland Southeast Asia,  said Chambers, of Naresuan University in the northern Thai province of Phitsanulok. New legislation taking effect next year will allow Thailand s Defence Technology Institute to operate on a commercial basis, but it will remain entirely under government ownership. Thailand s Defence Ministry said the government was also holding preliminary discussions with Ukraine, Russia and South Africa about joint defense manufacturing facilities, similar to the deal with China.

China denounces U.S. call to register Chinese journalists as agents,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China denounced on Thursday a U.S. congressional commission that accused its state media of involvement in spying and propaganda and called for their staff in the United States to be registered as foreign agents. The U.S. China Economic and Security Review Commission said in its latest annual report that while China had tightened restrictions on domestic and foreign media, its state media had rapidly expanded overseas. The commission, created by Congress in 2000 to monitor national security implications of U.S.-China trade relations, said China s state media expansion was part of a broader effort to exert greater control over how it is depicted globally, as well as to gather information. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang they had seen the report.  This commission that released the report has always been full of prejudice on China-related issues,  Geng told a daily news briefing.  Much of the content in the relevant report is sheer fiction, and many of its views reflect their bias against China,  he said. China urged the commission to put an end to its  wrong words and actions  and really play a constructive role in promoting the development of Sino-U.S. ties, Geng said, without elaborating.

China confident Venezuela can handle debt issue,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China s Foreign Ministry reiterated on Thursday that it believes Venezuela has the ability to handle its debt issue, after the oil-rich country started making interest payments on bonds following a delay that had threatened to trigger a default. Venezuela has borrowed billions of dollars from Russia and China, primarily through oil-for-loan deals that have crimped the country s hard currency revenue by requiring oil shipments to be used to service those loans.  On Wednesday, Venezuela won easier debt terms from Russia, as well as a vote of confidence from China - two countries that could provide a lifeline as Caracas seeks to keep its deeply depressed economy solvent. Asked whether China was concerned that the debt would not be repaid, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a regular news briefing that China-Venezuela financial cooperation was proceeding as normal.  We believe that Venezuela s government and people have the ability to properly handle their debt issue,  Geng said.  Venezuelan bond prices have been on a roller-coaster over the past 10 days, as President Nicolas Maduro called investors to debt restructuring talks, while pledging to keep honoring the country s obligations. But S&P Global Ratings declared it in selective default on two of its sovereign bonds early this week after it failed to make the coupons within a 30-day grace period. On Wednesday, the country s Economy Ministry said it had started transferring $200 million in interest payments on those bonds, which mature in 2019 and 2024. ",worldnews,"November 16, 2017 ",1
Final death toll from London's Grenfell Tower fire is 71: police,"LONDON (Reuters) - The final death toll from the fire that destroyed the Grenfell Tower social housing block in London in June is 71, police said on Thursday after five months of painstaking search and recovery operations. Police had previously said about 80 people died in the blaze, which tore through the 24-storey tower in west London in the middle of the night, but officers now believe all those who died in the fire have been recovered and identified. The figure has come down because some people were reported missing several times, some people who lived in the tower and were feared dead were found to have been elsewhere on the night, and some people were falsely reported dead by fraudsters hoping to receive financial compensation. The final toll includes 70 adults and children who died in the tower during the fire, and one baby who was stillborn shortly after the heavily pregnant mother escaped from the 21st floor, suffering severe smoke inhalation on her way down. The mother survived.  Specialist teams working inside Grenfell Tower and the mortuary have pushed the boundaries of what was scientifically possible to identify people,  said Metropolitan Police Commander Stuart Cundy, who is in charge of operations at the tower.  I know that each and every member of the team has done absolutely all they can to make this possible. They have done that for every person who lost their life, their families and loved ones, and all those for whom Grenfell Tower was home.  The tower was home to a tight-knit, multi-ethnic community in a deprived social housing estate within the wealthy Kensington and Chelsea borough that is also home to large numbers of millionaires. The tragedy has prompted political debate and soul-searching about London s stark social inequalities and whether neglect of social housing estates and the communities living in them played a part in the fire. A criminal investigation is under way that could result in individuals or organizations being charged. A separate public inquiry aims to shed light on any flaws or irregularities in the design, construction or maintenance of the tower. Cundy said that when he first entered Grenfell Tower after the fire, the devastation was such that he feared it would not be possible to find, recover and identify all those who died. Police officers, assisted by forensic anthropologists, archaeologists and specialists in using dental science to identify unknown human remains, searched every flat on every floor and every communal area. The search involved sifting through tonnes of debris by hand to identify all human remains in the charred building. In parallel, huge amounts of investigative work was undertaken to identify who was in Grenfell Tower on the night of the fire, who was missing and presumed dead, enquire after those reported missing and reconcile all the information. One person was reported missing 46 separate times. Some were reported under a number of different names, and even the slightest differences in spelling had to be investigated. Police said that having completed all this work, they now believed it was highly unlikely that anyone remained in Grenfell Tower. ",worldnews,"November 16, 2017 ",1

Japan weighs plans to deal with North Korean evacuees in case of crisis,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan is studying plans to cope with an influx of perhaps tens of thousands of North Korean evacuees if a military or other crisis breaks out on the peninsula, including ways to weed out spies and terrorists, a domestic newspaper said. The Japan Coast Guard would escort boats fleeing North Korea to designated ports, where police would screen them by checking their identity and possible criminal records and expel those deemed a threat, the Yomiuri newspaper said on Thursday. It did not say where those people would be sent, however. Evacuees granted temporary entrance would be transferred to emergency detention centers, probably in southern Japan, after completing quarantine and other procedures. Officials would then decide whether they were eligible to remain in Japan, the Yomiuri said.  Regional tension over Pyongyang s missile and nuclear arms programs remain high. A senior Chinese diplomat was to visit the North from Friday as a special envoy of Chinese President Xi Jinping, just a week after U.S. President Donald Trump met Xi in Beijing and pressed for greater action to rein in Pyongyang. Junji Ito, an official of the justice ministry s immigration bureau, said the Japanese government was looking at steps to deal with a possible influx of people from North Korea but declined to comment on details. Outspoken Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso grabbed headlines in September when he touched on the possibility of shooting armed refugees from North Korea.  Will police respond and arrest them on charges of illegal immigration?  media quoted him as saying in a speech.  If the Self-Defense Forces (military) are dispatched, will they shoot them down?   On Thursday, the Japan Coast Guard said it had rescued three North Korean men on a capsized boat a day earlier and was searching for 12 missing crew. The men said they were fishermen, not defectors, and Japan was arranging to send them home, it added. Japan has strict requirements for recognizing asylum seekers and accepted only three refugees in the first half of 2017 despite a record 8,561 fresh applications. In January, Human Rights Watch described Japan s record on asylum seekers as  abysmal . The country took in more than 11,000 Indochinese  boat people  refugees over three decades to 2005 in the aftermath of the Vietnam War, a little-remembered open-door policy.

Singapore suspends trade relations with North Korea,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore has suspended trade relations with North Korea, the latest of Pyongyang s major trade partners to cut commercial ties under toughening U.N. sanctions over its weapons program, a customs notice obtained on Thursday showed. The move comes about two months after the United States imposed North Korea-related sanctions on a number of firms and individuals, including two entities based in Singapore.  Singapore will prohibit all commercially traded goods from, or to, the Democratic People s Republic of Korea (DPRK),  the city-state s customs said in the notice sent to traders and declaring agents last Tuesday, referring to the country by its official name.   The suspension would take effect from Nov. 8, Fauziah A. Sani, head of trade strategy and security for the director-general of customs, said in the notice.  Repeated breach of the new prohibitions is punishable by a fine of up to S$200,000 ($147,340.50) or four times the value of the goods traded, imprisonment of up to three years, or both, it added.  Singapore is North Korea s seventh largest trading partner. The Philippines, Pyongyang s fifth biggest trading partner, suspended trade with North Korea in September to comply with a U.N. resolution. Tension on the Korean peninsula has escalated as North Korea s young leader, Kim Jong Un, has stepped up the development of weapons in defiance of U.N. sanctions. North Korea has tested a series of missiles this year, including one that flew over Japan, and conducted its sixth and biggest nuclear test in September. Pyongyang maintains a diplomatic presence in Singapore, with an embassy in its financial district.  In September, Singapore issued a travel advisory urging citizens to avoid all non-essential travel to North Korea, where it does not have diplomatic representation.  In an interview with National Public Radio in May, Singapore s minister of foreign affairs, Vivian Balakrishnan, had said the country was not ready to cut all diplomatic ties with North Korea.    In January last year, Singapore-based Chinpo Shipping Company (Private) Ltd was fined S$180,000 for facilitating a shipment of arms to North Korea in violation of U.N. sanctions.

Same-sex marriage may be law in Australia by early December,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australian lawmakers on Thursday vowed to push through laws legalizing same-sex marriage by early December, after a national survey found the majority of Australians favored the move.  Both Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull s Liberal-National coalition government and the main opposition Labor Party said they were aiming to pass the law through parliament by Dec. 7. That timeline was even earlier than the Christmas deadline named by Turnbull on Wednesday after the country s statistics agency reported that 61.6 percent of voters surveyed favored marriage equality, with 38.4 percent against. Legislation was rushed into the national parliament s upper house Senate late on Wednesday, even as colorful celebrations in the major cities continued and congratulations rolled in from international supporters.  If the legislation passes as expected, Australia will become the 26th nation to legalize same-sex marriage, a watershed for a country where it was still illegal in some states to engage in homosexual activity until 1997. The legislation faces some opposition from conservative lawmakers in the coalition, who have pledged to introduce amendments to protect religious freedom that would allow discrimination against same-sex couples.  Attorney-General George Brandis moved two amendments on Wednesday, seeking to extend protection to civil celebrants to refuse to officiate same-sex weddings.  They ll move amendments and some of them will be accepted,  Turnbull told a radio station on Thursday.  We re cracking (getting) on with it.  A rival bill proposed by the conservative faction that would have included widespread protections for religious objectors, including florists, bakers and musicians, to refuse service to same-sex couples was withdrawn after being widely condemned. Full debate on the bill, which was introduced by Senator Dean Smith, a member of the coalition and the country s first openly gay lawmaker, is scheduled to begin on Nov. 27. Almost 80 percent of the country s eligible voters took part in the voluntary public survey - a higher voter turnout than Britain s Brexit vote and Ireland s same-sex marriage referendum.

Cambodia's opposition braces for Supreme Court decision,"PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodia s Supreme Court on Thursday began its final session to decide whether to dissolve the main opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), thus ensuring victory for Prime Minister Hun Sen s ruling party in next year s general election. A verdict is expected later in the day, amid an increasingly tense political situation and a campaign by the ruling Cambodian People s Party (CPP) to crush the opposition ahead of the vote. If the court rules for dissolution, 118 members of the opposition party will also be banned from politics. More than half its members of parliament have already fled Cambodia, fearing a crackdown by Hun Sen.  Such a ruling would leave  no credible political opposition in Cambodia  for the first time since 1993, one senior diplomat based in the Cambodian capital told Reuters. In that year a U.N.-run election produced a shaky coalition between Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen, a former Khmer Rouge guerrilla installed as prime minister in the mid-1980s by the Vietnamese.   The processes in the early  nineties left Cambodia with a lively civil society and the freest press in Southeast Asia and there is a possibility of a lot of that going,  said the diplomat, who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to comment. Dozens of police guarded the court, its exterior painted yellow with gold accents, along with some officers from Hun Sen s personal bodyguard unit, although there has been no indication of any planned protest. Traffic flow was normal. On Wednesday, Cambodia s opposition said it did not think it could escape dissolution. The judge who heads the Supreme Court, Dith Munty, is a member of the permanent committee of the ruling party  and a longtime Hun Sen loyalist. The 2018 election had been shaping as possibly the biggest challenge to Hun Sen s leadership, after his opponents unified behind the CNRP. Hun Sen has stepped up measures against the opposition. In September, CNRP leader Kem Sokha was arrested in Phnom Penh and charged with treason. ",worldnews,"November 16, 2017 ",1
"China, Philippines agree to avoid force in South China Sea dispute","BEIJING/MANILA (Reuters) - China and the Philippines have agreed to avoid force to resolve their differences over the South China Sea, according to a joint statement issued on Thursday by China at the end of a visit to Manila by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang. China and the Philippines have long sparred over the South China Sea, but relations have improved considerably under Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. Malaysia, Taiwan, Brunei, Vietnam and the Philippines claim some or all of the South China Sea and its myriad shoals, reefs and islands. China claims most of the waterway and has been aggressively building and militarizing artificial islands. The joint statement, carried by China s official Xinhua news agency, said China and the Philippines reaffirmed the importance of peace in the South China Sea and of freedom of navigation and overflight. There should be no violence or threats of violence and the dispute should be resolved via talks between the  relevant sovereign countries , it added.   Both sides believe that the maritime dispute is not the full sum of the China-Philippines relationship,  the statement said. In a separate statement summing up discussions at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit, Duterte took note of the  improving relations between ASEAN and China  in the South China Sea.  In view of this positive momentum, we looked forward to the announcement of the start of substantive negotiations on the Code of Conduct (COC) with China  he said, hopefully in early 2018 in Vietnam, where the two sides will meet at the earliest. ASEAN and China have been discussing a set of rules on how to behave in the disputed waters to avoid accidents and raising tension.  Duterte said the two sides also had successfully tested the hotline among foreign ministries on how to manage maritime emergencies.  In our view, these are practical measures that could reduce tensions, and the risks of accidents, misunderstandings and miscalculation,  he said. ",worldnews,"November 16, 2017 ",1
"India's Modi remains overwhelmingly popular, says Pew poll","NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Nearly nine out of 10 Indians hold a favorable opinion of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and more than two-thirds are satisfied with the direction he is taking the country, a Pew survey has found, two years before he heads into a general election. Modi s Bharatiya Janata Party-led coalition won the biggest parliamentary majority in three decades in a 2014 election and the poll by the U.S.-based research center showed that his personal ratings remain high. Critics have accused hardline Hindu groups linked to the ruling coalition of promoting a partisan agenda, including targeting minority Muslims, since he came to power.  They have also blamed Modi for slowing economic growth and for failing to generate the hundreds of thousands of jobs needed for young people joining the workforce each month.  But the Pew poll found that 88 percent of Indians held a favorable view of Modi, a shade higher than the 87 percent who gave him a thumbs-up in 2015, a year after he swept to power promising to transform India into a high-growth economy. Such high ratings are unusual for political leaders three years into office in south Asia, where governments are more often voted out than retained as people become frustrated with broken campaign promises. Modi s favorable rating is 31 percentage points higher than that of Sonia Gandhi, the leader of the main opposition Congress party, and is 30 points more than that for her son, Rahul Gandhi, who is expected to take over the party leadership.  Three years into Modi s five-year tenure, the honeymoon period for his administration may be over but the public s love affair with current conditions in India is even more intense,  Pew said in comments on its findings. The survey was conducted in February and March, a few months after Modi withdrew most high-value bank notes in a shock move aimed at illegal wealth, but which put millions of people in difficulty as cash was sucked out of the economy. Modi defended the measure as an attack on the rich hiding their wealth from the taxman and said gains would come to the poor. Economic growth eased to a three-year low in the June quarter and experts said part of the reason was that the withdrawal of most of the currency had hurt consumer demand in a largely cash-driven economy. A poorly implemented goods-and-services tax that went into effect in July has further unsettled small businesses, many of which are part of the bedrock of the BJP s political base. But the poll found that more than 80 percent of those surveyed said economic conditions were good, up 19 percentage points since just before the 2014 election.  Overall, seven-in-ten Indians are now satisfied with the way things are going in the country. This positive assessment of India s direction has nearly doubled since 2014,  Pew said. The next general election is due in 2019.  But several states are voting for new assemblies over the next few months including Modi s home state of Gujarat. ",worldnews,"November 16, 2017 ",1
Canada will not send peacekeepers to Mali in near future: officials,"VANCOUVER (Reuters) - Canada will not be sending hundreds of peacekeepers to support a United Nations mission in Mali in the near future, officials said on Wednesday, a move likely to disappoint allies who want Canadians to play a role in the West African country. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last year promised to contribute up to 600 troops to peacekeeping operations and Canadian defense experts made three trips to Mali, where soldiers under the U.N. are fighting Islamist militants. Canada said it would split its soldiers among various missions instead, with no more than 200 going to any one spot, and will offer transport aircraft and helicopters in a series of  smart pledge  initiatives. It will also help train peacekeepers. U.N. officials downplayed concerns, saying that if Canada had pledged its troops and equipment to a single mission, like Mali, then those assets could not be deployed to support other missions in the region.  This is exactly what we need, we need flexibility... we need to be able to allocate these resources where we need them the most,  Jean-Pierre Lacroix, a U.N. under-secretary general for peacekeeping operations, told reporters. Lacroix said talks continue on how Canadian assets will be deployed, but added,  I m sure there s a strong determination to turn this commitment into a concrete action on the ground.  Earlier on Wednesday, a Canadian official told reporters  the option of sending forces to Mali one day was still alive, but added the planning process took at least six months,  So you re not going to going to see some kind of rapid deployment to any mission, let alone a complex one like Mali.  Trudeau sidestepped questions about the likely international reaction at a news conference, saying the varied measures Canada was proposing would serve the U.N. better.    Unhappy allies this year said Canada s bid for a U.N. Security Council seat could suffer unless Trudeau lived up to his promises.  This approach will be a disappointment to some, and the Canadian government will have to work hard to overcome the credibility it has lost in not following through on its initial pledge,  said Jane Boulden, a security studies expert at Queen s University in Kingston. Government insiders said enthusiasm for the Mali mission faded as the extent of likely casualties and the complex nature of the conflict became clear. More than 80 members have been killed since 2013, making Mali the world s deadliest peacekeeping operation. ",worldnews,"November 15, 2017 ",1
Senior China minister says some officials practice sorcery,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Some top Chinese officials are guilty of practicing sorcery and would rather believe in gurus and Western concepts of democracy than the Communist Party, a senior minister wrote on Thursday, warning of the danger they presented to its survival. China guarantees freedom of religion for major belief systems such as Buddhism, Christianity and Islam, but party members are meant to be atheists and are barred from what it calls superstitious practices, such as visits to soothsayers. Recent years have seen several cases of officials jailed as part of President Xi Jinping s crackdown on corruption being accused of superstition, part of the party s efforts to blacken their names. Some senior officials in leadership positions had  fallen morally , their beliefs straying from the correct path, wrote Chen Xi, the recently appointed head of the party s powerful Organisation Department that oversees personnel decisions.  Some don t believe in Marx and Lenin but believe in ghosts and gods; they don t believe in ideals but believe in sorcery; they don t respect the people but do respect masters,  he wrote in the official People s Daily, referring to spiritual leaders or gurus. People in China, especially its leaders, have a long tradition of turning to soothsaying and geomancy to find answers to their problems in times of doubt, need and chaos. The practice has grown more risky amid Xi s war on graft, in which dozens of senior officials have been imprisoned. Attacking officials whose faith in communism is wavering, Chen said some consider it an  entirely unreal mirage , and have lost faith in socialism. Instead, they look to Western concepts of the separation of power and multi-party systems as their ideal, added Chen, who also runs the Central Party School that trains rising officials. He did not name any officials guilty of practicing superstition or fawning over the West. But elsewhere in the article he named some of those caught up in the most high-profile recent cases, such as the feared former domestic security chief, Zhou Yongkang and the former party boss of Chongqing, Sun Zhengcai, sacked for corruption in July. They were  political careerist plotters , whose cases showed that officials  political problems were no less a threat to the party than corruption, Chen wrote.  The higher the position, the greater their platform, the greater the harm they caused to the party,  he added.  ",worldnews,"November 16, 2017 ",1
Pakistan's long-persecuted Ahmadi minority fear becoming election scapegoat,"RABWAH, Pakistan (Reuters) - Crammed into buses and mini-vans, more than 10,000 Pakistanis traveled to a mosque on the outskirts of the small Punjabi town of Rabwah, for the sole purpose of denouncing followers of the minority sect based here as  infidels and enemies of the state . For members of the long persecuted Ahmadi community, who are forbidden to call themselves Muslims and face discrimination and violence over accusations their faith insults Islam, the open vitriol on display at the Oct. 20 rally was not new. But this year, they say, anti-Ahmadi rhetoric has also re-entered mainstream Pakistani politics, as politicians seek to shore up support among religiously conservative voters after surprise gains by two new Islamist parties.  We are an easy community to scapegoat for political opponents to target each other,  said Usman Ahmad, who moved to Pakistan from Britain to work as a community activist. With a general election due in 2018, politicians from both the religious fringe and established parties have had the Ahmadis in their sights. In the past six weeks, a row over proposed changes to the election law that would have eased some of the barriers on Ahmadis participating in elections has seen the group denounced on the floor of Pakistan s parliament, while one of the new Islamist parties has held street protests. The government has since taken out ads in major newspapers reaffirming a religious oath requiring elected officials to vow that they do not follow anyone claiming to be a prophet after Mohammad and  nor do I belong to the Qadiani group , using a common derogatory term for Ahmadis. The Ahmadis consider themselves to be Muslims, but their recognition of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, who founded the sect in British-ruled India in 1889, as a  subordinate prophet  is viewed by many of the Sunni majority as a breach of the Islamic tenet that the Prophet Mohammad was God s last direct messenger.  The Ahmadi sect has 10-20 million followers worldwide who face discrimination in a number of Muslim-majority nations such as Indonesia and Algeria, as well as being ostracized by large parts of the Muslim community in Britain. There are about half a million Ahmadis in Pakistan, local leaders say, though other estimates have put the number at 2-4 million. Ahmadis are some of the most common defendants in criminal charges of blasphemy, which in Pakistan can carry the death penalty. By law they cannot call their place of worship mosques or distribute religious literature, recite the Koran or use traditional Islamic greetings, measures that they say criminalize their daily lives. The legal restrictions began in 1974, when the then-Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto passed a constitutional amendment declaring Ahmadis non-Muslim. A decade later military dictator General Zia ul Haq barred Ahmadis from identifying themselves as Muslim. Community leaders say these moves laid the groundwork for a sectarian divide that has since seen many violent attacks on Ahmadis and birthed multiple militant organizations, including many that are now linked to Islamic State. In the past four years, the Punjab government has also targeted Ahmadis under the country s anti-terrorism laws, filing at least eight cases against Ahmadis on charges of producing hate literature, including the sect s own holy texts. The offices of an Ahmadi magazine in Rabwah were raided in December 2016 by police, who arrested seven people and confiscated papers and hard drives.  They stormed the office, it felt like a group of terrorists had come in,  said Amir Fahim, who worked at the magazine and was held for 65 days.  They said the religious language you use belongs to us and the things you write offend the sensibilities of Muslims.  Community leaders say the use of anti-terrorism laws marks a new phase in the targeting of Ahmadis.  Here, to be an Ahmadi, through state laws, is a crime,  Pakistan s Ahmadi community spokesman Salimuddin said.  There are restrictions on our annual gatherings, our annual games ... If the state did not persecute us, we would not be persecuted.  Punjab government spokesman Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan said the authorities were not using the anti-terrorism laws to target any particular minority group.  The Punjab Government arrested thousands on charges of hate speech during the last three years,  he told Reuters.  Anti-Ahmadi groups were also included in them.  Many Ahmadis in Pakistan say they only truly feel safe in Rabwah, a town of more than 60,000 in eastern Punjab that is 95 percent Ahmadi. Most of the town s infrastructure is maintained on contributions made by the community, including free hostels and food for visitors and a community organized garbage clean-up. But on the edge of Rabwah lies a small settlement and a mosque run by a right-wing Islamist organization that openly professes hatred for Ahmadis. The organization, Khatm-e-Nubuwwat (Finality of the Prophet), built the mosque on land the Punjab government ordered confiscated from Ahmadis in 1975 for low-income housing. Khatm-e-Nubuwwat has been at the forefront of initiating blasphemy allegations against Ahmadis. Every year for 36 years, the group has held an anti-Ahmadi rally at the mosque.  Qadianis are the enemies of the prophet,  said Aziz ur Rehman, an organizer of the Rabwah conference, adding:  A country that was made in the name of the prophet cannot accept Qadianis.  Always volatile, political atmosphere in Pakistan has been especially tense since the Supreme Court removed former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif from office in July over corruption allegations, which he denies. The calculations of the mainstream parties have been complicated by the formation of two new Islamist political groups that garnered more than 10 percent in two recent by-elections and could become spoilers in a close election. One of the new parties, Tehreek-e-Labaik, launched a political furor last month after lawmakers from Sharif s party, which still holds a parliamentary majority, approved apparently small changes to the country s election law. The changes eliminated a requirement for Ahmadi voters to declare they are not Muslim and turned a religious oath for elected officials declaring belief in the Finality of the Prophet and affirming they are not Ahmadi into a simple declaration of belief. Tehreek-e-Labaik quickly termed any concessions to Ahmadis to be blasphemy and threatened mass protests. The government, still controlled by Sharif s party, quickly retreated and reversed the changes. A week later, speaking before Pakistan s National Assembly, Sharif s son-in-law, lawmaker Muhammad Safdar Awan called for Ahmadis to be barred from employment in the government, judiciary, and military. Sharif himself later distanced himself from Safdar s statement. The climbdown did not appease Tehreek-e-Labaik, which last week launched street protests blockading roads into Islamabad and demanding the law minister be sacked. The protests are ongoing and have paralyzed traffic in the capital. Saadia Toor, author of State of Islam said it s likely that anti-Ahmadi rhetoric will continue up to next year s elections, due by the end of August.  Anti-Ahmedi sentiment is widely held across the Pakistani Muslim mainstream, even among moderate Sunnis,  she said.  So using them as scapegoats for political purposes is easy.

German Greens want last nuclear weapons withdrawn: document,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Greens want the next coalition government to push for the removal of all nuclear warheads stationed in Germany, a document seen by Reuters showed on Wednesday. The discussion paper on defence and foreign policy did not mention the United States, which is believed to have 20 nuclear warheads at a military base in Buechel in western Germany, according to unofficial estimates. Chancellor Angela Merkel is trying to secure a fourth term through an unlikely coalition with the ecologist Greens and pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) after her conservative bloc lost support to the far-right in an election in September. NATO member Germany is not a nuclear power and in 2011 a Merkel-led government announced plans to shut all nuclear reactors by 2022 after the Fukushima disaster in Japan.  Within NATO, we want to ensure that the remaining nuclear weapons in Germany are withdrawn and we want to suspend the modernization programme,  read a section in the document stating the Greens  position. Before leaving office former U.S. President Barack Obama announced plans to modernize nuclear bombs, delivery systems and laboratories. His successor, Donald Trump, has said he wants to strengthen and expand his country s nuclear capability. The conservatives, Greens and FDP are hoping to end exploratory discussions on Thursday and move on to proper negotiations on forming a government. They remain divided on several key issues, including immigration, reforming the euro zone and climate policy. ",worldnews,"November 15, 2017 ",1
South Korean says U.S. must not strike North Korea without Seoul's consent,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump should  under no circumstances  take military action against North Korea without the consent of the government in Seoul, the chairwoman of South Korea s ruling party, Choo Mi-ae, said on Wednesday.  President Trump often emphasizes that he put all options on the table,  Choo told a Washington think-tank.  We want to make sure that this option of another war is not placed on the table. Under no circumstances should the U.S. go ahead and use a military option without the consent of South Korea.   We must seek a peaceful resolution of the matter in any manner that is available to us.  The remarks by Choo, who is expected to meet Trump administration officials in Washington, underscored South Korean concerns that any U.S. strikes against North Korea s nuclear and missile programs could provoke devastating North Korean retaliation against South Korea. Visiting Seoul last week, Trump warned North Korea he was prepared to use the full range of U.S. military power to stop any attack, but also urged Pyongyang to  make a deal.  Trump, who had previously called negotiations with North Korea a waste of time, has offered no clear path to talks and has sent mixed signals about his interest in negotiations. Speaking on his return from Asia, Trump said he and Chinese President Xi Jinping had rejected a  freeze for freeze  agreement. China and Russia have previously advocated such a plan, where the United States and South Korea stop major military exercises in exchange for North Korea halting its weapons programs. It was not clear if this was what Trump meant.  We agreed that we would not accept a so-called  freeze for freeze  agreement like those that have consistently failed in the past,  Trump said. There was no immediate comment from China s embassy in Washington. Pyongyang has shown little interest in negotiations, at least until it has developed a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland. Choo, whose president and fellow Democratic Party leader Moon Jae-in has advocated dialogue with North Korea, said Seoul backed Trump s policy of maximum pressure on Pyongyang through sanctions and there should be no talks for the sake of talks. However, she said blocking opportunities for dialogue could prompt North Korean  miscalculation.  She declined to say whether she was satisfied with the Trump administration s limited efforts to talk to Pyongyang to resolve the crisis stemming from North Korea s efforts to develop nuclear-tipped missiles capable of hitting the United States.

"U.N. to vote on rival U.S., Russia bids to renew Syria inquiry","UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations Security Council is due to vote on Thursday on rival U.S. and Russian bids to renew an international inquiry into chemical weapons attacks in Syria, diplomats said, a move that could trigger Russia s 10th veto to block action on Syria. The mandate for the joint inquiry by the U.N. and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which found the Syrian government used the banned nerve agent sarin in an April 4 attack, expires at midnight Thursday. The United States was first to ask for a vote on its draft resolution, followed quickly by Russia. A resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the United States, France, Russia, Britain or China to be adopted. Diplomats say there is little support among the 15-member council for the Russian draft, which Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia has said aims to correct  systemic errors  of the inquiry, known as the Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM). Russia has vetoed nine resolutions on Syria since the conflict started in 2011, including blocking an initial U.S. bid on Oct. 24 to renew the JIM, saying it wanted to wait for the release two days later of the inquiry s report that blamed a sarin gas attack on the Syrian government.  The United States hopes the Security Council will stand united in the face of chemical weapons use against civilians and extend the work of this critical group,  the U.S. mission to the United Nations said in a statement on Wednesday.   Not doing so would only give consent to such atrocities while tragically failing the Syrian people who have suffered from these despicable acts,  it said. While Russia agreed to the 2015 creation of the inquiry, known as the Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM), it has consistently questioned its findings, which also concluded that the Syrian government used chlorine as a weapon several times. A spokesman for the U.S. mission to the United Nations said on Monday that Russia has refused to engage in negotiations on the U.S. draft resolution. Diplomats said the United States had amended its draft in a bid to win Russian support. British U.N. Ambassador Matthew Rycroft warned on Wednesday that if the inquiry ended:  The only victors would be people who want to use chemical weapons in Syria, which is the (Syrian President Bashar) al-Assad regime plus Daesh (Islamic State).   Everyone in the Security Council would be shooting ourselves in the foot if we allowed that to happen,  he said.  The Russian mission to the United Nations was not immediately available for comment on the impending council vote. If the inquiry is not renewed, Nebenzia said on Monday:  It may send a bad signal, but the way the investigation has been conducted sends an even worse signal.  Syria agreed to destroy its chemical weapons in 2013 under a deal brokered by Russia and the United States. ",worldnews,"November 15, 2017 ",1
"May weathers new challenges on Brexit plan, more to come","LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May withstood new attempts to force concessions on her blueprint for leaving the European Union on Wednesday, the second day of a parliamentary debate that is deepening divisions over Brexit. May has been weakened by losing the Conservative Party s majority in a June election and faces hostility from many lawmakers, including some Conservatives, to various parts of the EU withdrawal bill which requires parliamentary approval. All attempts to amend the bill, on severing ties with the EU, have been voted down so far, but a debate next month on precisely when Britain should leave, and whether a time should be set at all, is be to test her authority. May urged lawmakers to work together ahead of a debate on several amendments aimed at entrenching EU protections on a wide range of issues from the environment to workers  rights.   We will be leaving the European Union on the 19th of March, 2019, and of course there is a lively debate going on in this place and that s right and proper, and that s important,  May said during the weekly prime minister s question time.  We are listening carefully to those who wish to improve the bill and I hope that we can all come together to deliver on the decision that the country took that we should leave the European Union.  The debates are likely to last for weeks on a bill seen by May as crucial to give companies confidence that there will be no major legal changes that affect business when Britain leaves the EU in March 2019. On the first day of debate on Tuesday, lawmakers broke down party lines in turning on each other with catcalls, jeers and accusations of treachery. Behind the debates is the fear of pro-Brexit lawmakers that Britain may never leave the EU, and of pro-EU politicians who are worried Britain might crash out of the EU without a deal.  Exit day  has become the focus for most in parliament with some lawmakers saying pro-Brexit politicians want a firm date on the bill - 11:00 p.m. on March 29, 2019 - to limit flexibility in talks with the EU that are deadlocked largely over money. May and her ministers are stepping up contacts with EU officials, trying to find ways to put pressure on negotiators in Brussels to try to push the talks forward by December, movement businesses say they need to make investment decisions.  On Wednesday, May met Manfred Weber, a leading lawmaker in the European Parliament and an ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, in London, where he expressed confidence that the difficulties in the talks could be overcome. The parliamentary debate is yet another headache for a prime minister, who has lost two ministers to scandals and faces calls to fire her foreign minister, Boris Johnson, over remarks he made about a jailed Iranian-British aid worker in Iran. She has tried to ease tensions by offering lawmakers some concessions on the bill, but has yet to convince all her lawmakers, many of whom have said they will not vote with the government on at least one of the debates, namely on  exit day .

"3,000 form chain of light against far right in Austrian government","VIENNA (Reuters) - At least 3,000 people formed a chain of light in Vienna on Wednesday to protest against the formation of a government that includes the far-right Freedom Party. Demonstrators holding flickering candles, torches and  bicycle lamps encircled the capital s government district.      Our republic s most powerful political offices should be exclusively reserved for trustworthy people who are not in the slightest connected to right-wing extremists,  said Alexander Pollak, spokesman for SOS Mitmensch, one of several human rights groups which organized the demonstration.  It was the biggest protest in Austria since coalition talks between the conservative People s Party (OVP) and the Freedom Party (FPO) started two weeks ago.

We are here because they (the FPO) feed hatred and want to divide people,  said Brigitte Griesser, holding a candle.      But the protest was far smaller than unrest 17 years ago, when the FPO last formed a government with the OVP and more than 100,000 took to the streets.

Libyan forces hit Islamic State camp with air strike: commander,"BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - East Libyan forces said they launched air strikes against suspected Islamic State militants on Wednesday south of the jihadist group s former stronghold of Sirte.  The Libyan air force struck and destroyed the biggest concentration of Daesh (Islamic State) south of Sirte, after monitoring the site over a period of time,  said Sherif al-Awami, an air force commander with the Libyan National Army. The site contained a large camp with military vehicles and stocks of petrol and water and had been used as a base for mounting attacks, he said. Islamic State was driven from Sirte last year and has been trying to regroup in the desert to the south, launching occasional forays into inhabited areas and attacks against local forces.  The United States has reported launching three sets of air strikes against jihadist camps in the area this year.   ",worldnews,"November 15, 2017 ",1
Peru's Kuczynski denies allegations of Odebrecht links,"LIMA (Reuters) - Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski said on Wednesday claims he had worked as a consultant for Brazilian construction company Odebrecht SA [ODBES.UL], which is embroiled in an international bribery scandal, were false. Kuczynski also said in a speech broadcast on television that he had never received any campaign donations from Odebrecht, which has admitted to paying millions of dollars of bribes in the country. The statements came a day after local newspaper El Comercio reported that the scandal-plagued company hired Kuczynski as a consultant a decade ago. Odebrecht SA acknowledged in a plea deal with U.S. and Brazilian prosecutors a year ago that it paid $29 million in bribes to officials in Peru over a decade spanning three presidencies as part of a massive graft scheme across much of Latin America and parts of Africa.  El Comercio reported that Marcelo Odebrecht, the jailed former head of the company, told prosecutors in Brazil that Odebrecht had hired Kuczynski after he served in the cabinet of former President Alejandro Toledo, and that the company might have funded his failed 2011 presidential bid.  Reuters could not verify what Odebrecht told Peruvian prosecutors in a meeting last week in Curitaba, Brazil. Kuczynski had earlier denied both any professional links and receiving campaign donations from Odebrecht on Twitter.  I did not receive any support from that company in either of my two electoral campaigns,  Kuczynski said in his speech on Wednesday.

The bombardment follows a surprise ground offensive by jihadist rebels on Tuesday on an army complex in the heart of the city s Eastern Ghouta region that has defied opposition assaults since the start of the conflict. The fortress-like Military Vehicles Administration in the government-held part of Harasta town has long been used to strike at the densely populated Eastern Ghouta, where over 300,000 people live under siege.  Rebels have failed in repeated offensives to seize the sprawling compound, from where surface-to-surface rockets are launched against the rebel enclave. Douma, the main city in opposition-held Eastern Ghouta, is only three km away.  The fighting is continuing and the shelling and air strikes are heavy near the base and most of the towns of the Ghouta,  said Abu Kutaiba, a military commander for Ahrar al Sham, an Islamist rebel group that has spearheaded the attack. A Syrian military source said on state media the army had repelled  terrorists who sought to infiltrate in large numbers,  killing tens and destroying their weaponry. It did not mention the heavy aerial strikes on opposition areas.  Backed by Russian strikes, government forces have escalated military operations against Eastern Ghouta in recent weeks, seeking to tighten a siege on the area, residents and rebels say. The rebel assault aims partly to relieve that pressure. The Eastern Ghouta is part of several de-escalation zones which Russia has brokered with rebels across Syria that has freed the army to redeploy in areas they can regain ground. The rebel offensive which began on Tuesday is the first since last March when mainstream Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebels staged an attack against government-held areas in northeastern Damascus. The rebels were forced to retreat after initial gains.  In retaliatory attacks, aerial strikes and shelling hit Harasta, Irbin, Misraba, Hamouriya, and Saqba towns in Eastern Ghouta with at least eight civilians killed and about 94 wounded in the last 20 hours alone, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and residents. After securing the last rebel pocket inside the capital s Qaboun district last May, the Syrian army has since concentrated its military drive against Ain Terma and Jobar, northeast of the capital in the Ghouta area.   Rebels helped by an elaborate network of underground tunnels have repelled repeated attempts to storm these areas.  The army and its militias have failed to make any progress and have had heavy losses,  said Alwan, a spokesman for the FSA s Failaq al Rahman rebel group. Backed by Russian strikes, the army has however gradually succeeded in the last year in shrinking rebel held control over Eastern Ghouta. The loss of agricultural land has compounded the humanitarian plight of civilians. The United Nations has warned of impending starvation if aid does not reach the area, where international deliveries have long been erratic and obstructed. ",worldnews,"November 15, 2017 ",1
U.S. embassy defends credibility of Liberia presidential poll,"MONROVIA (Reuters) - The U.S. embassy in Liberia on Wednesday defended the credibility of last month s presidential election there, amid allegations of irregularities and fraud that have delayed a run-off poll. First-round winner George Weah, a former international football star, was initially set to face the runner-up, Vice-President Joseph Boakai, last week to determine who will replace current term-limited President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.  But the third-place finisher, Charles Brumskine, contested the outcome of the first round, claiming gross irregularities had occurred and accusing NEC officials of fraud, an allegation the body denies.  No accredited Liberian, regional, or international observation group suggested that the cumulative anomalies observed reflect systemic issues sufficient to undermine the fundamental integrity of the electoral process,  the U.S. embassy said in a statement.   Liberia s Supreme Court ordered the elections commission to fully examine Brumskine s allegations last week, a decision likely to push back the run-off date by weeks and even creates the possibility of the first round being re-run. A number of first-round candidates, including Boakai, have publicly backed Brumskine s challenge to the results and echoed his fraud allegations.  The dispute led Johnson Sirleaf, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, to state in a radio address following the Supreme Court decision that Liberia s democracy was  under threat , without elaborating.  Efforts by any actors to impede the expressed will of Liberia s people for personal ambition could risk goodwill and future investments in Liberia by international partners,  the U.S. statement warned.   Liberia, Africa s oldest modern republic, was founded by freed U.S. slaves in 1847, and maintains a special relationship with the United States. The West African timber and rubber producer is still trying to heal the wounds of one of the continent s most brutal civil wars, which ended nearly 15 years ago. A successful vote would be its first democratic transfer of power in more than seven decades.    ",worldnews,"November 15, 2017 ",1
"EU cranks up criticism of Poland over court reforms, nationalist rally","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission on Wednesday voiced fresh concerns over Poland s plans to reform its courts and EU lawmakers accused Warsaw of promoting intolerance, reflecting deep fears for the rule of law in the country. Poland s nationalist, socially conservative ruling party, Law and Justice (PiS), in power since late 2015, is at loggerheads with the EU over its push to bring the courts and state media under more direct government control, as well as over migration and the logging of a primeval forest. PiS says the court reforms are needed for Poland s moral renewal and accuses the EU of heavy-handed meddling in the country s affairs. Critics say the changes threaten judicial independence and spell an erosion of democratic standards. PiS-allied President Andrzej Duda unexpectedly vetoed two of the government s judicial reforms in July and presented his own version of these draft laws, infuriating PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski and precipitating a power struggle in the ruling camp. The European Commission s deputy head, Frans Timmermans, told the European Parliament on Wednesday that even the draft laws proposed by Duda - which would row back somewhat from the options for direct government interference in the judiciary envisaged in the original PiS bills - were not acceptable.   At this preliminary stage of our assessment, the Commission already notes that certain issues in these draft laws could raise serious concerns,  Timmermans told EU lawmakers in their fifth debate on concerns about the rule of law in Poland. Timmermans urged Warsaw to align the drafts with EU democratic on judicial independence. EU concerns about developments in Poland escalated after a nationalist rally in Warsaw at the weekend that saw participants, their faces covered, waving banners bearing anti-Semitic, racist and xenophobic slogans such as  pure blood, clear mind  and  Europe will be white or uninhabited . Both Duda and Kaczynski condemned the racist banners but the government defended the march itself, held to mark the 99th anniversary of Polish independence. On Wednesday, Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski said the march, an annual occurrence since 2010, was valuable and important for stirring patriotism and love for Polish history.   There were incidents, it is true, there were banners and slogans that should not be there (...). The incidents are of course, reprehensible,  Waszczykowski told reporters. But, he added, the reaction of some politicians and some global media had been  manipulated  and  extremely  exaggerated.  It is not based on facts, it is based on fake news. I did not see any banners condemning the Jews, for example (...) There were references to migrants or refugees, but I did not hear of any anti-Semitic behavior.   Interior Minister Mariusz Blaszczak, who ordered no detentions or arrests of nationalists who displayed white supremacy slogans, though some counterprotesters were detained, said he  didn t see  any racist banners and thought the Independence Day rally had passed in  a very good atmosphere . Prime Minister Beata Szydlo told the conservative wpolityce.pl news portal on Wednesday that Poland is  free  of anti-Semitism and racism.  Marginal incidents should not be identified with the whole nation,  she said.     But the International Auschwitz Council, an advisory body to Szydlo s office, said it was alarmed about the resurgence of racist and anti-Semitic attitudes and public hate speech.  Knowing the tragic history of Auschwitz-Birkenau, there is no doubt where it can lead,  it said in a statement.  We therefore appeal to European governments for a strong response and effective countermeasures.  Many members of the European Parliament on Wednesday joined Jewish and human rights groups in expressing alarm at the attitudes on display during the Nov. 11 rally.  This was happening in Warsaw, in Poland, at less than 350 kilometers from Auschwitz and Birkenau,  said Guy Verhofstadt, head of the EU parliament s liberal group, referring to the Nazi death camp set up in occupied Poland where more than a million people, mostly Jews, were killed during World War Two.  Poland could still be a leader in Europe, but has degraded itself... by politicizing the constitutional court, curtailing civil society, muzzling the free media,  he said. Amnesty International echoed that criticism.  The Polish government is... increasingly restricting the freedom of assembly and expression, while peddling dangerously xenophobic rhetoric,  AI researcher Barbora Cernusakova said.     EU lawmakers voted by 438 to 152 against to demand that the 28 member states punish Warsaw by triggering Article 7 of the EU treaty, a procedure that could lead to Warsaw losing its voting rights in the bloc. Such a move is highly unlikely as it requires unanimity and Poland s ally Hungary, whose right-wing government is also under fire from Brussels, has promised to block any sanctions. A more likely punishment would be reducing the generous  development funds Poland receives from the EU. The Polish foreign ministry rejected the criticism from Timmermans and the European Parliament, accusing them of stigmatizing an EU member state.  There is nothing happening in Poland that would demand a debate by 700 members of the European Parliament,   Waszczykowski told reporters. ",worldnews,"November 15, 2017 ",1
UK's Johnson vows no stone unturned to free aid worker jailed in Iran,"LONDON (Reuters) - Foreign minister Boris Johnson said Britain would appeal to Iran on humanitarian grounds to free a jailed aid worker but expressed reservations that granting her diplomatic protection would help secure her release, her husband said on Wednesday. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, was sentenced to five years in prison after being convicted by an Iranian court of plotting to overthrow the clerical establishment. She denies the charges. Johnson came under pressure to resign after comments he made earlier this month that Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been teaching people journalism before her arrest in April 2016. Critics said the comments might have prompted Iran to extend her sentence and he apologized for his remarks on Monday. The Thomson Reuters Foundation, a charity organization that is independent of Thomson Reuters and operates independently of Reuters News, said Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been on holiday and had not been teaching journalism in Iran.  On Wednesday, Johnson met her husband Richard Ratcliffe and told him Britain would leave no stone unturned in its bid to free her, saying the British ambassador in Tehran had earlier raised her case again with the Iranian authorities.  Johnson also stressed the importance of an appeal on humanitarian grounds, Ratcliffe told reporters, saying it had been a positive meeting. But officials had questioned whether it would help to grant his wife diplomatic protection - a move that would explicitly make Zaghari-Ratcliffe s fate an issue in state-to-state relations rather than a purely consular case. A legal opinion prepared for the human rights charity Redress on Zaghari-Ratcliffe s case said the British government could grant her diplomatic protection as she is  predominantly  a British citizen who has been denied a fair trial.  I said I thought it would be important and helpful ... The foreign secretary and the Foreign Office expressed reservations,  Ratcliffe said. The Foreign Office said lawyers would meet in the next fortnight to discuss the issue further. Iran s state news agency IRNA also signaled such a move could backfire, citing comments by an unidentified international law expert.   In Iran s view, Zaghari is an Iranian citizen, and was tried, due to her illegal actions, and convicted in Iranian courts; and now she is serving her sentence,  it quoted the expert as saying.   Hence the UK s interference, other than through peaceful paths and humanitarian issues, is considered an intervention in Iran, and will (naturally) trigger Iran s severe reaction.  Ratcliffe said Johnson was  keen  to take him on a trip to Iran planned before the end of the year, which could allow him to see his wife and three-year-old daughter, who is being cared for by relatives in Iran, for the first time in 19 months.   For me it s very important to be going on that trip, to be standing alongside the foreign secretary and I understand that s a big ask. It s reasonably unprecedented, but I think it s important in our circumstances,  he said. Ratcliffe, who said his wife appeared to be on the edge of a nervous breakdown and was due to have further tests after finding lumps on her breasts, said he thought she was being used as a diplomatic bargaining chip.  There are fights that are nothing to do with us ... We re being used as a vehicle for those fights,  he said. ",worldnews,"November 15, 2017 ",1
Turkey asks U.S. about jailed trader: foreign ministry sources,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey has sent a note to U.S. authorities inquiring about the condition of gold trader Reza Zarrab, held in the United States awaiting trial on charges of evading U.S. sanctions on Iran,  Turkish Foreign Ministry sources said on Wednesday.  Following media reports about Reza Zarrab, our Washington Embassy has officially requested information from U.S. authorities, and have not yet received an answer,  the ministry spokesman s office said.  We will follow up the issue.  There was speculation in Turkish media after the U.S. Federal Bureau of Prisons website showed that Zarrab was released from prison on Nov. 8. However a spokesman for Acting U.S. Attorney Joon Kim in Manhattan said on Monday that Zarrab remained in federal custody.  The information that Zarrab was released is not factual,  Zarrab s lawyer Seyda Yildirim told Hurriyet newspaper on Wednesday.  He might have been moved to a different section. We haven t been informed in five days, we are unable to receive any information.  Zarrab has pleaded not guilty to the charges of sanctions evasion.  Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has said U.S. prosecutors have  ulterior motives  in the case, by including references to him and his wife in court papers. ",worldnews,"November 15, 2017 ",1
Thai court looks into lawsuit against owner of Leicester City,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - A Thai criminal court on Monday said it would proceed to determine whether it would hear a case in a 14 billion baht ($423 million) lawsuit brought against Thai duty-free giant King Power International, the company that owns English Premier League football club Leicester City. The Central Criminal Court for Corruption and Misconduct Cases in Bangkok said it would look into the allegations made in the lawsuit to determine whether there was a case to be heard, and would review the list of potential evidence and witnesses in February ahead of preliminary hearings.     Charnchai Issarasenanark, at the time an anti-graft official, filed the suit in a private capacity in July against the duty-free retailer, which is owned by billionaire Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha and his family. The committee of which Charnchai was a member has since become defunct as part of the military government s plan to restore democracy.    The suit accuses King Power of criminally failing to pay the Thai government 14 billion baht from the operation of the airport franchise it was granted in 2006.    The suit was also brought against executives from the state-owned airport operator, Airports of Thailand (AOT). In a statement on Monday, King Power said:  The allegations in question have yet to be accepted by the court and are categorically denied. King Power has always followed and been absolutely committed to the highest standards in proper and ethical business practice. We are proud of our company s good name and honest reputation and will fight rigorously any attempts to discredit them.  The AOT was not immediately available for comment. Self-made businessman Vichai founded King Power in 1989. The duty-free business took off in 2006 when it was granted an airport monopoly under the government of then prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, but it continued to prosper even after Thaksin s ouster in a coup that year. Vichai bought Leicester City in August 2010. The family s empire also includes Belgian football club, Oud-Heverlee Leuven, Accor s Pullman hotels in Thailand and a controlling stake in Asia Aviation Pcl, operator of low-cost carrier Thai AirAsia.

Lebanon accuses Saudi Arabia of holding its PM hostage,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - France said on Wednesday that Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri, who Lebanon s president says is being held hostage by Saudi Arabia, will visit France with his family in coming days.  Hariri travelled to Riyadh on Nov. 3 before abruptly resigning in a televised statement a day later. He has stayed in Riyadh and top Lebanese officials and senior politicians close to Hariri have told Reuters he was forced to quit.  Hariri and Saudi Arabia have both denied he is being held in Riyadh or was coerced to resign. Hariri has said he will return to Lebanon in the next few days to formally submit his resignation.    The crisis has thrust Lebanon onto the frontline of a Middle East contest for power pitting a Saudi-led bloc against Iran and its allies, including the Lebanese Shi ite group Hezbollah.      French President Emmanuel Macron said in a statement that he had invited Hariri to France after speaking to him and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.  The invitation is to visit for a few days and is not an offer of political exile, Macron said, speaking in Germany.   We will not accept (Hariri) remaining a hostage whose reason for detention we do not know,  Lebanese President Michel Aoun said in a statement.  Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil, the head of Aoun s political party, said the situation was  not normal  but that Beirut wanted  good relations  with Riyadh. Aoun has said he will not accept Hariri s resignation until he returns to Lebanon to formally tender it and explain his reasons, which Hariri has said he will do in the coming days.     Saudi Arabia has long been considered Hariri s main external supporter. Aoun is a political ally of Lebanon s Hezbollah, a powerful Shi ite Muslim group with close ties to Iran.  Lebanon s coalition government was formed last year through a political deal that made Aoun president, Hariri prime minister, and included members of Hezbollah in the cabinet.  Saudi Arabia last week accused Lebanon of having declared war on it because of Hezbollah s role in other Arab countries. It regards Hezbollah as a terrorist organisation.  Riyadh s main ally, the United States, has struck a different tone, continuing its support for Lebanon including military aid. The European Union has also repeatedly stated its support for Lebanon, which hosts 1.5 million Syrian refugees.  In an interview on Sunday night with a television station he owns, Hariri warned of economic sanctions against Lebanon and of a threat to the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of Lebanese workers living in Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies.   Nothing justifies Hariri s lack of return for 12 days. We therefore consider him detained,  Aoun said. He added that Lebanon had confirmed that Hariri s family were under detention in their house in Saudi Arabia and were searched whenever they entered or left it.  Speaking in Italy, Foreign Minister Bassil said:  We will continue all steps...for this problem to be solved in a brotherly way through good relations that we want to have with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.   He added, however:  If Saudi Arabia has a problem with Iran or with Hezbollah, they have to solve it with Iran, not with Lebanon and not with all the Lebanese.   Hariri wrote on Twitter that he was  perfectly fine  and would return,  God willing, to dear Lebanon as I promised . On Wednesday he said he would return in a couple of days but that his family was staying in Saudi Arabia, calling it  their country . Hariri holds Saudi nationality and his family fortune is based on the construction company - Saudi Oger - built by his father Rafik al-Hariri, who served twice as Lebanese prime minister and was assassinated in 2005.       Okab Sakr, a member of parliament for Hariri s Future Movement, told Reuters he had spoken on Wednesday to Hariri and that he told him neither he nor his family were being held.  On Tuesday, European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said after meeting Bassil in Paris that she expected Hariri and his family to return to Lebanon soon.  Sources from across Lebanon s political spectrum have said Hariri struck a more compromising tone in his Sunday interview than in his resignation statement, when he bitterly attacked Iran and Hezbollah.  The sources said this represented a retreat by Riyadh attributable to Western pressure. On Wednesday, Aoun said Riyadh had not responded to Arab countries who tried to secure Hariri s return so he had asked the international community to help.  French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian arrives in Riyadh late on Wednesday and is due to discuss Lebanon with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and meet Hariri on Thursday, a French diplomatic source said. France has close relations with Lebanon, which was under French control between the world wars, and with Hariri, who has a home in France and spent several years in the country.

France's Macron invites Hariri and family to France,"PARIS (Reuters) - Lebanon s Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri and his family will travel to France in coming days, a French presidential source said on Wednesday, after Emmanuel Macron invited him as part of efforts to defuse tensions in the Middle East. Speaking in the German city of Bonn after a climate conference, Macron said his invitation was not an offer of exile for Hariri, who announced his abrupt resignation as premier 11 days ago from the Saudi capital Riyadh. Lebanese President Michel Aoun, who has refused to accept his prime minister s resignation, earlier on Wednesday accused the Saudis of holding Hariri hostage - and called this an act of aggression. Asked if he was offering Hariri exile, Macron said:  No, not at all. I hope that Lebanon will be stable, and that political choices should be in accordance with institutional rule.  We need a strong Lebanon with her territorial integrity respected. We need leaders who are free to make their own choices and speak freely.  France has close relations with Lebanon, which was under French control between the world wars, and with Hariri, who has a home in France and spent several years in the country. His father Rafik was a close friend of former French President Jacques Chirac.  Macron s invitation came after he spoke to both Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Hariri by telephone, the Elysee said in a statement.  Saudi Arabia has denied detaining Hariri or coercing him to quit. One source in the presidential Elysee Palace said Hariri was expected to arrive in France  in the coming days .  France s offer appeared to be a last-minute one, with no indication from French officials this morning that this was on the cards. A French government spokesman in a weekly briefing even called on Hariri to return to Beirut to offer his resignation. French diplomats in Paris appeared caught off-guard. They said Macron had found a way to get Hariri out of Saudi Arabia without any side losing face, but questioned how this would pan out in the longer term.   This has come out of the blue,  one diplomat said.   The president wants to ease tensions ... but we re also going round in circles. Are we just inheriting the problems?  Hariri on Wednesday reiterated on Twitter that he would soon return to Beirut. It was not clear whether he might stop in Beirut before coming to Paris.  France s foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, arrived in Riyadh on Wednesday evening to dine with Crown Prince Mohammed and will meet Hariri on Thursday afternoon.  Saudi Arabia has long been considered Hariri s main external supporter. Aoun is a political ally of Lebanon s Hezbollah, a powerful Shi ite Muslim group with close ties to Iran. Lebanon s coalition government was formed last year through a political deal that made Aoun president, Hariri prime minister, and included members of Hezbollah in the cabinet. Macron last week made a last-minute stopover in Riyadh on his way back from the Gulf to see Crown Prince Mohammed, and has since spoken to Aoun and hosted the Lebanese foreign minister in Paris on Tuesday.

"Russian lawmakers approve ""foreign agents"" media law","MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia s lower house of parliament on Wednesday approved a law that would give Moscow the power to force foreign media to brand the news they provide to Russians as the work of  foreign agents  and also to disclose where they get their funding. The legislation needs approval from the upper house of parliament, which is likely to happen next week, and the signature of President Vladimir Putin before it becomes law.  In a sign that the authorities intend to enforce the law soon, a source in the Russian Justice Ministry said on Wednesday it had notified three U.S. news outlets they might be affected.  The source told Russian news agencies that Voice of America (VoA), a Russian unit of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) called Idel.Realias, and Current Time, produced by RFE/RL in cooperation with VoA, had all been notified. Joanna Levison, a Prague-based spokeswoman for RFE/RL, said she was not aware of any such notification. VoA and the Justice Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Russia s broadside against U.S. media is part of the fallout from allegations that the Kremlin interfered in the U.S. presidential election last year in favor of Donald Trump. U.S. intelligence officials accuse the Kremlin of using Russian media organizations it finances to influence U.S. voters, and this week Washington required Russian state broadcaster RT to register a U.S.-based affiliate company as a  foreign agent . The Kremlin denies meddling in the election and has said the restrictions on Russian broadcasters in the United States are an attack on free speech. It has vowed to retaliate by imposing restrictions on some foreign media operating in Russia. In the 450-seat State Duma, 414 lawmakers voted on Wednesday for the new bill in a third and final reading, with none against, Russian news agencies reported. If the upper chamber and Putin also back the draft, it will become law, but implementation of its provisions would be left to the discretion of the Russian government.      Putin has been fiercely critical of U.S. measures towards Russian media, but he has not given wholehearted support to the draft legislation, saying at the weekend it  might be a little too harsh .  The draft legislation states that Russian authorities can designate foreign media as  foreign agents , making them subject to the same requirements that are applied to foreign-funded non-governmental organizations under a 2012 law. That law, heavily criticized by Western governments, was an attempt by Moscow to insulate itself from a wave of popular revolutions in eastern Europe and the Middle East. Moscow said they were fomented by Western governments using civil society groups as proxies. Under the 2012 law,  foreign agents  have to include in any information they publish or broadcast to Russian audiences a mention of their  foreign agent  designation. They also have to apply for inclusion in a government register, submit regular reports on their sources of funding, on their objectives, on how they spend their money, and who their managers are. They can be subject to spot checks by the authorities to make sure they comply with the rules, according to the 2012 law.  RFE/RL s Levison said she did not want to speculate what steps Russia might take against her organization next and said RFE/RL looked forward to continuing its journalistic work. She said it was  inappropriate  to view the new Russian measures as being reciprocal since Russian-funded news outlets in the United States were still able to distribute freely.  ... RFE/RL has lost its broadcast affiliates in Russia due to administrative pressures, and has no access to cable. RFE/RL reporters are (also) subject to harassment and physical attack in Russia,  Levison added.   ",worldnews,"November 15, 2017 ",1

Merkel's EU ally says more confident about resolving Brexit problems,"LONDON (Reuters) - Manfred Weber, a leading lawmaker in the European Parliament, said on Wednesday he was more confident about Britain and the European Union ironing out difficulties in the Brexit talks. Weber, an ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel in the parliament, spoke after meeting Theresa May in London but would not say whether the British prime minister had signalled she was ready to move on a financial settlement with the EU. Negotiations to unravel more than 40 years of union have stalled over the divorce bill, with EU officials increasingly frustrated that Britain has not detailed its approach to settling what it owes the bloc when it leaves in March 2019.  After my meetings here in London my main message is I am more optimistic, there is progress ... That is the most important thing because the perspective from a European point of view towards London was in the last weeks not so clear,  Weber told a news conference. Asked whether there was any movement on the financial settlement, he declined to comment on what he described as private discussions with May. A spokesman for May said in a statement that she and Weber had discussed an  implementation period  to smooth Britain s departure from the bloc, and that Weber had asked what  this would look like in practice .  The Secretary of State for Exiting the EU (Brexit minister David Davis, who was also present) outlined the need to avoid a cliff-edge (exit) - including for the stability of the financial sector across Europe,  the spokesman said.

"Head of Afghan election body sacked, raising doubts over 2018 ballots","KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan President Ashraf Ghani sacked the chairman of the country s Independent Election Commission on Wednesday, raising doubts over whether parliamentary and council ballots scheduled for next year will take place as planned. Najibullah Ahmadzai, head of the body charged with organizing the elections, had faced growing pressure following repeated delays to preparations for them and had lost the support of both Ghani and disillusioned foreign donors. The 2018 votes are seen as dry runs for a presidential election in 2019 and a key test of the progress made by Afghanistan s Western-backed government towards establishing durable democratic institutions. Following a contentious presidential election in 2014, marred by allegations of massive voter fraud on both sides, international donor countries have laid heavy emphasis on the need for successful elections next year. But planning has been beset by a mix of technical and political problems that have made the officially scheduled date of July 2018 increasingly unrealistic. Five members of the seven-member IEC wrote to Ghani this week accusing Ahmadzai of was incompetence. Ambitious plans for a biometric voter registration system had to be abandoned and squabbling between members of parliament and Ghani s fragile National Unity Government over issues including who sits on the election commission have caused months of delay. The problems underline the fragility of the political institutions created in Afghanistan since a U.S.-led campaign brought down the Taliban in 2001. The bitter 2014 presidential election produced no agreed winner and led to a U.S.-brokered deal which saw former rivals Ghani and Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah forced into an uneasy coalition that has struggled to win popular support. District council elections have never been held, despite being mandated in the 2004 constitution, while the current parliament s term was supposed to end in June 2015 but has been extended due to the difficulty of holding new elections. Last month, officials from international partners including the United Nations told the Afghan government that even under the most favorable conditions, the earliest date on which an election could feasibly be held was Oct. 2018.  Many Western diplomats believe even that date is impossible. If not ready by October, Afghanistan s mountainous terrain, bad roads and lack of security mean that registering voters and setting up balloting stations across the country are likely to face severe delays over the winter months, potentially pushing the date into the following year.

At least 15 dead in flash floods on Greek coast,"MANDRA, Greece (Reuters) - Flash floods killed at least 15 people, made scores homeless and destroyed infrastructure in Greece on Wednesday after a raging torrent inundated two coastal towns west of Athens following a night of heavy rain. In devastation locals said was unprecedented in scale, an overnight deluge triggered flash floods in the industrial towns of Nea Peramos and Mandra in the foothills of a mountain just west of Athens. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras declared a period of national mourning.  These are very difficult moments for Greece. We are living a great disaster,  he said in a state address.  Immediately and without delay support measures will be adopted for households and businesses affected,  he said, without going into details. Residents said they were woken on Wednesday morning by rainwater and mud coming through their homes. As the scale of destruction became clearer during the day, large areas were covered in water and mud. In some areas floodwaters rose to the first story of small buildings.  There was just an incredible amount of water which caused raging torrents,  said Yiannis Kapakis, the head of Greece s civil protection service. Torrential rain of this type is uncommon in Greece, where poor infrastructure can leave citizens vulnerable to flooding. It has been raining steadily for about a week, and the country s met office issued a new severe weather warning for Thursday. Some residents were forced onto rooftops and balconies while cars were thrust onto porches of homes, rammed like dodgem vehicles into tree trunks or tipped onto their side.   This is a biblical disaster,  Mandra Mayor Yianna Krikouki told state broadcaster ERT.  Everything is gone.  The Attica prefecture, the administrative district for both towns, said it would seek assistance from the EU Solidarity Fund, set up to respond to natural disasters. A state of emergency was declared in the region.  The walls collapsed, the cars were carried away and they broke everything here. There is nothing left,  resident Marina Kolia said.  Water is everywhere in the house.  Mandra and Nea Peramos have a combined population of about 20,000. Many Greek housing settlements are built without taking into account town planning regulations. An Athens prosecutor ordered an urgent preliminary investigation into the deaths and destruction caused and was also investigating possible urban planning offences. On Tuesday, Greece declared a state of emergency on the eastern island of Symi, just off the coast of Turkey, after a storm swept cars into the sea, damaged homes and cut off electricity and water supplies.

Eyes on the 'Crocodile' as Zimbabwe military sweeps to power,"HARARE (Reuters) - When Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe sacked his vice-president in front of 12,000 baying party members in 2014, Emmerson Mnangagwa sat quietly in the crowd, a green baseball cap pulled low over his eyes. The man who stood to gain most from the dismissal betrayed nothing through his expression and gentle clapping - a survival tactic honed during five decades of service to the mercurial Mugabe. His cap, however, spoke volumes. Emblazoned across its front, next to a portrait of Mugabe, were four words:  Indigenise, Empower, Develop, Employ  - a slogan of the ruling ZANU-PF party. Speaking at the congress, Mnangagwa reinforced the message from his headgear, announcing revisions to the party s constitution that backed  total ownership and control  of Zimbabwe s natural resources. It was a key insight to the party s direction as it contemplated life beyond Mugabe.  We will remain forever masters of our own destiny,  Mnangagwa said, to cheers from the crowd. With Mugabe, 93, held following Wednesday s military takeover in Harare, questions have arisen about what the future holds for Mnangagwa, whose sacking from the post of vice president last week brought the political crisis to a head.  There are no arguments around his credentials to provide strong leadership and stability, but there are questions over whether he can also be a democrat,  said Eldred Masunungure, a political science lecturer at the University of Zimbabwe. The whereabouts of Mugabe s wife Grace, 52, whose prospects of succeeding the president appeared to have been helped by Mnangagwa s dismissal, are presently unknown.   With his appointment in 2014 as official deputy to Mugabe, Mnangagwa had appeared well set as the eventual successor to Africa s oldest head of state. The 75-year-old was one of Mugabe s most trusted lieutenants, having been at his side in prison, during wartime and then in government. Along the way, he earned the nickname  Ngwena , Shona for crocodile, an animal famed in Zimbabwean lore for its stealth and ruthlessness. Mnangagwa backed Mugabe s economic nationalism, especially a drive to force foreign firms to hand majority stakes to local blacks, suggesting he may not be the pro-market pragmatist many investors were hoping for. He has been in every administration since independence, holding posts as varied as minister of state security, defense and finance, as well as speaker of parliament. Most controversially, he was in charge of internal security in the mid-1980s when Mugabe deployed a crack North Korean-trained brigade against rebels loyal to his rival Joshua Nkomo. Rights groups say 20,000 civilians, mostly from the Ndebele tribe, were killed. Mugabe denies genocide or crimes against humanity but has admitted it was a  moment of madness . Mnangagwa s role remains shrouded in mystery, typical of a political operator trained as a communist guerrilla in China in the 1960s and who always stayed in the shadows behind Mugabe. Secretive and insular, he prefers to operate under the radar, those in his inner circle say, and when pushed into a corner, resorts to jokes and trivia to avoid serious discussion.  I wouldn t say he is deceptive but it s fair to say his default position is to crack jokes and deflect uncomfortable questions by asking endless questions,  one member of parliament close to him said.  He is very conscious that his public image is that of a hard man but he is a much more complex personality - pleasant and an amazing story-teller,  the politician, also from Mnangagwa s Midlands Province, told Reuters. Mnangagwa s appointment as vice president appointment came a day after his predecessor Joice Mujuru was fired for allegedly planning to topple Mugabe. Asked whether the purge would weaken the party, a smiling Mnangagwa said:  The revolution has a way of strengthening itself. It goes through cycles, this is another cycle where it rids itself of elements that had now become inconsistent with the correct line.  Mnangagwa learnt his politics in prison in the 1960s after being sentenced to death for sabotage by British authorities following his capture while in one of the earliest guerrilla units fighting white colonial rule in what was then Rhodesia. He was 19 and only spared the noose by a law prohibiting the execution of convicts under 21. After a decade in prison, often sharing a cell with Mugabe, Mnangagwa became personal assistant to the leader of the liberation struggle, and went on to head the guerrilla movement s feared internal security bureau. In January, a photograph appeared in local media showing Mnangagwa enjoying drinks with a friend. In his hand was a large novelty mug emblazoned with the words:  I M THE BOSS.  To supporters of Mugabe, this bordered on treason. They suspected that Mnangagwa already saw himself in the leader s shoes. When Mugabe fired Mnangagwa as vice president last week for showing  traits of disloyalty , he removed a possible successor who was also one of his last remaining liberation war comrades. But relations had already cooled between the two men after suggestions by Mnangagwa s allies in August that he had been poisoned by ice cream from a dairy owned by the Mugabes.

"Britain's May sees off challenges to Brexit plan, so far","LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May s blueprint to leave the European Union emerged unscathed on Tuesday from a first day of debate in parliament on legislation to sever ties with the bloc. The debate, expected to last for weeks, is on the EU withdrawal bill, seen by May as crucial to give companies confidence that there will be no major legal changes that affect business when Britain leaves the EU in March 2019. Opponents want to use the debate to force concessions on May s plan for leaving the bloc, but the initial challenges - including on the hour and day Britain should pull out as well as on the future role of the EU court - were voted down or dropped. The prime minister will face tougher battles as the debate goes on, testing her ability to steer through a bill intended largely to  copy and paste  European rules and regulations into British law by the time it leaves the 28-member EU. Her absence from parliament on Tuesday due to other engagements suggested she was not unduly worried by the initial discussion. But the debate s ill-tempered tone showed the level of anger in parliament with a government which some lawmakers say is mounting a power grab to force through its plans. With catcalls, sarcastic jokes and jeers being bandied about - not just between the two main parties, as is the custom, but often within them - many of the divisions before Britain voted in June 2016 to leave the EU re-emerged.  You re a disgrace,  one Conservative lawmaker yelled at another, while a Labour member of parliament openly quarreled with his colleagues in the main opposition party over which way their supporters voted in last year s referendum. Anna Soubry, a Conservative lawmaker, went on to criticize the  bullying  tactics of the Telegraph newspaper, who published the names of those politicians in May s party who voted against the government on the exact timing of Brexit. Behind the debate was the fear of pro-Brexit lawmakers that Britain may never leave the EU, and of pro-EU lawmakers who are worried Britain might crash out of the EU without a deal. The debates go to the heart of what parliament calls  one of the largest legislative projects ever undertaken in the UK , a process that could undermine May s already fragile authority. May, 61, has lost two ministers to scandals and her foreign minister, Boris Johnson, is facing calls to resign over remarks he made about a jailed Iranian-British aid worker in Iran. The Sunday Times has reported that 40 Conservatives support a no-confidence vote. May s Conservative government depends on a small Northern Irish party for its majority since a June election which dented her authority, and many lawmakers - even some Conservatives - will use the debate to increase pressure. The prime minister has tried to ease tensions by offering lawmakers some concessions on the bill before the debate began. But her moves have not yet eased everyone s concerns. One of her lawmakers, pro-EU Ken Clarke, ended his speech by saying:  I am a rebel.  ",worldnews,"November 14, 2017 ",1
Sweden says Congo not helping investigation into murder of U.N. monitor,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Swedish prosecutors accused Democratic Republic of Congo s government on Wednesday of not cooperating with their investigation into the murder of a U.N. sanctions monitor from Sweden. Zaida Catalan and her American colleague, Michael Sharp, were shot dead in March and found in a shallow grave in an area of central Congo where they had been gathering information on a conflict between the army and a militia. Congo s government has arrested more than a dozen people in connection with the killings, which it blames on the militia - though one report to the U.N. Security Council suggested state security services could also be involved. The Swedish Prosecution Authority launched its own investigation into Catalan s death, and said on Wednesday it had received no response to a request it made in April for information from Congolese authorities.  The Swedish investigation is facing severe difficulties given the fact that it is completely reliant on evidence that exists in the Congo and cooperation is not working with Congo,  prosecutor Sara Nilsson said in the statement. Material that Swedish authorities had managed to collect  does not exclude that persons who have close ties to the regime in Congo are involved in the murders,  the Authority added. In April, Congo s government screened a video to reporters, which it said showed members of the militia killing Catalan and Sharp. But analysts said the grainy footage raised more questions than it answered and Nilsson told Reuters the screening had tainted important evidence.  Congo s government spokesman Lambert Mende has denied Congolese officials were involved in the murders and said on Wednesday that it was up to Swedish authorities to provide information to the Congolese court hearing the case, not the other way around.  Justice is rendered here because the crime was committed here,  Mende said.  If they have information that the court might not be able to access, they should give it to the court.  The conflict in Kasai region between Congo s army and the Kamuina Nsapu militia has killed as many as 5,000 people and displaced around 1.5 million more since August last year.  The United Nations has repeatedly accused Congolese forces of using excessive force and targeting civilians with alleged ties to the militia. The government denies those charges.

Zimbabweans in South Africa hope for change at home as army seizes power,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Zimbabweans living in South Africa hope the move by the military to seize power from President Robert Mugabe will end corruption, abuse of power and economic hardships, even though uncertainty remained as to who was in charge. Zimbabwe s military seized power early on Wednesday saying it was targeting  criminals  around Mugabe, 93, who has ruled Zimbabwe since independence in 1980. Several million Zimbabweans have fled the country, mostly to South Africa, after the economy shrank by more than a third from 2000 to 2008 following the collapse of the agriculture sector. Unemployment rose to over 80 percent. Many in the diaspora said they were happy to see change back home at last.  I think it s a step in the right direction for a political situation which was now a joke,  Kevin Mpofu, 28, said.  The arrests that have happened so far are a celebration for many Zimbabweans tired of the corruption and abuse of power.  A 30-year-old Zimbabwean working as a marketing officer in South Africa who gave his name as Billy said it was  about time but it might be 20 years too late.  He worried that one strongman might follow another:  It may be hard in future to remove that person as well. We might have another 37 years ahead of us of a single person.  The main goal of the generals appears to be preventing Mugabe s wife Grace, 52, from succeeding him. The military stepped in after Mugabe sacked his presumed successor, Vice President Emerson Mnangagwa, last week. Mnangagwa s unexpected downfall followed months of sometimes vitriolic attacks by Grace Mugabe, who used national rallies organized by ZANU-PF youths to attack her party rivals.  We have suffered way too long under Mugabe, and ironically to some point Grace Mugabe is our hero. If it wasn t for her big mouth and her big ego this situation would not have happened,  said 36 year-old Mbangeni Nyathi, Johannesburg-based spokesman for Tajamuka, a pressure group calling for change in Zimbabwe.  We are not sure who is in charge but we are ready for any kind of change. Our hope is for the military to pave way for free and fair elections,  he added. Zimbabwe s economy briefly stabilized from 2010-2014 when Mugabe was forced to accept a power-sharing government with the opposition, but since then the recovery has unraveled. A chronic shortage of dollars has led to long queues outside banks and imported goods are running out. Asked if he would return to Zimbabwe if the economy was revived, Billy said:  Definitely, there is no place like home.  ",worldnews,"November 15, 2017 ",1
Memories in milk bottles: Polish exhibition 'shouts out' annihilation story of Warsaw Ghetto,"WARSAW (Reuters) - A deeply moving exhibition of archives documenting the life and annihilation of Jews by Nazi Germany in the Warsaw Ghetto during World War Two goes on public display in Poland on Thursday. The  What We Could Not Shout Out To The World  exhibition will for the first time display original documents prepared and hidden by historian Emanuel Ringelblum and a few dozen helpers who risked their lives in the Ghetto to save whatever was possible for posterity. Nazi occupiers in 1940 corralled some 400,000 Jews into a small section of Warsaw most of whom were then sent to camps to be killed or died from the conditions in the Ghetto itself. The Ghetto was destroyed in 1943 when the Nazis, attempting more deportations, were met with fierce opposition and a month long uprising. The exhibition marks the completion of many years of work to organize and translate the archives, and often decipher the documents that were partly damaged. Ringelblum and all but three of his aides perished in the Holocaust. But deep under the rubble of the burnt-down Ghetto they left a one-of-a-kind, meticulous chronicle of extermination.  We want to help shout out all that they said, find a language that will make this archive well-known and accessible,  said Pawel Spiewak, head of the Jewish Historical Institute in Warsaw where the exhibition is held. The Ringelblum archive, consisting of more than 35,000 pages, survived the war and destruction of the Warsaw Ghetto in 10 metal cases and two metal milk bottles that were recovered in 1946 and 1950, respectively. In 1999, the Ringelblum archives were assigned  Memory of the World  status by UNESCO, along with such Polish documents as the original manuscripts of composer Frederic Chopin and the treatises of astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus.  We want to show that this archive deserves this title,  Spiewak said.  It has to be shown and that people have to see it.      The archives include documents in Polish, German and Yiddish, Nazi proclamations and Jewish appeals, ghetto ration cards, tram tickets, private letters and photographs depicting life in the ghetto.

Gunmen shoot dead police officer and family in southwest Pakistan,"ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Gunmen on a motorcycle shot dead a senior Pakistani police officer, as well as his wife, son and grandson on Wednesday as the family was driving in Baluchistan province, officials said.  Two attackers opened fire on the vehicle carrying District Superintendent Muhammad Ilyas and his relatives to Quetta, the capital of the southwestern region, police said. His four-year-old granddaughter survived and was taken to hospital, they added. Authorities say there has been a surge in attacks on security officials in Baluchistan, with five suicide bombings and one armed attack targeting police in the past six months. No group immediately claimed responsibility for Wednesday s shooting - though Sunni militants and sectarian groups linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State, as well as the Taliban, operate in the region that borders Afghanistan and Iran. Separatists have also fought a long insurgency there, demanding a greater share of the region s gas and mineral resources and an end to what they say is discrimination.  Baluchistan is at the center of the $57 billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a planned transport and energy link from western China to Pakistan s southern deep-water port of Gwadar.

Bahrain says deadly bus attack engineered by Iran,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Bahrain said on Wednesday a bomb attack on a police bus which killed an officer and wounded nine last month was carried out by a militant cell trained by its arch-foe Iran. After authorities quashed Shi ite Muslim-led  Arab Spring  protests on the Sunni-ruled island in 2011, militants have launched deadly bombing and shooting attacks against security forces that Bahrain blames on Tehran s Shi ite theocracy.  Iran denies any role in Bahrain s unrest. There was no immediate Iranian reaction to Wednesday s Bahraini interior ministry statement, which added that authorities had arrested one member of the cell while others were fugitives in Iran.  The terrorist cell received extensive training in Iranian Revolutionary Guard camps on the use and manufacture of explosives and firearms, as well as material and logistical support,  the ministry said. Bahrain said earlier this week that an explosion at its main oil pipeline on Friday was caused by  terrorist  sabotage, linking the unprecedented attack to Iran. A key Western ally and host to the U.S. Fifth Fleet, Gulf Arab monarchy Bahrain has for years grappled with protests and sporadic violence coming from its Shi ite majority.

Kidnapped Saudi released in Lebanon: Lebanese news agency,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Kidnappers in Lebanon have released a Saudi Arabian man whose abduction was announced by Riyadh last week, Lebanon s National News Agency reported on Wednesday.  The case comes during a diplomatic crisis between Lebanon and Saudi Arabia.   The kidnapped Saudi ... was released. He was handed over to the Lebanese army intelligence,  the agency reported.  Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain have advised their citizens against traveling to Lebanon and urged those already there to leave as tensions have risen.  Lebanese President Michel Aoun on Wednesday accused Saudi Arabia of holding hostage Saad al-Hariri, who resigned as Lebanon s prime minister on Nov. 4 in a televised statement broadcast from Riyadh, where he had traveled on Nov. 3.  Saudi Arabia and Hariri both deny that he is being held by the kingdom.  When Saudi Arabia said last week that one of its nationals had been abducted, Lebanese Interior Minister Nohad Machnouk said the safety of Saudi residents and visitors was a priority for the Lebanese authorities.

"Against the clock, German parties haggle over immigration, euro budget","BERLIN (Reuters) - With just one day left to conclude exploratory talks on forming a new coalition government, German parties were still far apart on Wednesday on the hot issue of immigration and the future governance of the euro zone. Merkel, 63, wants the exploratory talks to end on Thursday, when German media expect her to press all sides to strike a compromise before moving to formal negotiations that could lead to her securing a fourth term as Chancellor. Merkel is hoping to put together an unlikely alliance of her conservatives, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the ecologist Greens - a combination untested at national level but a deal which could head off fresh elections. The parties are struggling to reach agreement on the touchy issue of immigration, with the Greens firmly opposed to a conservative plan to cap at 200,000 per year the number of migrants Germany will accept for humanitarian reasons. The parties are also at odds over the number of foreigners who qualify to join relatives granted asylum in Germany. Differences over whether Germany should back a French proposal to create a joint euro zone budget also highlight the difficulties Merkel faces in trying to forge the awkward alliance. A document seen by Reuters, describing a possible government s stance on European issues, contains bracketed sentences reflecting areas of disagreement that must be settled by party leaders on Wednesday.  [The following compromise proposal could not be reached: There is a need for a capacity to buffer extraordinary, unpredictable economic emergency situations which are beyond the control of individual member states...],  one passage reads. Another sentence, described as the FDP position read:  We do not support a fiscal capacity in order to buffer the effects of economic shocks.  The paper contains two alternate phrasings on the banking union, one supported by Merkel s conservatives and the left-leaning Greens, and another with more hardline language backed by the pro-business FDP. THWARTING THE FAR-RIGHT Merkel needs a deal to head off fresh elections that mainstream politicians fear could see the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) make further gains after it surged into parliament for the first time after a September election. Businesses are eager for the parties to reach a deal.  We believe that all parties involved have understood the urgency to reach an agreement by Christmas,  said Dieter Kempf, chief of Germany s largest industry association, the BDI, warning that prolonged uncertainty could hit investment. The mood music coming out of the talks has been mixed. Late on Tuesday, Merkel and other senior conservatives drank wine with Greens co-leader Katrin Goering-Eckardt, conservative party sources said. But the coalition negotiations are complicated by the dynamics within the conservative bloc, which comprises Merkel s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and their Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU). The CSU, worried about losing support in a state election next year, is uncompromising on immigration - a risk for the three-way  Jamaica  coalition, so-called because the parties  colours match those of the Caribbean country s flag. CSU Secretary General Andreas Scheuer said his party was ready to compromise, but added:  It is becoming ever more clear that Jamaica is not a pleasure trip.  ",worldnews,"November 15, 2017 ",1
Europe could be next mission for Merkel's 'Mr Fix It',"BERLIN (Reuters) - Peter Altmaier once said he would never rise to the top tier of German politics because of his appearance   he is a huge man who seems perpetually dishevelled, with shirt untucked and tie askew.   But Chancellor Angela Merkel s chief of staff and stand-in finance chief could become the most influential minister in her next coalition government, senior officials say.     In recent years, Merkel has often turned to Altmaier, who is known as her  Allzweckwaffe  (all purpose weapon), to carry out the most sensitive and complex tasks, from securing majorities for unpopular Greek bailouts to coordinating the government s response to the 2015 refugee crisis.   Since a Sept. 24 election, he has also emerged as a bridge builder between the disparate parties in coalition talks.   If the talks succeed, some officials believe Merkel will try to keep him at the finance ministry so he can tackle what may be the biggest challenge of her fourth term: brokering a deal with French President Emmanuel Macron on a reform of the European Union.  If Merkel made him finance minister for this transition period, then it is a sign that she trusts him to do this job in the future,  a senior aide to the chancellor told Reuters.   Henrik Enderlein, head of the Delors Institut in Berlin, a think tank, said it would send a  very strong signal  to France if Altmaier continued in the finance ministry post.   The liberal Free Democrats (FDP) are expected to have first choice of ministry in the new government. But if their leader Christian Lindner does not claim the finance ministry for himself, Altmaier could be in pole position.    Although the FDP and members of Merkel s Christian Democrats (CDU) are skeptical about some of Macron s proposals - notably his idea to create a budget and finance minister for the euro zone - some believe Altmaier s tone alone would inject new momentum into the relationship between Berlin and Paris.   Altmaier, who declined to speak to Reuters for this story, has not said publicly whether he is interested in becoming finance minister permanently  After meeting French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire last week, he said not all proposals from Paris would be greeted with  unlimited enthusiasm . But he added:  I never made it a secret that I m an advocate of Franco-German cooperation.   A jovial 59-year-old from the state of Saarland on the French border, Altmaier stands out among politicians and the officials in Merkel s close entourage, dominated by technocrats. The son of a coal miner and a nurse, Altmaier was the first prominent German politician to actively embrace Twitter.   He hosts extravagant dinners at his vast apartment in west Berlin, cooking  Gefilde    a Saarland specialty of potato dumplings filled with liverwurst and soaked in a bacon-cream sauce   for guests of all political stripes.   Altmaier speaks fluent English, French and Dutch and, unlike his boss, is a master communicator.  He also likes to make fun of himself, particularly his weight, which he estimated several years ago at 140 kilos (309 pounds) but now describes as a  state secret .    I may not be the  wichtigste  (most important) minister but I am the  gewichtigste  (heaviest),  he has joked. After years as Merkel s  Mr Fix It , some CDU officials see him as a dark horse candidate to succeed the chancellor one day.   As parliamentary whip for the CDU, he won over skeptics about the Greek bailouts with home-cooked meals and red wine.    The thinner the majority, the fatter Altmaier gets,  Bundestag members used to quip.   Later, as Merkel s environment minister, he brought order to her nuclear power phase-out and was appointed her chief of staff in 2013. Two years later, she turned to Altmaier for help over the arrival of hundreds of thousands of refugees and again this year to write the CDU s election program.   In coalition talks between Merkel s conservatives, the FDP and Greens, Altmaier has been a mediator, gently nudging the parties closer together, participants say. Like Merkel, he is a CDU moderate. After joining the Bundestag in 1994, he incurred the wrath of traditionalists by pushing for a reform of strict German citizenship laws and the rehabilitation of World War Two deserters. He was part of the  Pizza Connection , a group of young lawmakers from the CDU and Greens who met regularly at an Italian restaurant in Bonn, when the environmentalist party was viewed as a radical, fringe group by many conservatives.   Before entering German politics, Altmaier studied European law and worked at the European Commission, later participating in the European Convention that led to the EU s Lisbon Treaty.    Altmaier is one of a small number of top-tier German politicians who has real experience in Brussels,  said Martin Selmayr, chief of staff to European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, who worked with Altmaier in the Convention in 2002.  He is a committed European and would be a powerful pro-European voice in any German government.  ",worldnews,"November 15, 2017 ",1
South Korea postpones university exam after rare earthquake,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea postponed its annual university entrance exam by a week on Wednesday after a rare earthquake rattled the country, shaking buildings and causing damage but no deaths. Minister of Education Kim Sang-kon said the hugely competitive exam, scheduled for Thursday, would be postponed for the first time ever because of a natural disaster. It was the country s second-biggest earthquake on record.  A fair amount of damage was reported,  Kim told a media briefing.  Due to the continued aftershocks, we are seeing many citizens, including students, unable to return home.  The exam would now be held on Nov. 23 to ensure conditions were fair for everyone, he said. The 5.4 magnitude quake struck about 9 km (5 miles) north of the southeastern port city of Pohang, the Korea Meteorological Administration said. Shaking was felt across the country and there were numerous reports of minor damage. Operations at nuclear reactors were not affected, the state-run nuclear operator Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Co said. The university entrance exam is taken very seriously.   Commercial airliners do not fly during listening portions of the exam, while financial markets open later in the day to ensure light traffic for students to get to their exam centers. The country s foreign exchange and stock markets will still open an hour late (0100 GMT) on Thursday, South Korean financial authorities said in text messages. South Korea has relatively little seismic activity, compared with Japan to the east. Its strongest quake on record was magnitude 5.8 in September last year. The Meteorological Administration said nearly 20 aftershocks had shaken the region and more were expected in coming days. ",worldnews,"November 15, 2017 ",1
Murder and money laundering in Malta -- a challenge for EU,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union has called very publicly for Malta to bring to justice the killers of a journalist who accused the Mediterranean island s leaders of profiting from global corruption. But it has for years been much less vocal   and had little success   in ensuring Malta act to prevent money laundering, according to sources familiar with the work of the Maltese authorities and a Reuters review of EU and Maltese data. The data show the smallest EU state has been slow to apply international guidelines on naming firms that do not take action against dubious practices, and the number of convictions and sanctions for money laundering has been low. Malta has also consistently registered fewer reports of  suspect transactions  from banks, casinos and other financial operators than any other EU state, according to the data, despite having a  disproportionately large financial sector.  The European Parliament urged the European Commission, the EU s executive, on Wednesday to investigate Malta s adherence to the rule of law and voiced  serious concerns  about police independence and international money-laundering on the island. [L8N1NL4LI] But criticism of Malta on money laundering   in low-key reports by international supervisory bodies and by anti-corruption campaigner Daphne Caruana Galizia, killed by a car bomb on Oct. 16   appears so far to have had little impact.  Malta has sold its sovereignty to dirty money. The European Commission should take a more active role in investigating the condition of rule of law in Malta,  Sven Giegold, a member of  European Parliament from Germany s Greens party who campaigns against financial crime, told Reuters.  He said an international investigator was needed to counter a  culture of impunity and fiddling between political and economic elites  in Malta. Prime Minister Joseph Muscat told Reuters last month Malta s  financial services sector was  as transparent, solid and compliant as any other European jurisdiction . European Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans told lawmakers on Tuesday the EU executive had  no general concerns  about Malta s compliance with anti-money laundering laws though   improvements could be made on various levels.  Despite having a population of only 420,000, Malta, a former British naval stronghold south of Sicily, has a financial sector that dwarfs many EU countries. It is also the European leader in online gaming.  In 2016, assets of banks and financial institutions in Malta were more than 20 times its gross domestic product, about five times the equivalent figure for Germany and nearly four times the euro zone average, European Central Bank figures show. Yet in a report on the EU s anti-money laundering efforts that was released without fanfare in September, Europol said Malta reported fewer suspect transactions than other EU states between 2008, when it adopted the euro, and 2014. Europol also raised concerns that Malta and Cyprus may be failing to report as many cases as they should.  The supervisory authorities  receive very few reports given the size of their banking sectors and the significance of these jurisdictions in offshore financial services,  Europol said. Malta s Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU), the country s anti-money laundering agency, received 202 reports of suspect transactions in 2014, the last year for which Europol data are available. Lithuania recorded the next fewest   over 50 percent more than Malta in a financial sector one sixth the size. By contrast, the Netherlands, a much bigger economy, reported 277,532 dubious movements in 2014, the highest number in the euro zone. FIAU s deputy director, Alfred Zammit, told Reuters it was impossible to conduct a  meaningful comparison  among EU countries based on available statistics because of different structures and reporting regimes in member states.  It is indeed arguable that given the size of the financial sector in Malta, one would expect to see more suspicious transaction reports submitted to the FIAU,  Zammit said. But he said Malta was tackling the problem by increasing awareness of the obligation to report by organizing training sessions. The annual number of reports in Malta more than doubled  from 2014 to 2017 although the proportion of those that were passed to the police fell to 11 percent last year from 24 percent in 2013, FIAU data show.  The Maltese police and the FIAU did not respond to questions from Reuters on how many of these cases were investigated or led to successful prosecutions. Malta s court handed down four money laundering criminal convictions last year but disclosed none in the financial sector.  The results of a European Parliament inquiry released this month said the number of convictions was  extremely low  and the institutions implementing and enforcing rules on money laundering were  highly politicized . Banks not complying with money-laundering rules have received small fines which in few cases were made public, contrary to guidelines recommending exposure to deter wrongdoing.  Zammit said the public disclosure of a higher number of sanctioned institutions would have been  disproportionate when compared to the nature of the breach .  Moneyval, the anti-money laundering watchdog of the Council of Europe, Europe s leading human rights organization, has also raised concerns. It said in a 2012 report that Malta s reporting of suspicious transactions was low for the size of its market. In a subsequent report in 2015, Moneyval found the country  largely compliant . A Moneyval spokesman told Reuters the latest report was however not based on a full assessment of the Maltese legal framework. The European Parliament urged Maltese authorities on Wednesday to look into allegations of money laundering against Pilatus Bank, which has its headquarters on the island.  Maltese police and Pilatus Bank did not reply to questions from Reuters about allegations against the bank.  For graphic click tmsnrt.rs/2AKVblJ ",worldnews,"November 14, 2017 ",1

Maldives investigation alleges two suspects were planning suicide attack in capital,"MALE (Reuters) - Two Maldivians suspected of having links to Islamic State (IS)militants were planning to carry out a suicide attack in the country s capital, government officials said on Wednesday. The two, in their 20s, have been in detention since September but officials are now asking for them to be charged in criminal court.      The police investigation found out that they are affiliated with IS and they had planned to carry out an attack in Male,  Adam Thaufeeq, a spokesman at the Prosecutor General s office told Reuters. He declined to elaborate on specific location or the time of the planned attack. Male City, a two square mile island with a population of 150,000, is one of the most densely populated cities in the world. Maldives authorities made several arrests in September, after the United Kingdom updated its Maldives travel advisory, saying militants were  very likely  to carry out an attack in the country. Officials have also told Reuters that the authorities detained two Maldivians in Turkey en route to Syria to join IS fighters in September.  Significant numbers of radicalised Maldives youths have enlisted to fight for Islamic State in the Middle East and President Abdulla Yameen s government has brought some new laws to arrest Maldivians joining the group.

Senior official in US-backed Syria forces defects to Turkey-rebels,"AMMAN (Reuters) - A senior commander defected to Turkey on Wednesday from the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a leading combatant in the fight against Islamic State, Syrian rebel officials said, in the first such departure from its higher ranks. They said Brigadier General Talal Silo handed himself in at dawn to the Free Syrian Army (FSA), an adversary of the SDF, near Jarablus city in northern Syria where he was then escorted to Turkey, which backs some FSA groups in that area. The officials gave no reason for move by Silo, who was the SDF spokesman, but it follows months of growing discontent by some Arab tribes with the SDF, an alliance of Kurdish and Arab forces that is dominated by the Kurdish YPG.  Many local Arab tribes in areas controlled by the SDF complain they are marginalized in decision making and blame the YPG for discrimination against them, including the forced     conscription of their youths. The YPG denies these allegation.  Silo was secretly coordinating with commanders from the FSA and when he entered areas under their control he then crossed into Turkish territory,  said Ibrahim al-Idlibi, an FSA spokesman.  Kurdish fighters, alongside Arab allies, U.S. advisers and coalition jets, have driven Islamic State from swathes of territory including its former Syrian headquarters in Raqqa city. The Kurdish YPG militia and its political allies have carved out autonomous cantons in the north, and now control nearly a quarter of Syria. Their influence angers neighbor Turkey, which considers the YPG an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers  Party that has fought a decades-long insurgency on Turkish soil. The U.S.-led coalition said it was  aware of reports of Talal Silo s apparent departure from the SDF, but have no further details on his current status at this time.  Reuters could not immediately reach the SDF for comment.  U.S.-backed militias and the Syrian army have been advancing in separate offensives against Islamic State in eastern Syria, piling pressure on a small stretch of remaining territory the group still holds in oil-rich areas near the Iraqi border.

Russian long-range bombers strike Islamic State targets in Syria,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Six Russian long-range bombers struck Islamic State targets near the town of Albu Kamal in Syria s Deir al-Zor Province on Wednesday, the Russian Defence Ministry said in a statement. The TU-22M3 bombers took off from bases in Russia and overflew Iran and Iraq before launching the strike, it said.  The ministry said the planes had bombed Islamic State supply depots, militants, and armored vehicles and that satellite and drone surveillance had confirmed that all of the designated targets had been destroyed.  It said Sukhoi-30SM fighter jets, based at the Hmeymim air base in Syria used by Russian forces, had escorted the bombers while they were in Syrian air space and that all the bombers had safely returned to their bases. Russia on Tuesday accused the United States of providing de-facto cover for Islamic State units in Syria and of only pretending to fight terrorism in the Middle East. Specifically, the Russian Defence Ministry said the U.S. air force had tried to hinder Russian strikes on Islamic State militants around Albu Kamal. Asked about the Russian allegations, Colonel Ryan Dillon, a spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State, said:   The Russian ministry of defense statements are about as accurate as their air campaign and I think that is a reason for them to start, you know, coming out with their latest barrage of lies.

EU concerned over challenges to Romanian judicial independence,"BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Justice reform has stagnated in Romania this year, and challenges to judicial independence remain a persistent source of concern, the European Commission said on Wednesday. The European Union has monitored the justice systems of Romania and its neighbor Bulgaria since they joined the bloc a decade ago. It has backed an unprecedented crackdown on high-level graft in Romania, which Transparency International ranks among the bloc s most corrupt states. Romanian prosecutors have investigated hundreds of public officials, including a former prime minister. This week, anti-corruption prosecutors opened an investigation into the leader of the ruling Social Democrat Party on suspicion of forming a  criminal group  to siphon off cash from state projects, some of them EU-funded.  While progress in meeting some recommendations was advancing well ... the reform momentum in 2017 was lost overall,  said the Commission s latest justice monitoring report, released on Wednesday.  Challenges to and questioning judicial independence have also been a persistent source of concern.  The ruling Social Democrats are preparing a judicial overhaul that the Commission, foreign diplomats, thousands of magistrates and Romania s president have criticized as placing the justice system under political control.  Thousands of Romanians protested against the measures this month. The overhaul, announced by the justice minister in August, is under debate in parliament and the Social Democrat Party has said it aims to approve it by the end of this parliamentary session.  The most contested changes include those to a judicial inspection unit which oversees magistrates  conduct, and the way in which chief prosecutors are appointed. Justice Minister Tudorel Toader said on Wednesday of the Commission report:  The report refers to legal solutions that are still at the start of parliamentary debate, that are not finalised.  President Klaus Iohannis said in a statement he thought the report was  a serious warning signal the ruling coalition must take into account .  Affecting the independence of the judicial system and, in general, any pressure or attempt to politically control the judiciary will only return Romania to the past,  he said. This spring, Romania saw its largest street protests in decades, against what demonstrators saw as attempts by the ruling coalition to weaken the crackdown on high-level corruption.  In May, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said Romania should be able to persuade the EU to lift special monitoring of its justice system by the time it takes over the presidency of the EU Council in 2019.

Swiss stop seizing income from asylum seekers to pay for upkeep,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Switzerland will stop seizing income from some would-be asylum seekers to help pay for their upkeep, the government said on Wednesday, scrapping a rule that has drawn scrutiny by human rights groups. The government now imposes a special fee confiscating 10 percent of income earned for up to a decade by foreigners provisionally admitted to the country. This ends as of the start of next year. The change applies to foreigners who have been ordered to leave but cannot be sent back to their native countries because this would violate international law or put them in danger. Many end up staying for years. The cabinet called the change a way to promote employing foreigners already here at a time the country is trying to rein in immigration. A quarter of the Swiss population is foreign.  Eliminating this fee reduces the administrative burden on  employers. On the other hand it makes it easier for people who have been provisionally admitted to start work,  it said. Stefan Frey, spokesman for the Swiss Refugee Council human rights group, said the move was a gratifying first step by the government.  We welcome this as an individual measure but the work is far from done in the area of provisional admissions,  he said. Switzerland will still require arriving asylum seekers to turn over to the state assets they have worth more than 1,000 Swiss francs ($1,014) to help offset costs they trigger, the State Secretariat for Migration said in response to an enquiry. Broadcaster SRF in 2016 revealed the Swiss practice, which in similar form had drawn sharp rebukes for Denmark. ",worldnews,"November 15, 2017 ",1
Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood leader loses appeal against life sentence,"CAIRO (Reuters) - The leader of Egypt s Muslim Brotherhood movement, Mohamed Badie, lost his appeal on Wednesday against a life sentence for his role in violent clashes during political turmoil in 2013, judicial sources said. The judgment by the court of cassation against the sentence, handed out in 2016, cannot be appealed. Badie, 74, was convicted for his role in violence that broke out in the Suez Canal city of Ismailia days after the army, led by then General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, toppled President Mohamed Mursi, a member of the Brotherhood, following mass demonstrations against him.  Sisi was elected president the following year. In the same case, the court on Wednesday also upheld life sentences against seven other people and handed 10-year sentences to 39 and three-year sentences to 19 others. They were charged with killing three people and attempting to kill 16 others, thuggery, and vandalizing public property among other offences, related to the clashes in Ismailia in July 2013. Authorities outlawed the Brotherhood after Mursi was ousted, and arrested thousands of its supporters. They also dissolved its Freedom and Justice Party, which Mursi led. Mass life and death sentences have been common since then in what rights groups call an unprecedented crackdown by the government of Sisi, who promised during campaigning for the presidency to wipe out the Brotherhood. Badie has also been sentenced to life in eight other cases, only one of which has been confirmed. Two were canceled, two are pending appeal and three the subject of retrials.

"Despite EU caution, France pursues tough line on Iran missile program","PARIS (Reuters) - France said on Wednesday it wanted an  uncompromising  dialogue with Iran about its ballistic missile program and a possible negotiation over the issue separate from Tehran s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Paris has already suggested that new European sanctions against Iran could be discussed over its missile tests, something EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini seemed to dismiss on Tuesday, keen not to raise risks to the hard-won deal that curbed Iran s disputed nuclear activity. On Sunday, Iran rejected a call by French President Emmanuel Macron for talks on its missiles, saying they were defensive in nature and had nothing to do with its nuclear energy work.  France is concerned about the continued pace of the Iranian missile program, which does not conform with (U.N.) Security Council Resolution 2231 and which is a source of destabilization and insecurity for the region,  Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Agnes Romatet-Espagne told reporters in a daily briefing. Resolution 2231, which enshrined the nuclear deal, calls on Iran not to undertake activities related to missiles capable of delivering nuclear bombs, including launches using such technology. It stops short of explicitly barring such activity.  France wishes to examine all the diplomatic options: a frank and uncompromising political dialogue with Iran; investigations by the U.N. General Secretariat; if necessary, new European sanctions against Iranian entities or individuals involved in the ballistic program; and finally opening a negotiation on the subject,  she said. President Donald Trump, who has resumed a confrontational U.S. approach to Iran in contrast with predecessor Barack Obama s policy of detente, has said Iranian missile activity should be curbed and wants to punish Tehran over its role in  Yemen and Syria. Trump has also dealt a blow to Iran s nuclear deal - agreed with Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States under Obama - by decertifying Iranian compliance with its terms, contradicting the findings of U.N. nuclear inspectors. The U.S. Congress now has until mid-December to decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions on Iran that had been lifted in exchange for limiting its nuclear program in ways meant to prevent it developing an atomic bomb. But the EU, which normally coordinates closely with Washington on international sanctions, has been lobbying hard to keep the nuclear pact alive, saying it should be kept separate from missile and regional security matters. France s tougher line on the missile issue appears to reflect a concern that Iran might eventually try to arm a missile cone with a nuclear bomb, should it ever build one. Tehran has repeatedly denied any intent to do so. Romatet-Espagne reiterated the view that the nuclear deal should be kept separate, but said the ballistic missile issue was being discussed with fellow EU governments and Mogherini s foreign service. Foreign Minister Jean-Yves le Drian had been due to visit Tehran before the end of the month, although that has now been pushed back to later in the year due to a busy schedule, a diplomatic source said. Any EU-wide sanctions action requires the unanimity of all 28 member states but there is no consensus on new punitive steps against Iran, a fact made clear by Mogherini on Monday.  We didn t discuss, not today, not last week (and) I don t foresee any discussion also in the future, further sanctions from the EU side on Iran,  she said, alluding to Macron s remarks, after a meeting of EU foreign ministers.

Indonesian police officer killed in shooting near Freeport mine,"JAKARTA/TIMIKA, Indonesia (Reuters) - An Indonesian police officer was killed and a second wounded on Wednesday, after both were shot in the back in an area near Freeport-McMoRan Inc s giant Grasberg copper mine in the eastern province of Papua, police said.  The officers were patrolling an area close to where a Freeport vehicle was targeted in a shooting on Tuesday, Papua police spokesman Suryadi Diaz said in a statement. A helicopter flew the men to a hospital in the nearby lowland city of Timika. The main access road to Grasberg remained closed, Freeport Indonesia spokesman Riza Pratama said, referring to a 79-mile (127-km) stretch from Timika to the mining town of Tembagapura that runs near a river rich with gold tailings from the mine upstream. A string of at least 15 separate shooting incidents in the area since mid-August that wounded at least 12 people and killed two police officers has been blamed by police on an  armed criminal group , but linked to separatist rebels by others. In a statement, the separatist West Papua National Liberation Army (TPN-OPM), a group linked to the Free Papua Movement, claimed responsibility for Wednesday s incident. The group has said it is at war with police, military and Freeport. For decades, there have been sporadic attacks along the road where the shootings took place, but authorities  efforts to catch the perpetrators have been hampered by thick surrounding jungle.  The Indonesian Military (TNI) and police have urged the Armed Separatist Movement in Papua to surrender, but until now no one has turned themselves in,  Indonesian military chief Gatot Nurmantyo said in a statement.   Armed separatists cannot be left alone,  he said, adding that reining in such activities was the domain of the military, which was preparing  emergency measures  in case persuasive approaches by the police and military failed. Papua has had a long-running, and sometimes violent, separatist movement since the province was incorporated into Indonesia after a widely criticised 1969 U.N.-backed referendum. Foreign journalists have in the past required special permission to report in Papua, and once there, have had security forces restrict their movement and work. President Joko Widodo has pledged to make the region more accessible to foreign media by inviting reporters on government-sponsored trips, although coverage remains difficult.

"German spy chief sees Russia as danger, cites military advances","BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany s spy chief has warned that Russia should be seen as a  potential danger  rather than as a partner in building European security and said its big military exercise in summer showed an alarmingly high level of modernization in its armed forces. Bruno Kahl, head of BND foreign intelligence, made his remarks in a speech at an event hosted by the Hanns Seidel Foundation think-tank in Munich on Monday. An audiofile of the speech was heard by Reuters on Wednesday. Kahl s remarks come after U.S. intelligence accusations that Moscow sought to interfere in the U.S. elections in January and followed similar charges by Spanish ministers who say Russian-based groups used social media to promote Catalonia s independence referendum and destabilize Spain. Moscow denies interfering in any foreign elections and accuses the West of a campaign to discredit Russia. Kahl said it was important for Germany, the U.S.-led NATO alliance and the European Union to keep a close eye on Russian military development. He said Russia s large-scale Zapad exercise in summer had shown it was  very, very close  to meeting its target of modernizing 70 percent of its armed forces by 2020.   We must stay alert. Peace in Europe is no longer a guaranteed fact,  he said. Russia s goal included  weakening the EU, pushing back the USA, and in particular driving a wedge between the two. That means, instead of a partner for European security, we have in Russia a potential danger,  he said. Russian President Vladimir Putin was determined to prevent the eastward spread of European values to include Ukraine which, together with Georgia, had no chance of becoming members of NATO as long as Putin s  world view  prevailed in Moscow,  he said. The threat to Germany s security had increased with Moscow s  stationing of short-range missiles in its Kaliningrad enclave, he said.  The world player Russia is back. It will remain an uncomfortable power, and the West must see that realistically,  he said, though it was important to maintain some dialogue with Moscow despite its assertive actions.

Pope advised not to use term 'Rohingya' in Myanmar but rights groups disagree,"VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Leading figures in the Catholic Church and international politics have advised Pope Francis not to use the term Rohingya during a trip to Myanmar due to political sensitivities but human rights groups want him to uphold international law on self-identity. Hundreds of thousands of Muslim Rohingya have fled Myanmar following a military crackdown that the United Nations has described as ethnic cleansing. Majority Buddhist Myanmar rejects the term Rohingya and does not recognize them as citizens nor as an ethnic group in its own right. In the run-up to the his Nov. 27-Dec. 2 trip to Myanmar and Bangladesh, several high-profile figures including former U.S. Secretary General Kofi Annan and Myanmar Cardinal Charles Maung Bo have indicated he should not use the term Rohingya. The pope, a less predictable figure than his predecessor who has overruled advisors in the past, has used the term Rohingya before, and it is widely employed by international institutions such as the United Nations and governments including the United States. The Vatican, which does not make comments on papal speeches ahead of trips, would not say if Francis might heed the advice and use a term like  Muslims in Rakhine State . Roman Catholics make up a tiny minority in Myanmar. Francis, a strong defender of human rights and migrants,  has spoken earlier this year of  the persecution of our Rohingya brothers and sisters  and has defended their right to  live their culture and Muslim faith . This month Annan met the pope along with three other members of  The Elders  group of veteran statesmen and women and later hinted strongly that he believed the pope should not say Rohingya. Annan, a Nobel Peace Prize winner and author of an advisory commission report on Rakhine State given to the Yangon government in August, met the pope on the evening of November 6. The Vatican gave no details of the meeting but at a breakfast with a few reporters the next day, Annan was asked if he agreed with those who say the pope s use of the word Rohingya while he is in Myanmar could be  incendiary .  They are right,  Annan said. Annan gave the pope a copy of his 63-page report, which does not use Rohingya but refers only to  Muslims in Rakhine State .  (The word) is so emotional,  he said. Asked if he believed that message had been conveyed to the Vatican, Annan nodded. Lakhdar Brahimi, a former Algerian foreign minister and U.N. conflict mediator called the report  quite substantial . Human rights groups hope the pope does not pull his punches in Myanmar.  The Rohingya have little left besides their group name after years of statelessness, discriminatory restrictions on movement and access to life-sustaining services, and being targeted by a military subjecting them to ethnic cleansing and atrocities,  said Phil Robertson, deputy director for Human Rights Watch in Asia.  The Pope absolutely should stand up for the Rohingya by using the name Rohingya,  he said in an email. Myanmar has denied U.N. accusations of ethnic cleansing. The government says the clearance operation in Rakhine State was necessary for national security after Rohingya militants attacked 30 security posts and an army base in August. Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi assumed power in 2016 in a  landslide election win after former military leaders initiated a political transition. Asked if the pope should say Rohingya, Laura Haigh, London-based Myanmar expert for Amnesty International, said:  International law recognizes the right of a group to self-identify. It comes down to a principled stand.  Father Bernardo Cervelera, head of the Catholic news agency AsiaNews, said the pope should follow the local Church s advice in the country, which has some 700,000 Catholics in a population of more than 51 million that is mostly Buddhist.  Both the Church there and Aung San Suu Kyi are in a delicate position and I think the pope knows that,  he said. In 2015, Pope Francis angered Turkey when he used the word  genocide  to describe the World War One mass killings of Armenians by Ottoman Turks. The Turkish government, which denies that the deaths constituted a genocide, recalled its ambassador to the Vatican in protest. ",worldnews,"November 15, 2017 ",1
European Parliament urges EU probe of Malta after journalist killed,"STRASBOURG, France (Reuters) - EU lawmakers urged the European Commission on Wednesday to investigate Malta s adherence to the rule of law, in a move that could lead to sanctions following the murder of a campaigning journalist that has rocked the tiny Mediterranean island.  The European Parliament s non-binding resolution, backed by an overwhelming majority of deputies but criticised by the Maltese government, also voiced  serious concerns  about police independence and international money-laundering on the island. The move follows the murder on Oct. 16 of Daphne Caruana Galizia, a Maltese investigative journalist who had accused senior figures in both the government and opposition of corruption and involvement in international money-laundering. Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, leader of the ruling Labour Party, denies the allegations of corruption and says everything will be done to find the journalist s killers. The European Parliament  calls on the Commission to establish a dialogue with the Maltese Government regarding the functioning of the rule of law in Malta and to ensure respect for European values,  the text of the resolution said. This would be the first step in an oversight procedure that could trigger sanctions, including the suspension of Malta s voting rights in the EU, if systemic threats to the rule of law were confirmed and not addressed.  No EU member has been subject to these penalties, but Poland is currently under supervision over the independence of its judiciary, and lawmakers have also called for the activation of the procedure for Hungary. The Commission, which monitors member states  application of EU rules, has so far avoided commenting on the state of the rule of law in Malta, the EU s smallest member state with a population of just 420,000 people. The EU executive s vice president Frans Timmermans told deputies on Tuesday there were  no general concerns  at this stage on the application of anti-money laundering rules in Malta. But in their text adopted on Wednesday the lawmakers cited several high-profile cases of alleged corruption and risks of money laundering involving government members, as well as the island s flourishing online gaming industry and a Maltese scheme to sell citizenship to wealthy individuals.  The Maltese government said in a statement the EU text contained  factual inaccuracies and partisan political bias .    It is clear enough for the Maltese Government that most of this misinformation was led by highly politicised local actors, and can be read in a situation where some groups in the European Parliament are trying to gain leverage in negotiations on situations in their Member States,  the Maltese government said. In the resolution, backed by 466 lawmakers and opposed by 49 while 167 abstained, the deputies also accused Maltese police of failing to investigate  several serious allegations of corruption and breach of anti-money laundering and banking supervision obligations . The text also regretted  that there has been no police investigation to date in Malta of the revelations regarding the Panama Papers , despite the appearance of 714 companies linked to Malta and high-ranking officials in the leaked documents about tax schemes in offshore jurisdictions. Sources familiar with the work of Maltese authorities and a Reuters review of Maltese and EU data show possible shortcomings in Malta s efforts to prevent money laundering. Muscat told Reuters last month Malta s financial services sector was  as transparent, solid and compliant as any other European jurisdiction . ",worldnews,"November 15, 2017 ",1
U.S. mounts air strike against al Shabaab militants in Somalia,"MOGADISHU (Reuters) - The United States military has carried out an air strike in Somalia against al Shabaab, an al Qaeda-linked Islamist insurgency that wants to topple the U.N.-backed government, the U.S. Africa Command said on Wednesday. It said  several militants  were killed in the strike 60 miles northwest of the capital, Mogadishu, on Tuesday at about 1500 GMT. It was coordinated with the Somali government, AfriCom said in a statement.  Al Shabaab has publicly committed to planning and conducting attacks against the U.S. and our partners in the region,  AfriCom said.  Earlier this month, the U.S. warned of a threat to its diplomatic staff in Mogadishu and directed all non-essential staff to leave the capital. Al Shabaab was pushed out of Mogadishu in 2011 and has lost control of most of Somalia s cities and towns. But the group retains a strong presence in the south and center and can still carry out major attacks. It was blamed for bombings in Mogadishu last month that killed more than 350 people. The group aims to topple Somalia s government, drive out African Union peacekeeping troops and impose its own harsh interpretation of Islamic law.  ",worldnews,"November 15, 2017 ",1

Collapsed state housing in Iranian quake shows corruption: Rouhani,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - The ease with which some state-built homes collapsed in Sunday s earthquake in western Iran showed corrupt practices when they were constructed, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Wednesday in a sentiment shared by many ordinary Iranians. Some of the houses which collapsed in an earthquake that killed at least 530 people and injured thousands of others were built under an affordable housing scheme initiated in 2011 by Rouhani s predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.  That a house built by (ordinary) people in the Sarpol-e Zahab region has remained standing while in front of it a government-built building has collapsed is a sign of corruption,  Rouhani told a cabinet meeting, state media said.  It s clear there has been corruption in construction contracts,  he said. Sarpol-e Zahab is the town hardest hit by Sunday s 7.3 magnitude quake, the deadliest in Iran in more than a decade.  A picture widely circulated by ordinary Iranians on social media shows a building with relatively little damage in Sarpol-e Zahab next to a heavily damaged government-constructed building. This has fueled speculation that shoddy construction in the building of government housing had led to a higher number of casualties from the earthquake.  Rouhani said on Tuesday that any shortcomings in government constructed buildings in the earthquake zone will be punished. Mohammad Hossein Sadeghi, the prosecutor general in Kermanshah, the largest city in the earthquake zone, said on Wednesday that the quality of construction of new buildings that were heavily damaged would be investigated and charges may be brought against anyone deemed responsible.  If there are any problems with the construction, the individuals who were negligent must answer for their deeds,  Sadeghi said, according to the Iranian Students  News Agency (ISNA). An arrest warrant has been issued for a contractor responsible for a recently built hospital which was heavily damaged in the town of Islamabad-e Gharb, parliamentarian Heshmatollah Falahatpisheh said on Tuesday, according to the Iranian Labour News Agency (ILNA). Residents in the earthquake zone have also complained about the slow and inadequate government response as they struggle to find food, water and shelter.  ",worldnews,"November 15, 2017 ",1

"Mugabe: Zimbabwe's liberator and, for many, its oppressor","HARARE (Reuters) - When he came to power, Zimbabwe s Robert Mugabe was feted as an African liberation hero in a nation that had endured nearly a century of white colonial rule. Mugabe has not been seen since the military seized power in the early hours of Wednesday, targeting  criminals  around the veteran president. South African President Jacob Zuma said Mugabe had told him he was confined to his home but was otherwise fine. Educated and urbane, Mugabe came to power after seven years of a liberation bush war. But nearly four decades after independence in 1980, many see him as power-obsessed and willing to unleash death squads, rig elections and trash the economy in the relentless pursuit of control. The 93-year-old is the only leader Zimbabwe, formerly known as Rhodesia, has known since independence from Britain. While the West regards him as an autocrat, some in Africa see him as an anti-colonial champion. Mugabe has said he wants to seek another five years in office and last week he dismissed his putative successor, Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa, 75, in a boost for Mugabe s wife Grace, 52, also seen as a contender but whose whereabouts are  unclear.  Mugabe travels frequently to Singapore for medical treatment as age has taken its toll. The leader of Zimbabwe s influential liberation war veterans, Chris Mutsvangwa, told Reuters:  It s the end of a very painful and sad chapter in the history of a young nation, in which a dictator, as he became old, surrendered his court to a gang of thieves around his wife.  Born on a Catholic mission near Harare, Mugabe was educated by Jesuit priests and worked as a primary school teacher before going to South Africa s University of Fort Hare, then a breeding ground for African nationalism.  Returning to Rhodesia in 1960, he entered politics but was jailed for a decade four years later for opposing white rule. After his release, he rose to the top of the powerful Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army, known as the  thinking man s guerrilla  on account of his seven degrees, three of them earned behind bars. Later, as he crushed his political enemies, he boasted of another qualification -  a degree in violence . After the long bush war ended, Mugabe was elected as the nation s first black prime minister. Initially, he offered reconciliation to old adversaries as he presided over a booming economy. But it was not long before Mugabe began to suppress challengers such as liberation war rival Joshua Nkomo. Faced with a revolt in the mid-1980s in the western province of Matabeleland which he blamed on Nkomo, Mugabe sent in North Korean-trained army units, provoking an international outcry over alleged atrocities against civilians. Human rights groups say 20,000 people died, most from Nkomo s Ndebele tribe. The discovery of mass graves prompted accusations of genocide against Mugabe. After two terms as prime minister, Mugabe changed the constitution and was elected president in 1990, shortly before the death of his first wife, Sally, seen by many as the only person capable of restraining him. When, at the end of the century, he lost a constitutional referendum followed by a groundswell of black anger at the slow pace of land reform, his response was uncompromising. As gangs of blacks calling themselves war veterans invaded white-owned farms Mugabe said it was a correction of colonial injustices.  Perhaps we made a mistake by not finishing the war in the trenches,  he said in 2000.  If the settlers had been defeated through the barrel of a gun, perhaps we would not be having the same problems.  The farm seizures helped ruin one of Africa s most dynamic economies, with a collapse in agricultural foreign exchange earnings unleashing hyperinflation. The economy shrank by more than a third from 2000 to 2008, sending unemployment above 80 percent. Several million Zimbabweans fled, mostly to South Africa. An unapologetic Mugabe portrayed himself as a radical African nationalist competing against racist and imperialist forces in Washington and London. Britain once likened him to Adolf Hitler but Mugabe did not mind, saying the Nazi leader had wanted justice, sovereignty and independence for his people:  If that is Hitler, then let me be a Hitler ten-fold.  The country hit rock bottom in 2008, when 500 billion percent inflation drove people to support the challenge of Western-backed former union leader Morgan Tsvangirai. Facing defeat in a presidential run-off, Mugabe resorted to violence, forcing Tsvangirai to withdraw after scores of his supporters were killed by ZANU-PF thugs. An increasingly worried South Africa squeezed the pair into a fractious unity coalition but the compromise belied Mugabe s de facto grip on power through his continued control of the army, police and secret service. As old age crept in and rumors of cancer intensified, his animosity toward Tsvangirai eased, with the two men enjoying weekly meetings over tea and scones, a quirky nod to Mugabe s affection for British tradition if not authority. On the eve of the 2013 election, Mugabe dismissed cries of autocracy and likened dealing with Tsvangirai to sparring in the ring.  Although we boxed each other, it s not as hostile as before,  he said.  It s all over now. We can shake hands.  At the same time, Mugabe s agents were finalizing plans to engineer an election victory through manipulation of the voters  roll, the Tsvangirai camp said. The subsequent landslide was typical of a man who could always out-fight and out-think opponents.  To give the devil his due, he is a brilliant tactician,  former U.S. ambassador Christopher Dell wrote in a cable released by WikiLeaks. But whatever the outcome of this week s events, they could usher in a generational change for the southern African nation. ",worldnews,"November 15, 2017 ",1
Syrian Kurdish leaders back longer U.S role in Syria,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Syrian Kurdish leaders voiced support on Wednesday for a longer-term role for U.S. forces in Syria once Islamic State is defeated, after the United States signalled it would not pull out before there was progress towards a political solution. Comments by U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Monday have drawn heavy criticism from the Iran-backed Syrian government, which says Washington is making up a new excuse for keeping its  illegal occupation  forces in Syria. Limiting Iranian influence in Syria and Iraq is a key U.S. aim. Syrian Kurdish groups have emerged as the main partner on the ground for the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State in northern and eastern Syria, areas which the Syrian state and Iran have vowed to take back. Kurdish fighters, with Arab allies, U.S. advisers and coalition jets, have driven Islamic State from swathes of territory including their former headquarters in Raqqa city. The Kurdish YPG militia and its political allies have carved out autonomous cantons in the north, and now control nearly a quarter of Syria. Their influence angers neighbour Turkey, which considers the YPG an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers  Party that has fought a decades-long insurgency on Turkish soil. The main Syrian Kurdish political party, the PYD, welcomed a longer-term U.S. role in Syria. The U.S. presence should continue until there was a political solution to the Syrian crisis which erupted in 2011, it said.     In a written message to Reuters, the PYD s co-chief, Shahoz Hasan, agreed this would be beneficial.  Without achieving a political solution to the Syrian crisis, and with the continuation of the Turkish and Iranian intervention in Syria, and with the continued presence of al Qaeda groups in Syria, the continued operation of the coalition is better,  Hasan said. Senior Syrian Kurdish politician Fawza Youssef said a U.S. role would be very important for the future.  The United States and the coalition forces played a major role in fighting Daesh, and to reach a fair political settlement, we see a need for international guarantees,  said Youssef, a senior member of the Kurdish-led authority running the cantons in northern Syria. She pointed to an increase in humanitarian aid to northern Syria by Washington and the coalition since the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) captured Raqqa - a sign of a widening U.S. role. Turkey said on Monday the United States had 13 bases in Syria and Russia had five. As all sides in Syria battled Islamic State, the U.S.-backed forces have mostly avoided direct confrontation with the Syrian government, backed by Iran and Russia. But Iranian and Syrian officials are now signalling their intention to take back areas captured from IS by the SDF. Syria s main Kurdish groups say they want a federal system for the whole country, and hope for negotiations with Damascus to shore up their autonomous rule. Their territorial grip has expanded since joining forces with the United States to fight IS, though Washington opposes their autonomy plans. Mattis described this week a role for American troops long after Islamic State militants lose control of all the territory they hold.  Mattis said the U.S. military s longer-term objective would be to prevent the return of an  ISIS 2.0 . But he also suggested that U.S. forces aimed to help set the conditions for a diplomatic solution in Syria.  We re not just going to walk away right now before the Geneva process has traction , he said, a reference to U.N.-backed peace talks. The U.S.-led coalition has repeatedly said it does not seek to fight Syrian President Bashar al-Assad s military.  In response to the Mattis comments, the Syrian government said on Tuesday that Washington was presenting a new excuse to keep its forces in Syria by linking this presence to a political settlement, having previously said its goal was to fight IS. Foreign ministry comments affirmed the government s position that the presence of U.S. and other forces in Syria without government approval was an act of aggression.

Latest Singapore transit train mishap injures 28,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A Singapore mass transit train bumped into another at a station on Wednesday injuring 28 people, authorities said, the latest mishap on the transit system in a city-state that has long prided itself on its efficient public services. Transit operator SMRT said 26 passengers and two staff suffered light to moderate injuries and had been taken to hospital.  It s an awful day,  Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan said.  Commuters were inconvenienced, and some even injured. We are deeply sorry for that,  Khaw was quoted by the Straits Times newspaper as telling a news conference. Densely populated Singapore is highly dependent on public transport. It is one of the world s most expensive places to own a vehicle and it recently announced that it would not allow any net growth in its car numbers from February next year. The accident happened at 8.20 a.m. (0020 GMT), SMRT said in a statement.  A faulty west-bound train had stalled at Joo Koon station on the system s East-West line two minutes earlier, it said. A second train stopped behind the faulty train but moved forward unexpectedly a minute later, coming into contact with the stationary train. A software glitch in the signaling system was the cause of Wednesday s accident, the transit authorities later said.  A photograph posted on the Straits Times website showed two trains stopped and in contact but with no major damage apparent. Earlier, the Singapore Civil Defence Force said in a Twitter post that it had been alerted to an incident at the station at 8:33 a.m. The collision comes after a string of disruptions to mass rapid transit services. Last month, services were partially suspended on a  weekend because of flooding in a tunnel after heavy rain. The mishaps have led to a rare public apology by top transit executives and an assurance from the government to address the causes. ",worldnews,"November 15, 2017 ",1
France puts suspected militant under investigation for kidnapping journalists,"PARIS (Reuters) - A suspected Islamist militant accused of killing four in a 2014 attack on a Jewish museum in Belgium was placed under former investigation in France on Wednesday for allegedly kidnapping four French journalists in Syria. Mehdi Nemmouche was briefly transferred to Paris from a jail cell in Belgium, where he is being held pending a trial over the May 2014 attack in which four people including two Israeli tourists were killed in Brussels. Speaking outside Paris s lawcourts, a lawyer for Nemmouche said his client had been notified of the additional French probe and that he had chosen to say nothing on the advice of his legal team.  The investigating judge told him he had been formally put under investigation over the kidnapping and hostage-taking of four French journalists in relation with a terrorist group,  Vuillemin said. Nemmouche was arrested by police in the southern French port city of Marseille shortly after the Brussels shooting attack and extradited to Belgium in July 2014. French journalists who were released months earlier after almost a year in captivity in Syria identified him as their jailor there and said he was among French nationals working with the Islamic State group. Wednesday s brief transfer to Paris came two days after the second anniversary of other attacks in which Islamist militants, some of them residents of Belgium, killed 130 people in Paris. Scores more have been killed in Belgium, France, Britain and Spain in attacks commissioned or inspired by the Islamic State group, whose territory in Syria and Iraq is diminishing under military pressure from an international coalition.

Special Report: How a defrocked judge became the chief legal enforcer for Maduro's Venezuela,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Last March, Chief Justice Maikel Moreno shocked Venezuela when his Supreme Court nullified the powers of the National Assembly and transferred them to the 32-judge tribunal. Even in a country used to political upheaval, the decision triggered major protests, forcing Moreno to roll back much of the move three days later. But the power play illustrated Moreno s role as enforcer for the embattled administration of President Nicolas Maduro, now branded a dictatorship by a growing number of governments, from France and the United States to South American neighbors Colombia and Peru. The 51-year-old bodyguard-turned-judge and his court have overruled virtually every major law passed by the opposition-led assembly. Moreno s past, however, remains unknown even to most Venezuelans. To trace his ascent, Reuters examined documents and interviewed associates, colleagues and friends of the chief justice in five countries.  The picture that emerges is of a jurist who, by leveraging personal connections and handling politically sensitive cases that other lawyers and judges rejected, endeared himself to Maduro and fellow members of the late Hugo Chavez s  Bolivarian Revolution.  In his rise to Venezuela s top judicial perch, Moreno left behind a past that includes allegations he participated in extortion and influence-peddling rackets and his arrest in 1989 on suspicions of killing a teenager, according to government documents and people familiar with his history. Reuters found no evidence Moreno was ever tried or convicted of any criminal charges. In a brief text-message exchange with Reuters on Nov. 7, Moreno said the allegations of jail time, long rumored in Venezuela, were  invented  by sensationalists. He offered to give Reuters an interview, but then did not respond to requests to schedule one. He did not respond to additional questions by text about his career or other episodes in which he was accused of wrongdoing. Neither the Supreme Court nor Maduro s government responded to separate requests for comment. Documents including a 2006 intelligence report by the Supreme Court s security division and a high court ruling against Moreno last decade point to episodes in which Moreno was accused of being on the wrong side of the law   from the 1989 shooting to his ouster as a lower court judge in 2007 for what the high court said was the improper release of two murder suspects. Opponents of the Maduro government say Moreno is instrumental in propping up an administration that is increasingly authoritarian. In recent months, the top court has sentenced five opposition mayors to prison. It approved the ouster of Venezuela s chief prosecutor, who fled the country in mid-August, joining a growing exodus of Maduro critics. In May, Moreno s court gave the green light for Maduro to proceed with the election that created the Constituent Assembly, a legislature that now supersedes the National Assembly and cemented for many the country s tilt toward authoritarian rule. At least 125 people died in four months of protests that ensued after the court sought in March to neuter the assembly.  The greatest affront to the people is to put a criminal in charge of the judicial system,  said Luis Velazquez, a former Venezuelan judge who investigated Moreno on behalf of the Supreme Court a decade before Maduro appointed Moreno to run the top bench. During his investigation, Velazquez says he found an arrest record for Moreno after the 1989 shooting death of the teen and investigated a phone call in which another judge in a separate case recorded Moreno allegedly pressuring him to release a suspected arms and drug trafficker. The chief justice is not the first senior Venezuelan official to be accused of abuse of power.  The U.S. government earlier this year accused Vice President Tareck El Aissami of drug trafficking. It sanctioned Maduro himself for having  deliberately and repeatedly abused the rights of citizens  with repressive tactics. And it sanctioned Moreno and seven other Supreme Court justices for allegedly usurping the legislature and  restricting the rights and thwarting the will of the Venezuelan people.  Venezuela s government has dismissed the accusations and criticized the sanctions, which bar Americans from engaging in business with any of the officials and freezes any assets the officials may have in U.S. jurisdictions. El Aissami, the vice president, denied ties to the drug trade and slammed the United States on Twitter for  miserable provocations  and  vile aggression.   Under Chavez and now Maduro, the economy has cratered and social stability has ruptured in a country that was once one of Latin America s most prosperous and still boasts the world s largest proven oil reserves. After an October vote in which Maduro s Socialist party candidates swept a majority of gubernatorial elections, the president dismissed accusations of fraud and defended the legitimacy of his government.   I am not a dictator,  Maduro said.  I have a moustache and look like Stalin, but I m not him.  Little in the public record exists about Moreno s youth. He was born on New Year s Eve, 1965, in the eastern city of El Tigre, according to public tax and electoral documents. In the late 1980s, court, intelligence and newspaper records show he worked as a bodyguard for then-President Carlos Andres Perez. It is not clear how he became a bodyguard or joined the president s security detail. That era in Venezuela, marked by food shortages and high inflation similar to the conditions roiling the country now, set the stage for the eventual entry of Chavez, a disgruntled leftist Army officer, into power. With anger and hardship mounting, riots erupted in 1989. Hundreds of people died.  On the evening of April 26, Moreno and two other Perez bodyguards were in Parque Central, a working-class neighborhood of Caracas, the capital, according to an account two days later in El Nacional, a national newspaper. For reasons that are not clear, a brawl broke out. Ruben Gil, a 19-year-old student, entered the fray with a baseball bat, the newspaper said. The bodyguards opened fire, shooting Gil dead.  Presidential Bodyguards Kill Youth,  read the front-page headline, above a picture of Gil s weeping mother, Carmen Romelia Marquez de Gomez. Police arrested Moreno, according to the newspaper account, people familiar with the incident and an intelligence report prepared a decade ago by the security division of Venezuela s Supreme Court. A mugshot from his arrest, included in the report and dated the week after the killing, shows Moreno was arrested for  homicide.  The Supreme Court commissioned the report, a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters, in 2006. The 32-member court was already aligned with the leftist government by then, because of appointments made by Chavez, but several judges there had begun to question Moreno s rulings as a lower court judge. The report, which has never before been made public, was signed by Luis Enrique Villoria Garcia, director general of the court s security division at the time. Reuters was unable to reach Villoria to discuss the report. One page appears to be missing from the 19-page copy reviewed by Reuters. But details from the report regarding the homicide and Moreno s removal from the bench in 2007 were independently verified by people familiar with its contents. Those people include one senior government official, three former Supreme Court judges and three former senior intelligence officials. Important details about the homicide and Moreno s arrest remain unclear. Notably, Reuters was unable to find a paper trail documenting whether Moreno was tried, sentenced or imprisoned. The Supreme Court report says he was jailed until sometime in 1990, and cites a criminal case number for a homicide charge against him, 522755, but Reuters could not find any files associated with the case. A security guard at Lebrun, a central judicial archive in Caracas, would not grant Reuters access to records there. The Supreme Court did not respond to requests seeking permission to search the archive. Gil s mother died a decade ago, according to people close to the family. Two people close to Gil told Reuters that witnesses and family members at the time of the brawl said Moreno fired the shot that killed the 19-year-old. These people, who requested anonymity, saying they were afraid of reprisals, said Gil had been a gang member and that an existing, but unspecified rivalry with Moreno had sparked the brawl. One person, who says he saw Gil s body in a Caracas morgue, said the young man was shot in the back. Gil s death certificate, reviewed by Reuters, cites gunshot as the cause of death. Three people close to the family said legal proceedings followed Gil s death, but none of them knew what became of the case.  I have wanted to denounce him for years, but I have been too scared,  one of these people said.  Moreno has never publicly denied, confirmed or discussed shooting Gil. He told friends and colleagues the killing was in self-defense, according to a person close to Moreno who spoke on condition of anonymity. Another person, who also asked not to be named, told Reuters that Moreno said any fallout from the killing had been  resolved.  At some point in 1990, according to the intelligence report, Moreno was released from jail. It said he had received  an illegally granted procedural benefit  but gave no further details about his release. In the text exchange with Reuters, Moreno disputed the assertion of jail time, saying it and the other details from the report  are not true either.  He did not clarify or directly address other specifics from the report.  Once free, Moreno pursued a law degree at Santa Maria University, in Caracas. He worked as a bailiff while he studied, according to his official biography. While Moreno studied, Chavez in 1992 led a failed coup attempt against Perez s increasingly unpopular government. Chavez was jailed, but freed in 1994 thanks to the work of Cilia Flores, a firebrand attorney fond of leftist causes. In the next decade, Flores became a close aide of Chavez and the head of the National Assembly. She was also a friend of Moreno. It is not clear how she knew him, but Flores years before had also studied law at Santa Maria. The government did not respond to Reuters requests to speak with Flores. Reuters could not reach her outside government channels. Completing his law degree in 1995, Moreno worked for two years as an attorney before taking a job as a legal advisor at Corporacion Alas de Venezuela C.A., a holding company for Venezuelan airline Aeropostal Alas de Venezuela. By that time, Chavez had won increasing support from working-class Venezuelans and was on track to win the 1998 presidential election. Moreno was already bragging about his close ties to Flores and other ascendant Chavistas.  He made sure everyone knew about that relationship,  said Nelson Ramiz, who owned Aeropostal but gave up control of the airline and moved to Miami in 2007 after a dispute with regulators. After three years at the airline, Moreno worked as a legal advisor to the metropolitan police in Sucre, a district of Caracas. He also began advising the National Assembly and became an auxiliary judge for a district in the country s northeast. For the rest of the 1990s, Moreno alternated between work as an attorney and judge, sometimes wearing both hats at nearly the same time. It is not unusual for some attorneys in Venezuela to also work as judges. But Moreno s choice of cases sometimes created what critics saw as conflicts of interest. In one episode, he defended a suspect in a high-profile homicide trial and later, as judge, heard related charges against another suspect.  Both cases stemmed from shooting deaths that occurred during a short-lived coup against Chavez in April 2002. During the coup, gunfire erupted as opposition supporters marched toward Miraflores Palace, seat of the presidency. Witnesses later said they saw rooftop snipers, gunmen on a bridge and gun-wielding police officers during the shooting.  By the time the violence ended, 19 people were dead. Basic facts of the event, which fueled years of controversy and trials, are still disputed by critics and supporters of the Chavez and Maduro governments. Richard Penalver, a government supporter accused of being one of the shooters, hired Moreno as his defense lawyer. In 2003, Moreno secured Penalver s acquittal, a victory for the pro-government camp. Shortly thereafter, this time as pre-trial judge, Moreno agreed to hear whether a case should proceed against Ivan Simonovis, a former Caracas police commissioner who faced charges related to four of the deaths. Government opponents argued that the charges were manipulated and that Simonovis was being made a scapegoat. They also perceived a conflict for Moreno because of his recent role in clearing Penalver. Although the defense asked Moreno to recuse himself, according to one of the attorneys and a Simonovis family member, Moreno refused. He sent the case to trial, where Simonovis was convicted the following year and sentenced to 30 years in prison. Simonovis, now serving time under house arrest because of an illness, is not allowed under the terms of his sentence to discuss the case with Reuters. Few other judges were willing to hear such a polarizing case.  None of us wanted to take on political cases,  one former Supreme Court justice told Reuters.  Maikel did, though, to ingratiate himself  with the Chavez government. At the time, Moreno was getting ever closer to crucial powerbrokers, especially Flores and her longtime boyfriend - Chavez s confidante and future successor, Maduro. The judge and the power couple grew to have regular contact, the former justice said. Moreno began throwing his weight around with other judges. In 2004, Caracas judge Luis Melendez recorded a telephone conversation in which Moreno said he was phoning at the behest of Jose Vicente Rangel, Venezuela s vice president at the time. Disturbed by a prior call from Moreno, Melendez taped the follow-up conversation and gave the recording to internal inspectors of the national judiciary. In the recording, a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters, Moreno is heard pressuring Melendez to release Saul Cordero, a suspected criminal charged at the time with drug and arms trafficking. Reuters also reviewed a transcript of the call printed on Supreme Court letterhead during its investigation of Moreno in 2006.  The important thing is for him to be out,  Moreno told Melendez.  Do what needs to be done.  The senior government official and one other person familiar with the recording said it was authentic. It is not clear whether Melendez released Cordero. But Cordero was never tried on the charges and eventually was named a police chief by a pro-government mayor in the municipality of Caroni. Reuters could not reach Cordero, Melendez or Rangel for comment. By 2006, word of the phone call and of Moreno s controversial role in the 2002 shooting trials was increasingly well-known in judicial circles, according to several judges, attorneys and other officials active at the time. The Supreme Court ordered its security division to investigate.  The resulting intelligence report unearthed allegations that helped derail Moreno s first stint as a judge. The report, for instance, held that Moreno s efforts to affect judicial outcomes went beyond pressuring colleagues. It cited testimony by numerous witnesses alleging Moreno took part in an extortion ring   known as  Los Enanos,  or  the Dwarves    that secured payments from defendants in exchange for lenient sentences or acquittals. Moreno was never charged for anything related to the alleged extortion. But his behavior, the report warned, was a threat to the courts, to Chavez and to  the revolution.  In 2007, the Supreme Court found Moreno in contempt of the tribunal and defrocked him as an appeals court judge. Citing  grave and inexcusable errors,  the high court found Moreno had improperly released two murder suspects, according to its ruling. Reuters could not determine on what grounds Moreno had released the two suspects.  Despite his ouster, Moreno remained calm, according to people who spoke with him at the time. Allies like Maduro, whom Chavez had just named foreign minister, would help him.  Maduro and Cilia will protect me,  Moreno told Ramiz, according to the former airline owner s recollection of a conversation with Moreno shortly after the dismissal. The two had remained friendly after Moreno left Aeropostal. Almost immediately, Maduro sent Moreno to a diplomatic post in Rome. After a year, Maduro sent Moreno to Trinidad and Tobago, a Caribbean country much closer to home, where he held a commercial post with the Venezuelan embassy until 2010. Moreno then returned to Caracas and studied for a doctorate. Chavez, stricken by cancer, died in March 2013. Maduro, by then vice president, succeeded Chavez the following month. Weeks later, he married Flores, making her first lady. With his allies firmly in power, Moreno revived a judicial career that three senior judges said would have remained moribund without such connections, given Moreno s arrest in the 1989 killing and his later ouster from the court system. The country s 1999 constitution, rewritten by Chavez, stipulates the head of the Supreme Court be of  good repute.  In 2014, Maduro named Moreno, with a fresh doctorate in constitutional law, to the top court. Since then, Moreno s influence has only grown. In February 2017, Maduro named him chief justice, outraging critics, including Gabriela Ramirez, the national ombudsman at the time. Ramirez unsuccessfully sought to derail the appointment, citing to senior officials Moreno s ouster from the appeals court. Under Moreno as chief justice, the court proceeded to dismiss every legal challenge to Maduro s authority that has reached the bench.  ",worldnews,"November 15, 2017 ",1
Indonesia group pinpoints suspected mass graves from 1965 massacres,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - The head of an Indonesian group representing victims of the mass killings of alleged communists in the mid-1960s said he had pinpointed 16 suspected mass grave sites in central Java that could contain about 5,000 bodies.     Bedjo Untung, of the 1965 Murder Victims Research Foundation (YPKP 65), said the sites were around the town of Purwodadi where suspected communists were sent for execution. Untung has asked the human rights commission (Komnas HAM) to investigate.    Some of the bodies were thrown into a ravine. Some were thrown in wells,  Untung told a new briefing, citing the testimony of three witnesses.   I have a witness who when he was a kid used to follow his father to wash the dead bodies. Every morning people sent them around 50 bodies. So we estimate there were around 5,000,  he said, adding that human bones had been found in the area.  I can conclude that they were suspected followers of the Indonesian communist party (PKI),  said Untung, who was himself jailed for being a member of the now banned PKI. One of the worst massacres of the 20th century, some historians say at least 500,000 people died in an orgy of bloodshed after then-general Suharto took power following an abortive coup. A million or more people were jailed, suspected of being communists. The killings in 1965 and 1966 have never been officially investigated and perpetrators have never faced justice despite a pledge by President Joko Widodo to resolve human rights issues. Untung said that 122 other suspected sites of mass graves had previously been identified.  According to newly declassified U.S. documents, the U.S. government had intimate knowledge of the mass killing of alleged communists even as it failed to publicly reveal the slaughter. The documents also reveal that Indonesian army intermediaries told Western embassies they were considering toppling then president Sukarno less than a fortnight after the killing of six generals by rebel military personnel that sparked the bloodletting. [L4N1MT2UD] Amiruddin Al Rahab, a commissioner at Komnas HAM, said he would look into the matter. The rights group has previously made recommendations to launch an official investigation and set up ad hoc human rights courts but so far these have not been enacted.  Indonesia, the world s largest Muslim-majority country, still has periodic bouts of anti-communist hysteria. In September, a meeting by human rights activists and YPKP 65 was shut down after Islamists and nationalists rioted outside the venue. ",worldnews,"November 15, 2017 ",1

'New roadblocks' emerge in Iraq after Islamic State defeat: aid expert,"ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - The war against Islamic State in Iraq may soon be over but providing humanitarian aid to Iraqis is becoming more difficult as new political and cultural divides open up, the secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) said.  Jan Egeland also warned that members of the international coalition which helped Baghdad in its three-year campaign against Islamic State could now drastically reduce their humanitarian budget for Iraq following the militants  defeat. More than 3 million people displaced by Islamic State-related violence in the last three years have still not returned home. A rift between the central government in Baghdad and the Kurds following a September referendum on independence has created a fresh wave of displacement.  New political, cultural and sectarian divides seem to be popping up,  Egeland told Reuters during a visit to Iraq.  There are too many cleavages in Iraq. We don t need more roadblocks and certainly not more violence.  The NRC runs one of the largest foreign aid operations in Iraq. Islamic State s self-declared caliphate effectively collapsed in July when U.S.-backed Iraqi forces re-took Mosul, the group s de facto capital in Iraq, after a gruelling nine-month battle which reduced much of it to rubble. Nearly one million people fled Mosul since 2014, but only one third of its residents have so far been able to return, aid groups say.  Iraqi government officials have estimated it will take at least five years and billions of dollars to rebuild Mosul alone.  There s one thing we should have learned in Iraq   it is that we cannot spend countless billions of dollars on military campaigns and then not spend the smaller sums needed to make it safe for people in the future,  Egeland said.  This is a time of decision-making: will we stay and help people recover and rebuild their lives next year? Or will we prematurely think the job is done? The international community must not abandon the millions of people who are still displaced, Egeland said.  That would be not only shameful but shortsighted.

"British woman wins $5,200 for Sri Lankan deportation over Buddha tattoo","COLOMBO (Reuters) - A British woman won 800,000 rupees ($5,200) in compensation from a Sri Lankan court on Wednesday after being wrongly deported for having a Buddha tattoo on her arm.  Buddhism is accorded the  foremost place  in Sri Lanka s constitution and about 70 percent of the island s 21 million people are Buddhist. But there is no law banning Buddha tattoos. The Supreme Court also ordered police involved in the 2014 arrest and detention of Naomi Coleman to pay her 50,000 rupees ($325) each, the government s information department said on in its website (www.news.lk). Coleman was deported  contrary to the law governing immigration and emigration , the government said. Coleman was not present in court.  A lower court had decided to deport Coleman partly because she could have been  vulnerable  if allowed to stay as some Sri Lankans could have been offended by the tattoo, officials said. In 2013, Sri Lanka, a former British colony, denied entry to a British man because of his Buddha tattoo. ",worldnews,"November 15, 2017 ",1

Fifteen bullet-ridden kidnap victims found in southwest Pakistan,"QUETTA, Pakistan (Reuters) - Pakistani police on Wednesday found 15 bullet-ridden bodies of kidnap victims near the border with Iran, a favored route for human traffickers taking workers illegally to Europe. The bodies were found abandoned in a mountainous region of Buleda, in Baluchistan province, 600 km (370 miles) south of the provincial capital of Quetta, district commissioner Bashir Ahmad Bangalzai told Reuters. He said documents and other belongings found on the bodies suggested that they were en route to Iran illegally. Human smuggling is big business in Pakistan and other poor South Asian countries. There have been instances of workers being killed in border areas, or sometimes dying during road or sea travel.      It was not clear what prompted the killings, said Bangalzai. He said all 15 came from Pakistan s eastern province of Punjab.  We re getting in contact with their families,  he said. A police official said all 15 were reported to have been kidnapped on Tuesday.  No one has claimed responsibility. Violence-plagued Baluchistan, which also borders Afghanistan, has long been home to separatist groups seeking a greater share of regional resources and Islamist militants linked to al Qaeda, the Taliban and Islamic State. The violence has raised concerns about security for projects in the $57 billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor, a planned transport and energy link from western China to Pakistan s southern deep-water port of Gwadar.

Kenya court grants access to poll returns in case seeking to void election,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya s election board must give access to election returns to parties challenging President Uhuru Kenyatta s victory in last month s presidential election, the Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday.  Access to the original vote tally forms and a copy of the voter register must immediately be granted to the petitioners, a former lawmaker and two human rights activists, the judges said. They denied a request for access to the electronic devices used in vote counting. The legal challenges come after the court nullified Kenyatta s August victory and ordered a new election, an unprecedented move in Africa. The current proceedings may be the last chance for legal scrutiny of the second election, held on Oct. 26. The protracted political crisis has stirred fears for the stability of the east African nation, a regional hub for trade, diplomacy and security. The court is on a tight schedule. It has until Nov. 20 to rule on the two petitions. If the election result is upheld, Kenyatta will be sworn in on Nov. 28. Chief Justice David Maraga told the petitioners they must file a report on their findings from the returns by Thursday afternoon.  After Wednesday s ruling, lawyers for the petitioners began presenting their cases, arguing the poll s outcome is void because the election board did not hold fresh nominations after the earlier poll was invalidated, among other reasons.   Our position is you cannot have a fresh presidential election without a fresh round of nominations,  said Benjamin Musyoki, a lawyer for former legislator Harun Mwau. The lawyer for the two activists, Julie Soweto, also argued that voter turnout - just 39 percent, because opposition leader Raila Odinga boycotted the election - required the court to consider whether the election conformed  to the spirit and intent of the constitution.  Violence before and during the election also marred the process, Soweto said. She also referred to remarks by the election board chair the week before polling - he said he could not guarantee the vote would be free and fair, citing interference from politicians and threats of violence against his colleagues [L8N1MT0XK]. The process in the Supreme Court, however, may not repair the rifts opened by this year s prolonged elections season. A poll released by research firm Ipsos found that 80 percent of Kenyans think the country is going in the wrong direction. Pessimism about the country s path was at a record high - higher than during drought and food shortages earlier this year or a prolonged teachers  strike in 2015.  Human rights groups say at least 66 people have died in election violence, mostly at the hands of police cracking down  on opposition supporters. Electioneering has also disrupted East Africa s richest economy. The government lowered its forecast for 2017 economic growth to 5.5 percent, partly because of the  political uncertainty.  The Supreme Court was created by a 2010 constitution that followed a violent political crisis three years earlier. Around 1,200 people were killed in ethnic clashes after a disputed election in 2007. However, analysts said the moves by Kenya s court may  embolden other judiciaries in Africa. This month, Liberia s Supreme Court halted a presidential run-off until the election board investigates claims of fraud in the first round of voting.    ",worldnews,"November 15, 2017 ",1

Factbox: Key figures in Zimbabwe First Lady Grace Mugabe's 'G40' faction,"HARARE (Reuters) - Following are key figures in Zimbabwe First Lady Grace Mugabe s  G40  political faction, the target of an overnight coup by the military. The whereabouts of all of them are unknown, although sources in Harare have said some are in detention.  GRACE MUGABE - Mugabe s 52-year-old wife rose from political obscurity to the top ranks of the ruling ZANU-PF party and, after the purge a week ago of Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa, became the front-runner to succeed her husband. JONATHAN MOYO - A slick propagandist and former information minister, Moyo was G40 s brains and mouthpiece who never shied away from an acerbic comment or Tweet about his rivals. His Twitter feed has been uncharacteristically silent since the coup. SAVIOR KASUKUWERE - A bruising former ZANU-PF Youth minister nicknamed  Tyson , Kasukuwere ran Mugabe s attempts to  indigenise  the economy, essentially forcing foreign investors to surrender large stakes in their businesses to locals. IGNATIUS CHOMBO - A former University lecturer and Mugabe s homeboy, Chombo was promoted in an October cabinet reshuffle from the interior ministry to the finance portfolio, just as a severe domestic currency shortage tipped over into full-blown financial collapse. AUGUSTINE CHIHURI - As Commissioner General of the police, Chihuri was accused by rights groups of presiding over vicious crackdowns on dissent and popular protest in the last 18 months. KUDZAI CHIPANGA - The 35-year-old youth leader ingratiated himself to Mugabe and Grace and organized nationwide youth rallies that Grace Mugabe used to attack Mnangagwa and his allies.

Philippines' Duterte lauds China's help at 'crucial moment' in Marawi battle,"MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Wednesday heaped praise on visiting Chinese Premier Li Keqiang for what he said was China s  critical  role in expediting the end of a five-month war with Islamist insurgents in a Philippine town. Duterte credited China with supplying what he said was the rifle that on Oct. 16 killed Islamic State s regional point man, Isnilon Hapilon, and said he would present that weapon to China as a mark of appreciation for its help in the war in Marawi City.  I am going to return to you the rifle so that the Chinese people would know, it was critical, it is a symbol of the critical help,  Duterte told Li, the first Chinese premier to visit the Philippines in a decade. There are doubts, however, about if it really was a Chinese sniper rifle that killed Hapilon, and uncertainty about whether the military has used any of the 6,100 guns Beijing has donated since June.  The Philippine defense minister recently said all those weapons were given to the police. Hapilon was killed by members of the 8th Scout Ranger Company.  Scout Ranger Books , a Facebook page of one of the ranger officers, gave a blow-by-blow account of the operation and said the shot that killed Hapilon came from a gun mounted on an armored vehicle. Members of the unit also told media the shot came from a fixed weapon controlled remotely. Such weapons are typically 50-calibre machine guns.  The arms you gave us, helped abbreviate, shorten the military fight there,  Duterte said. On Friday, he said something similar to Russian President Vladimir Putin. He told him Russia had  helped us turn the tide and to shorten the war  by supplying weapons that Philippine soldiers used to kill militant snipers in Marawi. The Russian arms were actually delivered two days after military operations were declared over. The conflict was the biggest and longest battle in the Philippines since World War Two. More than 1,000 people, most of them rebel gunmen, were killed and 353,000 were displaced. Duterte told Li China s help came at  the crucial moment when we needed most and there was nobody to help us at that time . His remarks may not sit well with the United States and Australia, which from the early stages of the conflict were providing technical support to Philippine forces, including surveillance aircraft to pinpoint locations of militants. Li said China would provide 150 million yuan ($22.7 million) to help with reconstruction in Marawi. He praised Duterte for last year putting aside festering disputes with China and visiting Beijing, a trip he said was an  ice-breaker . Philippine security analyst Renato De Castro said the information Duterte gave to Li was inaccurate, but consistent with his policy of  total appeasement  of China.  I m really surprised, I don t know whether it s flattery or an outright lie,  he told news channel ANC. ",worldnews,"November 15, 2017 ",1
Cambodia's opposition party gives up hope of escaping ban,"PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodia s main opposition party has given up hope of escaping a ban when the Supreme Court rules on Thursday on a suit brought by the government of authoritarian leader Hun Sen, a senior leader said. The government called for the ban after arresting Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) leader Kem Sokha on Sept. 3 and charging him with treason for an alleged plot to take over the Southeast Asian country with help from the United States. Hun Sen s opponents say the charges are politically motivated to eliminate Kem Sokha from next year s election so the strongman, who is currently the world s longest serving prime minister, can extend his more than 32 years in power. The judge who heads the Supreme Court, Dith Munty, is a member of the permanent committee of the ruling Cambodia People s Party (CPP) and a longtime Hun Sen loyalist.  There is no chance whatsoever for CNRP to escape dissolution,  said Mu Sochua, a deputy of Kem Sokha who fled abroad last month saying she feared arrest in a widening crackdown by the government.  November 16, 2017 will mark the end of true democracy in Cambodia,  she told Reuters, adding that the ruling party would face local condemnation and possible international sanctions. Hun Sen, a former Khmer Rouge commander, has held power since 1985 by intimidating and dividing his enemies and through legal proceedings that have occasionally led to political bans on rivals at critical moments. Next year s election was shaping as possibly the biggest challenge to Hun Sen s leadership, after his opponents unified behind the CNRP. Former CNRP leader Sam Rainsy, who fled to France in 2015 to escape a jail term for defamation, announced on Wednesday he was returning to the party that he quit in February over fears his membership would lead to it being banned. The veteran opponent of Hun Sen said the party would be dissolved anyway so his membership now made no difference. A government official said Sam Rainsy s return would only provide further justification for dissolving the party.      He is not mature. He has no political philosophy and doctrine, but only anger and hatred,  Huy Vannak, undersecretary of state at the Interior Ministry, told Reuters. He also noted that the CNRP had not defended its position in court. A party lawyer, Sam Sokong, said there had been no point because the case was politically motivated. Western countries have condemned the government s crackdown on the opposition, civil rights groups and independent media and have called for the release of Kem Sokha to allow credible elections next year. U.S. President Donald Trump s senior Asia aide expressed  strong concerns  to Cambodia s government about the detention of Kem Sokha and restrictions on civil society and the press on Tuesday. Hun Sen has brushed off Western criticism, though he also lauded Trump as a kindred spirit this week and urged him to rein in subordinates critical of Cambodia. Hun Sen is also increasingly close to China, Cambodia s biggest donor. The main evidence presented against Kem Sokha is a video from 2013 in which he talks about a plan to gain power with the help of Americans. He says he was talking about democratic politics. Cambodia s capital, Phnom Penh, was calm on Wednesday. But metal barriers were set up outside the gold-embellished Supreme Court and police have been told to watch for trouble. Few in the capital wanted to give any opinion on the ruling or the possible verdict.  The court will decide. We cannot do anything,  said Kou Menglay, a taxi driver.

Russian Twitter accounts promoted Brexit ahead of EU referendum: Times newspaper,"LONDON (Reuters) - Russian Twitter accounts posted almost 45,000 messages about Brexit in the 48 hours around last year s referendum in an attempt to sow discord during the vote on whether to leave the European Union, the Times newspaper reported on Wednesday. The Times cited research from an upcoming paper by data scientists at Swansea University and the University of California, Berkeley, which it said showed accounts based in Russia had tweeted about Brexit in the days leading up to the June 23 vote. The Times said most of the tweets seen by the newspaper encouraged people to vote for Brexit, although a number advocated remaining in the EU. It quoted Tho Pham, one of the paper s authors, as saying  the main conclusion is that bots were used on purpose and had influence . The research tracked 156,252 Russian accounts that mentioned #Brexit, including one, Svetal1972 which posted 92 tweets between June 20 and 24, including one calling for Britain to  make June the 23rd our Independence Day .  It said many of the messages appear to have come from automated accounts known as bots or from cyborg accounts which are heavily automated but have some human involvement.  In the June 23, 2016 referendum, 17.4 million votes, or 51.9 percent of votes cast, backed leaving the EU while 16.1 million votes, or 48.1 percent of votes cast, backed staying. Russia has repeatedly denied meddling in Brexit. Russian officials say the West is whipping up anti-Russian hysteria around Moscow s alleged involvement in both the U.S. presidential election and Brexit. In Britain, a parliamentary committee has written to Facebook s Mark Zuckerberg asking for information on any paid-for activity by Russian-linked Facebook accounts around the EU referendum and the 2017 national election.  British Prime Minister Theresa May on Monday accused Russia of meddling in elections and said the government would maintain its commitment to protecting Europe after Brexit.  We will take the necessary actions to counter Russian activity,  she said. ",worldnews,"November 15, 2017 ",1

Rainbow celebrations as Australians vote for same-sex marriage,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australians have voted overwhelmingly for same-sex marriage, paving the way for legislation by the end of 2017 and sparking rainbow celebrations on Wednesday, with people wearing wedding dresses and sequined suits and declaring  our love is real . Australia will become the 26th nation to formalize the unions if the legislation is passed by parliament, which is expected despite some vocal opposition within the government s conservative right wing. Thousands of people in a Sydney park broke into a loud cheer, hugged and cried as Australia s chief statistician revealed live over a big screen that 61.6 percent of voters surveyed favored marriage equality, with 38.4 percent against.  Australian Olympic swimmer Ian Thorpe, who came out as gay three years ago, said the result was a huge relief.  It means that the way you feel for another person, whoever that may be, is equal,  Thorpe told reporters at the Sydney celebrations. The voluntary poll is non-binding but Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull immediately said he would fulfill a pledge to raise a bill in parliament with the aim of passing laws by Christmas. Turnbull played down concern of a split in his coalition government over the policy as the conservative faction presses for amendments to protect religious freedoms that discriminate against same-sex couples.  It is unequivocal, it is overwhelming. They have spoken in their millions and they have voted overwhelmingly yes for marriage equality,  Turnbull told reporters in Canberra after the survey results were announced.   They voted yes for fairness, yes for commitment, yes for love.  A marriage equality bill was introduced into parliament later on Wednesday.  The result marks a watershed moment for gay rights in Australia, where it was illegal in some states to engage in homosexual activity until 1997.  It s a g day. Way to go Australia,  tweeted U.S. TV host Ellen DeGeneres, who is married to Australian actress Portia de Rossi in the United States. Almost 80 percent of eligible voters took part in the survey - a higher turnout than Britain s Brexit vote and Ireland s same-sex marriage referendum. Mark Barry, 59, wiped away tears as he took in the result with his partner of 35 years, Gerrard Boller.  I know a celebrant who is going to be very happy about this,  Barry told Reuters.  Irish-born Qantas Airways Chief Executive Alan Joyce, one of the few openly gay business leaders in Australia, told the Sydney crowd, many of whom sheltered from the sun under rainbow umbrellas, that the result was  an amazing outcome  and urged Turnbull to move quickly on legislation. Turnbull has been under pressure amid a citizenship crisis that has cost him his deputy and the government s majority in parliament and political analysts said the resounding  yes  vote presented him with his first opportunity in months to exert decisive control. Nick Economou, a political scientist at Monash University, said Turnbull  should feel emboldened by the result and this is the sort of thing he has been looking for to show some assertive leadership . The  no  campaign had sought to leverage powerful religious organizations in a survey campaign that was criticized by some in the  yes  camp as divisive and aggressive. Catholic Archbishop of Sydney Anthony Fisher said he was  deeply disappointed that the likely result will be legislation to further deconstruct marriage and family in Australia . On the strength of the  yes  vote, conservatives dropped a plan for a competing bill that would have allowed private businesses to refuse services like wedding cakes for same-sex weddings by objecting on religious grounds.

Hungary summons U.S. envoy over media funding plan,"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary s foreign ministry has summoned U.S. envoy David Kostelancik over a plan to fund rural media outlets in Hungary, which Budapest considers a  political intervention  ahead of an election due early next year. The United States said on Monday it would devote $700,000 to fund rural media outlets in Hungary to help train and equip journalists in defense of an independent media it sees subject to growing pressure and intimidation. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has increased media control by legal changes, regulatory steps and takeovers of outlets by business sector associates. The moves have alarmed Western partners ahead of elections due in April 2018 which he is widely expected to win.  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade has summoned the U.S. Charg  d Affaires, asking for an explanation, and told him that we consider this a political intervention by the U.S. Department of State ahead of the elections,  spokesman Tamas Menczer said in an emailed response. The U.S. program offers technical and financial assistance to media outlets, as well as increased local and international exposure, small grants and other tools. They can use the funds after May 2018, after the election is due.

Senior Chinese diplomat to visit North Korea as envoy of Xi,"BEIJING (Reuters) - A senior Chinese diplomat will visit North Korea from Friday as a special envoy of Chinese President Xi Jinping, Beijing said, although it did not say he was planning to discuss North Korea s nuclear and ballistic programs. China has repeatedly pushed for a diplomatic solution to the crisis, but in recent months has had only limited high-level exchanges with North Korea. The last time China s special envoy for North Korea visited the country was in February last year.   In a brief dispatch, the official Xinhua news agency said Song Tao, who heads the ruling Communist Party s external affairs department, would leave for North Korea on Friday. He will  inform the DPRK of the 19th CPC National Congress and visit the DPRK , Xinhua said on Wednesday, using the North s official name and referring to China s recently concluded Communist Party Congress at which Xi further cemented his power. North Korea s KCNA news agency confirmed the visit, but said only that it would take place  soon . The trip will come just a week after U.S. President Donald Trump visited Beijing as part of a lengthy Asia tour, where he pressed for greater action to rein in North Korea, especially from China, with which North Korea does 90 percent of its trade.  It is not clear how long Song could stay, but he has already visited Vietnam and Laos to inform them of the results of the congress, a typical courtesy China extends other communist countries after such important meetings. It is also unclear whether Song will meet North Korea s youthful leader Kim Jong Un. Song s  main objective  in going to North Korea was to  report on the 19th Party Congress , Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a daily news briefing, adding that it was routine for China and other socialist countries to have such exchanges after important party meetings.  The two countries would also  exchange opinions on matters of mutual concern  during the visit, Geng added.  He reiterated that China was committed to resolving the Korean nuclear issue peacefully through consultation.      Kim and Xi exchanged messages of congratulations and thanks over the Chinese party congress, but neither leader has visited the other s country since assuming power.  Song s department is in charge of the party s relations with foreign political parties, and has traditionally served as a conduit for Chinese diplomacy with North Korea. A department official said last month that China s Communist Party continues to hold talks and maintain contacts with its North Korean counterpart, describing the two countries  friendship as important for regional stability. China s new special envoy for North Korea, Kong Xuanyou, who took up his position in August, is not believed to have yet visited the country since assuming the job. ",worldnews,"November 15, 2017 ",1
North Korea defector 'stabilized' after second surgery: South Korean surgeon,"SEOUL (Reuters) - A North Korean soldier who suffered critical gunshot wounds during a defection dash over the border to South Korea this week stabilized on Wednesday after a second round of surgery, a doctor treating him said. The soldier, whose rank and identity have not been disclosed, was flown by helicopter to hospital on Monday after his escape to South Korea in a hail of bullets fired by North Korean soldiers. Wednesday s surgery was  successful  in terms of staunching bleeding and the soldier had  stabilized much , said Lee Cook-jong, the surgeon in charge of his treatment. However, he remained unconscious and was not out of the woods, as complications from a severe hip fracture and possible infection remained major concerns, Lee said.   We will be able to tell you after about 10 days,  Lee told reporters at a briefing, when asked about the soldier s chances of surviving. On Tuesday, government and military officials said the soldier was in critical condition but doctors expected him to live. The soldier made his escape in a border  peace village  on the heavily guarded demilitarized zone between the two Koreas. At first, he sped toward the border in a four-wheel drive vehicle but was forced to abandon it and flee on foot when one of its wheels came loose, South Korean officials said earlier. He was hit by about seven bullets before he took cover behind a South Korean structure in a Joint Security Area (JSA) inside the demilitarized zone. Doctors removed five bullets from him earlier and one more on Wednesday. North Korea has remained silent on the issue, while no unusual activity has been detected at the border where the soldier defected, the South s Unification Ministry said.   There will need to be some questioning on why he defected after his treatment is over,  ministry spokesman Baik Tae-hyun told a regular briefing.  Monday was the first time since 2007 a North Korean soldier had defected across the JSA. ",worldnews,"November 15, 2017 ",1
"Zimbabwe military chief's China trip was normal visit, Beijing says","BEIJING (Reuters) - A trip to Beijing last week by Zimbabwe s military chief was a  normal military exchange , China s Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday, after the military in the southern African nation seized power. Zimbabwe s military took control targeting  criminals  around President Robert Mugabe but gave assurances on national television that the 93-year-old leader and his family were  safe and sound . General Constantino Chiwenga met Chinese Defence Minister Chang Wanquan in Beijing on Friday, where Chang expressed a willingness to promote relations with Zimbabwe, China s Defence Ministry said in a short statement last week. The ministry showed a picture of the two men, both wearing military uniform, shaking hands, and another one of officers from both countries sitting opposite each other holding a meeting at the People s Liberation Army headquarters in Beijing. Asked whether Chiwenga had briefed China on plans to seize power, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the Defence Ministry had already released information about his trip and that he didn t have an understanding about the specifics of his reception in China.  I can only tell you that his visit to China this time was a normal military exchange mutually agreed upon by China and Zimbabwe,  Geng said, referring other questions to the Defence Ministry, which has yet to respond to a request for comment.  As a country that is friendly with Zimbabwe, we are paying close attention to developments of the situation in Zimbabwe,  Geng added.   Maintaining peaceful and stable development accords with the fundamental interests of Zimbabwe and regional countries, and is the common desire of the international community. We hope the relevant parties in Zimbabwe appropriately handle their internal matters.  In contrast to his elevated status on the continent, Mugabe is reviled in the West as a despot whose disastrous handling of the economy and willingness to resort to violence to maintain power destroyed one of Africa s most promising states. China and Zimbabwe have a close diplomatic and economic relationship and Beijing has stood with Mugabe s government in the face of Western economic sanctions. In August, Zimbabwe s government said a Chinese company planned to invest up to $2 billion to revive operations at Zimbabwe Iron and Steel Company (ZISCO), which ceased production in 2008 at the height of Zimbabwe s economic meltdown. That same year, China vetoed a proposed Western-backed U.N. resolution which would have imposed an arms embargo on Zimbabwe and financial and travel restrictions on Mugabe and 13 other officials, saying it would  complicate , rather than ease, conflict.

Divided Srebrenica awaits Mladic verdict 22 years after massacre,"SREBRENICA, Bosnia (Reuters) - Almir Salihovic sits in his office in Srebrenica, waiting for a U.N. tribunal to give its judgment on the man accused of massacring his cousins and uncles there in 1995. He is hoping for a measure of justice, but little else. The businessman was 10 when he fled through the woods with his father and brother as Bosnian Serb soldiers opened fire behind them. The troops killed more than 8,000 Muslim men and boys in the days that followed.  Next week the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia will give its verdict on Ratko Mladic, the former Bosnian Serb general accused of overseeing the murders and other war crimes, including the siege of Sarajevo. A guilty verdict on Nov. 22 would give some  personal satisfaction to victims,  Salihovic told Reuters at his transportation company in the eastern town, where his family returned in 2004.  But it would do little else - certainly nothing to heal the deeper traumas and still gaping divides.  For most Serbs he will remain a hero, for others he will be the butcher and criminal, and we will continue to live in our folds, side by side, not together,  he said.   We carry the burden of a terrible crime that puts inter-ethnic relations under pressure.     The legacy of a commander who led the Bosnian Serb army in its swift takeover of two-thirds of the country during the 1992-95 war still divides Muslim Bosniaks and Serbs in Bosnia. For Srebrenica Muslims, Mladic is a symbol of the chaos and killings that broke out when his forces took over the U.N-protected eastern enclave where about 40,000 Muslims from eastern Bosnia had sought refuge.  For Serbs the 74-year-old is a proud general who won the territory with very few of his own casualties. Srebrenica s own Serb mayor Mladen Grujicic says the killings did not amount to genocide - and the two international courts who ruled that they did were biased against his fellow Serbs.  It will take many more years to reveal the complete truth, which is not favoring any side,  Grujicic told Reuters.   We in both communities are victims while higher agendas are at stake,  he added, without elaborating. Srebrenica is now a shrinking town where about 7,000 Muslim Bosniaks and Serbs still live side by side, suspicious of each other and divided by the past.  One thing they do share is their poverty. The town is dotted with empty houses, left behind by people seeking a better life. This year the only bakery and butchers shop had to close down. Srebrenica was once known for its metal plant and nearby lead, zinc and gold mines. These days, the main landmark is the cemetery on its outskirts and the 6,575 white tombstones marking the remains of the victims that authorities have managed to find.  In 2010, I buried my children and husband. Nobody should go through it ever again. Now I live alone, and I should not have had to live alone if it was not for some hotheads,  said Hatidza Mehmedovic. The 66-year-old comes every day to tend the graves of her husband and two sons killed in what is widely seen as Europe s worst atrocity since the World War Two.  This is not life, this is hell, this is a life of punishment,  Mehmedovic told Reuters.  Further southwest, in Mladic s home village of Bozanovici, his cousins are also waiting for the tribunal s verdict. They fear he will be jailed for crimes they say he did not commit.  I would be happiest if he died before the judgment,  his uncle Mile Mladic told Reuters.   We would then raise a large monument for him in the village and write the truth. All this that is happening is not the truth. It is a lie. The general is not guilty.  ",worldnews,"November 15, 2017 ",1
Indian police arrest suspected cow vigilantes after Muslim killed,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian police have arrested two Hindu farmers in connection with the killing of a Muslim man suspected of smuggling cows to a slaughter house, the investigating officer said on Wednesday. Hardline Hindu groups have gained prominence since Prime Minister Narendra Modi s nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party came to power in 2014, and the protection of cows, considered holy by many in the Hindu-majority country, is a priority for them. Police found the body of Ummar Khan, 35 on Friday on railway tracks in Alwar district, in the northwestern state of Rajasthan. The two suspects were detained on Monday and arrested the next day, said Rahul Prakash, the top police officer in Alwar.  It is a clear case of murder over the issue of cow protection and we have also found that the victim was running a cow-smuggling racket,  Prakash said. Khan and two accomplices were using a stolen vehicle to transport five cows when they were attacked by six members of a self-styled cow protection force, he said.  Both sides were carrying guns and were shooting at each other.  Khan was shot dead and his body was thrown onto the railway track, Prakash said. Cow slaughter is illegal in most of India.  Gau rakshaks , or cow vigilantes, run a loosely organized movement that they say is meant to prevent cattle smuggling, with tactics that include highway ambushes. Modi has called for more to be done to prevent such attacks on people accused of eating beef or slaughtering cows. This year, a Muslim farmer died from injuries sustained during an assault by a mob in Alwar, about 180 km (100 miles) southwest of New Delhi, when he was taking cows to his home. Khan s wife, Khurdisan, denied that her husband and been leading any cows to slaughter. She accused members of a right-wing Hindu group affiliated to Modi s party of the murder.  He was bringing the cows home for their milk, not for their meat. I want the government to protect me and my children,  she was quoted as saying by Hindi-language Rajasthan Patrika newspaper.

North Korea's Kim trades missiles for tractors during testing lull,"SEOUL (Reuters) - After a summer filled with flaming rockets and an earth-shaking nuclear blast, North Korea s state media is portraying Kim Jong Un as a leader who has temporarily traded weapons for workshops. The new portrayal appears designed to build domestic support by delivering on promises to develop the economy alongside the nuclear program and to reassure citizens amid tightening international sanctions. State media photos released on Wednesday showed Kim examining equipment at a tractor factory, test driving one of the vehicles and laughing with workers, the latest in a stream of photos in the past two months depicting a smiling Kim visiting farms and factories that make shoes, cosmetics, trucks. Between June 21 and Sept. 20, Kim did not conduct a single public activity related to the economy, instead focusing almost exclusively on appearances at events including missile tests or tours of weapons factories, according to data collected by South Korea s Ministry of Unification. The resumption of public, economic-related activities has coincided with a lull in missile testing. North Korea has not fired a rocket or tested a nuclear weapon since it launched a ballistic missile over Japan on Sept. 15. The break in testing matches lulls at similar times in past years and North Korea is almost certainly continuing its push for more capable nuclear weapons, South Korean officials say. But the renewed focus on economic development could be a bid to unify North Koreans and strengthen support for the leadership, said Baik Tae-hyun, a spokesman for South Korea s Unification Ministry.  While North Korea still shows the will to continue developing its nuclear and missile program, their focus on the economy is also helping the North Korean people come together,  Baik said. North Korea may be starting to feel the pinch of sanctions, tightened after its sixth and most powerful nuclear test in September, and its leadership could be under pressure to limit their impact, said Nam Sung-wook, a professor of North Korean studies at Korea University in Seoul.  Kim Jong Un has been simply doing what he does best - encouraging his people to achieve rapid economic growth and boost production,  Nam said.  Taking care of the economy and his people are the top priorities.  Since taking the reins of the reclusive regime after the death of his father at the end of 2011, Kim has embraced a goal of simultaneously pursing economic development and advanced nuclear weapons. New U.N. Security Council sanctions in August and September banned imports of coal, textiles and seafood, while restricting oil shipments to the North. North Korean officials have said in state media the sanctions were causing a  colossal amount of damage  to ordinary North Koreans, while leaders have shown defiance, arguing that self-reliance can overcome international pressure.  The main key to foiling the extremely vicious sanctions and pressure of the U.S. imperialists and their vassal forces and turning misfortune into a blessing is just self-reliance and the sci-tech strength,  Kim said in an Oct. 7 speech to leaders of his ruling Workers  Party of Korea, according to state media.        Benjamin Katzeff Silberstein, a researcher with the Foreign Policy Research Institute who tracks North Korea s economy, said there was a push to expand manufacturing and decrease reliance on imports of a wide range of goods. North Korea was also looking to expand exports of products not covered by sanctions, such as tractors, Silberstein added. While analysts say there is anecdotal evidence the sanctions are beginning to the North s economy, it is not clear to what degree. Prices of petrol and diesel have spiked, but the cost of foods likes corn and rice have remained relatively stable, according to a Reuters analysis of market data collected by the defector-run Daily NK website.

Zimbabwe military's statement after seizing power,"HARARE (Reuters) - Following is the text of an address made by Zimbabwe Major General SB Moyo, Chief of Staff Logistics, on national television after the military seized power:  Following the address we made on November 13, 2017, which we believe our main broadcaster, the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation and The Herald were directed not to publicize, the situation in our country has moved to another level. Firstly, we wish to assure the nation that His Excellency the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, and commander-in-chief of Zimbabwe Defence Forces, Comrade RG Mugabe, and his family are safe and sound and their security is guaranteed.  We are only targeting criminals around him who are committing crimes that are causing social and economic suffering in the country in order to bring them to justice.  As soon as we have accomplished our mission, we expect that the situation will return to normalcy. To the civil servants, as you are aware, there is a plan by the same individuals to influence the current purging that is taking place in the political sphere to the civil service. We are against that act of injustice and we intend to protect every one of you against that.  To the judiciary, the measures underway are intended to assure that as an independent arm of the state you are able to exercise your independent authority without fear of being obstructed as has been the case with this group of individuals.  To our members of parliament, your legislative role is of paramount importance for peace and stability in this country and it is our desire that a dispensation is created that allows you to serve your respective political constituencies according to democratic tenets.  To the generality of the people of Zimbabwe we urge you to remain calm and limit unnecessary movement. However, we encourage those who are employed and those with essential business in the city to continue their normal activities usual. Our wish is that you enjoy your rights and freedoms and that we return our country to a dispensation that allows for investment, development and prosperity that we all fought for and for which many of our citizens paid the supreme sacrifice.  To political parties we urge you to discourage your members from engaging in violent behavior.  To the youth we call upon you to realize that the future of this country is yours. Do not be enticed with dirty coins of silver. Be disciplined and remain committed to the ethos and values of this great nation.  To all churches and religious organizations in Zimbabwe we call upon you and your congregations to pray for our country and preach the gospel of love, peace, unity and development.  To both our people and the world beyond our borders, we wish to make it abundantly clear that this is not a military takeover of government. What the Zimbabwe Defence Forces is actually doing is to pacify a degenerating political, social and economic situation in our country, which if not addressed may result in a violent conflict.  We call upon all the war veterans to play positive in ensuring peace, stability and unity in the country.  To members of the defense forces, all leave is canceled and you all to return to your barracks with immediate effect.  To our respected traditional leaders, you are our custodians of our culture, customs, traditions and heritage and we request you to provide leadership and direction to your communities for the sake of unity and development in our country.  To the other Security Services: We urge you to cooperate for the good of our country. Let it be clear that we intend to address the human security threats in our country. Therefore any provocation will be met with an appropriate response.  To the media; we urge you report fairly and responsibly.  Thank you  ",worldnews,"November 15, 2017 ",1

Going strong after 70 years: UK's Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip celebrate platinum anniversary,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain s Queen Elizabeth will add another landmark to her record-breaking reign on Monday when she and Prince Philip celebrate their 70th wedding anniversary. Princess Elizabeth, as she was at the time, married dashing naval officer Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten at London s Westminster Abbey on Nov. 20, 1947, just two years after the end of World War Two, in a lavish ceremony attended by statesmen and royalty from around the world. Seventy years on, Elizabeth, 91, and her 96-year-old husband will mark their platinum anniversary with a small family party at Windsor Castle, the monarch s home to the west of London. A spokesman for Buckingham Palace said there would be no public event to mark the occasion. Greek-born Philip, a descendant of Elizabeth s great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria in his own right, has been at his wife s side throughout her 65-year reign, the longest in British history. He was the person who broke the news to her in 1952 that her father, George VI, had died and that she was now queen.  One of the secrets of this very, very long marriage, and it s an incredibly impressive anniversary, is the fact Prince Philip has always seen it as his main duty to support the queen, to help her in whatever way he can,  royal historian Hugo Vickers told Reuters.  He is the only person who can actually tell the queen absolutely straight what he thinks, and if he thinks some idea is ridiculous he will say so in whatever language he chooses to use.  The couple first met when they attended the wedding of Prince Philip s cousin, Princess Marina of Greece, to Elizabeth s uncle, the Duke of Kent, in 1934.  Philip then gained the attention of his future wife when the then-13-year-old princess made a visit with her parents to Britain s Royal Naval College at Dartmouth in southern England where he was a cadet.  She was truly in love from the very beginning,  the queen s cousin Margaret Rhodes, a life-long friend and one of her bridesmaids who died last year, wrote in her memoir.     Their engagement was announced in July 1947 and they married four months later. With Britain still recovering from the war, the wedding offered a rare burst of color and pageantry against an austere background of rationing and shortages. The 21-year-old princess, who wore an ivory silk Norman Hartnell gown decorated with 10,000 seed pearls, had to collect coupons for her dress like other post-war brides and the couple spent their honeymoon in southern England and Scotland. While some two billion people were estimated to have watched the couple s grandson Prince William marry his wife Kate in 2011, their own wedding was only broadcast live to some 200 million radio listeners, although highlights of the day were captured on grainy black and white film footage.   I can see that you are sublimely happy with Philip which is right, but don t forget us is the wish of your ever loving & devoted Papa,  King George wrote to his daughter after the wedding. While royal watchers say Elizabeth and Philip have had their ups and downs like any married couple, they have avoided the travails of three of their four children whose marriages have ended in divorce, most notably heir Prince Charles s ill-fated union with his late first wife Princess Diana. It was at the couple s 50th wedding anniversary in 1997 that the queen paid a rare personal tribute to her husband.  He has, quite simply, been my strength and stay all these years,  Elizabeth said.  No other British monarch has celebrated such a landmark, and indeed Elizabeth was the first to mark a diamond wedding anniversary in 2007.  Philip, who has suffered health issues in recent years and was hospitalized in June, retired from active public life in August. They both attended a memorial service on Remembrance Sunday on Nov. 12, although a royal source said the monarch had decided not to lay a wreath so she could watch from a nearby balcony alongside her husband.   Without Prince Philip the queen would have had a very tough and lonely life. He s been a complete support to her, a rock to her, from the moment she was on the throne,  royal biographer Claudia Joseph told Reuters. ",worldnews,"November 15, 2017 ",1
Rights watchers slam Myanmar's ban on protests in biggest city,"YANGON (Reuters) - Human rights monitors on Wednesday urged Myanmar to withdraw a  ban on protests in its largest city, Yangon, amid fears that free speech is under pressure under the government led by democracy champion Aung San Suu Kyi.  Suu Kyi led efforts to end decades of military rule and won a landmark election in the Buddhist-majority country in 2015, but her civilian government shares power with the military and has no control over the army and police. She has also been roundly criticised in the West for failing to rein in the military over its alleged role in atrocities  against minority Rohingya Muslims which the United Nations has described as textbook ethnic cleansing. The ban on protests, issued this month by a military-controlled ministry, restricts all applications for processions or assemblies in central Yangon in order to avoid  public annoyance and anxiety  and  disturbance of traffic , according to official documents reviewed by Reuters.      The curb came weeks before Pope Francis  visit to Yangon, when he is expected to raise the Rohingya, hundreds of thousands of whom have fled the country after a Myanmar army offensive in August.  It underscores rising concerns over free speech after recent arrests of journalists and activists in Myanmar.   There is no legitimate reason for imposing a ban on all protests in major sections of Burma s largest city,  said Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch, referring to Myanmar by its old name.   This directive was issued by a military officer and should be seen by the civilian government as a direct challenge to its commitment to basic rights for Burmese citizens. The government needs to reverse this ban and uphold the rule of law and refuse to capitulate to arbitrary actions by the military.  The order, issued by Yangon Region Security and Border Affairs Minister Colonel Aung Soe Moe, instructs authorities in 11 townships to deny all applications for assemblies. It does not say how long the curb will last.  A senior official from the military-run General Administration Department in Yangon s Ahlone Township confirmed that his office has received the order. He declined to be named as he s not authorized to speak to the media.     Reuters was unable to contact Yangon s police deputy chief by telephone. The office of Yangon s chief minister Phyo Min Thein declined to comment. A Myanmar court last week jailed for two months two journalists along with their interpreter and driver for violating an aircraft law by filming with a drone. Police on Sunday arrested an ultra-nationalist Buddhist monk who has a history of stoking sentiment against the Rohingya.  Since Suu Kyi s government took power last year, 93 people including journalists and activists have been charged or arrested under a controversial law that some worry is used to curb criticism of the authorities, according to advocacy group Research Team for Telecommunications Law.

"China corruption could lead to Soviet-style collapse, graft buster says","BEIJING (Reuters) - China must step up its battle against corruption in order to safeguard against a Soviet-style collapse, the country s second most senior graft buster said in an editorial on Wednesday. Yang Xiaodu, the deputy secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, who was promoted to the ruling Communist Party s 25-strong Politburo last month, said failure would risk the  red country changing color . In unusually direct and strongly worded criticism of previous administrations, Yang said  in a previous period , corruption had been allowed to fester to such an extent that the party s leadership had weakened, with supervision soft, and ideology apathetic.  It had developed to the point where if not rectified, the country could change color,  Yang wrote in the official People s Daily.  The future fate of the party and the country s people could follow the same old road to ruin as the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc.  President Xi Jinping, like many officials before him, is steeped in the party s long-held belief that loosening control too quickly or even at all could lead to chaos and the break up of the country. The party regularly implores cadres to study the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s.     Yang s editorial is the latest salvo signaling that the intensity of Xi s signature war on corruption would not wane despite the departure of Xi s right-hand man, Wang Qishan, who was widely seen as China s second most powerful politician before being replaced as anti-corruption chief in a leadership reshuffle last month.  Wang s replacement, Zhao Leji, wrote a similarly strongly worded editorial in the People s Daily on Saturday. Yang said Xi s anti-corruption achievements had been revolutionary in  turning the blade of the knife inward . But he said unhealthy pollutants within the party s political ecosystem had yet to be completely cleansed, and the anti-corruption fight remained  grave and complex .  There is no road for retreat, only forward in attack, and definitely no pause or relax,  Yang wrote. China has plans for a national supervision law and a new commission next year to oversee the expansion of Xi s graft fight. Yang, who is also minister of supervision, had been Wang s deputy since 2014 and his promotion to the Politburo is seen as another display of the importance the central leadership attaches to fighting corruption.

Beijing hits brakes on subway boom over debt concerns,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China has hit the brakes on subway projects in at least three cities and Beijing is asking others to slow down their plans, local governments and media have reported, indicating concerns over high debt from city-level infrastructure spending. China has been in the grips of a metro-building binge with more than 50 cities working on over 1 trillion yuan ($150.8 billion) worth of projects, after population restrictions were loosened last year to allow more cities to have metro systems. Such infrastructure spending has helped to shore up economic growth but is now being scrutinized more closely after the government pledged to clamp down on financial risks. Policymakers have warned about the risk of asset bubbles due to high levels of corporate and household debt in the economy. China s overall debt has jumped to more than 250 percent of GDP from 150 percent at the end of 2006. Financial magazine Caixin, citing unnamed sources close to the matter, reported that authorities in Inner Mongolia s Hohhot and Baotou cities have scrapped approved projects worth billions of dollars in recent months due to concerns over finances.  Xianyang city which wants to build six lines to link up to central Shaanxi province s capital of Xi an, said in a statement this month some of its plans had not yet been approved by the state planner, the National Development and Reform Commission.   The NDRC has become more cautious about approving metro construction plans and it will be difficult to achieve approval within the year,  it said, adding that one of the factors was debt concerns over the Baotou metro. The Economic Observer newspaper said it was told by the Wuhan city planner that the NDRC was re-evaluating the country s subway construction situation.  The Baotou city planner declined to comment when contacted by Reuters on Wednesday. The NDRC and authorities in Hohhot and Wuhan did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Guotai Junan analyst Gary Wong said such a crackdown on metro projects was appropriate given that many remote and financially weak cities had undertaken metro projects. He said  he did not anticipate a large impact on locomotive suppliers such as CRRC Corp who have shifted focus to metros to offset the slowing high-speed rail market.  They are already full with orders, even if they don t get new orders at the moment they will still be busy for the next 2-3 years,  he said.  China would overtake Europe and the Americas if all 50 cities went ahead with their metro plans, data from the International Association of Public Transport showed. Europe has 46 cities with metro systems, and America has 33 cities.  The China Association of Metros said in July that 30 cities currently have metros. ",worldnews,"November 15, 2017 ",1

China says Catalonia situation shows Taiwan independence effort doomed to fail,"BEIJING (Reuters) - The failure of Catalonia s effort to declare independence shows that Taiwan independence is also doomed to fail as national unity is paramount for all countries, a Chinese official said on Wednesday. China takes a dim view of independence or secessionist movements around the world, while saying it adheres to a policy of non-interference in other nations  internal affairs. Beijing has said it opposes any actions to split Spain. Last month Madrid assumed direct rule over Catalonia after the Spanish prime minister sacked the region s secessionist government which had declared independence from Spain following an attempted referendum. The issue is particularly sensitive for China because of the status of self-ruled and democratic Taiwan, claimed by China as its inherent territory, but where many people would like to proclaim formal independence, a red line for Beijing. The failure of Catalonia s independence bid was a good thing, said Ma Xiaoguang, the spokesman of China s policy-making Taiwan Affairs Office.  The failure of the Catalonia referendum fully shows that protecting national sovereignty and territorial integrity is a paramount national interest for east or west,  Ma told a regular news briefing.  So Taiwan independence is doomed to failure.  Relations between Beijing and Taipei have nosedived since the island elected Tsai Ing-wen as president last year. China believes she wants formal independence for Taiwan. Tsai says she wants to maintain peace with China, but will defend Taiwan s democracy and security. China has suspended a regular dialogue mechanism with Taiwan, stepped up military drills around the island and sought to squeeze its international space by siphoning off Taiwan s remaining diplomatic allies. This week, Taiwan said its environment minister had been prevented from attending an annual U.N. climate meeting in Germany, despite credentials as a non-governmental participant, due to pressure from China. Ma said Taiwan had itself to blame for the poor state of ties and its inability to participate in events such as the climate talks.  The Taiwan side shouldn t put blame on others while they themselves are to blame, and should earnestly reflect on things,  he added. ",worldnews,"November 15, 2017 ",1
Colombia court approves peace tribunals ahead of congressional vote,"BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia s constitutional court said in a ruling late on Tuesday that special justice tribunals outlined in a peace deal between the government and the Marxist FARC rebels are constitutional, ahead of a congressional vote on the subject. The court upheld most of the provisions agreed in the 2016 peace accord for the special courts, which will mete out alternative sentences like landmine removal for ex-guerrilla leaders from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) who are convicted of war crimes. Congress is holding debates on a law which would approve the tribunals. The bill has been backed by committees in both the upper and lower houses and is expected to be put to floor votes this week. President Juan Manuel Santos, speaking on television after the court s decision, urged congress to pass the law as quickly as possible. Guerrilla leaders participating in politics as part of the FARC s new political party will still have to comply with sentences from the court, he said, while Colombians, many of whom despise the group, must accept that the deal allows them to run for office.  Colombians, with our votes, will decide if we accept their ideas and proposals or if we reject them. Without a doubt it is better to have the FARC giving speeches than shooting bullets,  Santos said.  The court made several modifications to the law, local media reported, opening the possibility that ex-rebels could be extradited for crimes committed after the peace process ends and that former guerrillas elected to public office could lose their seats if they fail to comply with the tribunal process.

Alleged ringleader of 2010 migrant massacre in Mexico arrested,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The alleged mastermind of one of the worst massacres of migrants in Mexico s long drug war was detained on Tuesday in an operation led by federal police.

Protest over odor from rotting corpses shuts Mexican government office,"CHILPANCINGO, Mexico (Reuters) - A protest by government workers in a drug violence-riddled southern Mexican city over rotting corpses at the municipal morgue temporarily closed a prosecutor s office on Tuesday, officials said. The protest by some 60 workers forced the office in the city of Chilpancingo, the capital of southern Guerrero state, to shut for about three hours. The protesters complained that overcrowding at the morgue was causing unsanitary conditions. Violence has spiked in Guerrero in recent years as a growing number of criminal gangs vie for control of crops of opium poppies and for drug-trafficking routes. Media reports said that at least 500 corpses were being stored in the morgue. Officials promised protesters that future transfers of bodies to the morgue will involve better sanitary conditions.

"Russia attacked energy, telecom and media in Britain: government official","(Reuters) - Russian cyber operatives have attacked Britain s media, telecommunications and energy sectors over the past year, according to prepared remarks by the head of the government s  main cyber defense agency. Ciaran Martin, chief executive of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), declined to provide any details on the attacks in a speech scheduled for Wednesday in London. The remarks follow comments on Monday from Prime Minister Theresa May in which she accused Russia of spreading disinformation and meddling in elections, echoing a heated debate in the United States over alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Russian has strongly denied any election interference in the United States. The Russian embassy in Washington did not immediately respond when asked after normal business hours for comment on Martin s remarks. The NCSC, a branch of the GCHQ, Britain s main signals intelligence agency, has been in operation for a year and is charged with shoring up cyber security by working with a wide range of stakeholders. Martin said in his prepared remarks:  I can confirm that Russian interference, seen by the National Cyber Security Centre over the past the year, has included attacks on the UK media, telecommunication and energy sectors.   The agency was  actively engaging with international partners, industry and civil society  to tackle the threat from Russia, he said. Martin echoed May s comments that Russia was trying to  undermine the international system  with information warfare and cyber attacks.  Cyber security experts have long worried about attacks on electrical grids in particular, but Martin offered no evidence that the alleged Russian attacks succeeded in penetrating power systems or other critical infrastructure in the UK.

Venezuela opposition says talks with government delayed,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela s opposition said on Tuesday that this week s planned political dialogue in the Dominican Republic with President Nicolas Maduro s government was being postponed because regional guarantors were not going.  The international negotiation process cannot go ahead until the foreign ministers are invited,  opposition negotiator Luis Florido said, referring to the potential presence of Latin American foreign ministers at the talks. Negotiations to ease a bitter and long-running political crisis in the OPEC nation had been scheduled for Wednesday. Previous dialogue efforts have ended in recriminations between the two sides with no concrete progress. The opposition coalition had previously accused the Maduro government of blocking the presence of foreign ministers at this week s talks, but on Tuesday said it appeared to be more a scheduling problem. There was no immediate response from officials. The opposition s principal demand is for free and fair conditions for the 2018 presidential election.  It also wants freedom for jailed activists, autonomy for the opposition-led Congress, and a foreign humanitarian aid corridor to help alleviate Venezuela s unprecedented economic crisis.  Maduro accuses his opponents of conspiring with the United States and a right-wing international campaign to oust his socialist government via a coup. The government is seeking guarantees against violence and recognition of the pro-Maduro Constituent Assembly that has overridden Congress. At least 125 people died in four months of often violent protests against Maduro earlier this year. Foes say he is a dictator who has wrecked a once-prosperous economy. Maduro and his allies have accused the opposition of preferring violence to dialogue. Debt refinancing talks with international investors had begun successfully in Caracas on Monday, the government said, though creditors said the discussions were fruitless.

Oil seen as real prize of Iran's Kurdish adventure,"BAGHDAD/LONDON (Reuters) - After helping Iraq stifle a Kurdish push for independence, Iran is now positioning itself to take control of oil exports from the region s giant Kirkuk field, with the first deliveries expected within days, officials and trading sources said. In the weeks since September s failed Kurdish independence referendum, Iraq has agreed for the first time to divert crude from Kirkuk province, which it retook from the Kurds, to Iran, where it will supply a refinery in the city of Kermanshah. Iran is locked in a proxy war with its regional rival and U.S. ally, Saudi Arabia. As well as Iraq, it has been extending its influence in Syria, Yemen and Lebanon, raising increasing concerns in Washington and Riyadh. Under the new arrangement, the first oil will be trucked across the border in the coming days. Initially Iran will receive 15,000 barrels per day worth nearly $1 million, rising gradually to 60,000 bpd, according to Iraqi officials and trading sources. Baghdad and Tehran have also revived a project to build a pipeline to carry oil from Iraq s Kirkuk fields to central Iran and onwards for export from the Gulf. Hamid Hosseini, the Iranian secretary-general of the Iran-Iraq Chamber of Commerce, said Iran want to build a pipeline that can take as much as 650,000 bpd of Kurdish oil for its domestic refineries and for exports. The pipeline would replace existing export routes for crude from northern Iraq via Turkey and the Mediterranean and would be a blow to Ankara s hopes of becoming an energy hub for Europe. It would also be evidence of a U.S. failure to prevent a rapprochement between its ally Iraq and one of its biggest political foes, Iran, which is rapidly regaining influence in the Middle East. That is in part due to general Qassem Soleimani, commander of the Quds force, the international branch of the Revolutionary Guards, which is also taking a keen interest in Iran s oil business in Iraq. Soleimani visited Iraqi Kurdistan in September to warn the region against holding an independence vote. He was also involved in the Iraqi army s recapture of Kirkuk.  In Iraq, Iranian forces are working to sow discord as we recently saw in Kirkuk, where the presence of Quds force commander, Qassem Soleimani, exacerbated tensions among the Kurds and the government in Baghdad,  U.S. Senator John McCain said in Washington last week.  The Kurdish dream of being a big oil exporter is in tatters,  said a source close to the government in Erbil, who predicted that  Iran will be king of the game . The Kurds  bid for independence angered Turkey and Iran, which both have large Kurdish populations and condemned the referendum  as destabilizing the region. The United States also called on Kurdistan to scrap the vote.  But it was probably internal Kurdish divisions which doomed the referendum to failure, local political sources believe. Oil was at the heart of this dispute. The Kirkuk fields were controlled by Iraq s state oil firm SOMO before being taken over by Kurdish forces in 2014, when the Iraqi army retreated in the face of attacks by Islamic state. The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan party (PUK), in Sulaimaniya, then accused the ruling Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) party of then President Massoud Barzani, based in the capital Erbil, of not sharing the oil wealth. The PUK wanted to export oil from Kirkuk to Iran.  We tried to make Barzani accept joint management between Erbil and Sulaimaniya over the fields but he strongly opposed it,  said Sherzad Yaba, a political adviser close to the PUK.  To put an end to the illegitimate control of the KDP over Kirkuk oil, senior members from the PUK contacted both Baghdad and Tehran and encouraged the Iranians to build a pipeline to export Kirkuk crude through Bandar Abbas port,  said Yaba. The project lay dormant even though Iraqi oil minister Jabar al-Luaibi and his Iranian counterpart Bijal Zanganeh signed a memorandum on the project in February.  After the referendum, the KDP accused the PUK of striking a deal with Iran to withdraw from Kirkuk, which the PUK denies. The recapture of Kirkuk was coordinated with Soleimani and left Iraqi government troops in control of half of all Kurdish oil output. As Kurdish engineers fled the fields, output from Kirkuk was suspended and has remained shut for the past five weeks as Baghdad and Erbil argue over the revenue split. With output of over 300,000 bpd suspended since mid-October, losses are approaching $1 billion, according to Kurdish industry sources. To stop the losses, Iraq and the PUK resumed talks with Iran, according to Iraqi and Kurdish officials. Officials from Iraq s and Iran s state oil firms, SOMO and NICO, met last month to iron out details of oil sales to the Kermanshah refinery, the acting chief of SOMO, Alaa al-Yasiri, said. He also said active discussions were taking place about the pipeline project. Even though discussions between Baghdad and Tehran have been conducted between oil ministry officials and the Chamber of Commerce, the Revolutionary Guards are poised to step in.  Any oil transaction between Iran and Iraq should be approved by the Revolutionary Guards, not the oil ministry.  said Reza Mostafavi Tabatabaei, president of London-based ENEXD, a firm involved in the energy equipment business in the Middle East. Those dealings are overseen by the desk responsible for Iran s investments in Iraq at the president s office and are run by the Revolutionary Guards. The pipeline project will be the Revolutionary Guards  reward to the Kurds for helping with the recapture of Kirkuk, said Tabatabaei. ",worldnews,"November 14, 2017 ",1
Alaska Airlines discontinues Los Angeles-Havana daily flight,"(Reuters) - U.S. airline Alaska Airlines on Tuesday said it would discontinue a daily flight between Los Angeles and Havana, Cuba, after Jan. 22, due to the recent changes in Cuba travel policies by the U.S. government. The U.S. government made it tougher last week for Americans to visit Cuba and do business in the country, making good on a pledge by President Donald Trump to roll back his Democratic predecessor s move toward warmer ties with Havana.  The regulations include a ban on Americans doing business with some 180 Cuban government entities, holding companies, and tourism companies. The airline which started the Los Angeles-Havana flight in January this year, said it will redeploy the aircraft to other markets with stronger demand.   Passengers who have tickets booked to Havana after January 22 will be rebooked on another airline at no additional cost or a full refund, the company said. ",worldnews,"November 15, 2017 ",1
Soldiers on Harare streets as ruling party accuses Zimbabwe army chief of treason,"HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe s ruling party accused the head of the armed forces of treason on Tuesday as troops took up positions around the capital in an escalation of a dispute with 93-year-old President Robert Mugabe over political succession. Just 24 hours after military chief General Constantino Chiwenga threatened to intervene to end a purge in the ruling party, a Reuters reporter saw six armored personnel carriers on major thoroughfares on the outskirts of the capital. Aggressive soldiers directing traffic told passing cars to keep moving through the darkness.  Don t try anything funny. Just go,  one soldier said on Harare Drive. The presence of troops, including the movement of at least six armored personnel carriers from a barracks northwest of Harare, sparked rumors of coup against Mugabe, although there was no evidence to suggest Zimbabwe s leader of the last 37 years had been toppled. The lead item on the ZBC state broadcaster s evening news bulletin was an anti-military rally by the youth wing of Mugabe s ZANU-PF party. The Southern African nation has been on edge since Monday when Chiwenga, Commander of Zimbabwe Defence Forces, said he was prepared to  step in  to end a purge of supporters of a sacked vice president. The unprecedented statement represents an escalation of a rumbling political struggle over who will succeed Mugabe, who has been in power since the country gained independence from Britain in 1980. Mugabe chaired a weekly cabinet meeting in the capital on Tuesday. Afterwards, ZANU-PF said it stood by the  primacy of politics over the gun  and accused Chiwenga of  treasonable conduct... meant to incite insurrection.  Mugabe fired Vice President Emerson Mnangagwa last week. The veteran of the 1970s liberation war was popular with the military and had been seen as a likely successor to Mugabe. The army views his removal as part of a purge of independence-era figures to pave the way for Mugabe to hand power to his wife Grace Mugabe. A Reuters witness saw two armored vehicles parked beside the main road from Harare to Chinhoyi, about 20 km (14 miles) from the city. One, which was pointed in the direction of the capital, had come off its tracks. Witnesses said they saw four armored vehicles turn before reaching Harare and head towards the Presidential Guard compound in a suburb on the outskirts of Harare.  There were about four tanks and they turned right here, you can see markings on the road,  one witness on the Chinhoyi highway said, referring to the armored vehicles. He pointed to a road that links to the guard compound. The troop movements raise tension on a continent where for decades armies regularly overthrew civilian governments. Neither the president nor his wife responded in public to the general s remarks and state media did not publish Chiwenga s statement. The Herald newspaper posted some of the comments on its Twitter page but deleted them. The head of ZANU-PF s youth wing accused the army chief of subverting the constitution. Grace Mugabe has developed a strong following in the powerful youth wing.  Defending the revolution and our leader and president is an ideal we live for and if need be it is a principle we are prepared to die for,  Kudzai Chipanga, who leads the ZANU-PF Youth League, said at the party s headquarters in Harare. Grace Mugabe s rise has brought her into conflict with the independence-era war veterans, who once enjoyed a privileged role in the ruling party under Mugabe, but who have in recent years been banished from senior government and party roles. Decades ago, Zimbabwe had one of Africa s promising economies due in part to its agricultural exports. The country is currently struggling to pay for imports due to a dollar crunch, which is also sparking rampant inflation only 10 years after it suffered a financial implosion caused when the central bank began to print money. Martin Rupiya, an expert on Zimbabwe military affairs at the University of South Africa in Pretoria, said the army appeared to be putting the squeeze on Mugabe.  There s a rupture between the executive and the armed forces,  Rupiya said. Alex Magaisa, a British-based Zimbabwean academic said it was premature to talk about a coup.   A military coup is the nuclear option. A coup would be a very hard sell at home and in the international community. They will want to avoid that,  Magaisa said. ",worldnews,"November 14, 2017 ",1

"Iran quake survivors complain of slow aid effort, battle freezing cold","ANKARA (Reuters) - Exhausted and exposed to freezing cold, survivors of a weekend earthquake in western Iran begged authorities for food and shelter on Tuesday, saying aid was slow to reach them. Iranian officials called off rescue operations earlier in  the day on the grounds that there was little chance of finding more survivors from the quake, which killed at least 530 people and injured thousands of others. It was Iran s deadliest earthquake in more than a decade.  Survivors, many left homeless by Sunday s 7.3 magnitude quake that struck villages and towns in Kermansheh province along the mountainous border with Iraq, struggled through another bleak day on Tuesday in need of food, water and shelter. Iran has so far declined offers of foreign assistance to deal with the aftermath of the tremor, which officials said damaged 30,000 homes and completely destroyed two villages.  The U.S. government expressed condolences to the Iranian people despite President Donald Trump s  aggressive  policy towards the Islamic Republic, Iranian state media reported.   We are hungry. We are cold. We are homeless. We are alone in this world,  a weeping Maryam Ahang, who lost 10 members of her family in the hardest hit town of Sarpol-e Zahab, told Reuters by telephone.  My home is now a pile of mud and broken tiles. I slept in the park last night. It is cold and I am scared.   Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei urged state agencies on Tuesday to speed up aid efforts. President Hassan Rouhani paid a visit to the stricken region, promising to resolve  the problems in the shortest time .  Thousands of people huddled in makeshift camps while many others chose to spend another cold night in the open because they feared more tremors after some 230 aftershocks.    In some areas, no building was left standing and those that were had been deserted for fear they could come crashing down at any moment. Houses in impoverished Iranian villages are often made of concrete blocks or mudbrick that can quickly crumble and collapse in a strong quake.  State television aired footage of weeping villagers carrying away bodies wrapped in bloodied blankets and bed sheets and scrabbling with their bare hands through rubble in search of friends and relatives.  It was my cousin s birthday ... All the relatives were there ... like 50 people. But now almost all are dead,  Reza, who refused to give his full name, told Reuters from Sarpol-e Zahab town. He lost 34 members of his family on Sunday.    We spent two nights in the cold. Where is the aid?   On the Iraq side of the frontier, nine people were killed and over 550 injured, all in the northern Kurdish provinces. Television showed rescue workers combing through the rubble of dozens of villages immediately after the quake. But by Tuesday morning Iranian officials said there was no longer any likelihood of finding survivors and called off the search.  Hospitals in nearby provinces took in many of the injured, state television said, airing footage of survivors waiting to be treated. Hundreds of critically injured were dispatched to hospitals in Tehran.   Iran s Red Crescent said emergency shelter had been provided for thousands of homeless people but a lack of electricity and water, as well as blocked roads, hindered aid supply efforts.  People in some villages are still in dire need of food, water and shelter,  said Faramraz Akbari, governor of Qasr-e Shirin county in Kermanshah province.  State TV showed dozens of green and white tents dotting Sarpol-e Zahab, many containing two or three families. Groups clustered around bonfires trying to warm themselves.  It is cold. My children are freezing. We have water and food but no tent. The quake did not kill us but the cold weather will kill us,  a woman in her 30s said.   The mayor of the city of Ezgeleh said 80 percent of its buildings had collapsed. Survivors desperately needed tents with elderly people and babies as young as a one-year-old sleeping in the cold for two straight nights.  People are hungry and thirsty,  a local man told ISNA news agency.  There is no electricity. Last night I cried when I saw children with no food or shelter.   Some people were angry that among the collapsed buildings were homes built under an affordable housing scheme initiated in 2011 by then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.   The people should build their own houses. They build better houses than those built under projects and schemes,  Rouhani said in Kermanshah, state TV reported.  I promise you, those responsible will be punished.  Iran is crisscrossed by major geological fault lines and has suffered several devastating earthquakes in recent years, including a 6.6 quake in 2003 that reduced the historic southeastern city of Bam to dust and killed some 31,000 people.

"After U.S. visit, South Sudan's Kiir orders unhindered aid access","UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - South Sudan s President Salva Kiir has ordered that humanitarian aid convoys be allowed to move freely, unhindered and unimpeded around the country, two weeks after the United States said it had lost trust in his government and threatened to pull support. The Nov. 9 order, seen by Reuters, directs that all roadblocks should be removed, all levels of government must assist aid groups, and anyone who obstructs aid or imposes taxes on aid convoys shall be held accountable.  The move came two weeks after U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley met with Kiir in Juba. She was the first member of President Donald Trump s cabinet to visit South Sudan, which spiraled into civil war in late 2013, two years after gaining independence from Sudan. Haley said Washington had lost trust in Kiir s government for fueling the civil war, and demanded that Kiir allow full and consistent humanitarian aid access.  This is a good sign, but we must see actions - more than words from President Kiir,  Haley said in a statement on Tuesday, referring to the Nov. 9 presidential order.  The true test will be whether humanitarian assistance is actually allowed to get to the South Sudanese people in a consistent way. We will be watching, and we will continue to encourage President Kiir to do the right thing,  she said. Haley s office said Kiir had yet to deliver on further commitments made during a 45-minute, one-on-one meeting with Haley in Juba.    The war in South Sudan, sparked by a feud between Kiir and his former deputy Riek Machar, has plunged parts of the world s youngest nation into famine. Some 4 million people have fled their homes, a third of the country s population. U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator for South Sudan, Alain Noudehou, welcomed Kiir s Nov. 9 order.   We hope that the order will have a positive impact in reducing the many constraints faced by humanitarian partners that delay or prevent the provision of urgently needed help,  Noudehou said in a statement on Monday. This was not the first time Kiir has pledged to improve the humanitarian aid situation.  When U.N. Security Council ambassadors visited in September 2016, Kiir agreed to eliminate illegal checkpoints and streamline bureaucratic processes and access to people in need. The following month he set up a high-level humanitarian oversight committee to improve cooperation with aid groups. Yet U.N. sanctions monitors, in a report to the U.N. Security Council seen by Reuters last week, have accused Kiir s government of using food as a weapon of war to target civilians by blocking life-saving aid in some areas. They found that armed forces, groups and militias - particularly those affiliated with Kiir and Vice President Taban Deng Gai - continued to  actively impede both humanitarian and peacekeeping operations.  In his Nov. 9 order, Kiir directed the high-level humanitarian oversight committee ensure the aid convoys and groups can move freely and that state-level oversight committees be created.

"Volkswagen says offices of CFO, HR chief, chairman raided by tax authorities and prosecutors","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Prosecutors and tax authorities on Tuesday raided the offices of several senior officials of Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), the German car-maker said. Investigators searched the offices of supervisory board chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch, finance chief Frank Witter, and human resources head Karlheinz Blessing, a Volkswagen spokesman said. Files and computers were seized. The raid was related to suspicions of overpayments for works council chief Bernd Osterloh, the spokesman said. Osterloh s office was also searched.  Neither the works council nor the prosecutor in Braunschweig were immediately available for comment. A person with knowledge of the matter said the tax authorities were acting on suspicion of tax evasion. That is because over-remuneration could result in overly high operating expenses and the payment of too little tax. It was revealed earlier that German prosecutors were investigating current and former executives at Volkswagen on suspicion that they paid works council chief Bernd Osterloh an excessive salary.  In Germany, wasting corporate funds is legally a breach of fiduciary duty. ",worldnews,"November 14, 2017 ",1
U.S. government shares technical details on North Korean hacking campaign,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Tuesday issued a technical alert about cyber attacks it said are sponsored by the North Korean government that have targeted the aerospace, telecommunications and financial industries since 2016. The alert, from the FBI and Department of Homeland Security, said North Korean hackers were using a type of malware known as  FALLCHILL  to gain entry to computer systems and compromise network systems.  The FBI and DHS had issued a warning in June that squarely blamed the North Korean government for a raft of cyber attacks stretching back to 2009 targeting media, aerospace and financial sectors, as well as critical infrastructure, in the United States and globally. Tuesday s alert included the publication of IP addresses   the FBI said were linked to the hacking campaign and was intended to help private industry guard against the attacks. The FALLCHILL malware was described as providing hackers with wide latitude to monitor and disrupt infected systems. The malware typically gained access to systems as a file sent via other North Korean malware or when users unknowingly downloaded it by visiting sites compromised by the hackers. The new alert coincides with increasing tensions between Washington and Pyongyang over North Korea s missile tests. The previous warning, in June, said that North Korea would continue to rely on cyber operations to advance its military and strategic objectives. North Korea has routinely denied involvement in cyber attacks against other countries. ",worldnews,"November 14, 2017 ",1

"German parties want lobbyist registry, may mandate hack reports","BERLIN (Reuters) - German parties exploring a coalition government agreed on Tuesday to set up a mandatory registry of lobbyists and may require private firms to disclose breaches of cyber defenses, according to a draft paper on security seen by Reuters. The 3-page document, a blueprint for a new German government s stance on security, showed growing consensus on some issues among Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives, the pro-business Free Democrats and the environmental Greens. But several issues remained unresolved, including the number of police jobs to be added, rules on storage of private data, and the future of a controversial hate speech law. Merkel is pressing party leaders to resolve their differences by Thursday, with an eye to completing a detailed coalition agreement by Christmas. Party negotiators made progress on boosting aid to families with children on Tuesday, but remained at odds over transport and climate and put off discussing immigration until Wednesday. Top party leaders will likely have to tackle the most difficult issues on Thursday, sources said. Transportation Minister Alexander Dobrindt, a member of the CSU Bavarian sister party to Merkel s conservatives, said negotiators had been unable to bridge gaps on transportation issues despite four hours of intense discussions.  The Greens have a package of demands on the table that cannot be fulfilled,  he told reporters, citing a push by the Greens for higher taxes on diesel. He said his party would not agree to measures that would limit individual mobility or that could jeopardize the German auto industry. Negotiators did agree to create a mandatory registry of individuals lobbying government and parliament on behalf of interest groups to ensure greater transparency. They also said government agencies should be required to report cyber security gaps that affected relevant systems or a large number of people to the BSI federal cyber security agency.  The parties said they also planned to address dangers posed by cyber breaches of private companies.  This could include a reporting requirement,  the paper said, without elaborating. The paper showed the parties had agreed to create 2,000 new jobs in the federal and state justice systems, and pledged to add jobs federal law enforcement as quickly as possible. But they remained at odds about the exact number of jobs. The parties also agreed to expand control of the intelligence agencies via a special parliamentary board, according to the paper. It said the intelligence agencies and the federal government should be required to keep parliament informed about their work. The parties also agreed to dodge a dispute over the future of the European Stability Mechanism and would not include that specific issue in a paper outlining the parties  stance on Europe, negotiators said.

Trump heads home with 'America First' ringing in Asian ears,"MANILA (Reuters) - As Air Force One took off from Manila on Tuesday at the end of the longest trip to Asia by an American president in more than quarter of a century, at least two of the region s leaders had good reason to feel satisfied. At a summit in the Philippines, Donald Trump forged a  great relationship  with President Rodrigo Duterte, who only a year ago had cursed  son of a bitch  Barack Obama for decrying his administration s bloody war on drug pushers and addicts. And Trump flashed a thumbs-up as he shook hands with Cambodia s authoritarian prime minister, Hun Sen, who praised the U.S. president as a kindred spirit for telling countries to put their own interests first.  You are a great man to me,  Hun Sen said, addressing Trump at a meeting with other Southeast Asian leaders, and then referenced Trump s  America First  policy.  I would like to inform you that if you follow your new policy in respect of the independence and sovereignty of other countries, the United States will have a lot of friends and you will be much respected and loved.  For other leaders across Asia, however, Trump s go-it-alone instincts must have represented a puzzling departure from his predecessors, who were - to varying degrees - standard bearers of multilateralism, democracy and human rights. During a tour that took him to Japan, South Korea, China and Vietnam and the Philippines capital, Trump called for joint efforts to tighten the screws on North Korea and its development of nuclear weapons in defiance of U.N. sanctions. But at an Asia-Pacific summit in Vietnam, he declared that redressing the uneven balance of trade between Asia and the United States was at the center of his  America First  policy, which he says will protect U.S. workers.  Trump s vision has up-ended a consensus favoring multinational trade pacts whose regional champion is now China. On the sidelines of the Vietnam meeting, 11 countries kept alive a Trans Pacific trade deal that Trump walked away from last year in the name of protecting American jobs. One cabinet member from a major ASEAN country told Reuters there was little enthusiasm in the region for Trump s bilateral approach to deals.  As Singapore Prime Minister Lee pointed out, the reason bilateral trade deals are so attractive for the USA, is precisely why no one will want to enter into one with the USA: because the USA could bully anyone on a bilateral basis,  said the Cabinet member who did not want to be named.  Why would anyone sign up for that?  Trump told reporters before leaving that he had sealed deals of  at least $300 billion, possibly triple that figure . U.S. businesses signed around $250 billion dollars worth of deals during Trump s Beijing visit, but many of those were nonbinding. Missing was any agreement on market access or reduction in technology-sharing agreements that American businesses have long complained about. For Trump, dogged at home by low public approval ratings and investigations into Russian links to his election campaign, the deals will be an important prize to flaunt on his return.  The multi-billion-dollar deals he struck in Beijing may not help the U.S. trade deficit,  said a former Japanese diplomat in Tokyo, who declined to be named.  But optically ... he can tell people that because he went to China with business leaders, he was able to come back with a gift.  Although there were few weighty deliverables from Trump s tour, for Asian nations looking nervously at China s increasing assertiveness, it may be welcomed as a sign that his administration is still committed to the region.  What regional countries wanted was for him to simply show up   to underscore that America remained at least notionally committed to Asia,  said Shahriman Lockman, a senior analyst at the Institute of Strategic & International Studies in Malaysia. A senior official in South Korean President Moon Jae-in s administration said Seoul had been worried he  would come to South Korea and engage in unexpected behavior and language, but it turned out Trump was quite considerate.      South Korea was able to rest assured regarding its partnership with the United States,  the official said. He also got good reviews at the start of his Asia tour in Japan, which has been currying favor with Trump since right after his election when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe jetted off to Trump Tower with an expensive golf club as a present.   The most important deliverable is that we can send an almost identical message to the world that we share an identical strategy, a Japanese government official said.  For Asian leaders, Trump s off-the-cuff style, freewheeling tweets, and rhetorical hyperbole, must have been daunting. But one thing they seemed to learn was that he responds well to a lavish reception.  They say in the history of people coming to China there has been nothing like that, and I believe it,  Trump told reporters after his visit to Beijing, where President Xi Jinping extended him the honor of a personal tour of the Forbidden City. One measure of the Asian trip s success, he said, was the  red carpet, like I think probably nobody has ever received.  Diplomats say the bonhomie in Beijing probably stemmed in large part from Washington s expectations Xi will lean more heavily on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Trump s pronouncements on North Korea during the trip swung from embracing diplomacy to warnings of military intervention. Do not underestimate us. And do not try us,  he said in a speech to South Korea s National Assembly.  Days later, after Pyongyang dismissed the speech as  reckless remarks by an old lunatic,  Trump tweeted:  Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me  old,  when I would NEVER call him  short and fat? . And then he tacked back toward diplomacy. Oh well, I try so hard to be his friend - and maybe someday that will happen!  David Pressman, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under President Obama, said Trump arrived in Asia without a North Korea strategy and left without one.  Short and fat is not a nuclear strategy,  he said, adding that Washington s approach to North Korea was fed by  whim, ego, and theatrical calculations of a fickle and uninformed president.

Kenya court throws out opposition coalition from election challenges,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya s Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected the participation of the main opposition coalition in petitions challenging President Uhuru Kenyatta s victory in last month s presidential election, in what may be the last chance for legal scrutiny of the vote. The ruling, on the first day of the court s review of the petitions, is a setback for opposition leader Raila Odinga s NASA coalition, which hopes to overturn President Uhuru Kenyatta s victory in the Oct. 26 poll. The court has until Nov. 20 to rule on the petitions, the latest chapter in a protracted political crisis that has stirred fears for the stability of the east African nation, a regional hub for trade, diplomacy and security. If the election result is upheld, Kenyatta will be sworn in on Nov. 28. Delivering rulings on preliminary issues, the court upheld an objection by Kenyatta s lawyers to the participation of the NASA coalition.  NASA cannot be sustained as a respondent in this matter,  Justice Jackton Ojwang said while reading a unanimous decision, promising to give the court s reasons at a later date. The two petitions by a former lawmaker and two human rights activists argue the poll s outcome is void because the election board did not hold fresh nominations after an earlier, Aug. 8 poll was invalidated, among other reasons.  The court also struck out leaked internal memos of the election board that the petitioners sought to rely on in their case. The court will deliver a ruling on the petitioners  application for scrutiny of the election returns on Wednesday. Security was tight outside the courtroom, which has been center stage for Kenyan politics since it nullified the results of August s presidential election. That decision led to the re-run election on Oct. 26. The court has not convened since the day before last month s election, when it had been due to deliberate on a last-minute request to delay the vote. But that hearing was canceled because not enough judges showed up to make a quorum. The judges had demanded more security after the bodyguard of the deputy chief justice was shot the day before the hearing and said they would refuse to attend hearings without it, a judicial source said. The government turned them down, the source said [L8N1N64ON].  The chief justice later denied the Reuters report on the security issue and said the police had  enhanced  the judges  security [L4N1N83RU].    All six judges expected to be present showed up for Tuesday s meeting. The seven-member bench is still missing one of its judges, who fell ill during the hearings related to the August election and has since been receiving treatment.  Kenyatta came to power in 2013 and won a second and final term in August, defeating opposition leader Odinga by 1.4 million votes.  Odinga did not contest the repeat vote on Oct. 26, saying it would be unfair because the election commission had failed to implement reforms. Kenyatta won with 98 percent of the vote, though opposition supporters staged a boycott and prevented polls from opening in the west of the country. The week before the vote, the head of the commission said he could not guarantee the vote would be free and fair, citing interference from politicians and threats of violence against his colleagues. Kenya s prolonged election season has disrupted its economy. Human rights groups say at least 66 people have died in bloodshed surrounding the two elections. The Supreme Court was created by a 2010 constitution that followed a violent political crisis three years earlier. Around 1,200 people were killed in ethnic clashes after a disputed election in 2007.

Ukraine prosecutor says puzzled by lack of U.S. help on Manafort case,"KIEV (Reuters) - Ukraine is puzzled by the lack of a U.S. response to requests it has made to question former Donald Trump campaign chief Paul Manafort as a witness over two cases involving misuse of Ukrainian state funds, the chief investigator said. Manafort was indicted last month in Washington on charges he denies ranging from money laundering to acting as unregistered agent of former pro-Kremlin president Viktor Yanukovich s Party of Regions. The charges, some going back more than a decade, mention neither Trump nor his campaign. Serhii Horbatiuk, head of special investigations at the general prosecutor s office, told Reuters Ukraine had sent requests in 2014 and 2015 to question representatives of a law firm and Manafort. He said Ukraine had received reassurances from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) that the requests would be met, but without result.    Of course it s not normal,  Horbatiuk said in an interview at his office.  I would not say that we are upset, I would not say officially that we are upset, but it s not clear why it is so,  he said.  Even the results they have got so far, we could have got them back in 2015 or 2016 with their help. But during these years there was no cooperation for unknown reasons.  In Washington, the FBI and the Department did not immediately respond to requests from Reuters for comment. Horbatiuk is investigating two cases.  One relates to the suspected illegal use of Ukrainian state funds by justice ministry officials to pay a U.S. law firm for a report used to justify the imprisonment of former prime minister and political rival Yulia Tymoshenko during Yanukovich s rule. The second relates to a so-called  Black Ledger  discovered after Yanukovich s 2014 ouster by street protests, a book supposedly listing payments from a slush fund by Yanukovich s Party of Regions to their associates, including Manafort. Yanukovich denies corruption accusations.  Manafort denies all wrongdoing and in Ukraine he is at this stage only wanted as a witness.  Horbatiuk said he had not been contacted for assistance by the team of Special Council Robert Mueller, who indicted Manafort during an investigation into alleged Russian efforts to swing the 2016 presidential election in Trump s favor.  Manafort s attorney says his work for the Ukrainians ended in 2014, two years before he joined the Trump campaign. But the indictment sheds new light on the Ukrainian cases: the allegation that Manafort used offshore accounts to funnel $4 million to pay for the Tymoshenko report was news to Horbatiuk s team, who thought the report had cost around $1 million. He will submit a new request for help to the U.S. within weeks.  It is important to combine our investigations so that we can obtain information to determine the origin of this money ($4 million),  he said.   And the general information allows us to say that the investigation could be promising provided that the law enforcement agencies of the United States and Ukraine cooperate in what we are interested in.      Manafort joined the Trump presidential campaign in March 2016 and later became campaign manager, but he was forced to resign in August as questions emerged about his previous work for Yanukovich s party.",worldnews,"November 14, 2017 ",1
Russia's Defense Ministry to investigate wrong photos used on Syria statement,"MOSCOW/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russia s Defense Ministry said on Tuesday an employee had attached the wrong photos to a statement accusing the United States of providing de-facto air cover for Islamic State in Syria after the mistake was spotted online. The ministry said it would investigate the incident, which it said was caused by a civilian employee, but did not say how or why the pictures used were incorrect.  However, the U.S. command s refusal to carry out strikes on the convoys of ISIL terrorists retreating from Albu Kamal on November 9 is an objective fact reflected in the transcripts of the talks and therefore, fully known to the U.S. side,  Interfax news agency quoted the ministry as saying on Tuesday. Earlier on Tuesday, the ministry posted a statement on its Facebook page saying the U.S. air force had tried to hinder Russian strikes on Islamic State militants, accompanied by satellite photographs it said showed a vehicle convoy of Islamic State militants leaving the Syrian town of Albu Kamal on Nov. 9 2017. At least one of the photographs exactly matched a frame from a promotional video for a  AC-130 Gunship Simulator  computer game posted online in March 2015. Reuters was unable to reach the game s Argentinian developed, Byte Conveyor Studios, for comment. Asked about Russian allegations of the U.S. helping Islamic State around Albu Kamal, Colonel Ryan Dillon, spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State, said:  The Russian ministry of defense statements are about as accurate as their air campaign and I think that is a reason for them to start, you know, coming out with their latest barrage of lies.   I certainly can t verify, but I ve seen the report that one of the pictures came from a video game. So, again that is pretty consistent with what we have seen come out of Russian MoD, as being baseless, inaccurate and you know, completely false,  he told a briefing with Pentagon reporters on Tuesday.

More than 60 killed in air strike on Syrian market town,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - The death toll from air strikes on a Syrian town in a  de-escalation zone  has risen to 61, a war monitor said on Tuesday, a demonstration of the fragile state of areas set up in attempt to ease the violence. Jihadist rebels blamed Russian warplanes of carrying out Monday s attack and said they would fight back against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad s forces and his Russian and Iranian  backers in the six-year-old conflict. The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said three air strikes hit the market in Atareb, west of Aleppo,  and killed at least 61 people. Atareb is inside what is known as a de-escalation zone under an agreement between Turkey, Russia and Iran to reduce the bloodshed. But despite the diplomatic efforts, fighting continues in many areas, including Aleppo, Idlib, Raqqa, Deir al-Zor and Hama.  (The zones) did de-escalate fighting,  U.N. humanitarian adviser Jan Egeland told Reuters. But lately,  there has been increased fighting also.  The zones were set up under the Astana process, a series of talks in the capital of Kazakhstan between Russia and Iran, and the rebels  supporter Turkey. They agreed in September to deploy observers on the edge of a de-escalation zone in Syria s Idlib province, which is largely under the control of Islamist insurgents. Following the air strikes, the Tahrir al-Sham jihadist alliance denounced the ceasefire talks and pledged to keep fighting government forces and their Russian and Iranian allies.  This aggression and crimes confirms for us that there is no solution with the colonizers without fighting and struggling,  it said. Tahrir al-Sham includes the group formerly known as the Nusra Front, which changed its name last year when it broke formal ties to al Qaeda. ",worldnews,"November 14, 2017 ",1
"Spreading housing shortage hits over 850,000 people in Germany: report","BERLIN (Reuters) - A housing crisis is spreading in Germany, the Federal Homelessness Association said on Tuesday, forecasting that 1.2 million people could be living in shelters by 2018. The report came amid heightened concern about Germany s rising poverty rate and ability to integrate 1.1 million migrants that have arrived over the past two years, drawn by the country s reputation for affluence, efficiency and stability. The homelessness association said that more than 850,000 people lacked their own accommodation in 2016, up 150 percent from 2014, and half of those affected were migrants.  A total of 52,000 people were living on the streets in 2016, up a third from 2014, the group said in its report. It added that the number of those living in shelters would likely rise by another 40 percent by 2018, driven higher by rising rents, decreasing availability of subsidized housing, and the growing numbers of refugees granted asylum status and therefore entitled to housing. The homelessness association said immigration was a factor behind the rising rate of housing shortage, but also blamed what it called  failed  housing policies.  The main cause of housing shortages and homelessness is a housing policy that has failed in Germany for decades, as well as insufficient efforts to fight poverty,  Thomas Specht, director of the association, said in a statement. Almost 20 percent of Germany s population, or 16 million people, were at risk of poverty in 2016, the Federal Statistics Office reported last week. Germany s Labour and Social Affairs Ministry defended its handling of refugee housing needs, noting that finding individual housing around the country remained a challenge.   It should not be forgotten that the swift accommodation of hundreds of thousands of refugees in adequate collective housing in 2015 and 2016 was an extraordinary achievement,  the ministry spokesman said on Tuesday. Would-be partners in a new German government coalition remain at odds over a limit on migration. ",worldnews,"November 14, 2017 ",1
Scotland's Sturgeon demands changes in EU exit bill after meeting May,"LONDON (Reuters) - Scotland s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Tuesday the UK government had to make changes to its European Union withdrawal bill before her devolved government in Edinburgh would agree to back it, but said she was hopeful progress could be made. The devolved governments in Scotland and Wales are worried that the withdrawal bill will sap their powers. They cannot veto the EU bill, but failure to win their consent would be an embarrassing setback for British Prime Minister Theresa May s government and could reignite Scottish demands for independence.  There s a long way still to go and I m very clear that bill has to change,  Sturgeon told reporters after talks with May in London that she described as  constructive and cordial .  Hopefully having had the opportunity to air the concerns we have in more details we will be able to make progress in weeks to come,  Sturgeon said.  The EU withdrawal bill seeks to convert all existing EU laws into British law to provide legal clarity after Britain leaves the bloc and lawmakers started to debate it on Tuesday in Britain s parliament. Scotland and Wales, which currently control policy areas such as health, education, transport and agriculture, say the legislation does not guarantee the status of their devolved powers after Brexit. A spokeswoman for May said that devolved powers would be enhanced after Brexit.  The prime minister reiterated that as powers are repatriated from Brussels back to Britain there will be a significant increase in the decision-making powers for the Scottish Government and other devolved administrations.  Brexit is a source of tension for the four constituent nations of the United Kingdom because Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to stay in the EU, while Wales and England - by far the most populous of the four - voted to leave.

"Venezuela says debt refinancing under way, S&P calls selective default","CARACAS/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Venezuela s cash-strapped government insisted it had successfully begun efforts to refinance some $60 billion in bonds, though creditors disagreed following fruitless talks and a ratings firm declared the nation in selective default. Venezuelan bonds slid on Tuesday after S&P Global Ratings announced that Venezuela was in selective default for failing to make $200 million in overdue coupon payments on its 2019 and 2024 global issues within a 30-day grace period.  Investors, meanwhile, voiced concern after President Nicolas Maduro s negotiators met briefly with bondholders in Caracas on Monday but failed to present firm proposals to alleviate the OPEC nation s crippling foreign debt amid an unprecedented economic meltdown.  The process of refinancing Venezuela s foreign debt began with resounding success,  the socialist government said late Monday, complaining about U.S. financial sanctions and what it called unfair assessments from international ratings agencies.  The government repeated pledges to honor all its foreign debt and said Monday s talks were attended by 100 or so participants, including bondholders from Venezuela, the United States, Panama, Britain, Colombia, Chile, Japan and Argentina. However, attendees at the meeting came away confused over how Venezuela plans to avoid a default, given its parlous state finances, and how any refinancing could be worked out amid U.S. President Donald Trump s sanctions. The U.S. measures block the issuance of any new Venezuelan debt and impose sanctions on the country s chief negotiators, Vice President Tareck El Aissami and Economy Minister Simon Zerpa, on drug and corruption charges.  Venezuela has dismissed those accusations as politically motivated fabrications by Washington to tarnish the country s reputation.  The bondholder meeting in Venezuela was a non-event, lasting only 20-30 minutes with reports of only 10 non Caracas-based investors...and the only official that spoke was drug kingpin VP Tareck El Aissami  said Siobhan Morden, head of Latin American fixed-income strategy at Nomura, who did not attend. Four years of recession in the South American nation, fueled by failing socialist economics and a plunge in global oil prices, have hit Venezuelans hard. Many skip meals or suffer from malnutrition and preventable diseases, due to severe shortages of food and medicine and triple-digit inflation.   With some $9 billion in payments looming for 2018, a default would be a short-term relief for the government, enabling Maduro  to spend on desperately-needed food and medicine imports ahead of next year s presidential election.  But that strategy could also backfire if it sparks aggressive legal challenges from abroad, including moves to seize assets of state oil company PDVSA, [PDVSA.UL] which is the cash-cow for Venezuela s socialist system.  Despite concern that U.S. sanctions could prevent Venezuela hiring advisors, the government has appointed lawyer David Syed - a former partner at Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe - to advise it, working alongside a team at global law firm Dentons, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters news service.  On another flank of the country s creditworthiness, a committee of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) is looking into whether PDVSA triggered a credit event through late payment of its 2017N bond this month. The group said it would reconvene on Thursday to continue discussions of whether or not PDVSA was in default. ISDA also said on Tuesday it had received another request from investors as to whether Venezuela had triggered a credit event due to the late payment of the coupon on its sovereign bonds. Bondholders had told Reuters on Monday they had not yet received payments on the 2019 and 2024 bonds but were unconcerned about the delay, which they said was partly due to increased bank vigilance following the U.S. sanctions. In its statement on Monday, S&P Global Ratings said it could raise Venezuela s ratings again if the government made payments on the overdue coupons and remained timely on other payments before the restructuring is completed. However, it said it saw a one-in-two chance that Venezuela could default again within the next three months and it listed a further four bonds with overdue coupon payments due in the coming weeks, with unpaid obligations totaling $420 million. The Luxembourg Stock Exchange said on Tuesday said it was temporarily halting trading of Venezuela s 2019 and 2024 bonds due to the  event of default  in order to make changes to the way in which the securities are traded. Fitch Ratings also downgraded PDVSA due to  payment default  on notes due on Oct. 27 and Nov. 2 after  processing delays that resulted in bondholders receiving principal payments up to one week after the due date.  Venezuela s sovereign bonds, already the most distressed in the benchmark JPMorgan Emerging Markets Bond Index Plus (EMBI+) 11EMJ, have whipsawed over the past week.  The index measures the spreads of 13 Venezuelan sovereign bonds versus benchmark U.S. Treasuries.  Last week, as the Caracas talks loomed, investors bought Venezuela s bonds on speculation there might be progress in finding a solution, driving a 1,095 basis-point narrowing in spreads from Nov. 7 through Monday.  However, on Tuesday, spreads ballooned by 714 basis points as investors dumped Venezuelan bonds. (For a graphic on 'Venezuela's economy' click tmsnrt.rs/2pPJdRb) ",worldnews,"November 14, 2017 ",1

"EU says Hariri must return to Lebanon, warns against Saudi interference","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union on Monday urged Saad al-Hariri to return to Lebanon, calling on all political forces inside the country to focus on the domestic agenda and warning Saudi Arabia against meddling. Hariri s resignation, announced from Riyadh, and its aftermath have put Lebanon at the forefront of regional rivalry between Shi ite-led Iran and Sunni Saudi Arabia Riyadh in recent days.  We appeal first of all to the political forces to focus on Lebanon and what they can deliver to their citizens, Prime Minister Hariri to return to his country and the unity government ... to focus on domestic achievements,  the bloc s top diplomat, Federica Mogherini, told reporters.      We expect no external interference in this national agenda. We believe it is essential to avoid importing into Lebanon regional conflicts,  she said after hosting a meeting of all 28 EU foreign ministers in Brussels. She praised the achievements of the Lebanese government under Hariri, who resigned saying he feared assassination.  He has criticized the Iran-backed Hezbollah, which is part of his coalition government, for sowing strife in the Arab world and said he could take his resignation back if the group agreed to stay out of regional conflicts. France s foreign minister, speaking on the sidelines of the ministerial gathering in Brussels, also called on other countries not to interfere in Lebanon.  We are preoccupied by the situation in Lebanon... we are worried about its stability, we are worried about its integrity, we are worried about non-interference,  Jean-Yves Le Drian said.   To reach a political solution in Lebanon, all political figures must have complete freedom of movement,  he told reporters when asked about Hariri. Germany s Sigmar Gabriel also said Hariri should return as his departure has shaken Lebanon.

Lebanon's Hariri shackled by bigger outside forces," BEIRUT (Reuters) - Nothing so encapsulated the political shackles in which Saad al-Hariri has operated as Lebanon s prime minister as the way he resigned in a televised statement made from Saudi Arabia.  Every major decision by the unlikely politician was determined by factors beyond his control. He entered politics after the 2005 assassination of his father and his resignation served the agenda of Riyadh.  The dependence of their leaders on powerful external patrons is nothing new in Lebanon, where regional powers from Saudi Arabia to Iran have long tussled for geopolitical advantage.  But the case of Hariri, who many Lebanese think was summoned to the Saudi capital, coerced into resigning and put under house arrest - which he has denied - underscores an instance of external pressure extreme even by Lebanon s high standards.  In an interview on Sunday, he said he will return to Lebanon in the coming days and might reconsider his resignation. Even if he does, the events of the past 10 days show how decisions taken beyond Lebanon's borders would still define his role.  His shock resignation statement on Nov. 4, which has thrust Lebanon into a new political crisis, included a laundry list of Saudi complaints about the behavior of Iran and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah, Riyadh s main political adversaries.  Iran and Hezbollah, Hariri said, are  sowing strife  in the Arab world.  As Riyadh s ally at a time of its enemies  ascendancy, Hariri was already playing Lebanon s intricate political game from a position of weakness.  A year ago, after spending years abroad, he agreed to join a national unity government with President Michel Aoun, a former rival and Hezbollah ally, that included Hezbollah itself.  It was a compromise he said was necessary to end Lebanon s sectarian-tinged political paralysis and one that was personally difficult, as Hariri accuses Hezbollah of the assassination of his father, Rafik al-Hariri.  He seemed committed to that compromise until the moment he flew to Riyadh on Nov. 3, telling officials of discussions planned for his return the following Monday.  Saudi Arabia had previously accepted Hariri s political bargain in Lebanon. But Iran s trumpeting of its successes along with Hezbollah in the wars in Syria and Yemen at the expense of Saudi allies may have altered Riyadh s calculation.  A day after traveling to Riyadh, Hariri appeared on television reading a statement of resignation.  Hariri s career was built on the backing of Gulf states, the deployment of his family fortune - spending large amounts of it in Lebanon to finance a media network and charitable gifts to secure widespread support - and feelings of respect among many Lebanese for his late father.  In his resignation address, Saad said:  We are living in a climate similar to the atmosphere that prevailed before the assassination of Rafik al-Hariri .  In Lebanon s sectarian system, the prime minister must always be a Sunni Muslim and Rafik made his family pre-eminent among Lebanese Sunnis.  Rafik carved out a business empire in Saudi Arabia with the backing of its ruling family and returned to Lebanon to rebuild when the civil war there ended in 1990, serving twice as prime minister. The car bomb that killed Rafik gave Saad little choice but to adopt a previously unsought role as political leader.  Before being plunged into Lebanon s volatile politics, Saad had led a playboy lifestyle running his father s business. He was raised in Saudi Arabia and has Saudi nationality.  Outrage at Rafik s killing helped Hariri s movement to electoral victory five months later and he installed a political ally as prime minister, not taking the post himself until 2009.  It was the first government headed by factions opposed to the influence of Syria - and by extension Damascus  allies Iran and Hezbollah - since the 1975-90 Lebanese civil war.  That opposition came to a head in 2008 when the government tried to seize Hezbollah s telecommunications network, triggering street battles in Beirut that the heavily armed Shi ite Muslim movement won.  Qatar brokered a compromise, with Hariri becoming head of a coalition government that included Hezbollah. But Hezbollah pulled out in 2011, bringing down the administration.  As tensions rose over the war in neighboring Syria, Hariri left Lebanon, spending most of the ensuing years abroad until he returned months before joining a new government last year.  But his sway - and that of his family s regional patron Saudi Arabia - had diminished. The formation of last year s government was widely seen in Lebanon as an acknowledgement of the political dominance of Iran and Hezbollah.  Saudi Arabia s own apparent impatience with Hariri became evident in the fortunes of the family company - Saudi Oger - whose billions had underpinned their political role in Lebanon.  With a new dispensation in Riyadh under King Salman and his ambitious son Prince Mohammed, and a fall in oil prices damaging its finances, the Saudi government seemed less willing to roll out big state projects to enrich some allies.  When Hariri s first stint as premier ended in 2011, he said in a newspaper interview:  In Lebanon it s never over for anyone .  A source in his camp said a compromise to bring him back to Beirut as prime minister was still possible if Aoun distanced himself from Hezbollah s regional role.  Such a statement by Aoun might give some satisfaction to Saudi Arabia, but it would seem to leave Hariri no stronger than before.  After so public a departure, especially one delivered from abroad, his dependence on Riyadh has been made especially visible. His enemies in Lebanon even mocked his Arabic during his resignation speech as being more Saudi than Lebanese.  And the posters of him that have appeared across Beirut with the slogan  We are with you  looked less like statements of mass support than solidarity with a political hostage.

Lebanese patriarch makes historic Saudi visit amid Hariri crisis,"RIYADH (Reuters) - Lebanon s Christian Maronite Patriarch began a historic visit to Saudi Arabia on Monday under heightened scrutiny amid political tensions that have thrust his country back to the forefront of the conflict between the Sunni kingdom and Shi ite rival Iran. Patriarch Beshara al-Rai heads the Maronite church, which has a presence in Lebanon, Syria and Cyprus and follows an Eastern rite of the Roman Catholic church. Maronites number about 900,000 in Lebanon, around a quarter of the population. An official visit to Saudi Arabia by such a senior non-Muslim cleric is a rare act of religious openness for the kingdom, which hosts the holiest sites in Islam and bans the practice of other religions but says it wants to open up more to the world. It is also the first trip to Riyadh by a senior Lebanese official since the start of a crisis sparked by Saad al-Hariri s resignation as Lebanese prime minister on Nov. 4 from the Saudi capital. Top Lebanese government officials and senior sources close to Hariri say Saudi Arabia coerced him into resigning and has put him under effective house arrest since he flew there more than a week ago. During his visit, Rai plans to meet Hariri as well as King Salman and his son and heir-apparent, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, both of whom he praised in an address to Lebanese living in Riyadh.    Certainly his resignation surprised the Lebanese and saddened them and created a type of deadlock,  he later told reporters between selfies with followers.  We hope that with this visit we can speak about this topic.   TOLERANCE AND CO-EXISTENCE But Rai said his visit, which was planned before the latest crisis, was not political but aimed at boosting religious tolerance and co-existence in a region torn by sectarian conflict. Hariri said in a television interview on Sunday that he was a free man and would return to Lebanon within days to affirm that he had resigned. He said Lebanon was at risk of Gulf Arab sanctions because of the Shi ite group Hezbollah s regional meddling. Asked when he expected Hariri to return to Lebanon, Rai said:  I wish tonight ... we hope as soon as possible.  Hariri s resignation and its aftermath have destabilized his country, where Sunni, Shi ite, Christian and Druze factions fought a civil war from 1975-1990, often backed by rival powers around the region. The only other visit to Saudi Arabia by a Christian patriarch took place in 1975, according to the Saudi information ministry. Rai thanked King Salman for the invitation and said he had never dreamed of visiting the kingdom, which bans all non-Muslim houses of prayer, forcing Christians there to risk arrest by praying in private homes.

Fears for Lebanese economy if Saudis impose Qatar-style blockade,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanese politicians and bankers believe Saudi Arabia intends to do to their country what it did to Qatar - corral Arab allies into enforcing an economic blockade unless its demands are met. Unlike Qatar, the world s biggest supplier of liquefied natural gas with a population of just 300,000, Lebanon has neither the natural nor financial resources to ride it out, and people there are worried. Up to 400,000 Lebanese work in the Gulf region, and remittances flowing back into the country, estimated at between $7-8 billion a year, are a vital source of cash to keep the economy afloat and the heavily-indebted government functioning.  These are serious threats to the Lebanese economy which is already dire. If they cut the transfer of remittances, that will be a disaster,  a senior Lebanese official told Reuters. Those threats came from Lebanon s former prime minister, Saad al-Hariri, who resigned on Nov. 4 in a shock broadcast from Riyadh that Lebanese political leaders have ascribed to pressure from the Saudis. Hariri, an ally of Saudi Arabia, on Sunday warned of possible Arab sanctions and a danger to the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of Lebanese living in the Gulf. And he spelled out Saudi conditions for Lebanon to avoid sanctions: Hezbollah, the Iran-backed group that is Lebanon s main political power and part of the ruling coalition, must stop meddling in regional conflicts, particularly Yemen. According to a Lebanese source familiar with Saudi thinking, Hariri s interview  gave an indication of what might be waiting for us if a real compromise is not reached. The playbook is there in Qatar.  Hariri s resignation has thrust Lebanon to the center of an escalating rivalry between Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shi ite Iran.  The non-confrontational Saudi policy of the past towards Lebanon has gone, analysts say, under the new leadership of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, 32-year-old son of King Salman. He is now the de facto ruler of the kingdom, running its military, political and economic affairs. Whether Iran and Hezbollah are willing to make significant concessions to Riyadh is doubtful, sources said.  They (Hezbollah) might make some cosmetic concessions, but they won t submit to the Saudi conditions,  a source familiar with Hezbollah thinking said. Lebanese analyst Sarkis Naoum said Riyadh wanted Hariri to return to Lebanon and press President Michel Aoun to open dialogue and address their conditions on Hezbollah s regional interventions.  They need to come up with a position that will be satisfactory to the Saudis ... If the Saudis decide on sanctions they will do it,  Naoum said. A source close to Hariri said he had  put the ball in the court of Aoun, Hezbollah and its allies, by saying  business cannot continue as usual.   There was no sugar-coating. The sanctions were spelled out clearly. They want Lebanon to be disassociated from Hezbollah . Aoun has welcomed comments that the former premier planned to return home soon, palace sources said on Monday. Saudi frustration with Lebanon seems to have boiled over after a string of setbacks to its foreign policy. Riyadh has been bogged down in the war it launched against Iran-allied Houthi rebels in Yemen in 2015. Saudi Arabia has accused Iran and Hezbollah of backing the Houthis, and also said Hezbollah had a role in firing a ballistic missile from Yemen towards Riyadh earlier this month. Hezbollah and Iran s involvement in Syria has also transformed the war in favor of President Bashar al-Assad, while Saudi support for Sunni rebels in Syria s civil war have amounted to little. Hezbollah, a movement with a heavily armed fighting force in addition to seats in parliament and government, is Iran s spearhead in the region. Tehran s Revolutionary Guard looks to be trying to replicate it by building coalitions of militia groups in Iraq and Syria, according to some analysts. The list of potential sanctions against Lebanon, political sources there say, could include a ban on flights, visas, exports and transfer of remittances. Some of those have been imposed on Qatar, but that blockade, initiated in June, has had limited effect on the emirate so far, beyond driving it closer to Iran. Allegiance to foreign backers is not new to Lebanon. Sunnis have always looked to Saudi Arabia for support and funding while Shi ite Lebanese tended to turn to Tehran and Hezbollah.  The Lebanese have always been agents of foreign powers. They take their money, make promises, commitments and alliances,  Naoum said. But while Hezbollah fulfilled its promises to Iran, Sunni factions let Riyadh down, he said. Thanks in part to Iranian investment in the group, Hezbollah now calls the shots in the Lebanese capital as well as playing a pivotal role in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East. Riyadh has historically channeled billions of dollars to Lebanon to help its reconstruction after the 1975-90 civil war and following massive Israeli incursions of south Lebanon. Now it appears ready to do serious economic damage to Lebanon that could weaken Hezbollah s standing at home and in the region, should its demands not be met. The Saudi conditions are causing alarm among some Lebanese, who have long viewed Hezbollah as a  state-within-a-state . Many believe the solution is outside the control of local players.  Lebanon will pay the price,  a top Lebanese banker told Reuters.  The only pressure the Saudis have is economic ... they can put pressure by imposing sanctions that can hurt.

Hariri to return to Lebanon in next two days,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Saad al-Hariri will return to Lebanon from Saudi Arabia within two days, he said on Tuesday, 10 days after his shock resignation as prime minister in a broadcast from Riyadh. His abrupt resignation on Nov. 4 sent Lebanon spinning into political crisis and back onto the front line of the Middle East power struggle between Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia and Shi ite Iran.  Iran s ally Hezbollah holds major sway in Lebanese politics. It has long been a foe of Hariri but is part of the coalition government he formed last year and called for his return.  In his resignation he made bitter attacks on both Iran and Hezbollah, and top Lebanese officials and politicians close to Hariri have said Saudi Arabia coerced him to resign, dictated his statement and have held him under house arrest.  Riyadh and Hariri have both denied that. Hariri is a political ally of Riyadh and holds Saudi nationality. He cited a fear of assassination and Hezbollah s  sowing strife  in the Arab world as his reasons for stepping down.      Riyadh and Hariri both oppose Hezbollah s military role in Syria, fighting alongside President Bashar al-Assad, and what they allege is its participation in Yemen s civil war alongside the Houthi group against a Saudi-led coalition. Hezbollah denies having a role in the Yemen conflict. Lebanese President Michel Aoun has said he will not accept Hariri s resignation until he returns to Beirut to formally submit it. Analysts say when Hariri does so, members of parliament will nominate him to serve as prime minister once again, and Aoun will ask him to form a new government.  That would open the door to a long period of political talks like those which preceded the formation of the national unity government that made Hariri prime minister a year ago.  Hariri is expected to call on Aoun to convene political dialogue on key issues facing Lebanon, chiefly on reaffirming the tiny country s policy of staying out of regional conflicts and Hezbollah s role in conflicts outside Lebanon s borders, senior political sources say. Any attempt to keep Hezbollah out of the government, in line with Saudi wishes, will torpedo the talks, political sources say. Riyadh regards Hezbollah as a terrorist group.  Hariri warned on Sunday in his first interview since resigning of possible Gulf Arab sanctions against Lebanon and of the risk to the livelihoods of the 300,000-400,000 Lebanese in the Gulf. Lebanese Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil said in Paris on Tuesday that any punitive sanctions by Saudi Arabia on Lebanon would impact the region and Syrian refugees in the country.  Bassil is a member of President Aoun s political party. He said Hariri needed to return to Lebanon to prove he was free.  After Hariri s resignation, Saudi Arabia accused the Lebanese government of declaring war on it because of Hezbollah s pivotal role in Lebanese politics.  However, Riyadh s Western allies have struck a tone different from that of Saudi Arabia, appearing to throw their weight behind both Hariri and the Lebanese state, whose army is a major recipient of U.S. aid.  The European Union High Representative Federica Mogherini said on Tuesday after a meeting with Bassil that she expected Hariri and his family to return to Lebanon in the coming days.  On Twitter, Hariri said he was well but that his family was staying in Saudi Arabia.      Sources across Lebanon s political divide have said Hariri struck a more compromising tone in his interview than in his resignation statement, at one point holding out the possibility of rescinding his decision to quit.  They say this represents a retreat by Saudi Arabia, attributing it to Western pressure.  The Maronite Patriarch Bechara Boutros al-Rai, head of Lebanon s biggest Christian community, met Hariri and Saudi King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed in Riyadh on Tuesday. Saudi al-Arabiya television quoted him as saying he supported the reasons for Hariri s resignation. His comments reflect the views of some politicians in Lebanon s divided Maronite community but not President Aoun.  Echoing Saudi demands, MPs from Hariri s Future Movement called for a U.N. resolution from 2006 that demanded all militias in Lebanon disarm to be respected.  Hezbollah is the only Lebanese group with a militia, and says it needs weapons to secure Lebanon from Israel. Hezbollah s Lebanese opponents have long demanded it disarm. Lebanese politicians have previously held talks on Hezbollah s arsenal as part of a dialogue on a national defense strategy, but have never seriously discussed disarming it.

Lebanon's Hariri must return home from Saudi to prove he is free: foreign minister,"PARIS (Reuters) - Lebanon s Saad al-Hariri can only prove he is free by returning home from Saudi Arabia where he went to announce his resignation as prime minister, Lebanon s foreign minister said on Tuesday. Hariri s abrupt resignation on Nov. 4 threw Lebanon into crisis and put it center stage in a power struggle between Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia and Shi ite Iran, whose ally Hezbollah is powerful in Lebanese politics. Hariri said on Tuesday he would return to Lebanon within two days.  We hope to resolve this with the quick and immediate return of Prime Minister Hariri to his country ... where he has the right to do what he wants,  Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil said after meeting French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris.   The only thing that proves he is free is that he returns. Right now he is in a situation that is ambiguous and not normal. We want to return to a normal situation,  he told reporters after the talks about how to end the crisis. France is a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council and Lebanon s former colonial power. It is also penholder on Lebanon for potential resolutions. There has been some talk that Beirut could go to the U.N. if Hariri did not return this week.  The president (Michel Aoun) spoke of a timeframe of one week from when this diplomatic campaign started to try to find a solution otherwise we would have to go to international laws,   he said. French officials say there is no U.N. action in the works at the moment. Lebanese politicians and bankers say Saudi Arabia intends to do to their country what it did to Qatar - corral Arab allies into enforcing an economic blockade unless its demands are met. Bassil said any Saudi sanctions on his country would hurt Syrian refugees and destabilize the region.   Any (Saudi) measures would not only be targeting Lebanon and its stability, this would be a punishment for the region because any instability in Lebanon would cause instability in the region,  he said.  The first to be affected in this would be Syrians in Lebanon,  he said, adding that sanctions could make it harder for Lebanese population to absorb the Syrian refugees in their midst. Lebanon hosts some 1.5 million Syrian refugees that have fled the neighboring civil war.  In the first such statement by a French official, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe on Tuesday called on Hariri to return to Lebanon. Foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian is due in the Saudi capital Riyadh on Wednesday to discuss the crisis and is expected to meet Hariri. ",worldnews,"November 14, 2017 ",1
EU Parliament names press room after murdered Maltese journalist,"STRASBOURG (Reuters) - The European Parliament named its press room in Strasbourg after Daphne Caruana Galizia, the Maltese journalist killed last month in a car bomb after years of reporting allegations of deep-rooted corruption on the island. On a day when the EU legislature debated a broadly supported resolution questioning the rule of law in Malta and demanding answers on allegations of high-level money laundering made by Caruana Galizia, the ceremony underlined the pressure the Union s smallest state has found itself under since her Oct. 16 murder. In the auditorium used for news conferences in Parliament s Strasbourg seat, the new name above the door would, Parliament President Antonio Tajani said, ensure that from now on  we will not turn our eyes away from what happened in Malta . At the Parliament s other home, in Brussels, the press room is named after Anna Politkovskaya, the Russian investigative journalist shot dead in her apartment block in Moscow in 2006 in a killing opposition leaders blamed on the Kremlin. Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, who had sued Caruana Galizia and one of her sons for libel over allegations of graft, has vowed to track down her killers and insists that the Maltese state is fully compliant with EU standards. Peter Caruana Galizia, the dead journalist s husband, said during the naming ceremony in Strasbourg in the presence of other family members that Malta s political elite had  deep and wide  links to money laundering networks and the country had  slipped further and further away from European values .

Damages for Grenfell fire victims may total just $5 million: Reuters analysis," (This Oct. 18 story corrects age in paragraph 19 to five, not six) By Tom Bergin LONDON (Reuters) - The bill for compensating families of those who died in the Grenfell Tower fire in London may be as low as 4 million pounds ($5 million), according to several lawyers and a Reuters analysis of how damages laws apply in England. The blaze engulfed a 24-storey social housing block in west London on June 14, killing an estimated 80 people in the country s deadliest fire since World War Two. While similar disasters in the United States have led to massive payouts, any compensation for Grenfell would be far lower because English laws offer less generous damages and don t allow punitive claims, even if companies are found criminally responsible, said Brett Dixon, president of the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers (APIL). The four main firms that have been linked to the Grenfell fire - U.S. companies Arconic Inc. and Whirlpool Corp. and Britain s Harley Facades and Rydon Group - declined to comment on the size or calculation of potential payouts. The Reuters calculation of a bill of 4 million pounds is based on the compensation amounts stipulated in the Fatal Accidents Act of 1976, precedents set in previous cases and the individual circumstances of the 70 victims identified so far. Three personal injury lawyers have verified the methodology used by Reuters and said the estimate for the total payout is reasonable. If the courts find there was no unlawful behavior by any of the companies or public bodies involved, victims will not be entitled to sue for compensation and would only get the financial support and temporary housing already provided by the government and public donations, personal injury lawyers said.  The British judicial system is not renowned for being generous,  said Rebecca Thomas of law firm Duncan Lewis, which is representing some victims  families.  It s not about money for the families,  said Tim Murphy, whose brother Denis, a disabled former painter who lived on the 14th floor, died in the fire.  Nothing can ease our pain, (but) I think it s quite insulting.  The U.S. legal system sees punitive damages as a way of encouraging companies to behave lawfully, but British and European governments have taken the view this approach would put excessive burdens on the judicial system, businesses, insurers and state bodies that might be liable, some legal experts say. While APIL said the Grenfell Tower disaster demonstrated the inadequacy of payouts to victims, Duncan Fairgrieve, who has advised the UK government on compensation rules, said more generous payouts could also harm society. They could drive up insurance costs for all and lead to big claims against government bodies such as the National Health Service and the police, he said.  There is an affordability issue,  said Fairgrieve, a Senior Research Fellow at the British Institute of International and Comparative Law. If the courts find someone was wrongfully killed, the claim categories are a flat 12,980 pounds per victim for bereavement, costs such as funeral bills, dependency damages where minors or dependent spouses are left behind, and property damage - all to be paid by the party found responsible. Under the 1976 law, only family members who were supported by those who died can claim dependency damages. Reuters has identified only five people who died leaving dependents who could definitely claim damages - on the basis they were financially dependent on the deceased. Daniel Machover, a lawyer at Hickman and Rose, which is representing some victims  families, also said he didn t expect there to be many claims. Most of the others who died in the fire were minors, single or elderly and did not leave family members who were financially dependent upon them. The biggest dependency payout will be for children who lost both parents, said lawyers representing some of the victims. One five-year-old girl, Tasnim Belkadi, lost her mother, father and all her siblings in the fire. Lawyers said she could get 300,000 pounds, based on a share of her parents  income and some childcare costs up to her 18th birthday. Her aunt, with whom she now lives, did not respond to requests for comment on the Reuters calculation. Grenfell plaintiffs can also claim expenses they incurred as the result of a death, such as the cost of a modest funeral. Heirs to the deceased could also claim the value of goods lost in the fire. The Association of British Insurers puts the cost of replacing the contents of an average three-bedroom home at 55,000 pounds. However, Thomas said Grenfell claims would probably be less than 30,000 pounds per property because compensation is based on the market value of personal belongings rather than replacement value, and the flats destroyed had only one or two bedrooms. Based on the victims  circumstances, Reuters has calculated the payout for dependency damages could be 1.2 million pounds, for property it could be 1.4 million and for bereavement it could come to 1.0 million. Other smaller claims for costs and loss of parental guidance take the total to 4 million pounds. Police said the fire started in a fridge freezer made by a subsidiary of U.S. company Whirlpool and have been investigating whether the tower s cladding, made by U.S. firm Arconic Inc., played a role in the spread of the blaze. Arconic said it was up to contractors to ensure its products were used correctly. Whirlpool said it was investigating the fire. Rydon Group, the contractor that oversaw the refurbishment when the new cladding was added, said it had complied with all regulations. Sub-contractor Harley Facades Ltd said it was not aware of any link between the fire and the cladding. Fears among investors that companies linked to Grenfell could be sued for large sums in the United States hit their shares. Whirlpool s market value fell about $250 million on June 23 when police identified the maker of the appliance as Hotpoint, a brand owned by Indesit, which is a subsidiary of Whirlpool based in Italy. More than $1 billion was wiped off Arconic Inc. s value after Reuters reported in June that internal emails showed it had supplied flammable cladding panels, knowing they would be used on the tower and despite warning in its brochures that only non-combustible panels should be used on tall buildings. Arconic s share price has recovered since its late June lows but it and Whirlpool s stock are below the levels they were at just before the fire, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed 7 percent over the same period. Awards against companies in U.S. courts have run into the tens of millions of dollars per family in some cases. In 1980, a fire blamed in part on inadequate fire safety measures killed 85 people at the MGM Grand Hotel in Nevada and injured hundreds. The hotel operator and contractors agreed to pay victims  families and survivors more than $200 million. Foreigners have often tried to sue U.S. corporations in U.S. courts over alleged wrongdoing abroad. However, judges have consistently ruled they lacked jurisdiction in such cases, saying adequate tribunals existed in the plaintiff s own country and that it would be hard for defendants to make their case in the United States. Machover at Hickman and Rose said he was considering whether Grenfell victims could bring a U.S. case on the basis that two of the companies involved were based there. But Thomas at Duncan Lewis and Leigh Day partner Jill Paterson were skeptical that U.S. courts would agree to hear Grenfell claims given the United Kingdom offers a reasonable forum for redress and because the U.S. companies were involved through European-registered subsidiaries.  I can t see any circumstances under which they could bring this in the United States,  said Thomas. Arconic and Whirlpool declined to comment on the possibility of legal claims against them.

Abadi says Iraq to act soon over border areas in stand-off with Kurds,"BAGHDAD/ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, seeking to up the pressure in a stand-off with Iraq s Kurdish region, said on Tuesday he would act soon over border areas under Kurdish control but predicted his government s forces would regain them without violence. The central government in Baghdad has cracked down hard on the Kurds since the government of the Kurdish autonomous region staged an independence referendum on Sept. 25 that Baghdad considers illegal. The Iraqi armed forces have threatened to resume military operations against the Kurds, accusing them of delaying the handover of control of borders and taking advantage of negotiations to bolster their defenses.  We will regain control on border areas without escalation. But our patience will run out. We will not wait forever. We will take action,  Abadi said at a news conference. The independence vote defied the central government in Baghdad   which had ruled the ballot illegal   as well as neighboring Turkey and Iran which have their own Kurdish minorities. Abadi spoke a few hours after the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) announced a concession to Iraq s central government by saying it would accept a court decision prohibiting the region from seceding. The announcement marks the Kurds  latest attempt to revive negotiations with Baghdad over their region s future after the central government imposed measures in retaliation against the independence vote. Among the steps was an offensive by Iraqi government forces and the Iran-backed Popular Mobilisation Forces that took back the oil city of Kirkuk and other disputed territories from the control from the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) last month. The KRG said on Tuesday it would respect the Nov. 6 ruling by the Supreme Federal Court, which declared that no Iraqi province could secede.  We believe that this decision must become a basis for starting an inclusive national dialogue between (Kurdish authorities in) Erbil and Baghdad to resolve all disputes,  the KRG said in a statement. Abadi had previously urged the northern semi-autonomous Kurdish region to abide by the court s decision. The court is responsible for settling disputes between Iraq s central government and the country s regions and provinces. Its decisions cannot be appealed, though it has no mechanism to enforce its ruling in the Kurdish region. ",worldnews,"November 14, 2017 ",1
Ukraine's anti-corruption bureau launches case against sister agency,"KIEV (Reuters) - Ukrainian investigators on Tuesday said they had opened a criminal case into suspected extortion by officials at a sister anti-corruption agency, based partly on information from a whistleblower who also implicated the president s office. The National Agency on Corruption Prevention (NAZK) is a keystone of Western-backed reforms but has been criticized for making slow progress with its main task of verifying officials  wealth declarations for evidence of ill-gotten gains. NABU - a sister agency investigating high-profile corruption cases - said it opened the case against NAZK officials on suspicion they received  undue benefits in especially large amounts, combined with the extortion of such benefits.  Officials at other state bodies are also being investigated, a NABU spokeswoman said, without giving further details. While details of the case are not yet clear, the fact that a state-run anti-corruption agency is itself being investigated for corruption suggests the authorities still have progress to make in their promised drive to eliminate graft. The NABU spokeswoman said the case was opened on Nov. 10 partly due to information from the former head of NAZK s financial control department, Hanna Solomatina. Earlier on Tuesday, Solomatina said she had decided to resign and hand over evidence to NABU after realizing an online wealth declaration tool managed by NAZK was compromised.  In reality, the e-declarations system is used to cover officials loyal to the authorities ... and for the self-enrichment of the head of NAZK and NAZK members,  Solomatina said in a briefing.  NAZK is not an independent body, but is completely controlled by the authorities,  she said.  She described how she had been summoned to the administration of President Petro Poroshenko and told NAZK s decisions should first be checked with the president s office. In a statement, the presidential administration denied Solomatina s allegations.  We have no way to influence the work of NAZK,  it said. NAZK also denied Solomatina s account and said it would lodge a claim in court to refute her comments.  We stress that the widespread information of the ex-official (Solomatina), without concrete facts, is a personal attack on the chairperson, members and staff of the state agency  and an attempt to discredit successfully launched anti-corruption reforms in Ukraine,  it said. Following the ouster of a Moscow-backed president in 2014, Ukraine s new pro-Western authorities promised to root out graft and modernize the economy in exchange for billions of dollars in international funding. But Ukraine s backers have seen a failure to bring corrupt lawmakers and senior officials to justice as an indication the authorities may lack the commitment to eliminate the power of vested interests.

Romania expels pro-Russian Serb for photographing military radar,"BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Romania has expelled a pro-Russian Serbian nationalist and banned him from entering the NATO member for 15 years after he showed an interest in obtaining classified information on  military installations, state security said on Tuesday. Bratislav Zivkovic, 42, is a commander of Serbia s Chetnik paramilitary and went to Crimea in 2014-15 to support the Russian intervention there. He told reporters there at the time that it was only natural to want to help Russians fighting the Ukrainians.  A spokesman for Romania s SRI secret service said it had identified Zivkovic  showing interest in obtaining classified documents on critical infrastructure and national and allied military objectives located in south-east Romania with the intention of affecting our strategic partnerships.  SRI s Ovidiu Marincea said Zivkovic had been caught while taking photos of military radars on the Black sea shore and  trying to transmit their GPS coordinates.   I want to stress this Serbian citizen did not succeed in gathering any documents or classified information,  Marincea said. He poses a risk to Romania s national security, he added. Russia is Serbia s traditional ally with the two nations sharing Slav origins, the Christian Orthodox faith and having similar languages. Serbia is heavily dependent on Russia s energy and the cash-strapped government in Belgrade has turned to Kremlin to underpin its budget. The Serbian Chetniks gained notoriety in the 1990s when their units committed atrocities against non-Serbs in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo, a former Serbian province dominated by ethnic Albanians.

Duterte berates Canada's Trudeau at end of Philippines summit,"MANILA (Reuters) - Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte attacked Canada s Justin Trudeau at the end of a summit of Asian and Western nations for raising questions about his war on drugs, a topic skirted by other leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump. At the traditional news conference by the host nation at the end of the summit on Tuesday, Duterte was asked how he had responded to the Canadian prime minister raising the issue of human rights and extra-judicial killings in his anti-drugs drive.  I said I will not explain. It is a personal and official insult,  the Philippines president said in the course of a rambling answer, although he did not refer to Trudeau by name.  I only answer to the Filipino. I will not answer to any other bullshit, especially foreigners. Lay off.  Earlier in the day, Trudeau told a news conference that during his meeting with Duterte  the president was receptive to my comments and it was throughout a very cordial and positive exchange . Human rights activists had been hoping that leaders at the summit, including Trump, would raise the issue of the thousands of users and small-time pushers killed in the campaign that was launched by Duterte after he took office in mid-2016. His government says the police act in self-defense during drug-busts, but critics say executions are taking place with no accountability. There was no pressure from Trump on the drugs war when he met Duterte on Monday and the U.S. president later said the two had a  great relationship . A joint statement after the meeting only said the two sides  underscored that human rights and the dignity of human life are essential, and agreed to continue mainstreaming the human rights agenda in their national programs.  Duterte cursed Trump s predecessor, Barack Obama, last year for raising concerns about the war on drugs and he subsequently declared that he was breaking ties with the United States, a close ally of the Philippines since World War Two. The relationship appears to have got back on track after the bonhomie between him and Trump. Trudeau also said that he raised the issue of the exodus of Rohingya during a meeting with Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi, another sensitive topic bypassed by most other leaders, although he did not mention the Muslim minority by name.  This is a tremendous concern to Canada and to many, many countries around the world,  he said. The government in mostly-Buddhist Myanmar regards the Rohingya as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and does not recognize the term. Over 600,000 Rohingya have fled to refugee camps in Bangladesh since military clearance operations were launched in response to attacks by Rohingya militants on Aug. 25.  The plight of the Rohingya has brought outrage from around the world and the United Nations has called the operations ethnic cleansing. There have been calls for democracy champion Suu Kyi to be stripped of the Nobel peace prize she won in 1991 because she has not condemned the military s actions. Some countries in the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), particularly Muslim-majority Malaysia, have voiced strong concern over the issue recently. However, in keeping with ASEAN s principle of non-interference in each others  internal affairs, it appeared to have been put aside at the summit, which brought Southeast Asian nations together with the United States, Russia, Japan, China, India, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. Duterte reported that China had agreed at the summit to work on a code of conduct in the South China Sea with ASEAN nations to ease tensions over disputed claims to the busy and resource-rich waterway. The group also signed agreements on protecting migrant labor and fighting terrorism and cybercrime. Trump skipped the plenary session of the summit because of scheduling delays, but he said his marathon trip to Asia had been a  tremendous  success. He told reporters on Air Force One that he had delivered his prepared remarks during a lunch before the summit meeting.  Trump said at least $300 billion, possibly triple that figure, of deals had been agreed in the trip. He did not elaborate.  We ve explained that the United States is open for trade but we want reciprocal, we want fair trade for the United States,  he said. Trade and concern about possible protectionism under Trump s  America First  agenda have come up during his visit to the region, which included stops in Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam before concluding in the Philippines. After Trump left Manila, a group of Asia-Pacific nations pursuing a separate Beijing-backed trade deal that does not include the United States agreed to  intensify efforts  in 2018 to bring their negotiations to a conclusion. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) appeared to have been given new impetus at the summit by Trump s withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement, to which China is not party. The two trade deals are not mutually exclusive. ASEAN is joined in the RCEP talks by China, India, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea. ",worldnews,"November 14, 2017 ",1
Soul-searching at France's FN: far-right party polls activists,"NANTERRE, France (Reuters) - Who are you and what do you want? Seeking to rebrand itself and bounce back from electoral defeat, France s far-right National Front on Tuesday sent a questionnaire to party members asking them whether it should change its name and policies. Six months after party leader Marine Le Pen suffered a crushing defeat against centrist Emmanuel Macron in the presidential election run-off, the poll is part of the 45-year-old National Front s (FN) efforts to relaunch itself.  We need to ask ourselves why we didn t win the presidential election and how we can improve our political offer,  said FN lawmaker Sebastien Chenu.  We want to win elections, we owe it to our members.   The FN s 81,000 cardholders - which includes those up to a year late on party dues - are asked to say what type of job they have and where they get their news from. More crucially, they are asked if they want to ditch the euro and hold a referendum on France s membership of the European Union and if they think the party should focus less on immigration. Opposition to the euro and immigration have long been at the heart of the party s policies, but in the six months since her defeat, Le Pen has progressively watered down her anti-EU stance, which is unpopular and widely considered to be one of the reasons why the FN does not win major elections. Party officials will use the results of the questionnaire to help prepare a party congress to be held in mid-March. Members are also asked if they want to change the party s name. While the FN is a well-known brand throughout France, it is largely associated with Le Pen s father Jean-Marie, the party founder, who was several times convicted for incitement to racial hatred. While the FN got more votes than ever in the presidential election, the lower-than-expected second round score as well as the parliamentary election that followed were a huge disappointment for the party and its cardholders. Opinion polls over the past months have shown Le Pen s popularity has taken a hit even among party members and it is the far-left France Insoumise (France Unbowed), not the FN, that voters see as Macron s strongest opponent. Le Pen said the party needed to learn from its errors and rebrand itself. Her willingness to water down her opposition to the euro lead to the eviction of Florian Philippot, who had been her closest aide since she took over the party in 2011 and an architect of her policy plans.

EU support of Libyan coast guard 'inhuman': U.N. rights chief,"GENEVA (Reuters) - The European Union s support for the Libyan coast guard is leading to the arbitrary and indefinite imprisonment of migrants in  inhuman  conditions, the U.N. human rights chief said on Tuesday. The EU anti-trafficking mission Sophia has helped train Tripoli s coast guard, while Italy has supplied it with four patrol boats. Italy also has sent millions of euros and a navy repair ship to fix Libya s marine fleet. So far in 2017, the Libyans have intercepted almost 20,000 migrants at sea, according to the International Organization for Migration. After being taken from the boats, they are brought to land and put in  detention centers  that were visited by United Nations personnel.  Monitors were shocked by what they witnessed,  High Commissioner on Human Rights Zeid Ra ad Al Hussein said in a statement.  They saw  thousands of emaciated and traumatized men, women and children piled on top of each other, locked up in hangars with no access to the most basic necessities, and stripped of their human dignity,  he said.  Some 20,000 people are now being held in facilities controlled by Tripoli s migration department, up from 7,000 in September, the U.N. said in a statement. While U.N. agencies and other humanitarian groups have access to them and seek to provide health care and some food, Zeid said it was not enough because  the EU and its member states have done nothing so far to reduce the level of abuses suffered by migrants .  Just a day ago, European and African ministers repeated a pledge to try to improve conditions for migrants in Libya, and on Saturday Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni hailed Italian immigration policy.  Italy is the only country in Europe with a decent migration policy,  Gentiloni said.  We re proud because we don t build walls or close ports.  But it was Italy that struck a deal with the U.N.-backed Tripoli in February, which was endorsed by the whole of the EU, aimed at blocking migrants in Libya, much as the EU deal with Turkey did last year.   That agreement, combined with the support for the Libyan coast guard, has brought migrant sea arrivals down dramatically in recent months. This year there have been 115,000 sea arrivals in Italy, down 31 percent from last year, official data from Italy s Interior Ministry show. In October alone arrivals dropped by 76 percent from a year earlier.  ",worldnews,"November 14, 2017 ",1
"EU Commission defends Malta on money laundering, lawmakers skeptical","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A top European Commission official defended Malta s record on preventing money laundering in a parliamentary debate on Tuesday prompted by the murder of an investigative journalist, but a variety of EU lawmakers expressed scepticism. Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans told European Parliament lawmakers that the European Commission had carried out an analysis of Malta s compliance with anti-money laundering laws and concluded that there were  no general concerns .  He added however that  improvements could be made on various levels,  and said the commission was assessing new information provided by Malta on recent alleged cases of wrongdoing. Timmermans  assessment was however not shared by most lawmakers. Many called for closer oversight of Malta s adherence to the rule of law, a process that could lead to heavy sanctions if wrongdoing was ascertained. Esteban Gonz lez Pons, Vice-Chairman of the conservative group, the largest of the EU assembly, denounced in Malta  the harassment of journalists, the blackmailing of independent media by banks connected with money laundering, the involvement of government officials in tax evasion.  He said that police in Malta  remain silent  in the face of such activities. Other lawmakers echoed Pons s comments and raised other questions about Malta s respect for the rule of law and money laundering rules. A smaller number of parliamentarians urged caution on accusations against Malta. A resolution set to be voted on Wednesday openly questions the independence of the police on the island and raises  serious concerns about the rule of law, democracy and fundamental rights  in Malta.   The parliament s debate was triggered by the killing on Oct. 16 of Daphne Caruana Galizia, a Maltese journalist who had denounced high-profile corruption and accused Prime Minister Joseph Muscat of wrongdoing.  The Parliament named the news room in its Strasbourg building after Caruana Galizia on Tuesday.  Timmermans did not make any direct comment on the rule of law in Malta, but he called again on the Maltese authorities to bring to justice the perpetrators of Caruana Galizia s murder. He said the investigation should proceed unhampered and stressed that the Maltese authorities had committed to do all in their power to pursue the culprits. He also called on Malta to join the EU public prosecution office, a new body to prosecute crimes in the 28-country bloc, from which Malta has opted out. ",worldnews,"November 14, 2017 ",1
Macron lawmakers admonished for partying in French parliament,"PARIS (Reuters) - The head of France s parliament on Tuesday admonished newcomers from President Emmanuel Macron s party for noisy partying in the assembly s bar after late-night sessions. In one such case, lawmakers from the centrist president s Republic on The Move (LREM) party improvised a party with music at the National Assembly s bar after a debate on the social security budget. The bar staff were obliged to work late until the lawmakers had left, parliamentary sources said. Macron s 313 lawmakers, many of whom are new to politics, were initially criticized after the June election for their inexperience, though this has not stopped the swift adoption of wide-ranging reforms, including security and labor laws. But the partying after late-night votes has to stop, the assembly s president Francois de Rugy told them on Tuesday, saying it was not fair on the staff who work there.  De Rugy also said lawmakers must stop brandishing objects in parliament, something its rules and regulations forbid. That remark appeared aimed at lawmakers from the far-left France Insoumise (France Unbowed), who in July piled up pasta and a pot of tomato sauce on their bench in parliament to show how much students would lose out on with a 5 euro cut in housing subsidies.  It is crucial that the presidents of (parliamentary) groups remind each and every member about the proper conduct of parliamentary proceedings and the necessary dignity of lawmakers,  de Rugy said in a statement.

Saudi-led coalition air raid puts Yemen's Sanaa airport out of service: agency,"Aden (Reuters) - An air raid by the Saudi-led military coalition put Yemeni airport in the Houthi-controlled capital Sanaa out of service on Tuesday, jeopardizing relief shipments to a country on the brink of famine, the state news agency SABA reported. The Saudi-led coalition fighting Yemen s Houthi movement said last week it had closed all air, land and seaports in Yemen to stem what it said was the flow of arms to the Houthis from Iran. Air raids destroyed radio navigation station for aircraft, civil aviation authorities told SABA, which is controlled by the Houthis. Air traffic in Sanaa s airport is currently restricted to flights carrying humanitarian aid sent by the United Nations and other international organizations. The Houthis control most of the north, including Sanaa and its international airport, while the Saudi-led coalition dominates the airspace. Any reopening would need an agreement between the two sides, which blame each other for Yemen s humanitarian disaster. The top U.N. aid official in Yemen called on the Saudi-led coalition on Tuesday to open all Yemen s sea ports urgently, saying it risked damaging the fight against cholera and hunger, with 7 million already in  famine-like conditions . Millions of lives were at risk because of the blockade, U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Yemen, Jamie McGoldrick, said to reporters in Geneva by telephone from Amman. he said. The Saudi-led coalition was not immediately available for comment. ",worldnews,"November 14, 2017 ",1

"May Brexit offer would hurt, cost EU citizens - EU parliament","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May s offer of  settled status  for EU residents is flawed and will leave them with fewer rights after Brexit, the European Parliament s Brexit coordinator said on Tuesday. A family of five could face a bill of 360 pounds to acquire the new status, Guy Verhofstadt told May s Brexit Secretary David Davis in a letter seen by Reuters    a very significant amount for a family on low income . Listing three other concerns for the EU legislature, which must approve any treaty on the March 2019 exit, Verhofstadt told Davis:  Under your proposals, EU citizens will definitely notice a deterioration of their status as a result of Brexit. And the Parliament s aim all along has been that EU citizens, and UK citizens in the EU-27, should notice no difference.  Verhofstadt, a former Belgian prime minister, wrote in response to Davis, who had written to him after Parliament complained last week that there remained  major issues  to be settled on the rights of the 3 million EU citizens in Britain. On Tuesday, he told reporters that Parliament was determined that expatriates should not become  victims of Brexit . May had unveiled more details last week of a system aimed at giving people already in Britain a quick and cheap way of asserting their rights to stay there indefinitely. The issue, along with how much Britain owes and the new EU-UK border across Ireland, is one on which the EU wants an outline agreement before opening talks on the future of trade. Verhofstadt said lawmakers were not dismissing British efforts to streamline applications but saw flaws in the nature of  settled status  itself. As well as the cost, which is similar to that of acquiring a British passport, he cited three others: - Europeans should simply  declare  a whole household resident, without needing an  application  process; the burden of proof should be on the British authorities to deny them rights. - more stringent conditions on criminal records could mean some EU residents, including some now with permanent resident status, being deported for failing to gain  settled status . - EU residents would lose some rights to bring relatives to Britain as the new status would give them the same rights as British people, who now have fewer rights than EU citizens.

Japan's PM says North Korea still developing missiles despite launch pause,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Tuesday said an almost two-month pause in North Korean missile tests was no indication that it had halted its weapons development, insisting it was too early for any talks with the regime.  I believe that it continues to develop its weapons,  Abe told a news conference in Manila after a series of meetings with other Asian leaders at a gathering of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and East Asia Forum.   There is no point for talks for the sake of talks,  he said. Abe s insistence that tough sanctions, including restrictions on oil sales, are necessary to soften up the North Korean regime over the coming winter could put him at loggerheads with other countries such as South Korea that might agree to open talks if approached by the North. After firing missiles at a pace of about two or three a month since April, North Korean missile launches paused in September, after it fired a rocket that passed over Japan s northern Hokkaido island. Abe said he would work closely with other countries in the region including China and Russia to persuade North Korea to halt missile development and give up its nuclear weapon ambitions. Abe, in a meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping at an Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Vietnam on Saturday, hailed a  fresh start  to the relationship between Asia s two biggest economies and military powers, including cooperation on North Korea. Abe on Tuesday said that he wanted to deepen cultural and economic ties with China.

Bosnia making military progress in NATO bid - alliance general,"SARAJEVO (Reuters) - Bosnia meets the military conditions needed to take the next step toward its eventual goal of NATO membership but it remains unclear whether it can satisfy the political requirements, the head of the alliance s military committee said on Tuesday. Bosnia wants to activate its Membership Action Plan (MAP), a formal step toward joining NATO, but must first complete full registration of all military assets in its two constituent, ethnically-based regions, the Bosniak-Croat Federation and the Serb Republic.     Complicating Bosnia s membership drive is the stance of the Serb Republic, which remains wary of a military alliance that bombed Serbs in Bosnia and Kosovo in 1995 and 1999. The Serb Republic has said it would hold a referendum on joining NATO. The Bosnian Serbs have opposed registering their region s military assets to the country s weak central government in Sarajevo.  However, the head of NATO s military committee praised Bosnia s progress at the military level.  Our recommendation when it comes to the level of interoperability, the level of effort your armed forces are putting into reform, will be positive,  said Petr Pavel, a Czech army general. But he stressed that the decision to give Bosnia the green light on activating MAP would be a political one. Dragan Covic, the chairman of Bosnia s tripartite presidency, has voiced optimism that NATO foreign ministers could decide to activate the country s MAP at a meeting in Brussels on Dec. 5-6. Participation in MAP is not in itself a guarantee of eventual NATO membership. Pavel said NATO had a strong interest in Balkan stability and cited various threats he said faced all of Europe, including a resurgent Russia, illegal migration and terrorism. Bosnia s inter-ethnic presidency, its central government in Sarajevo and the Bosniak-Croat Federation have long said joining NATO and the European Union are strategic priorities.  But the Bosnian Serbs lean toward closer ties with Russia, aligning their policy with that of wartime patron and ally Serbia where NATO remains hugely unpopular after its 1999 bombing campaign to drive Serbian forces out of Kosovo and after 1995 NATO air strikes against rebel Serbs in Bosnia.

South China Sea code of conduct talks to be 'stabilizer' for region: China premier,"MANILA (Reuters) - China s agreement to begin talks with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) on the fine print of a code of conduct framework for the disputed South China Sea will help to stabilize the region, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said.  China s greatest hope is for peace and stability in the South China Sea,  Li told ASEAN leaders in Manila. The Chinese and Southeast Asian foreign ministers in August adopted a negotiating framework for a code of conduct in the South China Sea, a move they hailed as progress but seen by critics as a tactic to buy China time to consolidate its maritime power. While the South China Sea was not as dominant an issue at this summit at a time of relative calm, there was an underlying acknowledgement amongst ASEAN members that the risk of a miscalculation in the disputed waterway could flare up at anytime.       Li, addressing ASEAN leaders during a summit in the Philippines capital Manila on Monday, said there was a consensus on moving forward and to try to peacefully resolve the issue.  We hope the talks on the code of conduct will bolster mutual understanding and trust,  Li said, according to a transcript of his speech released by China s Foreign Ministry on Tuesday.  He added that he hoped this would be a  stabilizer  for the region, while pledging that China would  firmly safeguard  the freedom of navigation and overflight in the strategic waterway where $3 trillion worth of goods passes every year.  Critics, however, say the agreement to talk on the details of the code of conduct is only an incremental move, with a possible final agreement still years away.  While Li did not give a timeframe, Philippines  President Rodrigo Duterte, who was chairing the regional summit, said China was being pressed to set a specific date and that Beijing responded it would  consider really fast-tracking  the code of conduct.   China has graciously agreed to a code of conduct and it binds itself to the agreement,  Duterte said. The framework seeks to advance a 2002 Declaration of Conduct (DOC) of Parties in the South China Sea, which has mostly been ignored by claimant states, particularly China, which has built seven manmade islands in disputed waters, three of which are equipped with runways, surface-to-air missiles and radars. All parties say the framework is only an outline for how the code will be established but critics say the failure to outline as an initial objective the need to make the code legally binding and enforceable, or have a dispute resolution mechanism, raises doubts about how effective the pact will be.  Signing China up to a legally binding and enforceable code for the waterway has long been a goal for claimant members of ASEAN, some of which have sparred for years over what they see as China s disregard for their sovereign rights and its blocking of fishermen and energy exploration efforts. Malaysia, Taiwan, Brunei, Vietnam and the Philippines all claim some or all of the South China Sea and its myriad shoals, reefs and islands. China claims most of the waterway and has been aggressively building and militarizing artificial islands. China s official news agency Xinhua said in a commentary that the pact to hold consultations on the code of conduct was  a new starting point to jointly build a sea of peace, stability and prosperity .

Ireland says new thinking from UK needed for Brexit breakthrough,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - New thinking is needed from the British government to secure agreement on the Irish border and allow Brexit talks to move onto the next phase as the current proposals are not credible, Ireland s Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said on Tuesday. Brussels wants three issues broadly solved before it decides in December whether Brexit talks can move onto a second phase about trade, as Britain wants. These are Britain s exit bill, safeguarding expatriate rights, and the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, which will be the UK s only land frontier with the EU after its departure. After the latest round of negotiations ended with little obvious progress last week, Coveney said there was still a way to go on the border proposals before the negotiating teams would be able to move on to the next phase.  The current approach the British government are taking is not compatible with the solutions that we need,  Coveney told reporters.  Some of the ideas they published in their paper late in the summer hint towards finding solutions to those problems, but I don t think they are comprehensive or credible ... We need more detail and we need to see some new thinking that is flexible and recognises the unique challenges of the island of Ireland.  He was referring to proposals in August when London said there should be no infrastructure or electronic surveillance on the 500-km (300-mile) border, with smaller firms exempted from any new customs processes and  trusted trader arrangements  put in place to reduce the burden for larger companies. Coveney said Ireland did not think Britain s three aims of quitting the EU s single market and customs union, that the whole of United Kingdom leave together, and that there be no border infrastructure were compatible. The European Union agreed with Dublin s position, he said. Some 30,000 people travel across the border every day via over 400 crossings without any controls, and the issue is particularly sensitive given the decades of violence over whether Northern Ireland should be part of the UK or Ireland. Around 3,600 people were killed before a 1998 peace agreement. Dublin has said that the best way to retain the status quo is by keeping the same rules and regulations on both sides of the border.  We need a credible plan to avoid the imposition of border infrastructure in the future and we don t have it yet,  Coveney said. ",worldnews,"November 15, 2017 ",1
Tillerson to press Myanmar army chief to halt violence so Rohingya can return,"YANGON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will stress the need to halt violence and stabilize Rakhine State when he meets the head of Myanmar s military on Wednesday in a bid to ease the Rohingya refugee crisis, a senior State Department official said.  More than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh since late August, driven out by a counter-insurgency clearance operation of Myanmar forces in Rakhine. A top U.N. official has called the operation a textbook case of  ethnic cleansing . Attending an East Asia summit in Manila on Tuesday, Tillerson met Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi, whose less than two-year-old civilian administration shares power with the military and has no control over its generals. He will meet Suu Kyi again in the Myanmar capital of Naypyitaw on Wednesday, and hold separate talks with the head of the armed forces, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing. Asked what approach Tillerson would take with Myanmar s army chief, the State Department official told journalists in a briefing by teleconference that the emphasis would be on restoring peace in Rakhine.  We are focusing on trying to stabilize areas in northern Rakhine so that people can return there, stopping the violence, making sure that the military would protect all populations in that area equally and that they conduct a credible investigation that leads to accountability for people who have perpetrated abuses,  said the official, who was with Tillerson in Manila and declined to be identified. The official said the consequences for the country, also known as Burma, if it failed to respond to the crisis with accountability could be part of the conversation with the military leader.  Burma made a lot of progress and we would not want to see that progress reversed,  the official added. U.S. senators in Washington are pressing for economic sanctions and travel restrictions targeting the Myanmar military and its business interests.  The secretary will reiterate support for Burma s democratic transition and urge the Burmese government to protect the local population and allow unhindered humanitarian and media access, (and) support for a credible investigation of abuses,  the official added. Accusations of organized mass rape and other crimes against humanity were leveled at the Myanmar military on Sunday by another senior U.N. official who had toured camps in Bangladesh where Rohingya refugees have taken shelter. Mass Exodus: tmsnrt.rs/2xTAOon Pramila Patten, special representative of the U.N. secretary-general on sexual violence in conflict, said she would raise accusations against the Myanmar military with the International Criminal Court in the Hague. The military, known as the Tatmadaw, has consistently protested its innocence, and on Monday it posted the findings of an internal investigation on the Facebook page of Min Aung Hlaing. It said it had found no instances where its soldiers had shot and killed Rohingya villagers, raped women or tortured prisoners. It denied that security forces had torched Rohingya villages or used  excessive force . The military said that, while 376  terrorists  were killed, there were no deaths of innocent people. Human rights groups poured scorn on the military s investigation, branding it a  whitewash  and calling for U.N. and independent investigators to be allowed into Myanmar.  The Burmese military s absurd effort to absolve itself of mass atrocities underscores why an independent international investigation is needed to establish the facts and identify those responsible,  Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. Amnesty International also dismissed the military s internal investigation.  There is overwhelming evidence that the military has murdered and raped Rohingya and burned their villages to the ground,  the London-based rights group said. The government in mostly Buddhist Myanmar regards the Muslim Rohingya as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. And Suu Kyi s failure to speak out strongly over their plight has widely damaged the Nobel Peace Prize winner s international reputation as a stateswoman. Many diplomats, however, believe Myanmar s fragile transition to democracy after 49 years of military rule would be jeopardized if she publicly criticized the armed forces.  Both parts of the government will have to work together in order to solve this problem...Trying to get two of them to work together, to try to solve the problem, is certainly going to be very important,  the U.S. official said. The U.S. official said Suu Kyi had been forthcoming in her talks with Tillerson and others during the past few days about the steps that needed to be taken to improve the situation, including plans for the voluntary repatriation of Rohingya. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau were among those she met in Manila to discuss the Rohingya crisis.  This is a tremendous concern to Canada and to many, many countries around the world,  Trudeau told a news conference. Japan s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pledged up to 117 billion yen ($1 billion) of development aid to Myanmar in his meeting with Suu Kyi. While world leaders wrung their hands, thousands of Rohingya remained stranded in Myanmar, on beaches around the mouth of the Naf river, hoping to find a boat to make the short, sometimes perilous crossing to Bangladesh.  They re still coming, risking their lives, driven by fears of starvation and violence,  Shariful Azam, a police official in Bangladesh s Cox s Bazar, a narrow spit of land where the world s most urgent humanitarian crisis is unfolding.

South Sudan Supreme Court judge quits citing lack of independence,"JUBA (Reuters) - A judge of South Sudan s Supreme Court resigned on Tuesday, saying a lack of independence from the executive had turned the judiciary into a  mockery  and complaining of poor working conditions. All of South Sudan s judges went on a five-month strike in May over poor pay, raising the risk of impunity in a country already convulsed by criminality and war. South Sudan, the world s youngest country, descended into civil war in 2013 after President Salva Kiir fired his deputy, unleashing a conflict that has spawned a patchwork of armed factions.  The independence of the judiciary, in the Republic of South Sudan, has become a mockery,  Kukurlopita Marino Pitia, a Supreme Court judge, said in his resignation letter.  The war in South Sudan cannot be used as an excuse to interfere and silence and silence the judiciary,  Pitia said, adding that the judiciary was expected to protect many rights that are jeopardized by conflict. Government officials were not available immediately for  comment on his letter. The conflict in South Sudan has slashed oil revenues and paralyzed agriculture, spurring hyperinflation that has rendered many civil servants  salaries almost worthless. Arop Malueth, secretary for the steering committee for Judges and the Justice Union, told Reuters that two more judges from the lower courts had also resigned.  Many of us feel that the judiciary is not independent as it should be,  Malueth said, adding that some judges had been dismissed unconstitutionally, at the behest of the executive. EX-ARMY CHIEF Separately, the government said on Tuesday the former chief of the army, General Paul Malong, would be allowed to leave the country, six months after placing him under house arrest in the capital following a falling out with President Kiir. Kiir s spokesman Ateny Wek Ateny told UN radio in South Sudan that Malong was free to go to any country for medical treatment  on grounds of humanity . Malong led the army s war effort against rebels from 2014 but Kiir sacked him in May and placed him under house arrest. Earlier this month, Kiir sent troops to disarm Malong s bodyguards at his house in Juba, but they refused. Kiir s troops then surrounded Malong s house, sparking fears of clashes, before withdrawing a week later. Malong is under U.S. sanctions and has been accused, along with Kiir, by a U.N. panel of experts of leading troops who murdered and raped civilians during the civil war.(This version of the story was refiled to correct reporter s name in signoff) ",worldnews,"November 14, 2017 ",1
"Myanmar military denies atrocities against Rohingya, replaces general","YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar s army released a report on Monday denying all allegations of rape and killings by security forces, having days earlier replaced the general in charge of the operation that drove more than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims to flee to Bangladesh. No reason was given for Major General Maung Maung Soe being transferred from his post as the head of Western Command in Rakhine state, where Myanmar s military, known as the Tatmadaw, launched a sweeping counter-insurgency operation in August.  I don t know the reason why he was transferred,  Major General Aye Lwin, deputy director of the psychological warfare and public relation department at the Ministry of Defense, told Reuters.  He wasn t moved into any position at present. He has been put in reserve.  A senior U.N. official, who had toured the refugee camps in Bangladesh, on Sunday accused Myanmar s military of conducting organized mass rape and other crimes against humanity. The Myanmar military said its own internal investigation had exonerated security forces of all accusations of atrocities. The investigators  findings were posted on the Facebook page of the military s commander-in-chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing. The developments came ahead of a visit on Wednesday by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. He is expected to deliver a stern message to Myanmar s generals, over whom national leader Aung San Suu Kyi has little control. A spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department, Katina Adams, said the United States was aware of reports of the general s replacement and added:  We remain gravely concerned by continuing reports of violence and human rights abuses committed by Burmese security forces and vigilantes. Those responsible for abuses must be held accountable.  Lawmakers in Washington are pressing to pass legislation imposing economic and travel sanctions targeting the military and its business interests.  In an op-ed in Britain s Guardian newspaper on Monday, Republican Representative Steve Chabot and Democratic Representative Joseph Crowley said it was time to  expeditiously  impose sanctions.  The U.S. needs to send a clear message that there is no excuse for a cruel, extensive and grossly disproportionate crackdown on civilians,  they said. The government in mostly Buddhist Myanmar, which is also known as Burma, regards the Rohingya as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Leaders of Asian nations meeting in Manila on Monday skirted around the exodus of the Rohingya, disappointing human rights groups who were hoping for a tough stand. Maung Maung Soe s transfer was ordered on Friday and Brigadier General Soe Tint Naing, formerly a director in logistics, was appointed as the new head of Western Command. Made up of three divisions, Western Command is overseen by the Bureau of Special Operations, which reports to the office of Min Aung Hlaing. A senior U.N. official, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra ad al-Hussein, has described the army s actions in Rakhine as a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.  Myanmar says the clearance operation was necessary for national security after Rohingya militants attacked 30 security posts and an army base in the state on Aug. 25. The internal investigation put the number of fighters involved in the attacks at over 10,000, more than doubling an earlier official estimate. Speaking in Dhaka, Pramila Patten, the U.N. Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, said she would raise accusations against the Myanmar military with the International Criminal Court in the Hague.  When I return to New York, I will brief and raise the issue with the prosecutor and president of the ICC whether they (Myanmar s military) can be held responsible for these atrocities,  Patten said.  Sexual violence is being commanded, orchestrated and perpetrated by the Armed Forces of Myanmar, otherwise known as the Tatmadaw,  Patten said following a three-day tour of the Rohingya refugee camps in the Cox s Bazar region of Bangladesh.  Rape is an act and a weapon of genocide,  she said. Refugees have accused Myanmar soldiers and Buddhist vigilantes of torching their villages, murdering their families and raping women. Patten said brutal acts of sexual violence had occurred in the context of collective persecution that included the killing of adults and children, torture, mutilation and the burning and looting of villages.  The forms of sexual violence we consistently heard about from survivors include gang-rape by multiple soldiers, forced public nudity and humiliation, and sexual slavery in military captivity. One survivor was in captivity for 45 days by the Myanmar army,  Patten said. The Myanmar military s internal probe said that according to 2,817 people interviewed from 54 Rohingya villages soldiers did not fire on  innocent villagers , rape or commit sexual violence against women. Nor were there any killings or beating of villagers, and the security forces did not carry out any looting or set fire to Rohingya mosques, it said.  The report also concluded that security forces only used small arms in clashes with Rohingya militants and there were no findings to suggest the use of  excessive force . It also blamed the militants for setting fire to the villages and frightening and coercing people to leave their homes. Myanmar is refusing entry to a U.N. panel that was tasked with investigating allegations of abuses after a smaller military counteroffensive launched in October 2016. The country is in the early stages of a fragile transition to democracy after being ruled by a junta for 49 years, and the generals have retained their autonomy on matters of defense, security and border issues under a 2008 constitution. Three generals are members of the cabinet. Suu Kyi has said that any alleged atrocities should be substantiated and investigated, while her government is working to stabilize Rakhine in order for the Rohingya to return. For now, though, the flow is one way. The International Rescue Committee, a New York-based aid agency, reckons that around two-thirds of an estimated 300,000 Rohingya remaining in Myanmar could head across the border in the coming months.

Tanzania offers reward for arrest of anti-graft official who fled,"DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - Tanzania offered a reward of 10 million shillings ($4,500) on Tuesday for the arrest of a former chief accountant of its anti-graft watchdog, part of a new drive to root out corruption.  President John Magufuli, in office since November 2015, has launched a crackdown on high-level corruption that has already seen thousands of public officials losing their jobs. John Mbungo, deputy director general of the state-run Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB), told reporters that the agency s former chief accountant, Godfrey Gugai, is on the run after his assets were frozen in May as part of a graft investigation. The frozen assets include six vehicles and 40 apartments, houses and prime plots in the commercial capital Dar es Salaam and other urban centers.  Public officials convicted of possession of unexplained wealth face a sentence of up to seven years in jail, a fine or both. Foreign investors have long complained that corruption is a big obstacle to doing business in the country. ",worldnews,"November 14, 2017 ",1
Gala glitz masks Asia's tensions as Trump winds up tour,"MANILA (Reuters) - Leaders from across Asia joined U.S. President Donald Trump at an extravagant gala dinner in the Philippines  capital on Sunday, a show of amity in a region fraught with tensions that have lurked behind his marathon tour of the continent. Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte set the tone of cordiality ahead of the two days of summit meetings he will host, suggesting that despite their differences over claims to the South China Sea, the leaders should not discuss the issue.  We have to be friends, the other hotheads would like us to confront China and the rest of the world on so many issues,  Duterte said at a business conference, as planes carrying heads of state and government attending the summit landed in quick succession in Manila.   The South China Sea is better left untouched, nobody can afford to go to war. It can ill-afford a violent confrontation.  Hours earlier, during a bilateral visit to Vietnam, Trump offered to mediate in the dispute over the South China Sea, where four Southeast Asian countries and Taiwan contest China s sweeping claims to the busy waterway. All the claimants will be at the summit, except for Taiwan. Trump will join leaders of Southeast and East Asian nations in Manila over the next two days, the last leg of a tour that has taken him to Japan, South Korea and China as well as Vietnam. The sheer length of the trip - the longest to Asia by a U.S. president in more than a quarter century - may reassure some that, despite Trump s  America First  policy, Washington remains committed to a region China sees as its strategic domain. Leaders of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), China, Russia, Japan, Canada, South Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand arrived one by one for a glitzy gala dinner where they were entertained by singers and dancers. Each of the men sported a cream-colored barong, a traditional Philippines shirt made of fiber from the pineapple plant, embroidered and worn untucked. They were served a four-course Filipino-Asian fusion meal curate and prepared by Chef Jessie Sincioco, who also designed the menu for Pope Francis when he visited the Philippines in 2015. Police used water canon to prevent hundreds of protesters reaching the U.S. embassy in Manila ahead of Trump s arrival. Carrying placards declaring  Dump Trump  and  Down with U.S. Imperialism , the left-wing protesters were blocked by police in riot gear with shields and batons, and then showered with jets of water from a fire engine. The United States and its former colony, the Philippines,  have been strategic allies since World War Two.  Trump is expected to try during the summit to shore up relations, which have been strained by the mercurial Duterte s notorious anti-U.S. sentiment and his enthusiasm for better ties with Russia and China. Duterte - sometimes described as the  Trump of the East  because of his brash style - said last week he would tell the U.S. president to  lay off  if he raised the issue of human rights when they met. More than 3,900 Filipinos have been killed in what the police call self-defense in a war on drugs declared by Duterte. Critics say executions are taking place with no accountability, allegations the police reject. But Trump, who has been criticized at home for neglecting rights issues in dealings abroad, praised Duterte in May for doing an  unbelievable job on the drug problem .  INDO-PACIFIC  Trump s tour comes against a background of tensions on the Korean peninsula following exchanges of war-like threats and insults between North Korea s leader Kim Jong Un and Trump over Pyongyang s nuclear and missile development program. China has been urged by both South Korea and the United States to take a more active role in curbing North Korea s nuclear and missile ambitions. During his tour, Trump and his team have repeatedly used the term  Indo-Pacific  instead of  Asia-Pacific  for the region, which some see as an effort to depict it as more than China-dominated. Pacific Rim nation leaders agreed in Vietnam on Saturday to address  unfair trade practices  and  market distorting subsidies , a statement that bore the imprint of Trump s efforts to reshape the global trade landscape. The summit of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) countries in Vietnam put on show the contrasting vision of the  America First  policy with the traditional consensus favoring multinational deals that China now seeks to champion. Manila hosted the APEC summit two years ago, and at that meeting Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau won a Twitter poll with the hashtag #APEChottie that asked people to vote for the most attractive leader there. Journalists swarmed the youthful leader and screamed in excitement. On his latest visit, Trudeau visited an outlet of Jollibee, a chain that has become a byword for Filipino fast food, chatting and posing for selfies, charming the people of Manila again.

Hong Kong soccer fans defy Beijing by booing Chinese national anthem,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hundreds of Hong Kong soccer fans booed and jeered the Chinese national anthem at an Asia Cup qualifier match on Tuesday in defiance of Communist Party rulers in Beijing. The booing of the anthem,  The March of the Volunteers , has become a fixture at football matches in the Chinese-ruled territory, with some parallels to protests in the United States where American football players have knelt during the national anthem, an act denounced by U.S. President Donald Trump. Now the former British colony is preparing to introduce a law that will penalize people who boo the anthem, a measure that critics say undermines the city s autonomy and freedoms guaranteed when it returned to China 20 years ago. Details of the law, including jail terms and the scope of enforcement, have yet to be set. China extended the law to cover Hong Kong earlier this month. Chinese President Xi Jinping in recent years has ushered in new legislation aimed at securing the country from threats both within and outside its borders, besides presiding over a sweeping crackdown on dissent and free speech.  Chinese officials have said the anthem law is necessary to safeguard the authority of the state. Several hundred fans greeted the anthem before the match against Lebanon with jeers and boos, with some unfurling banners that said  Die for Hong Kong , while others yelled  We are Hong Kong  in English, rather than the local Cantonese dialect.  Some security guards signaled to the supporters to behave.   I m not scared even if it becomes law ... I will go to the toilet instead of sitting when the national anthem is on,  Hong Kong supporter Bendter Chong said when asked if he would continue to jeer the anthem when the law is enacted.  Tensions between Hong Kong and mainland China have increased in recent years amid calls for greater democracy. Mass street protests in 2014 paralyzed parts of the city although they failed to secure concessions on electoral reform from Beijing. Most of the jeering was from youths, underscoring how the younger generation has become increasingly disaffected by political tension and economic hardship.  Security was tight at the Hong Kong Stadium, the venue for the city s annual Rugby Sevens tournament, where about 10,000 gathered for the match. The stadium has capacity for 40,000. The game ended Lebanon 1, Hong Kong 0.  I m not sure about the law, but for sure people will be more behaved,  said Hong Kong supporter Fai Chan.  But it is still a matter of whether it is worth our respect.  Hong Kong returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997 under a  one country, two systems  arrangement that guarantees a high degree of autonomy, including an independent judiciary and freedom of expression. In 2015, Hong Kong football fans booed the Chinese anthem during a World Cup qualifier, prompting a fine for the Hong Kong Football Association from world body FIFA. The association was warned by the Asian Football Confederation recently over the conduct of fans and said  a repeat violation may result in more severe punishment . ",worldnews,"November 14, 2017 ",1

"Iran, Lebanon's Hariri differ on key meeting","BEIRUT (Reuters) - A top Iranian official and Lebanon s Saad al-Hariri gave conflicting accounts on Tuesday of a key meeting they had held right before Hariri quit as prime minister, a move he attributed to regional meddling by Iran and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah. The shock resignation has thrust Lebanon back onto the front line of a power struggle between Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shi ite Iran - a rivalry that has also buffeted Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Bahrain.  Hariri flew to Riyadh on Nov. 3, after meeting in Beirut Ali Akbar Velayati, the top foreign policy adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.   Hariri claims that in our meeting he asked Iran to stop interfering in the Lebanese affairs, but he did not say such a thing,  Velayati was quoted as saying by Iranian state television s website on Tuesday.  Our meeting was not tense or violent at all. These are all lies,  he said.      Velayati said Iran hoped Hariri would return to Lebanon, accusing Riyadh of fanning the flames of tension as it  could not tolerate the strategic friendship  between Tehran and Beirut. Hariri denied Velayati s account that the Lebanese leader had offered to mediate between Iran and Saudi Arabia.  Prime Minister Hariri did not offer mediation between any countries,  a statement from his press office said.   He presented to Velayati his point of view about the need to stop Iranian interventions in Yemen as a gateway and a precondition for any improvement in ties between (Iran) and the kingdom,  it said.  A long-time Saudi ally, Hariri had first mentioned the Velayati meeting in a television interview on Sunday night, his first public comments since quitting.  He warned Lebanon was at risk of Gulf Arab sanctions because of regional meddling by Shi ite Hezbollah and said he would return to Lebanon within days. In his resignation speech in a broadcast from Saudi Arabia on Nov. 4, Hariri said he feared assassination and accused Iran along with Hezbollah of sowing strife in the Arab world. Top Lebanese government officials and senior politicians close to Hariri believe Saudi Arabia coerced him into quitting and has been holding him against his will since, though Hariri and Riyadh have denied this.

"Lebanese patriarch, in Saudi, says supports reasons Hariri quit","RIYADH (Reuters) - Lebanon s Christian Maronite Patriarch, visiting Saudi Arabia in an historic visit to the ultra-conservative Muslim kingdom, expressed support on Tuesday for the reasons behind Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri s resignation. Hariri, a Saudi ally, resigned abruptly on Nov. 4 in a move Lebanese political leaders ascribed to pressure from Riyadh. Hariri said his resignation had been prompted by an assassination plot and accused Iran and Hezbollah of sowing strife in the region. He denies there are any constraints on his movement. Patriarch Bechara al-Rai met Hariri as well as King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as part of a trip that was planned well before the Lebanese political crisis brought on by Hariri s resignation.  Hariri is returning as fast as possible and I support the reasons for his resignation,  Rai was quoted as saying by Saudi-owned Al Arabiya television. Hariri said he was fine and would return to Lebanon in the next two days. On Twitter, he urged Lebanese to remain calm and said his family would stay in Saudi Arabia, calling it  their country . The events have thrust Lebanon back to the forefront of the conflict between Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shi ite Iran. Rai s trip has come under heightened scrutiny in light of Hariri s resignation, but an official visit to Saudi Arabia by such a senior non-Muslim cleric is significant as a rare act of religious openness by the conservative Muslim country. The kingdom hosts the holiest sites in Islam and bans the practice of other religions, forcing Christians to risk arrest by praying in private homes. Prince Mohammed says he wants Saudi Arabia to open up more to the world. In addition to imposing radical economic reforms, the 32-year-old heir-apparent has pledged to relax strict social norms and revive a  middle-of-the-road, moderate Islam open to the world and all religions, traditions and people . Rai heads the Maronite church, which has a presence in Lebanon, Syria and Cyprus and follows an Eastern rite of the Roman Catholic Church. Flanked by Catholic clerics wearing vestments and gold crosses, Rai discussed religious tolerance and combating extremism with the king and his son, the Saudi state news agency said. Prince Mohammed has taken a harder line on Iran since taking on wide-ranging authorities two years ago including as defense minister, with the kingdom waging a two-year-old war in Yemen against Houthi fighters aligned with Iran. He has also pushed for more social freedoms in a country where authority has rested for decades on an enduring accommodation between the royal family and clerics who control the hardline Wahhabi strain of Islam that originated in Saudi Arabia. The powers of the Saudi religious police have been curbed, enforcement of gender segregation has been relaxed and women have been granted some more freedoms, including the right to drive cars starting next year. Rai is the second Christian patriarch to visit the country, after another such trip in 1975. He said the original invitation had been extended in 2013 by the late King Abdullah.

Australian citizenship crisis deepens as eighth lawmaker falls,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - The citizenship crisis engulfing Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull s government deepened on Tuesday as an eighth lawmaker exited parliament and the main opposition party drafted in a high-profile candidate for a key by-election. Turnbull s center-right government has already lost its majority in parliament, accounting for four of the eight lawmakers to be forced out or to resign from parliament in recent weeks because they were dual citizens. That status is banned under the Australian constitution to prevent split allegiances. Adherence to that rule in a country where more than half the population of 24 million was either born overseas or has a parent who was born overseas has only come under the spotlight in the current crisis, with the High Court confirming a strict interpretation of the law. Jacqui Lambie, an independent and outspoken senator for the island state of Tasmania, confirmed on Tuesday that she was the eighth lawmaker in a parliament of 226 to fall foul of the dual citizenship law, with political analysts warning that several more are likely to fall. The opposition Labor Party upped the stakes on Tuesday by announcing it was putting forward former state premier Kristina Keneally to contest the seat vacated by a lawmaker in Turnbull s Liberal Party. The by-election in the inner Sydney seat of Bennelong, along with another one for the seat of former Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce, who was ejected by last month s High Court ruling, will be key to restoring Turnbull s small majority in parliament.  This is a chance which I think a lot of people in Australia would like to have that has fallen to the people of Bennelong to send a message against the dysfunction and the chaos of the current government, the policy paralysis, the failure of leadership,  Labor leader Bill Shorten told reporters on Tuesday. While Joyce is widely expected to win back his safe rural seat after renouncing his New Zealand citizenship, the entry of the popular Keneally into the Sydney race has made that contest far less certain. Previously a safe conservative seat, it fell to the Labor Party in 2007, before the conservatives won it back in 2010.  Elections are notoriously volatile, anything is possible,  Nicholas Economou, a political scientist at Monash University, told Reuters.  Voters often use by-elections to give a stinging rebuke to a government that s at war with itself and that s what this government is. It s game on in Bennelong.  The citizenship crisis has hit Turnbull hard, with a poll released on Monday showing he had slipped to a new low in voter popularity amid criticism that he has failed to act decisively. Independent lawmakers have threatened to use their new-found power in the lower house to push through controversial legislation that has been blocked by the government, including a Royal Commission into the banking sector. The government and main opposition party cobbled together a deal on Monday to agree to a deadline of Dec. 1 for all politicians to disclose the birthplace of their parents and grandparents. Lambie vowed to immediately renounce her UK citizenship, granted by descent courtesy of her Scottish-born father.  I won t be laying down, I ll just get up and get back on and go again, simple as that,  she told local radio. Lambie, 43, a former army corporal, has become one of Australia s most recognizable and colorful politicians in her short time in office. She has garnered headlines for a range of controversial comments, including her belief that China could invade Australia and applauding Russian President Vladimir Putin s  very strong leadership .

U.S. would welcome new EU sanctions on Iran: official,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Any move by the European Union to impose new sanctions on Iran over its ballistic missile program and alleged involvement in Middle East conflicts would be  interesting and helpful , a U.S. administration official said on Tuesday. U.S. President Donald Trump, who has taken a more hawkish line on Iran than predecessor Barack Obama, has said Tehran s missile program should be curbed and wants to punish Tehran over its role in Yemen and Syria. Trump has also dealt a blow to an international 2015 deal on Iran s nuclear program by disavowing Iran s compliance with its terms. The U.S. Congress now has until mid-December to decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions on Iran that had been lifted in exchange for it limiting its nuclear activity. But the EU, which normally coordinates closely with Washington on international sanctions, has been lobbying hard to preserve the nuclear accord, saying it should be kept separate from missile and regional security matters.  Last week, French President Emmanuel Macron mooted the possibility of fresh sanctions, saying he was  very concerned  about Iran s missile program following the firing of a missile from Yemen into Saudi Arabia.   It would certainly be a very interesting and probably helpful move on the part of the EU,  the U.S. administration official told reporters in Brussels when asked if Washington wanted the EU to pursue fresh restrictions on Iran. The missile fired into Saudi Arabia from Yemen on Nov. 4 was intercepted near Riyadh airport and there were no casualties. Saudi Arabia, which intervened against Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen s war in 2015, accuses the Islamic Republic of supplying missiles and other weaponry to the Houthis.  Tehran denies this and it also rejected Macron s remarks, saying its missile program was solely defensive and not linked to the nuclear pact, which European powers, Russia and China - the other parties to the 2015 deal - say is vital to containing Middle East tensions. And there is no consensus in the EU, where imposing any sanctions requires the unanimity of all 28 member states, on any new punitive measures, a fact made clear by the bloc s top diplomat after chairing foreign minister talks on Monday.  We didn t discuss, not today, not last week (and) I don t foresee any discussion also in the future, further sanctions from the EU side on Iran,  EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini told reporters when asked about Macron s comments.   Ballistic missiles are not in the scope of the (nuclear deal),  she said.  This is a discussion and a proposal that was never raised at our table in these recent months and I don t foresee this happening in the near future.  Iran and Saudi Arabia are locked in a struggle for Middle East predominance. Their rivalry flared again earlier this month with the resignation of Saudi-backed Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri, who blamed an alleged assassination plot against him and accused Tehran and its heavily armed Lebanese ally Hezbollah of sowing conflict in the Arab world. The U.S. administration official declined to say what the Congress might do in the wake of Trump s action but said any new U.S. sanctions would be targeted narrowly at people and entities involved directly in the areas of concern.  We should expect to see a continued use of the U.S. sanctions tool in the areas such as proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, support for terrorist organizations and the deterioration of human rights inside Iran.  The U.S. official also said the West should keep up pressure on Russia as long as it does not reverse its 2015 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine or implement its side of a peace deal for  Ukraine s east, gripped by a Moscow-backed insurgency.  The EU s own economic sanctions on Moscow, which restrict  business with the Russian energy, defense and financial sectors, are currently in place until the end of January 2018.

Pakistan court issues arrest warrant for finance minister,"ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - A Pakistani anti-corruption court on Tuesday issued an arrest warrant for Finance Minister Ishaq Dar after the veteran politician failed to turn up for several court hearings. The warrant comes at an awkward time for Pakistan, which wants to raise in excess of $1 billion on international debt markets through a Sukuk and a Eurobond in coming months and has been trying to woo international investors. Dar, who has been charged with amassing wealth beyond his known sources of income, has missed three weeks of court hearings conducted by the anti-graft agency the National Accountability Bureau (NAB). Judge Mohammad Bashir issued the warrant on the grounds of  continued absence  from the court, according to a court statement. Dar, who has pleaded not guilty, is receiving medical treatment in London and now faces arrest upon his return to Pakistan. The case has been adjourned until Nov. 21. The charges against Dar followed an investigation into the finances of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who was ousted in July after the Supreme Court disqualified him for not declaring a small salary from his son s off-shore company. The finance minister is one of Sharif s closest political allies and Dar s son has married Sharif s daughter. Both men deny any wrongdoing. Dar has rejected growing calls to resign amid his legal woes and a worsening economic outlook for Pakistan, which is battling to stave off a balance of payments crisis due to dwindling foreign currency reserve and a widening current account deficit. Dar was initially lauded for steering Pakistan out of a balance of payments crisis in 2013 and returning the nuclear-armed country toward a higher growth trajectory. But over the past year he has faced criticism for his refusal to allow the rupee to weaken to ease macroeconomic pressures. He has also been accused of eroding the central bank s independence.

"U.N. warns millions at risk in Yemen, urges Saudi coalition to open ports","GENEVA (Reuters) - The U.N. aid coordinator called on the Saudi-led coalition to open all Yemen s seaports urgently on Tuesday, saying millions of lives were at risk.  The Saudi-led coalition fighting Yemen s Houthi movement said last week it had closed all air, land and seaports in Yemen to stem what it said was the flow of arms to the Houthis from Iran.  We have some 21 million people needing assistance and seven million of those are in famine-like conditions and rely completely on food aid,  U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Yemen Jamie McGoldrick said.   The continued closure by the Saudi-led coalition of critical seaports and airports is aggravating an already dire humanitarian situation. I think it poses a critical threat to the lives of millions who are already struggling to survive.   McGoldrick was speaking to reporters in Geneva by phone from Amman, because he said flights into Sanaa were blocked.  The humanitarian impact of what is happening right now is unimaginable,  he said.  The Saudi-led coalition has said it will keep Hodeidah port closed until a U.N. verification programme is reviewed to ensure no weapons reach the Houthis.  Iran denies arming the Houthis and blames the two-and-a-half-year conflict in Yemen on Riyadh.  McGoldrick said the Saudi plan to supply Yemen through the Saudi port of Jizan in the north and Aden in the south was too complicated, dangerous, slow and expensive, adding an estimated $30 per tonne to every shipment.   We would ask that the coalition opens all the seaports as a matter of urgency and allows humanitarian and other supplies to move, as well as the movement of aid workers,  he said. Humanitarian agencies had been successful in preventing famine and tackling a cholera outbreak that has sickened more than 900,000 people in six months and killed over 2,200.  This import blockage will reverse those gains and leave millions of people in a very precarious situation as we move ahead. The humanitarians are just holding things together, waiting for a peace process which is very much in the distance.  The north of the country, home to 78 percent of the population, had 20 days  stocks of diesel, crucial for pumping water and fighting cholera, and 10 days  stocks of gasoline, with no prospect of resupply soon, he said. Yemen had commercial wheat stocks for three months for the entire population of 28 million and about 120 days of rice. The U.N. children s agency UNICEF had only three weeks of vaccine supplies left in Yemen, and both UNICEF and the World Health Organization had shipments of essential medicines and vaccines blocked in Djibouti, McGoldrick said. Yemen s national airline said on Tuesday a commercial flight had landed at Aden international airport after acquiring security permits. ",worldnews,"November 14, 2017 ",1

Four Serbs get suspended sentences for 2008 attack on U.S. embassy,"BELGRADE (Reuters) - Four Serbian men got suspended prison terms on Tuesday for taking parts in riots at the U.S. embassy in 2008 - a long-delayed case that has soured relations between Belgrade and Washington. The four were convicted of hurling stones at the embassy during protests over perceived U.S. support for Kosovan independence. They were not charged over a fire that broke out at the peak of the riots and destroyed part of the building. Washington has pressed for prosecutions for almost a decade, but no one has so far been convicted over the blaze which killed one protester.     The four - Dejan Vucckovic, Dragan Marinkov, Marko Novitovic and Milan Tomas - pleaded not guilty but were convicted of endangering public safety and given two-year suspended sentences.  The court ruling said the men s rocks broke windows in the embassy and other protesters later threw in flares that started the fire. Another three defendants were acquitted due to lack of evidence. Serbia s government and the protesters reacted with fury after Kosovo s declaration of independence on Feb 21, 2008. Serbia considers Kosovo its historic heartland and has waged a diplomatic campaign against the secession of the predominantly ethnic Albanian region. Belgrade lost control of Kosovo in 1999 after NATO bombing ended Serbia s brutal counterinsurgency against Albanians there. Defense lawyer Zelimir Cabrilo said the court s verdict had not addressed the political factors behind the riot.  It was a political decision to stage the rally ... to remove (police) security from the embassy,  Cabrilo told reporters.    Instead, we have light, modest sentences against four persons ... for hurling stones, they were not sentenced for torching it (the embassy).  The case was delayed last year when the Serbian Court of Appeals annulled a lower court s sentencing, citing deficiencies in the ruling, and ordered a retrial. ",worldnews,"November 14, 2017 ",1
Pakistan police arrest dozens from Islamist party blocking entrance to capital,"ISLAMABAD/LAHORE, Pakistan (Reuters) - Pakistani police have arrested dozens of members of a hard-line  Islamist party that has blocked a main entrance to the capital since last week, a provincial spokesman said, in the latest confrontation between religious activists and authorities. Hundreds of supporters of the Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan party have blocked a main road to Islamabad since Friday, threatening violence if their demand that the minister of law be sacked is not met. The group blames the minister, Zahid Hamid, for changes to an electoral oath that it says amounts to blasphemy. The government puts the issue down to a clerical error. Pakistan s blasphemy law has become a lightning rod for Islamists, especially since 2011 when the liberal governor of Punjab province, Salman Taseer, was murdered by a bodyguard for questioning the law that mandates the death penalty for insulting Islam or the Prophet Mohammad. A spokesman for the Punjab provincial government, Malik Muhammad Ahmed Khan, told Reuters the protests were a  serious inconvenience for people and disturbing public life  in the province that surrounds Islamabad.  The Punjab government has detained dozens of Tehreek-e-Labaik s activists from various districts,  he said. Labaik spokesman Ejaz Ashrafi said in a statement police arrested hundreds of its workers in a countrywide swoop, mainly in the party s base in Punjab.  Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal late on Monday urged the protesters to call off the sit-in, saying he hoped the government  wouldn t be forced to take extreme steps .  One security source said the protesters detained several policemen, seized their weapons and mistreated them.   The abduction of the police is a heinous crime,  Iqbal said  in a statement. Police have accused the protesters, who are occupying the main artery between the capital and the nearby city of Rawalpindi, of throwing stones at them. Fearing violence, the government has blocked several roads with shipping containers to corral the protesters, but that has caused hours-long traffic jams. Minister of state for interior affairs Talal Chaudhry said the government had refused to accept the demand to sack the minister, and instead had ordered police to block any more Labaik supporters or leaders from joining the protest. In 2007, a confrontation between authorities and supporters of radical preachers at an Islamabad mosque led to the death of more than 100 people when commandos stormed the complex.  We re still trying to resolve this issue through dialogue but the situation is becoming intolerable,  Chaudhry, told reporters.  If this cannot be resolved, the roads will have to be cleared.

"North Korea nuclear arsenal too developed to destroy quickly, says Moon","SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean President Moon Jae-in said on Tuesday it would not be easy for reclusive North Korea to destroy its nuclear arsenal quickly, even if wanted to, given its weapons programs were so developed. North Korea is under heavy international pressure to end its weapons programs, pursued in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions. But it has vowed never to give up its nuclear arsenal. Speaking to reporters in the Philippines, Moon said that if North Korea agreed to hold talks, negotiations could be held with all options open.  If talks begin to resolve the North Korea nuclear issue, I feel it will be realistically difficult for North Korea to completely destroy its nuclear capabilities when their nuclear and missile arsenal are at a developed stage,  Moon said in a briefing.  If so, North Korea s nuclear program should be suspended, and negotiations could go on to pursue complete denuclearization.  Moon s remarks were made available by the presidential Blue House. Last week, the North said it did not oppose dialogue, but would  never put the issue related to the supreme interests of the DPRK and security of its people on the bargaining table .  We are not interested in such dialogue and negotiations in the least,  the North s official news agency said, referring to the country by its official name, the Democratic People s Republic of Korea. The North defends the programs as a necessary defense against U.S. plans to invade. The United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean war, denies any such intention. U.S. President Donald Trump has traded insults and threats with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as North Korea races toward its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the United States. Trump threatened in his maiden U.N. address to  totally destroy  North Korea if the United States was threatened and has said the time for talking, the policy of previous U.S. administrations, is over. Moon reiterated his stance that now was the time to increase pressure on North Korea so that it would come to talks.  He said differences in understanding between South Korea and China, North Korea s lone major ally, regarding the deployment of the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system on South Koran soil had not been resolved.  China has not said it has changed its stance to agree to THAAD and still says THAAD infringes on its security. We have, in turn, explained THAAD is not aimed at China but only toward curbing North Korea s nuclear and missile provocations,  he said. Last month, South Korea and China agreed to end a year-long standoff over THAAD which had seen South Korean companies doing business in China suffer from retaliation against the system s  deployment.

They are accused of accepting bribes from the state s transportation industry body in exchange for favorable legislation going back to the governorship of S rgio Cabral, who held power from 2007 to 2014 and was arrested in 2016 on corruption charges. The arrested deputies were members of embattled President Michel Temer s PMDB party. Also on Tuesday, Brazil s federal police said in a statement that it was carrying out 10 search and detention orders in the capital Brasilia, some of them relating to employees of state bank Caixa Economica Federal. The police said the accused illegally skimmed money from about 385 million reais ($117 million) in information technology contracts received from the bank. None of the accused parties could immediately be reached for comment. ",worldnews,"November 14, 2017 ",1
Japan's Abe offers $1 billion in rural aid to Myanmar's Suu Kyi,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Tuesday pledge up to 117 billion yen ($1.03 billion) of development aid to Myanmar in a meeting in Manila with government leader Aung San Suu Kyi. The package of low-interest loans will be used to fund projects including infrastructure and small company financing meant to help improve rural incomes, Japan s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a release. The aid pledge comes as Myanmar comes under intense criticism from human rights groups, the United Nations and other countries for a counter-insurgency operation that has sparked an exodus of more than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims to Bangladesh since August. Abe and Suu Kyi are in the Philippines for an Association of South East Asian Nations conference including other regional leaders.  While there, Suu Kyi, whose administration has no control over the security forces under a constitution drafted during military rule, discussed the Rohingya crisis with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. China and the United States also compete for influence in Myanmar. ",worldnews,"November 14, 2017 ",1
Iran 'hopes Hariri will remain Lebanon's prime minister',"LONDON (Reuters) - An Iranian official said on Tuesday Tehran hoped Saad al-Hariri would remain as Lebanon s prime minister and denied Hariri had resigned after a tense meeting with him in Beirut. Hariri resigned abruptly on Nov. 4 while in Saudi Arabia, saying he believed there was an assassination plot against him and accusing Iran and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah of sowing strife in the Arab world. Hariri had flown to Riyadh on Nov. 3 after a meeting in Beirut with Ali Akbar Velayati, the top adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.   Hariri claims that in our meeting he asked Iran to stop interfering in the Lebanese affairs, but he did not say such a thing,  Velayati was quoted as saying by Iranian state television s website.  Our meeting was not tense or violent at all. These are all lies,  he said. Velayati accused Saudi Arabia of fanning the flames of tension as it  could not tolerate the strategic friendship  between Tehran and Beirut. Hariri s resignation plunged Lebanon into a new political crisis and thrust it into the front line of a regional power play between Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shi ite Iran that has also buffeted Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Bahrain. Velayati said Hariri in their meeting offered to mediate between Iran and Saudi Arabia and he welcomed the offer. Saudi Arabia cut diplomatic ties with Iran in January 2016 after Iranian protesters, angered by the execution of a senior Shi ite cleric by Riyadh, torched the Saudi Embassy in Tehran. Velayati said Tehran hoped Hariri would return to Lebanon and continue as prime minister  if Lebanese laws allow . In a television interview on Sunday, Hariri said he would return to his country within days and held out the possibility he could rescind his resignation if Iran-backed Hezbollah agreed to stay out of regional conflicts such as Yemen. He said he had  talked about the unacceptable Iranian interference in Arab countries  with Velayati in Beirut.  We cannot continue while Iran and a political party are interfering,  Hariri said, in his first public comments since his resignation.  ",worldnews,"November 14, 2017 ",1

Defecting North Korean soldier critical after escape in hail of bullets,"SEOUL (Reuters) - A North Korean soldier is expected to survive critical wounds he received when his old comrades fired a hail of bullets at him as he made a defection dash to South Korea, the South s government and military said on Tuesday. The soldier had on Monday sped toward the border in a  peace village  in the heavily guarded demilitarized zone, in a four-wheel drive vehicle. But when a wheel came loose, he fled on foot as four North Korean soldiers fired about 40 rounds at him, said Suh Wook, chief director of operations at South Korea s Joint Chiefs of Staff, briefing lawmakers.  Until this morning, we heard he had no consciousness and was unable to breathe on his own but his life can be saved,  Suh said. Surgeons had removed five bullets from the soldier s body, leaving two inside, Suh added, to murmurs from lawmakers who said the soldier s escape was  right out of a movie . The soldier took cover behind a South Korean structure in a Joint Security Area (JSA) inside the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas. South Korean and U.S. soldiers, fearing more North Korean fire, later crawled to him to rescue him, the United Nations Command said in a separate statement. North Korea has not said anything about the soldier. Its military had not given any indication of unusual movements on Tuesday, the South s military said. While on average more than 1,000 North Koreans defect to the South every year, most travel via China and it is unusual for a North Korean to cross the land border dividing the two Koreas, which have been in a technical state of war since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.  The U.N. Command, in place since the end of the war, said an investigation into the incident was being conducted. South Korean Defence Minister Song Young-moo said it was the first time North Korean soldiers had fired toward the South s side of the JSA, prompting complaints from some lawmakers that the South s military should have returned fire. Moon Sang-gyun, the South s defense ministry spokesman, said military operations at the JSA were usually conducted under the orders of the U.N. Command, which is in turn under orders from the U.S. military. The soldier, who was not armed, was flown in a U.N. Command helicopter to an operating theater where doctors began working to save him even before he was out of a uniform that indicated he held a lower rank, Suh said. South Korean officials have yet to identify where the soldier came from or what his intentions were. Lee Cook-jong, the surgeon in charge of the soldier s care at the Ajou University Hospital, told reporters he was suffering from critical intestinal damage. Hospital officials where under strict security agency orders not to talk to media and all updates on the soldier had to be through the military, workers there told Reuters. Dr Lee had been  given a talking-to  after a brief exchange with the media, the hospital workers said. The U.N. military armistice commission said it had informed the North Korean military that the soldier, who was found about 50 meters (150 feet) south of a Military Demarcation Line, was undergoing surgery for his wounds. Suh said the South had also informed the North on Monday of the soldier and his treatment, via loudspeakers on the border. North Korea has in the past complained that North Korean defectors had been abducted by South Korea, and it has demanded their release.  This month, the North demanded that South Korea return 12 waitresses it said had been kidnapped while working in China in 2016. South Korea said the 12 women, and one man, had chosen to defect to the South. Monday was the first time since 2007 a North Korean soldier had defected across the JSA.

Amnesty says China detains 30 relatives of exiled Uighur leader,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Authorities in China s far western region of Xinjiang have in recent months detained up to 30 relatives of an exiled ethnic Uighur leader, Rebiya Kadeer, rights group Amnesty International said on Tuesday. It was not possible to independently verify the report. Xinjiang, where hundreds have died in recent years in violence between majority Han Chinese and ethnic Uighurs who call Xinjiang home, is under tight security and independent reporting there is difficult. Uighurs are a mostly Muslim people who speak a Turkic language. A Xinjiang government news department official declined to comment, saying she was unaware of the report. China s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Kadeer is a former political prisoner in China accused of leaking state secrets in 1999. She was later allowed to leave on medical grounds and lives in the United States. She is president of the World Uyghur Congress. Amnesty said that among those detained were Kadeer s sisters, brothers, sons, grandchildren and extended relatives.  Some of her relatives have been detained or jailed previously in Xinjiang. The rights group said in an emailed statement that it was unclear when they were taken away, and that they were  presumed  to be held at a so-called education center and risked torture.  These facilities are known to arbitrarily detain Uighurs and other Muslim minorities for 6-12 months or more,  it said.   Forced to study Chinese laws and policies, many of those detained are targeted because they may have been found praying, owning religious books, have traveled abroad, or have family members living abroad,  it said. The Chinese government routinely denies accusations of rights abuses in Xinjiang, though it has admitted a problem with torture of detainees and has pledged to stop mistreatment of prisoners. Xinjiang, on the borders of Central Asia, Afghanistan and Pakistan, is one of China s most sensitive domestic issues and where China says it faces its own war on radical Islam and militancy.  Rights groups and Uighur exiles say the unrest is more a product of Uighur frustration at Chinese controls on their culture and religion. China denies any repression.

At least six killed in Yemen suicide bombing claimed by Islamic State,"ADEN (Reuters) - At least six people were killed on Tuesday when a suicide car bomb ripped through a base used by a local security force in Yemen s southern port city of Aden, residents said, in an attack claimed by Islamic State. Dozens of other people, including civilians, were wounded in the attack, which occurred outside a camp used by a local security force organized by the Saudi-led coalition fighting Yemen s Houthi rebels. Islamist militants have exploited a civil war that began in 92015 to try to expand their influence and gain a foothold in the impoverished country located in the southern Arabian Peninsula, near the world s top oil exporter, Saudi Arabia. Witnesses described a huge explosion that shook the al-Mansoura district in northern Aden, destroying at least one building and shattering windows in others. A plume of smoke rose over the area. Ambulances raced to the scene to evacuate the wounded. Pictures circulating on social media showed several young men in military uniform being carried away. Residents said two suicide bombers carried out the attack. But Islamic state, which claimed responsibility for the attack, said only one bomber was involved and identified him as Abu Hajar al-Adani. The group said Adani targeted the operations room of the  apostate Security Belt , destroying it and killing and wounding all those inside it. Pictures posted on social media showed young men in military uniforms being carried away in bandages. The Security Belt was set up by the United Arab Emirates, a key member of the Saudi-led coalition that has been fighting the Iran-aligned Houthis since they advanced on Aden in 2015, forcing President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to flee to Saudi Arabia. The civil war between the Iran-aligned Houthis and the internationally recognized Hadi government has killed more than 10,000 people and displaced more than two million. The war  drags on with no sign that it will end soon. Tuesday s attack was the second of its kind in Aden this month. On Nov. 5, a car bomber blew himself up at a security checkpoint, killing 15 people and wounding at least 20. Islamic State also claimed responsibility for that assault but provided no evidence it was involved [nL5N1NB0EF]. ",worldnews,"November 14, 2017 ",1

"U.S., Philippines ties back on track as Trump, Duterte make up and bond","MANILA (Reuters) - Mutual praise, warm handshakes and even an impromptu love song at a lavish dinner suggest U.S. President Donald Trump and Philippine leader Rodrigo Duterte want a fresh start after the biggest breakdown in U.S.-Philippine ties in years. Their meeting on Monday during a summit of Asian leaders in Manila was arguably the most anticipated of the three-day event and went off well, with Duterte s aides talking up the rapport the two had, and Trump boasting of his  great relationship  with the similarly mercurial Philippines leader. It came a little over a year after Duterte announced his  separation  from the United States and sought new alliances with China and Russia. Angered by Barack Obama s criticism of his war on drugs, he told the then-U.S. president to  go to hell , shocking American businesses and a Philippine military heavily reliant on the help of the Pentagon. Central to the rapprochement this week was Duterte holding his tongue, and Trump not expressing concern about Duterte s centerpiece policy - the crackdown on drugs that has killed thousands of Filipinos.  Tensions and damage inflicted during the Obama administration has somehow been repaired, looking at the executive relationship, it has essentially been normalized,  said Richard Javad Heydarian, an author and a political science professor at Manila s De La Salle University.  The modus operandi is, Trump doesn t openly criticize Duterte s war on drugs and Duterte tones down his direct attacks on the U.S.  Even with Trump in the White House, Duterte had repeatedly railed at the  hypocrisy  of his country s former colonial ruler. He has accused Washington of treating the Philippines like a dog and said he would not visit the United States, because it was  lousy . But there was none of Duterte s trademark hostility this week and some indications that both countries had taken a calibrated approach to ensure the two leaders hit it off. Contrary to traditional seating protocol for a summit of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), the two were seated next to each other at Sunday s gala dinner. Duterte sang a hit Filipino love song at that event, and joked it was  on the orders of the U.S. commander-in-chief . Although Duterte s fallout with Obama was acrimonious, the fissures between the two long-term allies did not run deep, with joint programs across various sectors largely intact. That included dozens of annual joint military exercises over the past year. This year, the Philippines military relied on U.S. technical support in its biggest-ever urban battle, ending a five-month occupation of a southern city by rebels loyal to Islamic State.  There were no signs of an exodus of American business under Duterte either, with $353 million of investments from the United States recorded in the first eight months of this year, compared to $90 million in the same period in 2016, according to the Philippines central bank. There were conflicting accounts of what was discussed between Trump and Duterte on Monday, however. A White House spokeswoman said human rights was talked about, in the context of the drugs war. Duterte s spokesman, Harry Roque, said that was not the case, although Duterte had explained his anti-drugs campaign to Trump, who nodded and  seemed to be in agreement .   The relationship appears to be very warm and very friendly, getting very candid,  Roque said.  They have similar feelings toward former U.S. President Barack Obama.  Duterte had said last week he would tell Trump to  lay off  if he talked about human rights. But according to a senior White House official, Duterte raised the issue himself.  He had an explanation and he pre-emptively brought it up,  the official said, estimating Duterte did 90 percent of the talking. The two leaders agreed to further strengthen the decades-old defense alliance between them, one that Duterte had previously threatened to abort.  Heydarian, the professor, however said that even with improved ties, Trump would be powerless to stop moves by Duterte to diversify foreign relations beyond the United States to include China and Russia, and tap them for anything from loans and infrastructure to rifles and jeeps.  I don t think that the Trump-Duterte convivial hobnob will ever be enough to change Duterte s strategic orientation,  he said.  We have stopped the hemorrhaging of the alliance, but it will never go back to being special and sacred as it was before Duterte came to power.  ",worldnews,"November 14, 2017 ",1
Taiwan says shut out of U.N. climate talks due to China pressure,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan said its environment minister has been prevented from attending an annual U.N. climate meeting even with credentials as a non-governmental participant due to pressure from China. It represents the latest case of self-ruled Taiwan not being able to take part in an international event because of opposition from China, which objects to the island it claims under its  one-China  stand being accorded anything akin to the status of an independent state. Environmental protection agency minister Lee Ying-yuan had hoped to attend a U.N. climate change meeting in Bonn, Germany, the island s foreign ministry said in a statement late on Monday.  Due to China s interventions, environmental protection minister Lee was unable to enter the UNFCCC meeting,  it said, referring to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. Relations between Beijing and Taipei have nosedived since  Tsai Ing-wen was elected the island s president last year. China believes she wants formal independence for Taiwan, a red line for Beijing. Tsai says she wants to maintain peace with China but will defend Taiwan s democracy and security. Taiwan s foreign ministry spokesman, Andrew H.C. Lee, told a news conference in Taipei the president believed climate change was an important issue and the island would endeavor to take part in international meetings to address it. In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China s position was very clear.  On the matter of Taiwan participating in international events, China s position is very clear; that is, it must comply with the One China principle,  Geng told reporters, without elaborating. Organizers of the event in Bonn where were not immediately available for comment. Since 2009, when Taiwan announced its intention to participate in U.N. climate change meetings, the government has helped officials get credentials for talks as non-governmental observers to attend the international meeting. Taiwan participated last year with a lower-level delegation. Taiwan is not a member of the United Nations, having lost the seat it held in China s name in 1971 when the Communist government in Beijing assumed the position. Under the previous Taiwan administration of the China-friendly President Ma Ying-jeou, Beijing let Taiwan attend some U.N.-related events, including getting observer access at the annual U.N. World Health Assembly meeting in Geneva. This year, Taiwan was shut out of the health assembly, which the island also said was due to China s coercion and threats. China has previously blamed Taiwan for its exclusion from international events, saying it is due to Taipei s refusal to accept the  one China  principle. Nationalist forces, defeated by the Communists, fled to Taiwan at the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. ",worldnews,"November 14, 2017 ",1
Australia should accept New Zealand offer to resettle refugees: UNHCR,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - The U.N. refugee agency on Tuesday urged Australia to accept New Zealand s offer to resettle 150 refugees from an abandoned Australian-run detention center in Papua New Guinea, as about 450 men remain barricaded inside without food or water. The asylum seekers have been holed up inside the center for the past two weeks defying attempts by Australia and Papua New Guinea to close the facility, saying they fear for their safety if moved to transit centers. With many detainees complaining of illness bought about by the unsanitary conditions in the camp, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) urged Australia to allow 150 of them to resettle in New Zealand.  We urge Australia to reconsider this and take up the offer,  Nai Jit Lam, deputy regional representative at the UNHCR told Reuters.  Most of the asylum seekers are from Afghanistan, Iran, Myanmar, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Syria. Australia s  sovereign borders  immigration policy, under which it refuses to allow asylum seekers arriving by boat to reach its shores, has been heavily criticized by the United Nations and human rights groups but has bipartisan political support in Australia. Australia says allowing asylum seekers arriving by boat to reach its shores would only encourage people smugglers in Asia and see more people risk their lives trying to sail to Australia. Two motions introduced in Australia s parliament by the Labor and Green parties, and passed in the upper house on Tuesday, call on Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to approve the New Zealand proposal.  This is a foul and bloody stain on Australia s national conscience,  Greens senator Nick McKim told reporters. Turnbull this month rejected the refugee resettlement offer from his New Zealand counterpart, Jacinda Ardern, preferring instead to work through an existing refugee swap deal he negotiated with former U.S. President Barack Obama last year. Under the U.S. deal, up to 1,250 asylum seekers detained by Australia in Papua New Guinea and Nauru in the South Pacific could be resettled in the United States in return for Australia accepting refugees from Central America. So far, the United States has accepted only 54. Despite Turnbull rejecting the offer, Ardern this week said it remained on the table and she would seek a second meeting with Turnbull to discuss the  unacceptable  situation inside the Manus island detention center. Water and electricity to the center were disconnected two weeks ago after Australian security withdrew and the camp closed on Oct. 31. The camp gad been declared illegal by a Papua New Guinea Court. Papua New Guinea has threatened to forcibly move the men if they remain inside the center. It has set three deadlines but all have passed largely without incident. ",worldnews,"November 14, 2017 ",1
Tokyo governor quits as head of conservative opposition 'Party of Hope',"TOKYO (Reuters) - The governor of the Japanese capital, Tokyo, whose opposition  Party of Hope  came a distant third to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s ruling party in a general election last month, said on Tuesday she would quit as party co-leader.  Governor Yuriko Koike, a former ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) lawmaker sometimes mentioned as a possible first female Japanese premier, launched the party to great fanfare ahead of the Oct. 22 lower house election and absorbed a big chunk of the failed opposition Democratic Party. But despite her bid to create what she called a  reformist, conservative  rival to Abe s LDP, Koike s party won only 51 seats in the 465-member lower house.  That tally was not only dwarfed by the LDP s 283 seats but also lagged the 54 seats taken by the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ), a group hastily formed by liberal-leaning former Democratic Party members. Koike announced her decision at a televised meeting of her party legislators, also attended by Yuichiro Tamaki, who was recently elected as Party of Hope co-president.  I want to step down as party leader and support you all,  she told the meeting.  I want to leave things to President Tamaki.  A media-savvy former TV announcer and veteran lawmaker who served as environment and defense minister, Koike defied the LDP to run for Tokyo governor last year and trounced her ruling-party rival.  She then led her party to a historic victory over the LDP in a July Tokyo assembly poll. But support for the Party of Hope faltered after Koike said she would  exclude  liberal members of the Democratic Party and decided not to seek a seat in parliament herself.  She also confused many voters by seeming to leave open the possibility of a tie-up with the LDP after the general election. Support for the Party of Hope was a mere 3.2 percent against 9.3 percent for the CDPJ and 37.1 percent for the LDP, in an NHK survey released on Monday. Abe has had a bounce in his ratings, a series of public opinion polls published this week indicated, but his support remains below 50 percent.  The NHK survey put support for his cabinet at 46 percent, a seven point rise from a September survey, with the most frequently given reason being  it s better than other cabinets .

"Refugees in Greece demand transfer to Germany, start hunger strike"," (This November 1 story has been corrected to read 25,000 in paragraph 11) By Karolina Tagaris  and Deborah Kyvrikosaios ATHENS (Reuters) - A group of mainly Syrian women and children who have been stranded in Greece pitched tents opposite parliament in Athens on Wednesday in a protest against delays in reuniting with relatives in Germany. Some of the refugees, who say they have been in Greece for over a year, said they had begun a hunger strike.  Our family ties our stronger than your illegal agreements,  read a banner held up by one woman, referring to deals on refugees between European Union nations. Greek media have reported that Greece and Germany informally agreed in May to slow down refugee reunification, stranding families in Greece for months after they fled Syria s civil war. Greece denies this.  What we ve managed to do on family reunification is to have an increase of about 27 percent this year compared with last year, even though we re accused of cutting back family reunification and doing deals to cut back family reunification,  Migration Minister Yannis Mouzalas told reporters. Mouzalas said Greece had assurances from Germany that refugees whose applications have been accepted will eventually go to Germany even if there are delays. He denied that refugees had to pay for their flights.  Applications for asylum, reunification and relocation to other European countries can take months to be processed.  I have not seen my husband, my child, for more than one year and nine months,  said 32-year-old Syrian Dalal Rashou, who has five children, one of whom is in Germany with her husband.  I miss him and every day I am here in Greece I cry. I don t want to stay here, I want to go to my husband  she said. About 60,000 refugees and migrants, mostly Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis, have become stranded in Greece after border closures in the Balkans halted the onward journey many planned to take to central and western Europe. Some 25,000 refugees and migrants have crossed to Greece from Turkey this year - a fraction of the nearly 1 million arrivals in 2015 - but arrivals have picked up in recent months. An average of 214 people arrived each day in September, up from 156 in August, 87 in July and 56 in March, Mouzalas said. The rise has stretched Greek island camps, which are struggling to cope with numbers two to three times their capacity. Most new arrivals are women and children, according to United Nations data. Mouzalas said the government was in talks with local authorities to move refugees and migrants to local accommodation, including hotels, and it also planned to increase the capacity of some facilities.

British PM May pledges to protect Europe from Russian threats,"LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Monday the government would maintain its commitment to protecting Europe after Brexit as she accused Russia of military aggression and meddling in elections.  The prime minister said Britain would continue to provide assistance to states that were victims of aggression.  The UK will remain unconditionally committed to maintaining Europe s security,  May said in a speech at the Guildhall in London s financial district.  The comprehensive new economic partnership we seek will underpin our shared commitment to open economies and free societies in the face of those who seek to undermine them.   The British government is playing one its strongest cards in the Brexit negotiations by offering to put its defense and security assets at the disposal of the EU in the hope of winning concessions on future trading and economic relations. The country has bigger defense budgets than any other EU member state and its diplomatic and intelligence services are among the most extensive in Europe. Its government also argues it is one of the leading EU contributors to a range of security measures, such as data and evidence sharing, extradition measures and to the EU s police agency Europol. May on Monday accused Russia of fomenting violence in eastern Ukraine, of repeatedly violating the national airspace of several European countries, and mounting a campaign of cyber attacks. She also accused Russia of meddling in elections and hacking the Danish defense ministry, the German parliament and its state-media of planting fake stories and photo-shopped images in an attempt to undermine western institutions. May said the government is working to reform NATO so it is better placed to counter Russian hostility and has stepped up military and economic support to Ukraine.  We will take the necessary actions to counter Russian activity,  she said. May also said she wanted better relations with Russia if it worked to promote peace.   Russia can, and I hope one day will, choose this different path,  she said.  But for as long as Russia does not, we will act together to protect our interests and the international order on which they depend.  ",worldnews,"November 13, 2017 ",1
Arab countries in row with Qatar are not interested in solution: Emir,"DOHA (Reuters) - Qatar s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani said on Tuesday that Arab states that had imposed sanctions on his country in June over allegations of supporting terrorism were not interested in a solution to the crisis. Speaking to members of the Gulf Arab state s Shoura Council, Tamim said his government was preparing for elections to the consultative body. The necessary legislation would be ready in 2018. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain cut diplomatic and trade links with Qatar on June 5, accusing Doha of financing terrorism and cozying up to their arch-rival Iran. Qatar denies the charges.  We express our readiness for a compromise within the framework of a dialogue based on mutual respect for sovereignty and common obligations, but on the other hand we recognize that the indicators that come from the blockade states show they do not want to reach a solution,  Tamim said. The four countries have  put pressure and published rumors and fabrications  against Qatar hosting the World Cup in 2022. Tamim, who assumed office in 2013 after his father stepped down, also said his government was currently working on the instruments needed for elections, which he said would be ready in 2018. Plans for elections to the 45-member body originally envisaged for 2013 were never carried out. In his speech, Tamim also said his government was focusing on completing strategic projects to help the country cope with the sanctions imposed by its neighbors, including ports, water and food security, and to encourage investments.

Mongolian sumo champ apologizes after media reports beer bottle assault on fellow wrestler,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Mongolian sumo grand champion Harumafuji on Tuesday apologized for injuring a fellow wrestler who media said suffered a fractured skull after being hit with a beer bottle in the latest scandal to engulf the closed, hierarchical sumo society.  Harumafuji, 33, hit Takanoiwa on the head last month at a party of sumo wrestlers from Mongolia, public broadcaster NHK quoted unnamed sources affiliated with the Japan Sumo Association as saying. Takanoiwa, 27, is not taking part in the 15-day tournament that started on Sunday in Fukuoka, western Japan, due to the fracture, concussion and several other injuries, according to the association s Twitter entry. Takanoiwa told the association it would take two weeks for the injuries to heal, NHK and other media said. The association said Harumafuji would sit out the tournament and that it was looking into the matter.  As for Takanoiwa s injuries, I apologize deeply for causing trouble for stable master Takanohana, people affiliated with Takanohana stable, the Sumo Association and my stable master,  NHK showed Harumafuji telling reporters. He declined to give details of the assault, NHK said.   Takanoiwa belongs to a stable led by former grand champion Takanohana. The stable master has already reported the incident to police, Kyodo news agency said. It was not immediately clear if Harumafuji would be charged.   No one was available for comment at Harumafuji s or Takanoiwa s stable.        In 2010, former stable master Tokitsukaze was sentenced to fives years in prison for instructing seniors to beat up a novice 17-year-old wrestler. The same year, grand champion Asashoryu, also from Mongolia, retired from the ancient sport following a probe into reports of a drunken scuffle in Tokyo. ",worldnews,"November 14, 2017 ",1
Nepal scraps $2.5 billion hydropower plant deal with Chinese company,"KATHMANDU (Reuters) - Nepal has scrapped a $2.5 billion deal with China Gezhouba Group Corporation to build the country s biggest hydropower plant, citing lapses in the award process, the energy minister said.  The cabinet has canceled the irregular ... agreement with Gezhouba Group to build the Budhi Gandaki hydroelectric project,  Energy Minister Kamal Thapa, who is also the country s deputy prime minister, said on Monday in a twitter post in Nepali after a cabinet meeting. He did not give further details. Nepal s rivers, cascading from the snow-capped Himalayas, have vast, untapped potential for hydropower generation, but a lack of funds and technology has made Nepal lean on neighbor India to meet annual demand of 1,400 megawatts (MW). In June, a Maoist-dominated coalition government awarded a contract to China Gezhouba Group Corporation to build a 1,200 MW  plant on the Budhi Gandaki river, about 50 km (32 miles) west of Kathmandu, to address acute power shortages. Critics say the $2.5 billion project was handed to the Chinese company without any competitive bidding, which is required by law, and a parliamentary panel asked the government that succeeded the Maoist-led coalition to scrap the deal. Speaking in Beijing on Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said he was unaware of the reports but said China maintained very good relations with Nepal and enjoyed cooperation in many areas and projects. Gezhouba did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment and did not answer telephone calls. China and India jostle for influence with aid and investment in infrastructure projects in Nepal. Kathmandu has cleared a 750 MW project to be built on the West Seti River in the western part of the country by China s state-owned Three Gorges International Corp. It has also permitted two Indian companies - GMR Group and Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam Limited - to build one hydropower plant each, both capable of generating 900 MW of power each, mainly to be exported to India.

"Afghans believe country headed in wrong direction, but optimism rising slightly: survey","KABUL (Reuters) - More than 60 percent of Afghans still believe the country is headed in the wrong direction, but signs of better governance and rebuilding has slightly lifted the national mood, according to a survey by the Asia Foundation. Just over half of the 10,000 people surveyed said they had confidence in President Ashraf Ghani s government, which has struggled to establish security in the face of a growing Taliban insurgency. Last year, just under half of Afghans said they had confidence in Ghani. However, nearly 39 percent of those surveyed said they would be willing to leave if they had the opportunity, the second highest figure in the survey s more than decade-long history. The main reason was increased security concerns. More than 70 percent of Afghans fear for their personal safety. Attacks are up across the country. In May, more than 150 people were killed by a blast in Kabul s diplomatic zone - one of the deadliest since the Taliban s ouster in 2001. On the day the survey was released, more than 20 policemen were killed in fighting with Taliban insurgents in the southern province of Kandahar. The survey which was conducted in all 34 provinces of Afghanistan in July, primarily in rural households, pointed to a mixed picture, with steady gains in education and health over the past decade and a half matched by continuing concern over corruption, unemployment and security. Around a third of Afghans, or 33 percent, believe the country was heading in a positive direction, up slightly from 29.3 percent last year to buck a years-long declining trend.  After a historic decline in 2016, confidence in public institutions has slightly improved; growing confidence in the Afghan National Security Forces stabilized in 2017,  Abdullah Ahmadzai, Asia Foundation s country representative in Afghanistan said in a statement. The increase in optimism applied across ethnic groups except Uzbeks, who make an important minority in Pashtun- and Tajik-dominated Afghanistan. While there was a slight rise in positive sentiment, it was down significantly from a peak in 2013 before the withdrawal of most foreign forces. Back then nearly 60 percent of Afghans were positive about their future. The survey comes as the United States in August announced a boost in U.S. troops to Afghanistan, which could push optimism higher in the coming months. ",worldnews,"November 14, 2017 ",1
"Trump says has been clear that U.S. open for trade, if fair, reciprocal","MANILA (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he had made clear during his trip to Asia that the United States was open to trading with other countries, but only if conditions were fair for his country. Trade and concern about possible protectionism under Trump s  America First  agenda have come up during his regional visit, which has included stops in Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines.  We ve explained that the United States is open for trade but we want reciprocal, we want fair trade for the United States,  he told reporters in Manila during a summit of Asian leaders, where integrating economies and curbing protectionism has been on the agenda.

"Taliban attack Afghan checkpoints, killing more than 20 police","KANDAHAR, Afghanistan (Reuters) - The Afghan Taliban attacked more than a dozen checkpoints over six hours in the southern province of Kandahar, killing 22 police and wounding 15, officials said on Tuesday, as militants killed eight soldiers in the west in a growing insurgency.  Government forces killed 45 insurgents and wounded 35 and none of the police checkpoints was captured in the overnight attacks, officials said.  Our forces resisted until they received reinforcements and air support,  said Zia Durrani, spokesman for Kandahar s police chief.  The Taliban were defeated.     The Taliban told reporters by WhatsApp that they killed 43 police and members of a militia and destroyed 13 armored vehicles. The insurgents often exaggerate battlefield casualties.       The Taliban, fighting to restore Islamic rule after their 2001 ouster by U.S.-led troops, also attacked Bala Boluk, in the western province of Farah, on Tuesday, killing eight soldiers and wounding three, according to the provincial government. The government s control or influence over the country has fallen to just under 60 percent, down six percentage points from last year, according to the United States  Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction.

Australia to introduce safeguards against covert foreign interference,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia said on Tuesday it will introduce reforms by the end of the year to combat foreign interference and covert political influence, which could pose a threat to the economy and political system. The decision to improve safeguards follows a review of Australia s espionage and foreign interference laws and will include legislation to ban foreign political donations, Attorney-General George Brandis told Parliament.  Espionage and covert foreign interference can cause immense harm to our national sovereignty, to the safety of our people, to our economic prosperity, and to the very integrity of Australian democracy,  Brandis said. Policies modeled in part on the U.S. Foreign Agents Registration Act, requiring individuals or institutions to make a declaration if acting on behalf of a foreign power to influence the political processes, would also be introduced, he said. While Brandis did not mention any countries targeted by the legislation, there has been growing concern about China extending its influence. In June, Australian Broadcasting Corporation and Fairfax Media, publisher of the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age newspapers, reported there had been a concerted campaign by China and its proxies to  infiltrate  the Australian political process and institutions to promote their interests. China dismissed the accusation as  totally unfounded and irresponsible .  This week, one of Australia s largest independent publishers said it decided to delay the publication of a book that alleges widespread Chinese government influence in Australian institutions due to legal concerns.

"Strong earthquake hits Iraq and Iran, killing more than 450","ANKARA/BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Thousands of homeless Iranians huddled against the cold late on Monday, a day after at least 450 people were killed in Iran s deadliest earthquake in more than a decade, state TV said. Rescue teams kept up search operations for dozens trapped beneath the rubble of collapsed houses in towns and villages in the mountainous area of the western province of Kermanshah that borders Iraq.   Iran s English-language Press TV said more than 450 people were killed and 7,000 were injured when the magnitude 7.3 earthquake jolted the country on Sunday. Local officials expected the death toll to climb as search and rescue teams reached remote areas of Iran.  The quake was felt in several provinces of Iran but the hardest hit province was Kermanshah. More than 300 of the victims were in Sarpol-e Zahab county in that province, about 15 km (10 miles) from the Iraq border.  Iranian state television said the quake had caused heavy damage in some villages where houses were made of earthen bricks. The quake also triggered landslides that hindered rescue efforts, officials told state television.  At least 14 provinces in Iran had been affected, Iranian media reported. Iranian media reported that a woman and her baby were pulled out alive from the rubble on Monday in Sarpol-e Zahab, the worst hit area with a population of 85,000. Relief workers said while much aid had been pledged, there was an immediate need for blankets, children s clothes, medicine and large cans to store drinking water. TV aired footage of some people weeping next to corpses shrouded in blankets. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei offered his condolences on Monday, urging all government agencies to do all they could to help those affected. State TV appealed for blood donations. The government announced one day mourning on Tuesday.  Tempers frayed in the quake-hit area as the search went on for survivors amidst the twisted rubble of collapsed buildings. State TV aired footage of damaged buildings, vehicles under rubble and wounded people wrapped in blankets.  We need a shelter,  a middle-aged man in Sarpol-e Zahab told state TV.  Where is the aid? Where is the help?  His family could not spend another night outside in cold weather, he said.     An Iraqi meteorology official put the quake s magnitude at 6.5, with the epicenter in Penjwin in Iraq s Sulaimaniyah province in the Kurdistan region, close to the main border crossing with Iran. Kurdish health officials said at least six people were killed in Iraq and at least 68 injured, adding that in northern Iraq Kurdish districts seven were killed and 325 wounded. Iraq s health and local officials said the worst-hit area was Darbandikham district, near the border with Iran, where at least 10 houses had collapsed and the district s only hospital was severely damaged.  The situation there is very critical,  Kurdish Health Minister Rekawt Hama Rasheed told Reuters. The district s main hospital was damaged and had no power, Rasheed said, so the injured were taken to Sulaimaniyah for treatment. Homes and buildings had extensive structural damage, he said.  The quake was felt as far south as Baghdad, where many residents rushed from their houses and tall buildings when tremors shook the Iraqi capital.  I was sitting with my kids having dinner and suddenly the building was just dancing in the air,  said Majida Ameer. who ran out of her building with her three children.   I thought at first that it was a huge bomb. But then I heard everyone around me screaming:  Earthquake!  An Iranian local official told state TV that some villages were totally destroyed.   I lost nine members of my family ... they were killed while they slept,  a weeping middle-aged woman told state TV.      Local officials said hundreds of critically wounded people had been transferred to other provinces as Kermanshah s main hospital had been badly damaged.  Iran sits astride major fault lines and is prone to frequent tremors. A magnitude 6.6 quake on Dec. 26, 2003, devastated the historic city of Bam, 1,000 km southeast of Tehran, killing about 31,000 people. Electricity and water was cut off in several Iranian and Iraqi cities, and fears of aftershocks sent thousands of people in both countries out onto the streets and parks in cold weather. Across the area, rescue workers and special teams using sniffer dogs and heat sensors searched wreckage. Blocked roads made it hard for rescue workers to reach some remote villages.  Iranian authorities acknowledged the relief effort was still slow and patchy. More than 70,000 people needed emergency shelter, the head of Iranian Red Crescent said. Hojjat Gharibian, one of hundreds of homeless Iranian survivors, was huddled against the cold with his family in Qasr-e Shirin.   My two children were sleeping when the house started to collapse because of the quake. I took them and ran to the street. We spent hours in the street until aid workers moved us into a school building,  Gharibian told Reuters by telephone.   Iran s police, Revolutionary Guards and Basij militia forces were sent to quake-hit areas overnight, state TV reported. Aid workers handed out water to people, while bulldozers worked to clear the streets in damaged areas.  A local official said aftershocks slowed down erecting tents for homeless people but electricity had been restored in most of the quake-hit areas.    The main problem is sheltering people at this cold weather. We need more tents,  Qasr-e Shririn governor Faramarz Akbari told TV.          ",worldnews,"November 12, 2017 ",1
Exclusive: Kremlin tells companies to deliver good news,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin wants good news.  The Russian leadership has told major companies to supply it with news stories that put its stewardship of the country in a positive light, according to documents seen by Reuters.  A seven-page document spelled out the kind of articles required, with a focus on new jobs, scientific achievements and new infrastructure, especially those involving state support. It also detailed how the stories should be presented, and gave a weekly deadline for submissions.  The instructions were sent last month by the energy ministry to 45 companies in Russia s energy and utilities sector including Rosneft, Lukoil and Novatek, according to a second document, a list of recipients. The drive coincides with the run-up to a presidential election in March next year when President Vladimir Putin needs a strong mandate with high turnout to maintain his firm grip on power after dominating Russian politics for two decades.  Life for the majority of people has become calmer, more comfortable, more attractive. But many such examples often escape the media s attention,  said the first document.  Our task, through a creative and painstaking approach, is to select such topics and subjects and offer them to the media.  That document, which did not mention the election, said the news items to be supplied were to feed a  positive news wire  and should correspond to two themes:  Life is getting better  and  How things were; how they are now . Both documents were attached to an invitation, dated Oct. 9, sent by the energy ministry to senior executives in the public relations and government relations departments of the firms, of which 17 are state-controlled and 28 privately-held. The invitation requested they send representatives to an Oct. 12 meeting at the ministry in Moscow to discuss how to help the government s PR effort.  Reuters saw a copy of the invitation and spoke to three executives who received it. According to the invitation, the news initiative was requested by Sergei Kiriyenko, the first deputy chief of staff in the presidential administration.  A spokesman for Kiriyenko did not respond to a request for comment. The energy ministry also did not respond, nor did Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov.  Reuters sent requests for comment to the biggest five companies out of the 45, by market value - state-owned oil major Rosneft, state-owned gas giant Gazprom, private oil companies Lukoil and Surgutneftegaz, and private gas firm Novatek. No responses were received.  NINE-POINT LIST Oil and gas provide Russia s biggest source of revenue and energy firms are among the most powerful companies and biggest employers. Reuters has not found evidence that similar instructions were sent to companies in other sectors. The Oct. 12 meeting was chaired by Deputy Energy Minister Anton Inyutsyn, and an official from the presidential administration was also present, according to one of the sources who attended. The two officials went through and explained the instructions laid out in the seven-page document, said the source, who added that the election was not mentioned. Reuters reported in February that the ministry had enlisted energy companies to give it advance notice about developments that could influence public opinion. The meeting last month and the guidelines circulated in preparation for it show that, since then, the initiative has stepped up into a higher gear, with companies being handed highly specific instructions on how they are expected to help. It was not clear if the companies had acted on the instructions.   The news guidelines document said the government wanted to highlight  victories and achievements .  It included a nine-point list of the kind of news that companies should supply. It asked, for example, for stories about business units  where it s possible to say that state support helped lift them out of crisis, restored modern production, and re-equipped them with new equipment and gave work to local residents . Examples given of the kind of events of interest to the government from elsewhere in the corporate world included state lender Sberbank hiring 700 people in the Volga river city of Togliatti, a festival funded by a company in Kaliningrad region for young people with hearing difficulties and a sports center being opened in Cherkessk, southern Russia. The document also held up the case of Yevgeny Kosmin as an example of a positive news story, a miner in western Siberia whose team extracted 1.6 million tonnes of coal in July this year, a monthly record. That carried echoes of Alexey Stakhanov, a miner who in 1935  extracted almost 15 times more coal during a shift than his quota required. Communist propaganda held Stakhanov up as a symbol of Soviet industrial prowess.  The instructions stipulated that companies should submit positive news stories every week - on the Monday, or Tuesday morning at the latest.  They said the companies should present their items in the format of a table, with new additions highlighted in a colored font, and accompanied by a press release that could be passed on to journalists with minimal editing from government officials. The document also required each company to provide a contact person who could provide extra information to journalists, tell TV news crews how to reach the venue to report on an event, and organize access for news crews to the company s sites. Reuters was not able to establish if the Kremlin had made similarly specific demands of companies in the past.  Putin has not yet declared his intention to seek re-election. Most Kremlin observers say he will. Opinion polls show he will win comfortably, with many voters crediting him with restoring national pride. The Kremlin s biggest headache with the election, scheduled for next March, is ensuring a strong turnout, say many political analysts.  With the economy weak and many people viewing the result as a foregone conclusion, voters may be tempted to stay away from polling stations. A low turnout could undermine Putin s legitimacy in his next term, the analysts say.  ",worldnews,"November 14, 2017 ",1

Freeport Indonesia closes mine access road again after shooting,"TIMIKA, Indonesia (Reuters) - The Indonesian unit of Freeport-McMoRan Inc closed the main access road to its giant copper mine in the eastern province of Papua on Tuesday for the second time in three days after another shooting incident. A Freeport vehicle was hit by gunfire while it was heading from Tembagapura to Ridge Camp, the company said in a statement, referring to an area where Freeport workers live.  One passenger in the vehicle  suffered a bullet wound to his thigh  but was in a stable condition at a local clinic, according to the statement. Security apparatus were on the scene investigating the incident, it said. One source initially described the vehicle as a  patrol car . The Freeport statement said it was a  light armored vehicle .  It is the second time the access road to the Grasberg mine has been closed since Sunday, and follows a string of shooting incidents since mid-August that have injured at least seven people and killed one police officer.  The violence has escalated security concerns around the mine to their highest level in more than five years.  The separatist West Papua National Liberation Army (TPN-OPM), a group linked to the Free Papua Movement, has said it is at war with police, military and Freeport. It was not immediately clear if TPN-OPM were behind the latest shootings.  ",worldnews,"November 14, 2017 ",1
Top U.S. negotiator arrives in South Korea amid hopes for easing tensions,"SEOUL (Reuters) - The United States  top negotiator with North Korea arrived in South Korea on Tuesday, a visit that comes as hopes rise for an easing of tensions on the peninsula in the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump s visit and a lull in missile testing. Special Representative for North Korea Policy Joseph Yun will meet with South Korean and international officials, according to the U.S. State Department, although there is no indication his visit will include talks with the North. Seoul s foreign ministry said Yun is scheduled for talks with his South Korean counterpart Lee Do-hoon on Friday on the sidelines of an international conference on disarmament, jointly hosted by the ministry and the United Nations on the resort island of Jeju.  South Korea-born Yun has been at the heart of reported direct diplomacy in recent months with Kim Jong Un s regime in North Korea, which accelerated its program of nuclear and missile testing earlier this year. Using the so-called  New York channel,  he has been in contact with diplomats at Pyongyang s United Nations mission, a senior State Department official told Reuters in early November. Even as Trump called talks a waste of time, Yun has quietly tried to lower the temperature in a dangerous nuclear stand-off in which each side shows little interest in compromise. In a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations on Oct. 30, Yun reportedly said that if the North halts nuclear and missile tests for about 60 days, it would be a sign that Washington needs to seek a restart of dialogue with Pyongyang.  After several months of unprecedented testing earlier this year, North Korea has not fired a rocket or tested a nuclear weapon since it launched a ballistic missile over Japan on Sept. 15. Some analysts say it is too early to read much into the break in testing, which is the longest lull so far this year, but could align with seasonal cycles. And there is no sign that the behind-the-scenes communications have improved a relationship vexed by North Korea s nuclear and missile tests as well as Trump s heated statements.     During his visit to Seoul last week, Trump warned North Korea he was prepared to use the full range of U.S. military power to stop any attack, but in a more conciliatory appeal than ever before he urged Pyongyang to  make a deal  to end the nuclear standoff. Trump also urged North Korea to  do the right thing  and added that:  I do see some movement , though he declined to elaborate. While his comments seemed to reassure many in South Korea, North Korea s foreign ministry called Trump a  destroyer of the world peace and stability,  and said his  reckless remarks  only made the regime more committed to building up its nuclear force.   Trump muddied the water later on his Asia visit by Tweeting that North Korean leader Kim had insulted him by calling him  old  and said he would never call Kim  short and fat . He also said  it would be very, very nice  if he and Kim became friends.  It is indeed noteworthy that the President, at several junctures, seemed to open the door to negotiations with North Korea,  said David Pressman, a partner at the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner who helped lead North Korea sanctions negotiations as ambassador to the United Nations under former President Barack Obama.  However, it is entirely unclear if the President s suggestions are reflective of a strategic shift or merely reflective of what the last person he happened to speak with about North Korea said before the President made those comments.

"Russia, U.S. stalemate over Syria chemical weapons inquiry","UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Russia said on Monday it was talking to the United States about the U.N. Security Council renewing an international inquiry into chemical weapons attacks in Syria, but Washington countered that Moscow had refused to engage on a U.S.-drafted resolution. The mandate for the joint inquiry by the U.N. and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which has found the Syrian government used the banned nerve agent sarin in an April 4 attack, expires on Friday. Russia vetoed an initial U.S. bid to renew the joint  investigation on Oct. 24, saying it wanted to wait for the release of the latest investigation s report two days later. It has since proposed its own rival draft resolution.  We are talking to the U.S., it s not over yet,  Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told reporters on Monday.  The inquiry s report found the Syrian government was responsible for the April 4 attack using sarin in the opposition-held town of Khan Sheikhoun, killing dozens of people. The Syrian government has denied using chemical weapons.  Russia has refused to engage on our draft resolution   which the vast majority of council members agree is the most viable text   in spite of our multiple attempts to consider Russian concerns,  a spokesman for the U.S. mission to the United Nations said on Monday.   A resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by Russia, China, the United States, Britain and France to pass. The council unanimously created the inquiry, known as the Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM), in 2015 and renewed it in 2016.  It is important that the JIM is renewed but on an updated mandate because the systemic errors that we saw with the recent report should be corrected and that s the aim of our resolution,  Nebenzia said.  He added that if the mandate of the inquiry was not renewed,  It may send a bad signal, but the way the investigation has been conducted sends an even worse signal.  The JIM previously found that Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks in 2014 and 2015 and that Islamic State militants used mustard gas.   The draft text Russia put forward without any negotiation is unhelpful, has no support, and cannot be taken seriously,  said the spokesman for the U.S. mission.  Syria agreed to destroy its chemical weapons in 2013 under a deal brokered by Russia and the United States. ",worldnews,"November 14, 2017 ",1
Google broadens takedown of extremist YouTube videos,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc s Google in the last few months has begun  removing from YouTube extremist videos that do not depict violence or preach hate, YouTube said on Monday, a major policy shift as social media companies face increasing pressure from governments. The new policy affects videos that feature people and groups that have been designated as terrorist by the U.S. or British governments but lack the gory violence or hateful speech that were already barred by YouTube. A YouTube spokesperson, who asked not be named for security reasons, confirmed the policy in response to questions. The company would not specify when the policy went into effect.   As YouTube terms already barred  terrorists  from using the  service, the new policy keeps out videos uploaded by others  that militants likely would try to distribute if they could have accounts, according to the spokesperson. Hundreds of videos of slain al Qaeda recruiter Anwar al-Awlaki lecturing on the history of Islam, recorded long before he advocated violence against the United States, were among those removed under the new policy, the spokesperson said. Governments and human rights groups have pressed YouTube for years to crack down on extremist videos. They argue that the propaganda radicalized viewers and contributed to deadly terror attacks. British Home Secretary Amber Rudd amplified the pressure during visits with tech companies in Silicon Valley in July and a speech in Washington, D.C. last week. European Union and U.S. lawmakers this year have threatened consequences for tech companies if concerns are not addressed.  Legislation could resemble a German law approved in June to fine social media companies 50 million euros ($57 million) if hateful postings are not promptly removed. YouTube said discussions with outside experts prompted the new policy, but it was unclear why the company decided to act only recently. In June, the company announced that  inflammatory religious or supremacist content  that did not violate its policies would be allowed with warning labels and a restriction making them ineligible for ad revenue. At the time, Google General Counsel Kent Walker said in a blog post,  We think this strikes the right balance between free expression and access to information without promoting extremely offensive viewpoints.   The latest step goes farther and was praised by critics such as Paul Barrett, deputy director of the New York University Stern Center for Business and Human Rights.  If the terrorist is in the business of recruiting and inciting people to make violent attacks, you ve got to the draw the line  against any of their content, Barrett said.  The new policy does not affect news clips or educational videos about terrorism. But YouTube will not always have an easy time distinguishing, experts said, pointing to tactics such as overlaying extremist commentary on news footage to get around censors. YouTube has resisted imposing more editorial control because it fears making it harder for important videos to get a wide audience, Juniper Downs, YouTube s global director of public policy, told a San Francisco conference sponsored by the Anti-Defamation League on Monday.   We will lose something very valuable if we completely transform the way these platforms work,  she said during a panel discussion. Internet freedom advocates such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation have urged tech companies to be cautious and transparent in responding to government pressure.  YouTube is relying on government lists of terrorists and terrorist groups for enforcement. Content moderators check the listings and make removal decisions after fielding reports from an automated system, users or partner organizations such as the Anti-Defamation League and The Institute for Strategic Dialogue.

"Russia, China, others boycott U.S. meeting at U.N. on Venezuela","UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Russia, China, Egypt and Bolivia boycotted an informal public United Nations Security Council meeting on Venezuela on Monday organized by the United States, saying the 15-member body should not be involved in the situation.  The issue is about meddling with the internal domestic affairs of Venezuela,  Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told reporters, adding that he hoped the country could settle its issues peacefully without any external interference. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told the meeting:  The fact that the (Venezuelan) government would go so far as to try and get people not to show up to a meeting is guilt. And that s unfortunate.  Venezuela is suffering from a harsh economic crisis and President Nicolas Maduro s government has clamped down on the opposition, jailing or otherwise barring from office many dissenting leaders and activists. Dozens of people have died in violence since the opposition began a sustained wave of protests in April. Met by rubber bullets, water cannon and tear gas fired by the National Guard, the protesters say the crisis demands an early presidential election that they are sure Maduro would lose. His popularity has been pounded lower by triple-digit inflation and acute food and medicine shortages.  We received pressure from regional partners not to have this meeting,  Haley said.  This goal is not to degrade anyone. This is not to humiliate a region. This is only to lift up the region.  Uruguay s Deputy U.N. Ambassador Luis Bermudez attended the U.N. meeting, but said his country did not believe the situation in Venezuela was a threat to international peace and security.  Venezuela s U.N. Ambassador Rafael Dario Ramirez spoke to reporters as the meeting was being held, flanked by Nebenzia, Chinese Deputy U.N. Ambassador Wu Haitao and Bolivian U.N. Ambassador Sacha Sergio Llorentty Soliz.   The meeting is a hostile and clearly interfering act of the United States that undermines the principle of sovereignty of a member state of the U.N.,  Ramirez said.  We condemn this act of political manipulation.   European Union foreign ministers approved economic sanctions, including an arms embargo, on Venezuela on Monday, saying regional elections last month marred by reported irregularities had deepened the country s crisis. The United States has also imposed targeted sanctions on top Venezuelan officials. The U.N. Security Council also met behind closed doors in May, at Washington s request, to discuss the crisis in Venezuela. ",worldnews,"November 14, 2017 ",1
U.S. to fight Islamic State in Syria 'as long as they want to fight': Mattis,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. military will fight Islamic State in Syria  as long as they want to fight,  Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Monday, describing a longer-term role for U.S. troops long after the insurgents lose all of the territory they control. As U.S.-backed and Russian-backed forces battle to retake the remaining pockets of Islamic State-held terrain, Mattis said the U.S. military s longer-term objective would be to prevent the return of an  ISIS 2.0.   The enemy hasn t declared that they re done with the area yet, so we ll keep fighting as long as they want to fight,  Mattis said, speaking to reporters at the Pentagon about the future of U.S. operations in Syria. He also stressed the importance of longer-term peace efforts, suggesting U.S. forces aimed to help set the conditions of a diplomatic solution in Syria, now in its seventh year of civil war.  We re not just going to walk away right now before the Geneva process has traction,  he added. U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin affirmed joint efforts to stabilize Syria as its civil war wanes, including with the expansion of a July 7 truce in the southwestern triangle bordering Israel and Jordan. Mattis said he believed the southwestern zone was working, and spoke hopefully about additional areas in the future that might allow for more refugees to return home.  You keep broadening them. Try to (demilitarize) one area then (demilitarize) another and just keep it going, try to do the things that will allow people to return to their homes,  he told reporters at the Pentagon. He declined to enter into specifics about any future zones.  Russia, which has a long-term military garrison in Syria, has said it wants foreign forces to quit the country eventually. Turkey said on Monday the United States had 13 bases in Syria and Russia had five. The U.S-backed Syrian YPG Kurdish militia has said Washington has established seven military bases in areas of northern Syria. The U.S.-led coalition says it does not discuss the location of its forces. One key aim for Washington is to limit Iranian influence in Syria and Iraq, which expanded during the war with Islamic State. ",worldnews,"November 14, 2017 ",1
Venezuela offers chocolates but little else to creditors,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela s socialist government gifted chocolates to creditors on Monday, but offered no firm proposals at a brief meeting in Caracas that left investors without a clear understanding of the government s strategy to renegotiate $60 billion in debt. President Nicolas Maduro confused investors this month with a vow to continue paying Venezuela s crippling debt, while also seeking to restructure and refinance it. Both restructuring and refinancing appear out of the question, however, due to U.S. sanctions against the crisis-stricken nation. A default would compound Venezuela s dire economic crisis. Monday s short and confused meeting, attended by senior Venezuelan officials blacklisted by the United States, gave no clarity on how Maduro would carry out his plan, bondholders and their representatives who participated said afterwards. That means Venezuela remains with the dilemma of whether to continuing paying debt at the expense of an increasingly hungry and sick population, or defaulting on creditors and burning its bridges to the global financial system.  There was no offer, no terms, no strategy, nothing,  said one bondholder, leaving the meeting that lasted a little over half an hour at the  White Palace , departing with a colorful gift-bag containing Venezuelan chocolates and coffee.  But bond prices maintained last week s rally, with one investor saying there was relief the meeting did not include a default announcement. Nearly $300 million in late interest payments on three bonds - PDVSA 2027, Venezuela 2019 and Venezuela 2024 - was also due on Monday after 30-day grace periods ended. But bondholders appeared unconcerned at the delay, which was due in part to increased bank vigilance of Venezuela transactions.   My expectation is that the coupon payments will come through as well,  said Jan Dehn, Head of Research at Ashmore Investment Management.  We know that these delays exist and why they exist.    About 100 investors, including some bondholders from New York and lawyers representing creditors, entered the  White Palace  via a red carpet and were greeted by a poster of Maduro s predecessor Hugo Chavez at the entrance of the meeting room inside. Chief debt negotiators Vice President Tareck El Aissami and Economy Minister Simon Zerpa - on U.S. sanctions lists for drug and corruption charges respectively - attended the meeting for half an hour. They met with some bondholders, while others stayed out of the room on concerns about penalties for dealing with officials sanctioned by Washington. El Aissami told creditors that Deutsche Bank may soon cut off some financial services to Venezuela, participants said. Deutsche declined to comment. He read a statement protesting unfair treatment by global financial institutions, including U.S. President Donald Trump s sanctions aimed at preventing Venezuela from issuing new debt.  Now Maduro can say:  I showed goodwill, the bondholders showed goodwill ... but unfortunately because Uncle Sam is not playing ball we can t (refinance) ,  said Dehn, who did not attend the meeting.  I m not hugely surprised nothing s come out of that meeting.  Separately, the European Union approved economic sanctions and an arms embargo on Venezuela on Monday, although it has yet to name who will be subject to the sanctions. Markets continue to remain optimistic that Venezuela will service its debts, noting it has made close to $2 billion in payments in the past two weeks, albeit delayed.  Bond prices were up across the board on Monday, with the benchmark 2022 notes issued by state oil firm PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] rising 3.3 percentage points.  The economic implosion has already taken a brutal toll on Venezuelans. Citizens are suffering from malnutrition and preventable diseases because they cannot find food and medicine or cannot afford them because of triple-digit inflation.  The sight of poor Venezuelans eating from garbage bags has become a powerful symbol of decay. It contrasts sharply with the era of Chavez, when high oil prices helped fuel state spending. Halting debt service would free up an additional $1.6 billion in hard currency by the end of the year. Those resources could be used to improve supplies of staple goods as Maduro heads into a presidential election expected for 2018. But the strategy could backfire if met with aggressive lawsuits. A default by PDVSA, which issued about half of the country s outstanding bonds, could ensnare the company s foreign assets such as refineries in legal battles - potentially crimping export revenue.

Brazilian minister quits in sign of rift in Temer's coalition,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - One of four ministers representing a centrist Brazilian party in President Michel Temer s government resigned on Monday, underscoring a rift between the embattled leader and one of his most powerful coalition partners.  Bruno Araujo said in a resignation letter that while he respected the autonomy Temer had given him as head of the Ministry of Cities, his Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB) no longer supported him remaining in the position.    An intense internal debate within the PSDB is playing out, with younger lawmakers urging it to abandon the scandal-plagued Temer government and elders countering that support should be maintained to provide the stability for the nation. In late October, however, government sources told Reuters that Temer planned to shuffle his cabinet and to push out PSDB members after a majority of its lawmakers in the lower house of Congress voted to put him on trial on allegations of corruption. Temer managed to avoid a trial. Members of the PSDB have said that while they support the economic reforms of the Temer government, they now consider him to be too fragile a leader to attempt an overhaul of the country s pension system, a move that is viewed as key to plugging the government s budget deficit.  The PSDB also plans to stand its own candidate for the presidential election next October, and many of its members want to distance themselves from the deeply unpopular Temer government to better their chances at the polls.

"Erdogan swipes at Russia, U.S. missions in Syria","ANKARA/SOCHI (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan took swipes at U.S. and Russian interventions in Syria on Monday and said if countries truly believed a military solution was impossible, they should withdraw their troops. Russian President Vladimir Putin and his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump said in a joint statement on Saturday they would continue to fight against Islamic State in Syria, while agreeing that there was no military solution to the country s wider, six-year-old conflict.  I am having trouble understanding these comments,  Erdogan told reporters before flying to Russia for talks with Putin.  If a military solution is out of the question, then those who say this should pull their troops out.   Then a political method should be sought in Syria, ways to head into elections should be examined... We will discuss these with Putin,  he said. After more than four hours of talks with Putin in the southern Russian resort of Sochi, Erdogan said the two leaders had agreed to focus on a political solution to the conflict.  We agreed that the grounds to focus on a political solution (in Syria) have been formed,  he said. Putin said Russia would continue to work on Syria with Turkey and their efforts were yielding results:  The level of violence has definitely been reduced, favorable conditions are being created for the progression of a inter-Syrian dialogue.  Neither leader went into more specific detail. Asked if the two discussed Erdogan s earlier comments, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the talks were about more complex issues which could not be made public, according to RIA news agency. Turkey has been annoyed by both Russian and U.S. missions in Syria. Before his trip to Russia, Erdogan said both Moscow, which backs President Bashar al-Assad, and Washington, which armed Syrian YPG Kurdish forces Ankara sees as allied to separatists fighting in southeastern Turkey, had set up bases.  The United States said it would completely leave Iraq, but it didn t. The world is not stupid, some realities are being told differently and practiced differently,  he said. He said the United States had 13 bases in Syria and Russia had five. The YPG has said Washington has established seven military bases in areas of northern Syria. The U.S.-led coalition says it does not discuss the location of its forces. Russia has been a strong supporter of Assad, whose removal Erdogan has demanded, and Moscow s military intervention two years ago helped turn the conflict in the Syrian president s favor.  Turkish troops have also fought in Syria to halt the advance of Kurdish YPG forces along its frontier.  We attach great importance to the joint steps Turkey and Russia will take on (the) defense industry,  Erdogan said. His remarks follow Turkey s recently completed purchase of Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile systems, a defense deal that Turkey s Western allies see as a snub to the NATO alliance. The weapon cannot be integrated into NATO defenses. Ankara says it is making agreements with the Franco-Italian EUROSAM consortium to develop, produce and use its own sources for air defense system.

"EU readies sanctions on Venezuela, approves arms embargo","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union foreign ministers approved economic sanctions, including an arms embargo, on Venezuela on Monday, saying regional elections last month marred by reported irregularities had deepened the country s crisis. Anxious not to push Caracas any closer to economic and political collapse as debt restructuring talks begin, EU governments held back from targeting any individuals. The bloc instead left names for a later stage to try to persuade President Nicholas Maduro to calm the situation.  Everything we do is aimed at seeking dialogue between the government and the opposition to find a democratic and peaceful solution,  Spain s Foreign Minister Alfonso Dastis told reporters at a meeting with his counterparts where the sanctions decision was made. Venezuelan opposition leaders said last week they would resume efforts to hold a dialogue with Maduro, even though they say he previously used such talks to stall for time instead of implementing serious reform. Over the weekend, Maduro had termed imminent sanctions by the bloc as  stupid.   On Monday, his government said the  illegal  and  absurd  EU measures were a violation of international norms.   The European institutions show their lamentable and shameful subordination to the U.S. government,  it added. Spain has long pushed for sanctions on those close to Maduro, whom Washington accuses of installing a dictatorship and slapped sanctions on in July. But the EU has been divided over whom to target. The arms embargo adds Venezuela to an EU list that includes North Korea and Syria, where European defense companies can no longer do business and to which the sale of any goods deemed as being used for repression are also banned. Britain sold 1.4 million pounds ($1.83 million) worth of arms to Venezuela between May 2010 and March 2017, according to The Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT), which lobbies to end arms sales to repressive governments. In a joint statement, all 28 EU ministers said the legal basis for individual travel bans to the EU and the freezing of any Venezuelan assets in the bloc  will be used in a gradual and flexible manner and can be expanded.  Representatives of Maduro s government were due to meet investors in Caracas on Monday to discuss renegotiating $60 billion in foreign debt. Some EU governments want to give former Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, the EU s main envoy for Venezuela, another chance to try negotiations despite unsuccessful efforts in 2016. But in the statement, ministers said regional elections held in Venezuela on Oct. 15 were a turning point that had hardened the bloc s position, having taken place amid  reported numerous irregularities.   The results appeared to favor Maduro s ruling Socialists, while polls had suggested the opposition would easily win a majority. In the end it won only a handful of governorships, according to the pro-government electoral board. EU ministers will decide whom to target with sanctions at a later stage, but said they would focus on security forces and government ministers and institutions accused of human rights violations and the non-respect of democratic principles or the rule of law. Experts say individual U.S. sanctions spearheaded by U.S. President Donald Trump, while providing strong symbolism, have had little or no impact on Maduro s policies and that oil-sector and financial sanctions may be the only way to force the Venezuelan government to change.

Russia's RT America registers as 'foreign agent' in U.S.,"MOSCOW/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Kremlin-backed television station RT America registered Monday with the U.S. Department of Justice as a  foreign agent  in the United States, the outlet s editor in chief said and the Department of Justice confirmed later in the day. U.S. intelligence agencies said in a report in January that the television station, which broadcasts on cable in the United States, is  Russia s state-run propaganda machine  and that it contributed to the Kremlin s campaign to interfere with last year s presidential election in favor of Republican Party candidate Donald Trump.  After that report, the Department of Justice insisted that RT America comply with registration requirements under the Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA). Under the act, RT will be required to disclose financial information.      Moscow has repeatedly denied the allegations of election meddling and said it views the actions against RT as an unfriendly act. But RT s editor in chief, Margarita Simonyan, said on Monday that it would comply with the demand in order to avoid further legal action by the U.S. government.      Between a criminal case and registration, we chose the latter. We congratulate American freedom of speech and all those who still believe in it,  Simonyan said on Twitter. The Department of Justice confirmed that it received a registration from T&R Productions LLC, which has operated studios for RT, hired and paid U.S.-based employees and produced English-language programming.   Americans have a right to know who is acting in the United States to influence the U.S. government or public on behalf of foreign principals,  said acting Assistant Attorney General Dana Boente.  In October, Twitter announced it would no longer allow advertisements from RT and another Kremlin-backed news organization, citing intelligence that the television station participated in efforts to influence the election. FARA requires foreign governments, political parties and the lobbyists and public relations firms they hire in the United States to register with the Department of Justice. FARA was first passed in 1938 in the lead up to World War Two in an effort to combat German propaganda efforts. Foreign government-owned news organizations, including China Daily, the English-language newspaper owned by China s government, register under FARA. The law applies to companies that are owned or controlled by foreign governments. The United States and Russia are engaged in a back-and-forth over  foreign agent  registration.  Russia s parliament warned on Friday that some U.S. and other foreign media could also be declared  foreign agents  in response to the actions against RT, requiring them to regularly declare full details of their funds, financing and staffing. U.S. government-sponsored Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), CNN and Germany s Deutsche Welle could all be affected by the retaliatory measures, a senior Russian lawmaker said earlier on Monday.   While traveling in Asia, Trump touted the relationship between himself and Russia and posted on Twitter that improved relations with the country would  a good thing, not a bad thing.

"At U.N., North Korea says U.S. to blame for 'worst ever situation'","UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - North Korea complained to the United Nations on Monday about joint military exercises by the United State and South Korea, describing it as  the worst ever situation  because U.S. nuclear war equipment had been deployed ready to strike. In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, seen by Reuters, North Korean U.N. Ambassador Ja Song Nam said the United States was  running amok for war exercises by introducing nuclear war equipment in and around the Korean Peninsula.  Three U.S. aircraft carrier strike groups have been involved in the joint exercise in the Western Pacific in a rare show of force as President Donald Trump visits Asia. The last time three U.S. carrier strike groups exercised together in the Western Pacific was in 2007. South Korea has said the joint drill, due to finish on Tuesday, was in response to North Korean nuclear and missile provocations and to show any such developments by Pyongyang can be repelled with  overwhelming force.  However, Ja said Washington was to blame for escalating tensions and accused the U.N. Security Council of ignoring  the nuclear war exercises of the United States who is hell bent on bringing catastrophic disaster to humanity.  Ja asked Guterres to bring to the attention of the 15-member council - under the rarely used Article 99 of the U.N. Charter -  the danger being posed by the U.S. nuclear war exercises, which are clearly threats to international peace and security.  Tensions have soared between the United States and North Korea following a series of weapons tests by Pyongyang and a string of increasingly bellicose exchanges between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Trump said in a tweet on Sunday that Kim had insulted him by calling him  old  and said he would never call the North Korean leader  short and fat.  The United States has said that all options, including military, are on the table to deal with North Korea, although its preference is for a diplomatic solution. The U.N. Security Council has unanimously ratcheted up sanctions on North Korea over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs since 2006. ",worldnews,"November 13, 2017 ",1
Saudi anti-graft detainees will get due process: Saudi U.N. envoy,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Saudi royal family members, officials and businessmen arrested in an anti-corruption crackdown this month will be granted due process, Saudi Arabia s U.N. Ambassador Abdallah Al-Mouallimi said on Monday. Authorities have detained dozens of top Saudis including billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal in a move widely seen as an attempt by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to neuter any opposition to his lightning ascent to power. Those held face accusations of money laundering, extortion, bribery and exploiting public office for personal gain. A Saudi anti-corruption committee has been given the power to seize companies, funds and other assets ahead of criminal inquiries.   I can assure you there will be due process for anybody who is detained,  Al-Mouallimi told reporters at the United Nations.  When asked how many people had been detained, he said:  I do not have a figure to share with you. This is something that the security authorities will announce in due course.  U.S. President Donald Trump has endorsed the crackdown, saying some of those arrested have been  milking  Saudi Arabia for years, though the State Department has urged Riyadh to carry out prosecutions in a  fair and transparent  manner.  Human Rights Watch has also called on Saudi authorities to  immediately reveal the legal and evidentiary basis for each person s detention and make certain that each person detained can exercise their due process rights .

"South Africa's Zuma again denounces ""monopoly"" white economic power","JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African President Jacob Zuma reiterated a call on Monday for radical reforms to shift the balance of  monopoly  economic power away from whites who dominated under apartheid, saying without such change blacks would stay poor for a long time. He made the remarks, reiterating a staple criticism leveled by his ruling ANC about South Africa s economy, against the backdrop of widespread allegations of corruption against Zuma and his friends, the Indian-born Gupta brothers. Zuma was responding to a question about his role as an enemy of  white capital , during an interview with the ANN7 news network, which was founded by the Guptas. Zuma and the Guptas have denied any wrongdoing.   I don t know why there is a debate in fact. Because there is a monopoly capital and in South Africa it is white ... because of our history, it does have a color. It is white,  Zuma, who steps down as head of the ANC in December but can remain head of state until elections due in 2019, said.  Companies that dominate in the mines, there are not many ... You will find the same companies in charge. That means they are monopolizing the economy and they re not black,  he said. The Chamber of Mines in the world s top platinum producer says that in 2016, 39 percent of the sector was owned by  historically disadvantaged South Africans  - meaning non-whites.   Zuma said the policy of  radical economic transformation,  which has also seen moves to change the constitution to allow for the expropriation of land for redistribution to landless blacks, was needed to  correct the past.   The ANC must follow this policy because if you don t, we are going to stay in poverty, in inequality, for a long time.  The frontrunners to replace Zuma at the helm of the ANC are Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, a trade unionist who amassed a fortune in the world of business, and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, former chair of the African Union and Zuma s ex-wife. Ramaphosa is viewed more favourably by foreign investors, who help cover the country s deficits. Many of them are unsettled by Dlamini-Zuma s calls to radically redistribute wealth and her perceived links to her former husband. In a separate interview on state broadcaster SABC, ANC Secretary General Gwede Mantashe said  state capture is a reality,  referring to allegations that the Guptas and others have undue political influence with access to state resources and contracts under Zuma. Mantashe is regarded as an ally of Ramaphosa with ties that go back to the 1980s when they were involved in the founding of the National Union of Mineworkers. ",worldnews,"November 13, 2017 ",1
UK's Johnson makes fuller apology for remarks on jailed aid worker in Iran,"LONDON (Reuters) - British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson issued a second, fuller apology on Monday for remarks about an Iranian-British aid worker jailed in Iran that critics said might have prompted Iran to extend her prison sentence. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, was sentenced to five years after being convicted by an Iranian court of plotting to overthrow the clerical establishment. She denies the charges. Johnson told a parliamentary committee on Nov. 1 that she had been teaching people journalism before her arrest in April 2016, contradicting her and her employer, who said she had been on holiday visiting her family.  It was my mistake. I should have been clearer. I apologize for the distress and anguish that has been caused to Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her family,  Johnson told lawmakers on Monday.  Our priority now is to do everything we can to get her out of Iran on humanitarian grounds.  On Nov. 7 Johnson said in the course of an exchange with an opposition MP in parliament that  I am sorry if any words of mine have been so taken out of context and so misconstrued as to cause any kind of anxiety for the family.  Opposition British lawmakers had said the remarks could land the aid worker a longer term in jail.  Johnson, whose job has come under pressure over the case, said he would meet Zaghari-Ratcliffe s husband this week, adding that the issue was casting a shadow over relations with Iran.  I shall travel to Iran myself later this year to review the full state of our bilateral relations and to drive home the strength of feeling in this House and in the country at large,  Johnson said. Earlier on Monday, the government said it was considering granting diplomatic protection to Zaghari-Ratcliffe as part of an effort to secure her release from jail. It is unclear how such protection could be offered retrospectively to a dual Iranian-British citizen, or whether such a move could help to secure her release, but a spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said it was one option being considered.   The prime minister has been involved with this case from the outset, she s raised it with the Iranian president on at least two occasions, the entire government is working towards securing her release as quickly as possible,  he said. A legal opinion prepared for the human rights charity Redress on Zaghari-Ratcliffe s case said the British government could grant her diplomatic protection as she is  predominantly  a British citizen who has been denied a fair trial. It is unclear how Tehran would view such a step, which would explicitly make Zaghari-Ratcliffe s fate an issue in state-to-state relations rather than a purely consular case. Zaghari-Ratcliffe s fate become a major political issue in Britain after Johnson made remarks on Nov. 1 that appeared to cast doubt on statements from her employer. The Thomson Reuters Foundation, a charity organization that is independent of Thomson Reuters and operates independently of Reuters News, said she had been on holiday and had not been teaching journalism in Iran.  Iranian state television said Johnson s comments showed Zaghari-Ratcliffe s guilt and that she was involved in spying. Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, said the case had become a bargaining chip for Iran in its relations with Britain, and that it would not be helpful for Johnson to resign.  He has asked to come with Johnson on a trip to Tehran planned for later this year and called for her to be given diplomatic protection.  Nazanin is being held because she is British and is being used as a bargaining chip against the UK, now justified by your words,  he said in an article in the Evening Standard newspaper.  Nazanin is no longer simply a consular case as she has been endangered in a deeper way,  he wrote. He added the uncertainty had affected his wife s health and she had gone to hospital for tests after finding lumps on her breasts, which the specialist thought were benign and stress-related. British ministers have rallied round Johnson but one of his allies, Environment Secretary Michael Gove, was accused of muddying the waters in a television interview on Sunday when he said he did not know what Zaghari-Ratcliffe was doing in Iran.

Brazil resumes murder trial in Samarco mining disaster,"RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - A court in Brazil decided on Monday to resume criminal proceedings, including consideration of murder charges, related to the 2015 Samarco mine disaster, throwing out a challenge from two defendants claiming that evidence was illegally collected. Vale SA and BHP Billiton Ltd, joint owners of the Samarco iron mine, are part of a group that includes 22 people and two other companies that stand accused of crimes related to a tailing dam that burst.  The burst unleashed a torrent of toxic mud that killed 19 people.  The court in the state of Minas Gerais suspended proceedings in July to consider claims from two Samarco executives who alleged that phone data, instant messages and emails were illegally collected outside of the period legally authorized. The judge ruled certain material based on transcripts of corporate emails and chats to be invalid but that it did not impact the validity of telephone surveillance and other evidence, federal prosecutors said in a statement.

"Saudi Arabia to host ""expanded"" Syrian opposition conference","DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia will host what it called an  expanded  conference for the Syrian opposition this month, aiming to unify its position ahead of United Nations-backed peace talks, the state news agency SPA reported on Monday. Saudi Arabia backs a grouping of opposition figures called the High Negotiations Committee (HNC) led by Riyad Hijab, a former Syrian prime minister under Assad. The HNC has represented the Syrian opposition at previous Geneva talks.  A number of other political opposition groups and figures backed by other countries including Russia and Egypt also exist. It was not clear from SPA s statement which Syrian opposition members would participate in the conference.  The kingdom, a leading backer of Syrian rebels, supports an international agreement on the future of Syria but maintains that President Bashar al-Assad should have no role in any transition to bring the war there to an end. Assad, whose Syrian army forces have been backed by Saudi arch-foes Iran and Hezbollah, has made major gains against opposition forces and Islamic State militants.  Based on the policy of the Kingdom in support of the efforts to establish peace and counter terrorism, and in response to the request of the Syrian opposition, an expanded meeting will be held in the city of Riyadh,  SPA said. Talks set for November 22-24 aim  to bring its parties and platforms closer together and unite its negotiating delegation to resume direct negotiations in Geneva under the auspices of the U.N.  Several rounds of U.N. talks in Geneva between the Damascus government and the opposition have made little progress.  ",worldnews,"November 13, 2017 ",1
Macedonia's PM hopes for quick solution to name dispute with Greece,"LJUBLJANA (Reuters) - Macedonia s prime minister said on Monday he hoped Skopje and Athens could soon reach a solution to a decades-long dispute over the former Yugoslav republic s name.  Athens argues that the use of the name Macedonia implies territorial claim over Greece s own northerly region with the same name and has been blocking Skopje s efforts to join NATO and European Union over the issue. But Prime Minister Zoran Zaev said he expected the two sides to move fast to find a solution.   November 21, 20 there will be a first meeting with (U.N. mediator) Matthew Nimetz and I hope we will find a solution rather than postpone it,  Zaev said after meeting his Slovenian counterpart Miro Cerar.  He said he expects Macedonia to start accession talks with the EU next year. The meeting in November will be the first with the U.N. mediator since Zaev took over in June.  The Macedonia name dispute has dragged on for almost 26 years with no clear progress. Athens has previously insisted that Skopje use a compound name such as  New  or  Upper  Macedonia. The former prime minister, nationalist Nikola Gruevski, built his almost decade-long rule on nationalism and had refused to meet Greek demands.  Macedonia, a small ex-Yugoslav republic of about 2 million people, declared independence in 1991 and avoided the violence that accompanied the breakup of Yugoslavia. It was later rocked by an insurgency among its large ethnic Albanian minority that almost tore the country apart in 2001. ",worldnews,"November 13, 2017 ",1

"Zimbabwe's top general ready ""to step in"" to end purge of ousted VP supporters","HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe s top general warned on Monday that the military would not hesitate to step in to end purges against former liberation war fighters in President Robert Mugabe s ruling party after Emmerson Mnangagwa was stripped of his vice president s post. General Constantino Chiwenga, commander of Zimbabwe Defence Forces and a political ally of Mnangagwa who was also expelled from the ruling ZANU-PF, said instability in the party was causing anxiety in Zimbabwe. Chiwenga s statement, read out at a news conference packed with army top brass, comes at a time of a deepening rift within ZANU-PF over who will eventually lead the party after the 93-year-old Mugabe goes.  Mnangagwa s removal provides a boost for Grace Mugabe, the wife of the president, who is supported by the largely youthful G40 faction of ZANU-PF to succeed her husband. Chiwenga said ZANU-PF had been hijacked by people who did not fight in the 1970s liberation war, a clear shot at G40 wing and Grace Mugabe who is a vocal critic of Mnangagwa.       We must remind those behind the current treacherous shenanigans that, when it comes to matters of protecting our revolution, the military will not hesitate to step in,  Chiwenga said in a statement read to reporters at the news conference.  The current purging ... targeting members of the party with a liberation background must stop forthwith,  he said.  Mugabe s 37 years in power has been anchored by support from the military, which has always said it will not back anyone for president who did not fight in the liberation war. But the aging leader has been accusing the generals of taking sides in the succession race.  It is rare for the defense forces to publicly take sides in the affairs of ZANU-PF. When Joice Mujuru, a war veteran and Mugabe s deputy of 10 years, was sacked from the ruling party in 2014, the military remained quiet. Political analysts however say the military stayed quiet then because the beneficiary of Mujuru s downfall was the 75-year-old Mnangagwa, a war veteran. Grace, now poised to become a vice president, did not fight in the liberation war. The party appears split over the succession with the G40 faction supporting Grace and another faction, that includes war veterans, rooting for the ousted Mnangagwa. Chiwenga said ZANU-PF had since 2015 been rocked by infighting, which had afflicted the economy, causing serious cash shortages and soaring prices of basic commodities - rare criticism of those in government by the military. Analysts said if Mugabe responded to Chiwenga s statement, he would be compelled to choose sides between war veterans and the young turks rallying behind his wife.  He is in a corner. He has to declare his allegiance. If he condemns that statement, then he is saying therefore I am for the young turks against the war veterans,  said Eldred Masunugure, a political science lecturer at the University of Zimbabwe.  What we are witnessing is the military saying:  We are willing to intervene if the red line is crossed . It is a warning that the political class in ZANU-PF is about to cross that red line.

Nigeria's Buhari to visit heartland of Biafra secessionists,"ABUJA (Reuters) - President Muhammadu Buhari is to visit southeast Nigeria this week, his spokesman said on Monday, his first trip since taking office to a region formerly known as Biafra.  Calls for secession have become increasingly loud in the last few months in parts of the southeast, where the president is deeply unpopular, prompting Buhari to say he will not allow Nigeria to be divided by separatist groups. A million people died in a 1967-70 civil war over the short-lived Republic of Biafra. Buhari, a 74-year-old former military ruler who took office in May 2015, fought in the war as a young soldier on the government side. The spokesman, Garba Shehu, said the president would, as part of his trip, visit the campaign run by his All Progressive Congress party in the state of Anambra ahead of gubernatorial elections in the next few days.   Mr President will be visiting two southeast states of Ebonyi and Anambra,  said Shehu. He said Buhari would leave the capital, Abuja, on Tuesday morning and return the following day.  Tensions in the region rose following the release on bail of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the region s best known secessionist group, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). The government designated the group as a terrorist organization in September, and deployed troops to the region to crack down on secessionists.  Kanu, who was on bail after being charged with treason, has not been seen since Sept. 14, when IPOB says his home was raided by soldiers. The military has denied raiding Kanu s home and has said it is not holding him.  We are yet to know our leader s whereabouts or that of his parents. (Buhari) is not the type of person any governor should be welcoming to their land,  said an IPOB spokesman in a statement that urged the president to  stay away .  A Nigerian minister in September said secessionists in the southeast were sponsored by the government s political opponents. The government has repeatedly rejected the accusation that Buhari, a Muslim northerner, is opposed to the development of the mostly Christian southeast, where people are mainly from the Igbo ethnic group.  Nigeria s 180 million inhabitants are split roughly equally between Christians and Muslims, and around 250 ethnic groups mostly live peacefully side by side. ",worldnews,"November 13, 2017 ",1
Bob Geldof calls Aung San Suu Kyi 'handmaiden to genocide',"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Irish musician and activist Bob Geldof called Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi  a hand maiden to genocide  on Monday as he returned his Freedom of the City of Dublin award in protest over his fellow recipient s response to the repression of Rohingya Muslims.  I don t want to be on a very select roll of wonderful people with a killer,  Geldof told state broadcaster RTE.      Someone who is at best a handmaiden to genocide and an accomplice to murder.   More than 600,000 Muslims from Myanmar s Rakhine state have fled to refugee camps in Bangladesh after military operations described by the United Nations as ethnic cleansing. Their plight has drawn outrage around the world. But Suu Kyi, long seen as a champion of human rights, has been criticized for failing to speak out against violence. There have been calls for her to be stripped of the Nobel Peace Prize she won in 1991. Suu Kyi was given the Freedom of Dublin in 1999 while she    was held under house arrest by Mayanmar s then military government. She received her award at a reception in Ireland in 2012, two years after her release.  Her association with our city shames us all and we should have no truck with it, even by default. We honored her, now she appals and shames us,  Geldof said in a statement.  The Lord Mayor of Dublin, Micheal Mac Donncha, said the city council had discussed taking away the honor and the matter was still under review. Last month she was stripped of a similar honor by the British university city of Oxford, where she was an undergraduate.  But Mac Donncha, a councillor for the Irish nationalist Sinn Fein party, also criticized Geldof s gesture, saying it was ironic as Geldof held a British knighthood despite  the shameful record of British imperialism across the globe .  The former Boomtown Rats singer was given an honorary knighted in 1986 in recognition of his charity work, including organizing the 1985 Live Aid concert to help those suffering from starvation and disease in Ethiopia. Other foreign recipients of the Freedom of Dublin include John F. Kennedy, Nelson Mandela and Mikhail Gorbachev. Irish rockers U2, who had campaigned for Suu Kyi s release while she was a political prisoner, also voiced disappointment and said her silence was  starting to look a lot like assent .  Who could have predicted that if more than 600,000 people were fleeing from a brutal army for fear of their lives, the woman who many of us believed would have the clearest and loudest voice on the crisis would go quiet,  the band said in a statement.  For these atrocities against the Rohingya people to be happening on her watch blows our minds and breaks our hearts.  The Myanmar military says it launched the crackdown in response to attacks by Rohingya militants. ",worldnews,"November 13, 2017 ",1
Lebanon's president welcomes Hariri's plans to return,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanese President Michel Aoun, who has refused to accept Saad Hariri s resignation as prime minister unless Hariri returns from Saudi Arabia, welcomed comments from Hariri that he plans to come home soon, palace sources and visitors said on Monday. Hariri, who threw Lebanon into political crisis by reading out his resignation on Nov. 4 from Riyadh, gave his first public remarks since then in an interview late on Sunday, saying he planned to return within days. He suggested he could even withdraw his resignation, provided the Shi ite group Hezbollah   allied to Saudi Arabia s regional rival Iran   renounces interference in conflicts across the Middle East. The crisis has thrust tiny Lebanon   where Sunni, Shi ite, Christian and Druze groups with backing from regional powers fought a 1975-1990 civil war   to the forefront of the rivalry between Riyadh and Tehran being played out on battlefields from Syria to Yemen.  Aoun has said he believes Hariri does not have free control over his own movements while in Saudi Arabia, and that this casts doubt on any statements Hariri makes. Nevertheless those close to Aoun said the president welcomed Hariri s comments.  President Aoun expressed his pleasure at Hariri s announcement of his return to Lebanon soon,  a source said. Aoun said that Hariri was  leaving all doors open including rescinding his resignation , according to one of a group of visitors who met Aoun. The visitors declined to be identified while discussing the closed-door conversations. The visitors quoted Aoun as saying that Hariri s remarks showed that the political deal underpinning Lebanon s coalition government   which includes both Hariri s Sunni party and the heavily armed Shi ite movement Hezbollah   still stands. Aoun has been convening high level meetings with Lebanese politicians and diplomats since Hariri stepped down, and the visitors said the president believed that Hariri s comments showed such efforts were working. Nearly 24 hours after Hariri s interview, which appeared on a TV station he owns, Hezbollah had still not commented on his remarks. Hezbollah s allies in Iran said Hariri s remarks gave hope he would return to Lebanon. In his resignation speech Hariri, whose father, also a former prime minister, was killed by a bomb in 2005, said he feared assassination. He said in his interview eight days later that he was free to leave Saudi Arabia but that his movements were also guided by concern for his family s safety. Hariri s Future Movement political party said on Monday it saw his plan to return to Beirut within days as a  good sign  and a step on the road to repairing Lebanon s foreign relations.  In a televised statement, Future Movement lawmaker Ammar Houri said it supported Hariri s statement that Lebanon should stay out of regional conflicts and reject Iran s interference. Saudi Arabia denies that it coerced Hariri into resigning or has kept him from leaving. It has accused Lebanon of declaring war on it because of Hezbollah, and has advised Saudi citizens to leave Lebanon. Hezbollah says it was the Saudis who have declared war on Lebanon. Hariri s comments encouraged a recovery on Monday in Lebanese dollar bonds, which slumped last week. ",worldnews,"November 13, 2017 ",1
EU signs defense pact in decades-long quest,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - France and Germany edged toward achieving a 70-year-old ambition to integrate European defenses on Monday, signing a pact with 21 other EU governments to fund, develop and deploy armed forces after Britain s decision to quit the bloc. First proposed in the 1950s and long resisted by Britain, European defense planning, operations and weapons development now stands its best chance in years as London steps aside and the United States pushes Europe to pay more for its security. Foreign and defense ministers gathered at a signing ceremony in Brussels to represent 23 EU governments joining the pact, paving the way for EU leaders to sign it in December.  Those governments will for the first time legally bind themselves into joint projects as well as pledging to increase defense spending and contribute to rapid deployments.  Today we are taking a historic step,  Germany s Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel told reporters.  We are agreeing on the future cooperation on security and defense issues ... it s really a milestone in European development,  he said. The pact includes all EU governments except Britain, which is leaving the bloc, Denmark, which has opted out of defense matters, Ireland, Portugal and Malta. Traditionally neutral Austria was a late addition to the pact.   Paris originally wanted a vanguard of EU countries to bring money and assets to French-led military missions and projects, while Berlin has sought to be more inclusive, which could reduce effectiveness. Its backers say that if successful, the formal club of 23 members will give the European Union a more coherent role in tackling international crises and end the kind of shortcomings seen in Libya in 2011, when European allies relied on the United States for air power and munitions. Unlike past attempts, the U.S.-led NATO alliance backs the project, aiming to benefit from stronger militaries. The club will be backed by a 5-billion-euro defense fund for buying weapons, a special fund to finance operations and money from the EU s common budget for defense research. Members will also be required to submit national plans and be subject to a review system identifying weak spots in European armies with the goal of plugging those gaps together. Many governments say Russia s seizure of Ukraine s Crimea in 2014 was a turning point, after years of defense spending cuts that left Europe without vital capabilities.   This is a commitment for countries to do better together,  French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said.  It comes at a time of significant tension,  he said, referring indirectly to Russia s rising military reach and Islamic militants who have attacked European cities. Despite an Anglo-French-led EU defense integration effort in 1998, Britain blocked formal collaboration on military matters, wary of the creation of an EU army. Defense integration was revived by France and Germany, with support from Italy and Spain, in a show of unity after Britons voted to leave the EU in June 2016. The EU had struggled in military and humanitarian missions in the Balkans, Libya and in Africa over the past 20 years and were caught off guard by Russia s Crimea annexation. As the EU initiative, known as Permanent Structured Cooperation, has gained momentum, British officials have been pressing for involvement. Britain s aerospace industry and its biggest defense firm BAE Systems (BAES.L) fear losing out, diplomats said.  British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson likened London s support to Gothic architecture, saying:  We are there, like a flying buttress to support the cathedral,  he told reporters.  In a possible compromise, Britain may be able to join in, but only on an exceptional basis if it provides substantial funds and expertise. ",worldnews,"November 13, 2017 ",1
Freeport Indonesia reopens mine access after shootings,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - The Indonesian unit of Freeport-McMoRan Inc has reopened the main supply route to its huge copper mine in Papua, the company said on Monday, after the road was closed on Sunday following a shooting incident in the area.  No one was reported injured when shots were fired at an escort vehicle traveling from the lowlands, but Freeport canceled all convoys along the road on Sunday afternoon while the security situation was assessed.  Freeport Indonesia spokesman Riza Pratama said the temporary closure has had no impact on production at the world s second-biggest copper mine.  The incident was the latest in a string of shootings near the mine since mid-August that have killed one police officer and wounded at least six others. Authorities have declared a state of emergency and stepped up security in the area around Tembagapura village, about 10 km from the mine.  The separatist West Papua National Liberation Army (TPN-OPM), a group linked to the Free Papua Movement, has said it is at war with police, military and Freeport. It was not immediately clear if TPN-OPM was behind Sunday s shooting.  Police in Indonesia s eastern-most province on Sunday said they would issue a notice to an  armed criminal group  that authorities say are occupying villages in Mimika regency, where Freeport s Grasberg mine is located, and demand that rebels surrender their weapons and turn themselves in.  Timika Police chief Victor Mackbon said they were investigating reports that an employee of PT Freeport had been kidnapped by an armed criminal group. Freeport spokesman Pratama said he could not confirm the reports of a kidnapping. He also said he could not confirm police reports that a Freeport excavator had been used by the group to dig up a road to Banti, one of the villages authorities said was occupied by the rebel group.  Freeport is  deeply concerned  about the escalation of violence, Pratama said, adding that the company was working with authorities to ensure the safety of its workers and the local community.  Grasberg workers have become  uneasy  amid the security concerns, union representative Tri Puspital told Reuters, urging police to handle the matter more carefully. Despite a long history of shooting incidents in the region, efforts to end the violence had been  sporadic, and not effective,  Puspital said, but warned that a  hard  approach could further escalation.  Part of the problem is a perception locally that most of the benefits from Grasberg go to the  political elite , he said.  About 200 officers were standing by to secure the area by force if necessary, police officials said.  Papua has had a long-running, and sometimes violent, separatist movement since the province was incorporated into Indonesia after a widely criticized 1969 U.N.-backed referendum.  Foreign journalists have in the past required special permission to report in Papua, and once there, have had security forces restrict their movement and work.  President Joko Widodo has pledged to make the region more accessible to foreign media by inviting reporters on government-sponsored trips, although coverage remains difficult.

France pays tribute to Paris dead two years on,"PARIS (Reuters) - France, still on alert against militant Islamist attacks, paid tribute on Monday to 130 people killed when gunmen and suicide bombers attacked Paris two years ago. Flowers were laid and victims names read out at otherwise silent homage ceremonies in the presence of President Emmanuel Macron at the six sites struck on Nov. 13 2015 in attacks for which the Islamist State group claimed responsibility. Macron, whose government has implemented legislation giving police and intelligence agents wider wiretap, search and arrest powers in an attempt to avert more attacks, was accompanied by other politicians including Francois Hollande, president at the time of the Paris attacks. More than 240 people have died in the past three years in attacks commissioned or inspired by Islamic State, which has urged followers to attack France and other countries involved in military efforts to oust it from swathes of Syria and Iraq. Dozens more have been killed in similar attacks in Europe, primarily in Belgium, Britain, and also in Spain more recently.  The threat level remains high,  Prime Minister Edouard Philippe told public radio station France Inter. The government says 30 planned attacks have been thwarted in the past two years. Police and intelligence services are working flat-out to cope with the challenge of religious radicalization and further attacks. Hundreds of French citizens have left France, a traditionally Roman Catholic country where about one in six people are Muslims, to fight as jihadists for the Islamist State, which declared a caliphate .

Greens hold out on climate in German coalition talks,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Environmental policy dominated negotiations on forming a new German coalition on Monday, as the Greens pushed their would-be partners for a quicker exit from coal power. Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives, who lost seats in last month s election, hope a deal with the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the Greens will keep her in office, but the unlikely partners are far apart on a host of issues. Merkel urged party leaders at the weekend to show more willingness to compromise after three weeks of exploratory talks also failed to paper over differences on transport, immigration and euro zone governance.  What s lying on the table isn t enough for us,  said Greens chairwoman Simone Peter in response to a suggestion by the two other camps that 10 coal-fired power stations be shuttered. The Greens are holding out for carbon dioxide emissions cuts that would require the closing of 20 coal plants. Earlier, a discussion paper seen by Reuters showed that the two more pro-business partners wanted to cut coal power by 3-5 gigawatts by 2020. The ecologists wanted an 8-10 gigawatt cut. Peter told reporters that the Greens disagreed on the size of cuts in carbon dioxide emissions that were needed by 2020. The conservatives and the FDP believed cuts of up to 66 million tonnes were needed by 2020, while the Greens believed cuts of up to 120 million could be needed.

Iran says it does not interfere in Lebanese state affairs: TV,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Iran said on Monday that it does not interfere in Lebanon and that comments on Sunday by Saad al-Hariri, who resigned as Lebanese prime minister nine days ago, gave hope he would soon return to his country, state TV reported. The resignation of the Saudi-allied Hariri s and its aftermath have put Lebanon back to the forefront of the conflict between Shi ite-led Iran and its regional Sunni rival Saudi Arabia.  Riyadh blames Lebanon s Iran-backed Hezbollah for the resignation, accusing it of hijacking Lebanese politics. Tehran has accused Riyadh and its allies of trying to stoke tension in the Middle East. In a television interview on Sunday, Hariri said he would return to Lebanon within days and held out the possibility he could rescind his resignation if Hezbollah agreed to stay out of regional conflicts such as Yemen. The comments were his first in public since he quit from Riyadh on Nov. 4.   Hariri s remarks on Sunday gave small hope of the possibility of his return to Lebanon...Iran does not interfere in Lebanon s affairs,  Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi was quoted as saying by state TV.

"Trump vaunts trade progress, red carpets on 'fruitful' Asia trip","MANILA (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he had made significant progress on trade issues during a fruitful trip across Asia that saw governments roll out red carpets  like nobody has ever seen .  We ve made some very big steps with respect to trade, far bigger than anything you know,  Trump told reporters in Manila on the sidelines of a summit with leaders of Southeast Asian and East Asian nations. He did not give details of his achievements on trade matters during a tour that took him to Japan, South Korea, China and Vietnam before his last leg in the Philippines capital. He said a statement would be issued from the White House on Wednesday about North Korea, and on trade, key issues of a trip he described as fruitful.  It was red carpet like nobody, I think, has probably ever seen,  he said. In Vietnam at the weekend, Trump and leaders of Pacific Rim nations agreed to address  unfair trade practices  and  market- distorting subsidies , a statement that bore the imprint of Trump s efforts to reshape the global trade landscape. His  America First  vision has upset a traditional consensus favoring multinational trade pacts that China now champions. On the sidelines of the Vietnam meeting, 11 countries kept alive a Trans Pacific trade deal whose future was thrown into doubt when Trump withdrew from it in the name of protecting American jobs. Chinese President Xi Jinping told the summit in Vietnam that Asia-Pacific nations must  uphold multilateralism , countering Trump s message that the United States would stay out of trade deals that surrender its sovereignty. Trump, by contrast, blasted the World Trade Organization and multilateral trade deals during his tour. Some analysts expect tougher U.S. action may be imminent to fight trade imbalances with China exacerbated by its state-led economic model.    ",worldnews,"November 13, 2017 ",1
"Weaker than ever, May faces test in UK parliament over Brexit plans","LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May s blueprint for Britain s exit from the European Union faces a crucial test starting on Tuesday, when lawmakers try to win concessions from a weakened leader on the government s legislation to sever ties. It is yet another battle for May after scandals and gaffes that have brought questions about her leadership into the open. As many as 40 of her lawmakers would support a no-confidence motion against her, according to the Sunday Times newspaper. But many sources in her governing Conservative Party say now is not the time to force her out because despite backing Britain remaining in the EU, even if reluctantly, they think she is still the best option to deliver Brexit. That makes the debates over EU withdrawal bill all the more important as a test of her ability to steer through legislation she says is crucial to give companies confidence that the rules will not change when Britain leaves in March 2019. With the power balanced in favor of lawmakers rather than the government after the Conservatives lost their majority in a June election, many - even within the party - will use the debate over coming weeks to put the pressure on.   We have no intention of parliament being a bystander, we are a key participant in this process,  said Hilary Benn, a lawmaker from the opposition Labour Party who is chair of the Brexit parliamentary committee.  In the end we are going to have to vote on the final deal, and the outcome of the election and the balance of votes in the House of Commons now really does bring that home,  he told the Institute for Government thinktank earlier this month.  The public debate in parliament on Tuesday is the first of eight to discuss the bill before it goes on to other legislative stages. The schedule will be determined by the House of Commons  over the course of the debates.  Lawmakers have proposed 186 pages of amendments to the bill, which largely  copy and paste  EU rules and regulations into British law but also, critics say, hand the government wide-ranging powers and cut parliament out of some Brexit planning. The bill is separate from negotiations going on in Brussels, but the EU will want to see how many and which amendments are passed and will regard the showdown as a test of May s strength at home. May is under pressure to make progress with the EU at a summit in December after growing European frustration over Britain s refusal to say how much it thinks it should pay to leave. The amendments include one to stop the government from adopting the so-called Henry VIII powers, named after the 16th century monarch who ruled by proclamation, which allow the government to amend laws being transposed from EU law. Other amendments address criticism that parliament will not get a  meaningful vote  on the deal eventually agreed with the EU, and press the government to enshrine in law the EU protections Britons now enjoy such as workers rights and environmental protections. May s government has taken some of the fire out of the proposed challenges by signaling it is willing to bend on the Henry VIII powers, and on Monday, her Brexit minister David Davis said parliament would be offered a new vote on the final Brexit deal.  The first debate will cover the part of the bill that repeals the 1972 European Communities Act on the retention, conversion and interpretation of existing EU laws, and EU rights.  Getting parliamentary scrutiny is a winner. The government will change position because it doesn t want a defeat,  said one Conservative lawmaker, speaking on condition of anonymity. But other issues, such as the push for a vote in parliament on the EU deal which could force the government back to the negotiating table, or even possibly overturn Brexit, present huge challenges. The debate comes at a new low point for May since she was made prime minister after Britain voted for Brexit last June.  She has lost two ministers in a week, and her foreign minister, Boris Johnson, is under pressure from the opposition to resign over comments about a jailed aid worker in Iran, a case further complicated at the weekend by Gove, his ally.     On Monday, Keir Starmer, the Brexit spokesman for the Labour Party, launched a new bid to derail the withdrawal legislation, saying May s policy to end the jurisdiction of the EU court - the European Court of Justice - was incompatible with her own policy for a smooth transition after Brexit.  Over recent weeks, it has become increasingly clear that you alone do not have the authority to deliver a transitional deal with Europe and to take the necessary steps to protect jobs and the economy,  he wrote in an open letter to May.

UK minister offers parliament new vote on any Brexit deal,"LONDON (Reuters) - British Brexit minister David Davis said on Monday the government would allow parliament the opportunity to debate, scrutinize and vote on any final Brexit agreement, offering a concession to Conservative Party rebels. Prime Minister Theresa May is under pressure to offer a  meaningful vote  on any deal for Britain s departure from the European Union.  Members of her own party are willing to vote against the government to stymie a bill which she says is needed to sever ties with the bloc.  I can now confirm that once we ve reached an agreement we will bring forward a specific piece of primary legislation to implement that agreement,  Davis told parliament.  This also means that parliament will be given time to debate, scrutinize and vote on the final agreement we strike with the European Union. This agreement will only hold if parliament approves it.  May s blueprint for Britain s exit from the EU faces a crucial test starting on Tuesday, when lawmakers will debate the EU withdrawal bill that she says is crucial to give companies confidence that the rules will not change after Brexit. Lawmakers have proposed 186 pages of amendments to the bill, which largely  copy and paste  EU rules and regulations into British law but also, critics say, hand the government wide-ranging powers and cut parliament out of some Brexit planning. Davis said the government would allow parliament the chance to vote on a  withdrawal agreement and implementation bill  once it has secured a Brexit deal with the European Union, which both sides aim to do by late next year.  This confirms that the major policies set out in the withdrawal agreement (with the EU) will be directly implemented into UK law by primary legislation,  he said. Primary legislation means making law by acts of parliament or statute. Some lawmakers welcomed the move, but others said the change in procedure would mean that if Britain failed to negotiate a deal with the EU, parliament would have no say, and that there would not be time for a proper chance to have sway over a deal.  Hasn t he just given the game away on what a sham offer this is? Totally worthless to parliament, essentially trying to buy off people,  Chris Leslie, a member of the opposition Labour Party and a pro-EU campaigner, said. ",worldnews,"November 13, 2017 ",1
London authorities failing people displaced by deadly fire: lawmaker,"LONDON (Reuters) - Hundreds of people displaced by a fire that killed about 80 people in London in June are still living in hotels or friends  houses because of a failure by local authorities to rehouse them, the lawmaker representing the area said on Monday. The 24-storey Grenfell Tower, a social housing block in a deprived area within the wealthy borough of Kensington and Chelsea, was destroyed on June 14 in a blaze that left hundreds bereaved and homeless. A criminal investigation is under way into the causes of the fire, while a separate public inquiry is also going on to establish whether there were failures in planning, construction, maintenance or other aspects of the tower s history.  The council and the government are failing in their duty of care to Grenfell survivors, evacuees and near neighbors every day,  said Emma Dent Coad, a member of parliament from the opposition Labour Party who represents Kensington. In a report on housing and inequality in the borough, she wrote that most children displaced by the fire were still in emergency accommodation five months later even though it was unlawful to keep them in such accommodation for longer than six weeks. The Conservative-run local authority, Kensington and Chelsea Council, denied that the slow pace of re-housing people was due to any failure on its part. A spokesman said the process was tailored to the bereaved and going at their own pace. Of the 206 households from the tower itself and from nearby Grenfell Walk who needed new homes, 28 have moved into permanent homes while 49 have moved into temporary ones, the council said. It said a total of 178 children were still in emergency accommodation, including living with friends, in hotels or in serviced apartments. Dent Coad dismissed the suggestion that any of the families were still in emergency accommodation out of choice. She said she had visited many families and they were all desperate to move into a permanent home. The problem, she said, was that they were not being offered suitable homes.  A lot of people are losing their minds,  Dent Coad said, describing visits to families in cramped hotel rooms where children had nowhere to do their homework and parents broke down in tears when they talked about their situation.

Activists to appeal new South African nuclear plant decision,"CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - Greenpeace Africa and other NGOs intend to appeal against South Africa s decision to grant an environmental permit for a new 4,000 megawatt nuclear plant close to Cape Town, the activists said on Monday. Last month South Africa s department of environmental affairs granted authorization to state-owned power utility Eskom to build the new plant at Duynefontein, close to the continent s only existing nuclear site Koeberg. South Africa s nuclear regulator said in October that an installation site license for the plant would likely be granted in June, despite the finance minister saying construction of a new plant was unaffordable in a stagnant economy facing further credit downgrades.  If this project goes ahead, it will infringe the environmental rights of both present and future generations. This authorization can and must be challenged,  Penny-Jane Cooke, climate and energy campaigner for Greenpeace Africa, said in a statement. South Africa s nuclear plans are shrouded in controversy and uncertainty, with local activists and the media raising concerns about transparency and costs as well as safety and environmental risks at a time when Pretoria is trying to reduce the economy s heavy reliance on coal power. Nuclear reactor makers including Rosatom, South Korea s Kepco, France s EDF and Areva, Toshiba-owned Westinghouse and China s CGN are eyeing the South African project, which could be worth tens of billions of dollars.

Tanzania investigates ex-minister days after he joins opposition,"DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - Tanzania s tourism minister ordered a corruption investigation into his predecessor on Monday, just two weeks after the former post-holder quit the ruling party and joined the opposition. Hamisi Kigwangalla, in charge of regulating one of Tanzania s most lucrative sectors, told parliament he had asked the anti-corruption watchdog to look into allegations of abuse of office by Lazaro Nyalandu. Nyalandu took to Twitter to deny any wrongdoing and called the announcement a smear campaign meant to stop anyone else jumping ship. He quit the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi party on Oct 30 and joined the main opposition CHADEMA, citing rights abuses and a weakening of democracy in the east African nation. Rights groups have accused President John Magufuli s government of cracking down on opposition voices, something it denies. Earlier, the government threatened to disband an opposition-controlled municipal council after the body decided to stay in a pro-democracy organization that the country as a whole had left. The northwestern Kigoma Ujiji Municipal Council, run by the relatively small ACT-Wazalendo party, has decided to remain in the Washington-based Open Government Partnership (OGP) despite the central government s withdrawal.  Tanzania joined the OGP in 2011 to promote transparency and accountability in government spending, but withdrew in July, saying it wanted to focus on participation in APRM, a similar peer review system for African governments. At the time it said it wanted to cut down on the time and paperwork involved in taking part in two initiatives.  If they (the council) continue to communicate with OGP as they are doing now, the government will take stern measures ... which may include disbanding the municipal council. Don t force us to go there,  Tanzania s Good Governance Minister, George Mkuchika, said in parliament. The leader of ACT-Wazalendo criticized the announcement.  Forcing it (the municipal council) to withdraw... is unconstitutional because the central government is interfering in the affairs of local government,  he said in a statement.

Netanyahu signals Israel will act with free hand in Syria,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday he has put the United States and Russia on notice that Israel will continue to take military action across the frontier in Syria, even as the two powers try to build up a ceasefire there.   We are controlling our borders, we are protecting our country and we will continue to do so,  Netanyahu said in public remarks to members of his right-wing Likud party in parliament.  I have also informed our friends, firstly in Washington and also our friends in Moscow, that Israel will act in Syria, including in southern Syria, according to our understanding and according to our security needs.  U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday affirmed joint efforts to stabilize Syria as its civil war wanes, including with the expansion of a July 7 truce in the southwestern triangle bordering Israel and Jordan. Israel has been lobbying both leaders to deny Iran, Lebanon s Hezbollah and other Shi ite militias any permanent bases in Syria, and to keep them away from the Golan Heights frontier, as they gain ground while helping Damascus beat back Sunni-led rebels. Netanyahu s remarks echoed those on Sunday by Israel s regional cooperation minister, Tzachi Hanegbi, who sounded circumspect about the ceasefire deal and said Israel has  set red lines and will stand firm on this . Israel s military has said it has carried out around 100 strikes in Syria. Attacks have targeted suspected Hezbollah or Iranian arms depots or have come in retaliation for shelling from the Syrian-held Golan. A U.S. State Department official has said Russia had agreed  to work with the Syrian regime to remove Iranian-backed forces a defined distance  from the Golan Heights frontier with Israel, which captured the plateau in the 1967 Middle East war. The move, according to one Israeli official briefed on the arrangement, is meant to keep rival factions inside Syria away from each other, but it would effectively keep Iranian-linked forces at various distances from the Israel-held Golan as well. Those distances would range from as little as 5-7 kilometers (3-4 miles) and up to around 30 km (18 miles) depending on current rebel positions on the Syrian Golan, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.

U.S. launches media fund for Hungary to aid press freedom,"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - The United States said on Monday it would fund rural media outlets in Hungary to help train and equip journalists in defense of an independent media it sees subject to growing pressure and intimidation. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has increased media control by legal changes, regulatory steps and takeovers of outlets by business sector associates. The moves have alarmed Western partners with the approach of elections, due in April 2018, which he is widely expected to win comfortably. The trend was especially strong in rural Hungary, where government-controlled public media and a handful of outlets friendly to the ruling Fidesz party are the only news sources most people get. That is where the $700,000 U.S. program focuses.  The Department of State... seeks a partner for the United States Government who will help educate journalists and aspiring journalists on how to practise their trade,  a State Department official said in a statement emailed to Reuters.  The United States has publicly and privately expressed our concerns about the status of the free press in Hungary on multiple occasions,  the official said.  Hungary has committed to upholding these standards.  The government had no immediate comment. The program offers technical and financial assistance to media outlets, as well as increased local and international exposure, small grants and other tools. They can use the funds after May 2018. Washington denied entry to top officials of his government on corruption charges in 2014, and Orban ruffled feathers with attacks on the U.S.-chartered Central European University, an issue yet to be resolved. The U.S. Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor launched the program after the top U.S. diplomat in Budapest cited an erosion of media freedoms.  There are still independent and opposition media outlets here that are able to practise journalism with broad editorial freedom,  Charg  d Affaires David Kostelancik said last month at a journalism conference.  That is a good thing.   However, their numbers are dwindling, and they face challenges in the advertising market that the pro-government outlets do not. They face pressure and intimidation... as a result, fewer and fewer Hungarians are exposed to the robust debate and discussion that is so important   in fact fundamental   to a representative democracy.  Foreign Ministry State Secretary Levente Magyar, reacting to those comments, said the government would  continue to reject all statements that affect Hungarian internal affairs and are based on misrepresentation in the strongest possible terms . The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, an intergovernmental human rights and media freedom watchdog, has said media pluralism has declined in Hungary.

Spain sees Russian interference in Catalonia separatist vote,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Madrid believes Russian-based groups used online social media to heavily promote Catalonia s independence referendum last month in an attempt to destabilize Spain, Spanish ministers said on Monday. Spain s defense and foreign ministers said they had evidence that state and private-sector Russian groups, as well as groups in Venezuela, used Twitter, Facebook and other Internet sites to massively publicize the separatist cause and swing public opinion behind it in the run-up to the Oct. 1 referendum. Catalonia s separatist leaders have denied that Russian interference helped them in the vote.  What we know today is that much of this came from Russian territory,  Spanish Defence Minister Maria Dolores de Cospedal said of Russian-based internet support.   These are groups that, public and private, are trying to influence the situation and create instability in Europe,  she told reporters at a meeting of EU foreign and defense ministers in Brussels. Asked if Madrid was certain of the accusations, Spanish  Foreign Minister Alfonso Dastis, also at the meeting, said:  Yes, we have proof.  Dastis said Spain had detected false accounts on social media, half of which were traced back to Russia and another 30 percent to Venezuela, created to amplify the benefits of the separatist cause by re-publishing messages and posts.  Ramon Tremosa, the EU lawmaker for the PDeCat party of Catalan separatist leader Carles Puigdemont, repeated on Monday that Russian interference had played no part in the referendum.  Those that say Russia is helping Catalonia are those that have helped the Russian fleet in recent years, despite the EU s boycott,  Tremosa tweeted, referring to Spanish media reports that Spain was allowing Russian warships to refuel at its  ports. Those who voted in the referendum opted overwhelmingly for independence. But turnout was only about 43 percent as Catalans who favor remaining part of Spain mainly boycotted the ballot. The separatist vote has plunged Spain, the euro zone s fourth-biggest economy, into its worst constitutional crisis since its return to democracy in the 1970s.  Dastis said he had raised the issue with the Kremlin. Moscow has repeatedly denied any such interference and accuses the West of a campaign to discredit Russia. NATO believes Moscow is involved in a deliberately ambiguous strategy of information warfare and disinformation to try to divide the West and break its unity over economic sanctions imposed on Russia following its 2014 annexation of Crimea.  U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in January that Russia interfered in the U.S. election to try to help President Donald Trump defeat rival Hillary Clinton by hacking and releasing emails and spreading propaganda via social media. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who attended the EU meeting in Brussels, declined to comment on Spain s accusations, but the alliance s top commander said last week that Russian interference was a concern.   NATO s Supreme Allied Commander Gen. Curtis Scaparotti said  Russian malign influence  was trying to sway elections and other decisions in the West, describing it as a  destabilization campaign,  although he did not directly address the Catalonia referendum.

German police hunt former RAF guerrillas for suspected robbery,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German police on Monday published videos showing three former members of the Red Army Faction (RAF) militant group taking part in a 2016 armed robbery in northern Germany, and called for public help to track them down. The left-wing militia, which arose out of the student protests of the late 1960s, was suspected of killing 34 people between 1972 and 1991. The group formally disbanded in 1998 with many members slipping back into ordinary lives.  The three former members being sought - two men and a woman aged between 49 and 63 - have been on the run for more than 25 years. Since 2011, they have been suspected of involvement in robberies in which more than 370,000 euros have been stolen from supermarkets and money transfer stores. The new security camera videos from July 2016, show two men strolling into a supermarket in the central city of Hildesheim with their faces covered, before they suddenly raise a gun at one of the employees and force him into a room.  The other video showed the two standing in a bus in Osnabruck, Lower Saxony, carrying bulging backpacks. [goo.gl/7u811o] German police officers have visited more than 4,000 car dealers to trace the suspects, who buy cheap cars weeks before their robberies. A reward of 80,000 euros has been offered to anyone who provides significant information about them. The RAF captured world headlines in 1977 with their kidnapping and killing of industrialist Hanns Martin Schleyer. They hoped to secure the release of guerrilla comrades held in a high security prison in Stuttgart. Twenty years ago, German authorities said they believed most of RAF s members were either dead, in jail or now living  ordinary  lives. ",worldnews,"November 13, 2017 ",1

Trump and Duterte bond at Asia summit; U.S. says discussed rights,"MANILA (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he had a  great relationship  with his Philippine counterpart, Rodrigo Duterte, while a White House official said human rights got only a brief mention when the two met on the sidelines of an Asian summit. A spokesman for Duterte said there was no mention at all of human rights or extrajudicial killings during their conversation.  The meeting between the two presidents was one of the most anticipated at the summit of East and Southeast Asian leaders in Manila, with human rights groups pressing Trump to take a tough line on Duterte over his bloody war on drugs, in which thousands of people have been killed.  The conversation focused on ISIS (Islamic State), illegal drugs, and trade,  said White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders.  Human rights briefly came up in the context of the Philippines  fight against illegal drugs.  Duterte s spokesman, Harry Roque, told a news conference the Philippine president had explained his antidrug policy at length to Trump, who  seemed to be appreciative of his efforts.   There was no mention of human rights, no mention of extralegal killings,  he said. A joint statement released later by the White House listed human rights as the third of 14 topics discussed.  The two sides underscored that human rights and the dignity of human life are essential, and agreed to continue mainstreaming the human rights agenda in their national programs to promote the welfare of all sectors, including the most vulnerable groups,  the statement said. They discussed the Philippine campaign against crime, including illegal drugs, it said, and  committed to share best practices in the areas of prevention; enforcement, including capacity-building and transparency in investigations; and rehabilitation.   More than 3,900 people have been killed in a war on drugs that Duterte declared when he took office last year. His government says the police act in self-defense, but critics say executions are taking place with no accountability.  We are your ally. We are an important ally,  Duterte told Trump at the beginning of their talks, according to reporters allowed in to the meeting room. Trump replied:  We ve had a great relationship. This has been very successful. And the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) conference has been handled beautifully by the president in the Philippines.  Duterte, who has been called the  Trump of the East  for his brash style and provocative language, said last week he would tell the U.S. president to  lay off  if he were to raise accusations of rights violations. Trump was criticized in May for praising Duterte during a phone call for the  great job  he was doing to counter illegal narcotics. The United States and the Philippines, a former U.S. colony, have been strategic allies since World War Two. But their relations have been strained by anti-U.S. outbursts from Duterte and his enthusiasm for better ties with Russia and China. However, Duterte clearly appears to be getting on better with Trump than he did with the American president s predecessor, Barack Obama. Trump and Duterte seem to have warmed to each other after meeting for the first time on Saturday at an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) group meeting in Vietnam. On Sunday, Duterte crooned hit Filipino love song  Ikaw  (You) at a gala dinner for summit leaders in Manila, saying it was on  the orders  of Trump. One of the song s verses, translated from Filipino, begins:  You are the light in my world, a half of this heart of mine .  Ladies and gentlemen, I sang uninvited, upon the orders of the commander in chief of the United States,  Duterte said later, according to the ABS-CBN news channel. Roque described the relationship between Trump and Duterte as  warm, friendly and candid.   It s very apparent that both of them have a person who they consider as not a best friend,  he added.   They have similar feelings toward former U.S. President Barack Obama.   Duterte s anger was unleashed last year when Obama raised concern about possible human rights abuses in the war on drugs. Duterte said Obama could  go to hell  and called him a  son of a bitch.  ",worldnews,"November 13, 2017 ",1
"Factbox: Divided, rebellious UK parliament takes on May's Brexit plan","LONDON (Reuters) - British lawmakers will debate legislation underpinning the government s plan to leave the European Union this week, the latest stage in an arduous journey through parliament. The first two days of debate in the current stage of the process will be held in parliament on Nov. 14 and 15. A total of eight days of debate are planned during this  Committee Stage , used to make changes to the government s proposed wording of the bill. Formally known as the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill, the legislation will then face several more stages of approval in the lower house of parliament, and must also make its way through a multi-stage process in the upper house. Both chambers must agree on the wording before it can become law. What is the bill and what does it do? The legislation serves two main functions: 1. Repealing the 1972 European Communities Act which made Britain a member of the European Communities, forerunner to the European Union. This effectively ends Britain s EU membership. 2. Transferring the existing body of EU law into British law. This is designed to provide legal certainty about the complex process of leaving.  Why is it controversial? The bill has faced criticism from opposition lawmakers, campaign groups and members of May s Conservative Party. Brexit is still divisive in Britain after a referendum in June last year, and many people, including some lawmakers, want to retain as much of the country s current EU membership as possible. Others would like to reverse the vote. May runs a minority government, which has a slim 13-seat working majority in the 650-seat parliament thanks to a deal with a small Northern Irish party.  A rebellion of seven or more Conservative lawmakers could see her lose a vote in parliament and forced into making concessions. The objections are mainly based on two themes: 1. The power for the government to amend EU laws as they are brought onto the British statute book. These are often referred to as  Henry VIII  powers after the 16th century English monarch who ruled by proclamation. The government says it needs to be able to fix the wording of laws to ensure they work correctly after Brexit. For example, where a law refers to an EU institution which will no longer have jurisdiction in Britain, the law must be changed to point to the correct British equivalent.  Critics say the bill gives ministers too much power to make changes, and creates the potential for policy shifts to be implemented without full parliamentary scrutiny. The process through which the government would make the changes already exists and is known as  secondary legislation . It does allow for some degree of scrutiny by lawmakers, but would not submit changes to the full legislative process.  2. The bill does not contain a provision for parliament to vote on the final Brexit deal. The government has promised lawmakers they will get a  meaningful vote  on the outcome of negotiations in Brussels to decide the terms of Britain s exit and its future relationship with the bloc. As it currently stands, this vote will be on whether to accept the terms of the deal, or reject it and walk away without a deal. But critics says the promise of a vote should be written into the bill. Some also say that it should give lawmakers more options than the current  take it or leave it  vote. This could mean an option to send Britain back to the negotiating table. What has happened so far? The bill cleared its first parliamentary hurdle in September when, after two days of debate, lawmakers voted 326 to 290 in favor of the principles of the bill.  Although the government won the vote, several Conservatives indicated they were unhappy with the details of it, and said they wanted to see concessions during the next stage.  What happens next? The first two days of the  Committee Stage  have been scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday but the remaining six days have not yet been scheduled.  Any lawmaker can submit changes for consideration. So far, 186 pages of so-called  amendments  have been submitted. The list will be scrutinized by parliament s deputy speaker, whittled down and grouped according to subject. The amendments to be considered will be announced at the start of each day s debate. The first two days will focus on the part of the bill that repeals the 1972 European Communities Act, the retention, conversion and interpretation of existing EU laws, and EU rights.   At the end of the debate over each group of amendments, some will be put to a vote. If supported by a majority of lawmakers, the changes will be made to the bill. They can still be reversed. Once all the groups of amendments have been debated, the bill is reprinted to include any amendments passed and it moves on to the next stage in the process. Which is ...? The bill will be subject to several more stages of votes in the lower chamber and the upper chamber of parliament. The entire process will take months to complete, and there is no target end date. Report stage:  Any amendments voted by the house at committee stage will pass to report stage. This is a new opportunity to add amendments. The speaker of the house oversees this process. Third reading:  This takes place immediately after report stage. It usually lasts an hour and is a general discussion of the bill followed by a vote. No amendments can be made. House of Lords:  The bill passes to the unelected upper chamber of parliament, the House of Lords. Lords can put forward their own amendments, each of which will be discussed and decided on in turn. If the lords agree to any amendments, the bill passes back to the House of Commons for its approval. Ping Pong: If the bill passes back to the commons, they debate and vote on the lords  amendments. No new amendments can be introduced. In theory the bill can continue passing back and forth between the lords and commons until the final bill is agreed upon. Royal assent: Once the bill has been agreed by both houses of parliament, it is given royal assent, when the queen formally agrees to make the bill into an Act of Parliament.

Iran sticks to key limits of nuclear deal: U.N. watchdog report,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Iran has remained within the main limits on its nuclear activity set by its 2015 deal with six world powers, the U.N. atomic watchdog said in its first report since U.S. President Donald Trump decertified Iranian compliance with the terms. Iran undertook to curb its uranium enrichment program in return for relief from international sanctions that crippled its economy, and U.N. nuclear inspectors have repeatedly verified Tehran s adherence to the key aspects of the accord. Trump has called the agreement between Iran, the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China and the European Union  the worst deal ever  and he disavowed Iran s compliance last month. His decision did not constitute a U.S. exit from the accord but raised concern about its staying power. Trump s move, at odds with the commitment of the other parties to the deal, meant the U.S. Congress must decide by mid-December whether to reimpose economic sanctions lifted under the accord, reached under his predecessor Barack Obama. If Congress reimposes the sanctions, the United States would in effect be in violation of the deal and it would likely fall apart. If lawmakers do nothing, the deal remains in place. In response, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said Tehran will stick to the nuclear accord as long as the other signatories respected it, but would  shred  the deal if Washington pulled out. If the deal unravels, it would strengthen hardline opponents of Hassan Rouhani, Iran s pragmatist president who opened up diplomatic channels to Western powers to enable nuclear diplomacy after years of worsening confrontation. Iran s stock of low-enriched uranium as of Nov. 5 was 96.7 kg (213.2 pounds), well below a 202.8-kg limit set by the deal, and the level of enrichment did not exceed a maximum 3.67 percent cap, said the confidential International Atomic Energy Agency report sent to IAEA member states and seen by Reuters. Iran s stock of so-called heavy water, a moderator used in a type of reactor that can produce plutonium, a potential nuclear bomb fuel, stood at 114.4 metric tonnes, below a 130-tonne limit agreed by the parties to the deal. The 3.67 percent enrichment and 202-kg stockpile limit on uranium, and the 130-tonne cap on heavy water, aim to ensure that Iran does not amass enough material of sufficient fissile purity to produce a nuclear bomb. Such a device requires uranium to be refined to around 90 percent purity. IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano told Reuters in September he would welcome clarification from the powers on how the agency should monitor Iran s implementation of the so-called Section T of the nuclear pact that deals with certain technologies that could be used to develop an atom bomb. Russia had been critical of the agency s monitoring of Section T provisions, but Monday s report said the IAEA had verified Iran s commitment to the section. ",worldnews,"November 13, 2017 ",1
Romanian ruling party leader investigated over 'criminal group',"BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Romanian anti-corruption prosecutors opened an investigation on  Monday into the leader of the ruling Social Democrat Party, Liviu Dragnea, on suspicion of forming a  criminal group  to siphon off cash from state projects, some of them EU-funded.     Dragnea, currently on trial in a separate abuse-of-office case, told reporters he rejected the new charges. Opposition parties called on him to resign as parliament speaker pending the criminal inquiry. Prosecutors said Dragnea was suspected of forming  an organized criminal group  that included public servants and businesspeople in 2001. They said there were suspicions the group was still active.  The investigation focused on road construction firm Tel Drum SA, formerly controlled by the county council of the southern Teleorman region, a body that Dragnea headed until 2012, prosecutors said. Dragnea and eight other people conspired to privatize the company through intermediaries, so that it came under  the influence and control of the suspect Liviu Dragnea,  the prosecutors added. The company won many public contracts, at times without tenders or benefiting from confidential information that helped it beat other bidders, the prosecutors  statement said. Dragnea and people close to him received cash and other assets from it, the statement added. Tel Drum director Petre Pitis, also under investigation, declined to comment as he left a closed-door hearing at the office of anti-corruption prosecuting agency DNA. A company representative told Reuters that an official reaction was not expected on Monday.  The group of nine people was suspected of seeking to  fraudulently obtain important sums from public works contracts funded with domestic and European funds, by committing abuse of office, EU funds fraud, tax evasion, money laundering and accessing confidential information,  the DNA statement read. The case was based on a notice sent by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) in 2016 regarding suspicions that Dragnea and other regional officials had used forged papers to secure EU funds for road rehabilitations, prosecutors said.  I categorically do not feel guilty, I never formed a criminal group,  Dragnea told reporters. The 55-year-old, who got a suspended prison sentence last year for illegally using his influence within the party to sway a 2012 referendum, has dismissed past investigations as politically motivated. Opposition liberal Ioan Cupsa said Dragnea should resign.  Once more, he is making parliament and the image it has with public opinion vulnerable,  he was quoted saying by state news agency Agerpres. Dragnea said he had no intention of stepping aside. Transparency International ranks Romania among the European Union s most corrupt states. Brussels, which keeps Romania s justice system under special monitoring, has praised magistrates for their efforts to curb graft. The ruling Social Democrats are currently preparing a judicial overhaul the European Commission, foreign diplomats and Romania s own president have all said could place the justice system under political control. Thousands of Romanians protested against the overhaul earlier this month. At the start of 2017, attempts by the ruling coalition to weaken anti-corruption legislation triggered the country s biggest protests in decades. ",worldnews,"November 13, 2017 ",1

"Europe, Africa ministers agree to help migrants held in Libya","BERN (Reuters) - European and African ministers agreed on Monday to try to improve conditions for migrants in Libya and seek paths such as scholarships for Africans to reach Europe legally, to cut the death toll from smuggling across the Sahara and Mediterranean. The deadly trek across the desert from sub-Saharan Africa through Libya and over sea to Italy is now the main route used by refugees and other vulnerable migrants heading to Europe, after Turkey closed the other main route via Greece that brought in nearly a million people in 2015. Almost 115,000 migrants have landed on Italian shores so far this year. Almost 2,750 are known to have died while trying to cross the Mediterranean, the U.N. International Organization for Migration said on Friday, and the death toll in the Sahara desert is thought to be at least twice as high. European and African officials say the numbers reaching Europe have finally been falling over the past few months due to better efforts to fight smuggling. But that has also left tens of thousands of migrants trapped in Libya, often detained in conditions rights groups say are dangerous and inhumane. Interior ministers belonging to the  Central Mediterranean contact group  met in Switzerland to discuss the crisis.  While they talked about law enforcement measures to combat smuggling, their final statement focused more on efforts to alleviate the journey s harm. Ministers from Algeria, Austria, Chad, France, Germany, Italy, Libya, Malta, Niger, Slovenia, Switzerland, Tunisia and Mali were among those backing the statement.  We had a very intensive exchange, because the questions we are dealing with are very demanding issues,  Swiss Justice Minister Simonetta Sommaruga said after the meeting.  This is why we concentrated on protecting refugees. We had many people with different viewpoints sitting around the table, but nonetheless, on this point we all agreed.... We want to improve the situation of migrants and refugees, particularly in Libya.  Sommaruga said an improvement in the situation on the central Mediterranean route would be possible only if countries joined together to help stabilize Libya.  The ministers said they would work closely with Libyan authorities to ensure detained migrants and refugees were held with respect for human rights and humanitarian standards, and promised to secure priority release from detention for vulnerable people such as children and victims of torture. They also pledged to create economic alternatives to smuggling, including pilot projects for pathways for Africans to reach Europe legally, such as scholarships and apprenticeships.  We risk this time to be seen as a dark chapter in European history. If we wish to change that situation, we must get together with those states which themselves are very severely affected by migration,  Sommaruga said. ",worldnews,"November 13, 2017 ",1
"Trump meets Japan, Australia leaders over trade, North Korea threat","MANILA (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump raised North Korea s missile tests during talks on Monday with the prime ministers of Japan and Australia, and said  a lot  of progress had been made in negotiations on trade. On the sidelines of a summit of East and Southeast Asian leaders in Manila, Trump met with Japan s Shinzo Abe and Australia s Malcolm Turnbull, and said discussions at the meeting would include tensions on the Korean Peninsula and trade. In brief remarks prior to news media being ushered out of the meeting, Turnbull said North Korea s  recklessness  needed to be stopped, while Abe said the most immediate challenge was to ensure regional peace and stability. Following the meeting, the White House said  the three leaders reaffirmed their commitment to maintaining maximum pressure on North Korea in the effort to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula.   They also discussed expanded security cooperation for enhanced deterrence and defense against North Korean aggression,  the White House said in a statement.   The three men also discussed the need for  free and open  trade in the Indo-Pacific region and  the need to pursue fair and reciprocal trade,  the White House added. Trump, who campaigned heavily on U.S. trade issues, made pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Asian trade deal one of his first acts in office. His administration has instead pledged to reach bilateral pacts with individual nations.  Countries remaining in the pact have said the deal is advancing without the United States.

UK's Johnson makes fuller apology for remarks on jailed aid worker in Iran,"LONDON (Reuters) - British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson issued a second, fuller apology on Monday for remarks about an Iranian-British aid worker jailed in Iran that critics said might have prompted Iran to extend her prison sentence. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, was sentenced to five years after being convicted by an Iranian court of plotting to overthrow the clerical establishment. She denies the charges. Johnson told a parliamentary committee on Nov. 1 that she had been teaching people journalism before her arrest in April 2016, contradicting her and her employer, who said she had been on holiday visiting her family.  It was my mistake. I should have been clearer. I apologize for the distress and anguish that has been caused to Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her family,  Johnson told lawmakers on Monday.  Our priority now is to do everything we can to get her out of Iran on humanitarian grounds.  On Nov. 7 Johnson said in the course of an exchange with an opposition MP in parliament that  I am sorry if any words of mine have been so taken out of context and so misconstrued as to cause any kind of anxiety for the family.  Opposition British lawmakers had said the remarks could land the aid worker a longer term in jail.  Johnson, whose job has come under pressure over the case, said he would meet Zaghari-Ratcliffe s husband this week, adding that the issue was casting a shadow over relations with Iran.  I shall travel to Iran myself later this year to review the full state of our bilateral relations and to drive home the strength of feeling in this House and in the country at large,  Johnson said. Earlier on Monday, the government said it was considering granting diplomatic protection to Zaghari-Ratcliffe as part of an effort to secure her release from jail. It is unclear how such protection could be offered retrospectively to a dual Iranian-British citizen, or whether such a move could help to secure her release, but a spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said it was one option being considered.   The prime minister has been involved with this case from the outset, she s raised it with the Iranian president on at least two occasions, the entire government is working towards securing her release as quickly as possible,  he said. A legal opinion prepared for the human rights charity Redress on Zaghari-Ratcliffe s case said the British government could grant her diplomatic protection as she is  predominantly  a British citizen who has been denied a fair trial. It is unclear how Tehran would view such a step, which would explicitly make Zaghari-Ratcliffe s fate an issue in state-to-state relations rather than a purely consular case. Zaghari-Ratcliffe s fate become a major political issue in Britain after Johnson made remarks on Nov. 1 that appeared to cast doubt on statements from her employer. The Thomson Reuters Foundation, a charity organization that is independent of Thomson Reuters and operates independently of Reuters News, said she had been on holiday and had not been teaching journalism in Iran.  Iranian state television said Johnson s comments showed Zaghari-Ratcliffe s guilt and that she was involved in spying. Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, said the case had become a bargaining chip for Iran in its relations with Britain, and that it would not be helpful for Johnson to resign.  He has asked to come with Johnson on a trip to Tehran planned for later this year and called for her to be given diplomatic protection.  Nazanin is being held because she is British and is being used as a bargaining chip against the UK, now justified by your words,  he said in an article in the Evening Standard newspaper.  Nazanin is no longer simply a consular case as she has been endangered in a deeper way,  he wrote. He added the uncertainty had affected his wife s health and she had gone to hospital for tests after finding lumps on her breasts, which the specialist thought were benign and stress-related. British ministers have rallied round Johnson but one of his allies, Environment Secretary Michael Gove, was accused of muddying the waters in a television interview on Sunday when he said he did not know what Zaghari-Ratcliffe was doing in Iran.

Kosovo at risk of attacks by returning Islamist militants: report,"PRISTINA (Reuters) - Kosovo s government considers the possibility of attacks by Islamic State fighters returning from Iraq and Syria one of the main threats to national security, according to a new strategy document. Around 300 Kosovars have gone to Syria and Iraq since 2012 to fight with the Islamic State group for the establishment of a caliphate ruled by Islamic law. Some 70 have been killed but many, including women and children, are still believed to be in the conflict zone, despite the group s expulsion from almost all the population centers it had held. The document,  State Strategy Against Terrorism and Action Plan 2018-2022 , was posted on a government website on Friday. It said potential threats included  attacks by members of terrorist organizations through foreign terrorist fighters, inactive cells, but also by sympathizers and supporters who may be inspired to commit violent acts . International and local security agencies have previously warned of the risk posed by returning fighters, and in 2015, Kosovo adopted a law making fighting in foreign conflicts punishable by up to 15 years in jail. The report said there had been  public calls for terrorist attacks in Kosovo and the region  and called terrorism  one of the biggest threats to national security . Kosovo s population is nominally 90 percent Muslim, but largely secular in outlook. There have been no Islamist attacks on its soil, although in June, nine Kosovar men were charged with planning attacks at a soccer match in Albania against the visiting Israeli national team and its fans the previous November. The state prosecutor said some of the men had been in contact with Lavdrim Muhaxheri, a prominent Islamic State member and the self-declared  commander of Albanians in Syria and Iraq , from whom they had received orders to attack. Muhaxheri was reported to have been killed in the Syria the same month. The government strategy, compiled by the Interior Ministry, said that a form of radical Islam had been imported to Kosovo by non-governmental organizations from the Middle East after the end of its 1998-99 war of secession from Serbia.

Turkish plane investigated in Copenhagen airport after threat,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danish police were investigating a plane at Copenhagen airport due to depart for Istanbul, in response to a threat against aircraft of Turkish airline Atlasglobal in Europe, the airport said on Monday.  Copenhagen police have said there is a threat against all Atlasglobal s planes in Europe,  a Copenhagen Airports spokesman said. The Atlasglobal plane had been moved to a remote part of the airport while police carried out further investigations. Authorities briefly closed ten gates at the airport due to the investigation, but these were later reopened. Copenhagen police confirmed to Reuters that officers were investigating a suspicious incident at the airport but did not give further details. A spokesman for Atlasglobal said the airline was not immediately able to comment and would likely release a statement later. ",worldnews,"November 13, 2017 ",1
South African commission urges more education spending before ratings reviews,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa should raise state spending on higher education by around a third to at least 1 percent of gross domestic product, a report commissioned by the presidency and released on Monday found. The recommendation by the commission appointed by President Jacob Zuma came as a senior Treasury official resigned after news reports said he had complained about presidential interference in the budget process, and as state-owned utility Eskom said it was facing serious liquidity issues. South Africa relies on foreign investors to finance its hefty budget and current account deficits. Investors are nervous ahead of important credit rating reviews scheduled this month and with the ruling African National Congress gearing up to elect Zuma s successor as party chief in December. The presidency said on Monday that Zuma would make an announcement on the higher education report once ministers had processed its findings. Zuma set up the commission early last year in response to protests by university students demanding free education. The rand and benchmark bonds weakened after the presidency said it would publish the report on Monday, but they were little changed after its release. Currency traders and analysts said markets were waiting to see how the presidency would react to the report, but they said its recommendations were risky from an economic standpoint.  If we start repeating this pattern of recording higher and higher budget deficits we are undoubtedly headed for downgrades,  said senior Nedbank economist Nicky Weimar. South African GDP was around 4.3 trillion rand ($296.6 billion) last year, so an increase in government spending on higher education of 0.25 percent of GDP would amount to around $750 million of additional expenditure.  The commission also recommended that all university students should be funded through a cost-sharing model, whereby the government would guarantee income-contingent loans issued by commercial banks. Should a student fail to reach a certain income level, the state should repay the tuition loan, it advised. Introducing those measures would make it more difficult for Treasury to rein in a projected budget deficit of over 4 percent of GDP for the 2017/18 fiscal year.  But it would be popular among young people and ANC voters, many of whom are dissatisfied that South African society remains deeply unequal more than two decades after the end of apartheid in 1994. South Africa next holds a national election in 2019, and the ANC has seen its electoral majority shrink in elections. South African markets have also been pressured by fears that the independence of financial institutions is under threat. Local media outlet Fin24 cited sources on Monday as saying that Treasury Deputy Director-General Michael Sachs had resigned last week after complaining that Zuma was interfering in the budget process. Treasury confirmed Sachs  resignation, saying only that his departure was because he wanted to  serve the public sector in a different capacity . International ratings agencies downgraded South Africa s debt earlier this year after Zuma fired respected finance minister Pravin Gordhan in an abrupt cabinet reshuffle. S&P Global and Moody s are expected to review the country s ratings again on Nov. 24, and all eyes are on whether they will downgrade its local-currency rating to  junk  status after Gordhan s replacement, Malusi Gigaba, unveiled dismal medium-term budget forecasts last month. Downgrades to sub-investment grade could trigger forced selling of up to $12 billion of South African bonds and pile further pressure on the rand, which is already trading at a 12-month low against the dollar. South Africa s debt insurance costs hit a four-month high on Monday, reflecting a greater likelihood of ratings downgrades.     ",worldnews,"November 13, 2017 ",1
"North Korean soldier, shot and wounded, defects to South","SEOUL (Reuters) - A North Korean soldier defected to the South on Monday after being shot and wounded by the North Korean military, South Korea said. The soldier was found on the south side of the border village of Panmunjom, about 50 meters south of the Military Demarcation Line, wounded in his shoulder and elbow, according to a South Korean defense ministry official. He defected from a North Korean guard post nearby and was being treated in hospital.  The defector was urgently transferred to hospital in a helicopter of the United Nations Command, and there was no exchange of fire with our side,  the ministry official told Reuters.   Since it was an area exposed to the North, we had to crawl toward there to get him out,  the official added. There was no immediate comment on the incident from North Korea. While on average more than 1,000 North Koreans defect to South Korea every year, most travel via China and it is unusual for a North Korean to cross the land border dividing the two Koreas, which have been in a technical state of war since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. The last such crossing was in June. The South Korean ministry official said the soldier s condition and military rank remained to be verified. The defection comes amid tension between the two Koreas, and between the United States and the North.  North Korea has this year been boosting its nuclear and missile capacity with a series of tests as it faces off with U.S. President Donald Trump who has vowed to stop it from being able to hit the mainland United States with a nuclear weapon. North Korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear bomb test on Sept. 3, but has not launched any missiles since firing one over Japan on Sept. 15, the longest such lull this year.

"Militants cross from Afghanistan, kill two Pakistani soldiers: army","ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Militants have crossed into Pakistan from Afghanistan and killed a Pakistani army officer and a soldier, the Pakistani military said on Monday. The uneasy neighbors, both of which are important U.S. allies, accuse each other of harboring militants on either side of the border, and their two armies have exchanged fire across it during periods of tension over recent years. Four Pakistani soldiers were wounded in the attack on a military post in the northwestern region of Bajaur, the army said.  It did not say when the raid took place but said up to 10 of the attackers were believed to have been killed in Pakistani retaliatory fire. Independent verification was not possible as the area is largely closed off to reporters. Pakistan and Afghanistan share a rugged, porous border of 2,500 km (1,500 miles).  Afghanistan, which does not recognize the border, has lately been angry over a Pakistani plan to build a fence along most of it. The Pakistani army said the absence of Afghan central government s writ on its side of the border facilitated such militant attacks. There was no immediate response from the Afghan government. The attack came a week after unidentified gunmen shot and killed a Pakistani diplomat near his residence in the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad.    ",worldnews,"November 13, 2017 ",1
Anti-elite Slovene presidential candidate seen running for parliament after narrow loss,"LJUBLJANA (Reuters) - Anti-establishment Slovenian presidential candidate Marjan Sarec, who narrowly lost to President Borut Pahor in an election runoff on Sunday, is likely to run for parliament in general elections due next June, political analysts said.  I expect Sarec to announce his candidacy very soon. He might win, supported by a large number of voters who are dissatisfied with the political establishment,  Tanja Staric, an analyst at Radio Slovenia, told Reuters on Monday. Sarec finished with 47 percent to Pahor s 53 percent in the runoff, the tightest presidential race result since Slovenia s independence in 1991 from then-federal Yugoslavia.  Sarec, 39, whose center-left Lista Marjana Sarca has so far been active only at local level, indicated he will run for parliament.  My result (at the presidential election) is very good, I am very happy with it...This is not my last word in politics,  he said on his Twitter account late on Sunday. Sarec says changes of approach are needed to further improve Slovenia s economy and lift living standards. In an anti-establishment pitch, he calls for politicians to listen to voters closely and come up with practical solutions to their problems. He also wants electoral rule changes to allow people to vote for individual candidates rather than parties. Sarec is a former actor and comedian whose second mandate as mayor of Kamnik in northern Slovenia expires next year. Analysts forecast election defeat next year for the Party of Modern Centre of Prime Minister Miro Cerar because of widespread  dissatisfaction, particularly over lengthening waiting times for examinations and other procedures in the national health system. The government faces pressure for public sector wage hikes but wants to keep a lid on spending given relatively high levels of budget deficit and public debt. A poll published by daily newspaper Delo on Monday showed Social Democrats, earlier led by Pahor before he ran for president as independent though still with SD support, led with 19.8 percent, followed by main opposition, center-right Slovenian Democratic Party with 13.8 percent. Another poll released on Monday by the Nova24TV website put the SDS in the lead with 15.8 percent, trailed by the SD at 11.2 percent, with half the electorate still undecided. Pollsters have so far not included Sarec s party in their soundings.  ",worldnews,"November 13, 2017 ",1
France raises prospect of new sanctions on Iran over ballistic program,"PARIS (Reuters) - France s foreign ministry suggested on Monday that new sanctions could be imposed on Iran if needed over its ballistic missile program.  Iran rejected on Sunday a call by French President Emmanuel Macron for talks on Tehran s ballistic missiles, saying they were defensive and unrelated to a nuclear agreement with world powers.  As you know, the European Union has already placed sanctions on Iranian entities involved in the ballistic program,  foreign ministry spokeswoman Agnes Romatet-Espagne said. She was responding when asked to clarify comments made by Macron during a trip to the United Arab Emirates last week about the prospects of possible sanctions with regard to those activities.  If needed, new sanctions could be taken,  she said.  The United States accused Iran on Tuesday of supplying Yemen s Houthi rebels with a missile that was fired into Saudi Arabia in July and called for the United Nations to hold Tehran accountable for violating two U.N. Security Council resolutions. Saudi Arabia and its allies accuse Iran of supplying missiles and other weapons to the Houthis, saying the arms were not present in Yemen before conflict broke out there in 2015. Iran denies the charges and blames the conflict on Riyadh. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian will be in the Saudi capital later this week and intends to travel to Iran before the end of the month.  The political dialogue between France and Iran is active and makes it possible to address all topics, including strategic and regional issues,  Romatet-Espagne said.  Mr Le Drian will have a firm dialogue when he goes to Iran.  ",worldnews,"November 13, 2017 ",1
"Non-secessionist solution to Catalan crisis possible, says ex-leader","MADRID (Reuters) - Catalonia s deposed president said he might consider a solution to Spain s political crisis that did not involve the region s secession, appearing to soften the staunchly pro-independence stance that cost him his leadership last month. In an interview with Belgian daily Le Soir, Carles Puigdemont was asked if a non-secessionist option was on the table to resolve a crisis triggered when Spain took over control of the region after its parliament declared independence on Oct. 27.  I m ready, and have always been ready, to accept the reality of another relationship with Spain ... It (another solution) is still possible,  Puigdemont said.  I have, being pro-independence all my life, worked for 30 years to have another way of Catalonia being anchored to Spain,  he added, giving no details of what form such a relationship could take. He posted a link to the interview, which was published on Monday, on his Twitter feed. The former president is in self-imposed exile in Belgium after running an independence campaign that prompted authorities in Madrid to fire his cabinet, dissolve the regional parliament and call new elections for December. Puigdemont, who had previously insisted the independence declaration should form the basis of any political negotiations with Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, is under conditional release after an international arrest warrant was served against him. He and four other former members of the Catalan government with him in Belgium face charges of rebellion and sedition.  Rajoy has said he was open to talks with Catalan leaders on resolving Spain s worst political crisis since its return to democracy four decades ago, but only within a legal framework and after the independence drive was dropped as a condition. In an interview with German newspaper Handelsblatt published on Monday, Rajoy said the position of the former Catalan leaders focused on the independence vote and gave little room beyond that for debate.  Many blame me for not seeking political solutions. But I ve been in politics for a long time and ... there was no alternative,  Rajoy said, adding that the Catalan crisis was the largest problem he had had to face as prime minister. He said had tried to reach a compromise with the regional government, but it was impossible.  The government of Catalonia had only one goal - the independence referendum,  he said.  The Spanish government has called regional elections for Dec. 21, and Puigdemont s PDeCAT has failed to agree on a united ticket with other secessionist party, the ERC, denting the pro-independence camp s hopes of uniting behind the secessionist cause.  The head of the ERC and former deputy to Puigdemont, Oriol Junqueras, will campaign for his party from a prison cell after being detained with other cabinet members who remained in Spain and pending trial on sedition and rebellion charges.   According to an opinion poll released last week, independence supporters would win the election if they ran on a joint ticket, though probably short of a parliamentary majority.

"About 30 killed when train derails, catches fire in Congo","KINSHASA (Reuters) - About 30 people were killed and more than two dozen injured when a train derailed then caught fire in Democratic Republic of Congo, a provincial governor said on Monday. The freight train was traveling from the southern copper and cobalt mining hub of Lubumbashi to Luena, in Lualaba province, on Sunday when it left the tracks and tumbled into a ravine near the town of Buyofwe.   There s major damage because the tanker cars caught fire,  Lualaba s governor Richard Muyej told Reuters.  Around 30 dead and 26 wounded were transferred to the hospital in Lubudi, 25 km (16 miles) from the scene of the accident.  The train had taken on a number of passengers before the accident, and Muyej said the death toll could rise further. Eleven of the train s 13 cars caught fire following the derailment. Officials from Congo s national railway company, the SNCC, were investigating the cause of the crash, which was not immediately known.   Rail accidents are relatively common in Congo due to aging, poorly maintained infrastructure and lax enforcement of safety standards.

Prince Charles leads Remembrance day ceremony for British war dead,"LONDON (Reuters) - Prince Charles led the annual ceremony to honor Britain s war dead on Sunday, laying a wreath on behalf of 91-year-old Queen Elizabeth to mark Remembrance Sunday as she watched the service from a balcony. Breaking with her usual custom of placing the wreath at the Cenotaph on Whitehall in central London, the queen asked her eldest son to take on the role, in part because of the demands of the ceremony for someone in their 90s. A two-minute silence was held at 1100 GMT (6.00 a.m. ET) and wreaths were laid at the foot of Britain s main war memorial by senior royals and political leaders including Prime Minister Theresa May and the leader of the main opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn. The queen and her 96-year-old husband, Prince Philip, watched from the balcony of the nearby Foreign Office. Royal historian Hugo Vickers said the queen had slightly stumbled during last year s service.  One of the most important things with the queen as she gets older is not to put her in any situation where she might be uncomfortable or things might be difficult,  he told Reuters.  It requires a certain amount of standing around and then it involves the queen carrying something quite heavy and walking backwards.  But he rejected the notion that it symbolized something more significant, saying it was  another step that we realize that we have an ageing monarch, and it s very important that we should not put too much pressure on her . The head of state has been gradually reducing her workload and younger royals, including the 68-year-old Charles, have been taking up some of her duties.  Philip retired from public life in August but was keen to attend the annual ceremony, which commemorates the fallen of two World Wars and later conflicts. The queen has missed the wreath-laying ceremony only six times in her 65-year reign. On four of those occasions she was on foreign visits: to Ghana in 1961, Brazil in 1968, Kenya in 1983 and South Africa in 1999. She also missed the ceremonies in 1959 and 1963, before the births of her two youngest children, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward. ",worldnews,"November 12, 2017 ",1

"""You are the light"" - Philippines' Duterte croons at Trump's request","MANILA (Reuters) - President Rodrigo Duterte crooned a hit Filipino love song at a dinner in Manila for leaders from across Asia, explaining later that it was  on the orders of U.S. President Donald Trump . Trump and Duterte were among 19 leaders at a glittering  gala in the Philippines capital on Sunday ahead of an annual summit, and at one point Duterte took the microphone to sing  Ikaw  (You), in a duet with local pop diva Pilita Corrales. One of the song s verses, translated from Filipino, begins:  You are the light in my world, a half of this heart of mine .  Ladies and gentlemen, I sang uninvited, upon the orders of the commander-in-chief of the United States,  Duterte said later, according to the ABS-CBN news channel. Duterte, who is sometimes described as the  Trump of the East  because of his brash style, is due to meet the U.S. president on the sidelines of the summit on Monday. The United States and its former colony, the Philippines,  have been strategic allies since World War Two. But their relations have been strained by anti-U.S. outbursts from Duterte and his enthusiasm for better ties with Russia and China. More than 3,900 Filipinos have been killed in a war on drugs that Duterte declared when he took office last year. His government says the police act in self defense, but critics say executions are taking place with no accountability. Duterte said last week he would tell the U.S. president to  lay off  if he raised the issue of human rights when they met. But Trump, who has been criticized at home for neglecting rights issues in dealings abroad, praised Duterte in May for doing an  unbelievable job on the drug problem . Trump and leaders of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, China, Russia, Japan, Canada, South Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand were entertained by singers and dancers at the dinner. Each of the men sported a cream-colored barong, a traditional Philippines shirt made of fiber from the pineapple plant, hand-embroidered and worn untucked. They were served a four-course Filipino-Asian fusion meal curate and prepared by Chef Jessie Sincioco, who also designed the menu for Pope Francis when he visited the Philippines in 2015.

Germany probes expenses at Paris embassy; no other embassies affected,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel has ordered a  special inspection  into past irregularities in billing of expenses at its embassy in Paris, but the ministry said it was not aware of similar problems at other embassies. Walter Lindner, a senior ministry official, disclosed the probe in a letter to Greens lawmaker Franziska Brantner in letter dated Friday, and said it could trigger new recommendations for billing practices at all foreign offices. The letter marked the first confirmation by the ministry of irregularities at the Paris embassy after French daily Le Monde reported that the embassy had set up an undeclared cash fund to pay staff for special events at the embassy for third parties. In the letter, first reported by the Koelner Stadt-Anzeiger newspaper, Lindner said the ministry had revamped billing procedures in Paris in spring 2016 after discovering that the previous  form of billing had not met the usual standards.  The changes were triggered after a former butler and head waiter accused the embassy of using fake invoices to channel money into a fund used to give staff undeclared cash for overtime work at events hosted on behalf of private companies such as BMW and Mercedes. Lindner said the changes implemented in Paris ensured  a transparent accounting of the use of the embassy by third parties,  but the thorough review now under way could also trigger recommendations for all foreign missions and embassies. Brantner urged the ministry to hold those accountable for the problematic billing practices in Paris - some of whom still worked for the ministry.   In addition, all foreign offices must be carefully examined to ensure that such practices are not occurring elsewhere,  Brantner said in a statement. She also called for protection of whistleblowers.

"Alleged Kenyan police killing of girl, baby in vote-related violence likely to reach court: official","NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya s police monitor said on Monday investigations into the alleged killings by police of a girl and a baby in election-related violence were complete, and a spokesman said the case would probably end up in court. Kenyan police frequently face accusations of brutality and extrajudicial killings from civilians and rights groups, but officers are rarely charged and almost never convicted.  Human rights groups say at least 66 people have died in bloodshed associated with the August election, which was later voided by the Supreme Court, and in unrest surrounding the re-run of the presidential vote last month.  Stephanie Moraa, an 8-year-old girl in the Nairobi slum of Mathare, died after being hit by a stray bullet as police fired to disperse protesters on Aug. 12, the day after election results were announced. And the parents of six-month-old Samantha Pendo said she was teargassed and clubbed by police who invaded their home in Kisumu looking for protesters.  On Monday, the government-funded but civilian-run Independent Police Oversight Authority (IPOA) said it had forwarded its findings and recommendations to the director of public prosecutions  for review and direction . Asked on Monday what IPOA had recommended to the prosecutor s office regarding the two deaths, spokesman Dennis Oketch said:  It s a matter which will most likely end up in court. We don t want to give any information that can become prejudicial. We will wait for the [prosecutor s] review.  IPOA s statement did not specify if it had identified suspects in the two deaths. It did not mention any other investigations into election-related violence.  It has however, completed another investigation into alleged police beatings at a demonstration in September at Kenya s oldest university that sparked opposition anger at what they see as a pattern of police brutality.  IPOA said it had recommended to a police service commission that it take  stern disciplinary action against the responsible Commander . It had also forwarded the investigation file to the prosecutor s office, the statement read. Shortly after the August election, IPOA said it was fast-tracking investigations of all deaths and injuries for which the police were alleged by rights groups to be responsible.  Kenyan police dispute those accounts. The National Police Service described a report last month by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International on 33 deaths in Nairobi during the crackdown as  totally misleading and based on falsehoods . Despite its history of police brutality, Kenya is an economic and transport hub in East Africa and important Western ally against militant Islam that receives substantial financial support for its security services from international donors, including the United States and Britain. The IPOA was set up in 2011 after the killings of around 1,200 people in violence following the disputed 2007 election. It has received more than 9,000 complaints of police brutality and corruption since then.  Last year, it secured its first conviction, of two police officers sentenced for the death of a 14-year-old girl shot dead during a house raid in 2014. A survey last year by the non-profit International Police Science Association ranked Kenya s police force as the 125th worst-performing out of 127 national police forces studied. Only forces in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Nigeria did worse, measured on factors such as  process  and  legitimacy.  ",worldnews,"November 13, 2017 ",1

Human rights skirted at Asia summit as Trump rounds off tour,"MANILA (Reuters) - Leaders of Asian nations meeting in Manila on Monday skirted around the mass exodus of Rohingya Muslims triggered by Myanmar s military crackdown, disappointing human rights groups who were hoping for a tough stand on the humanitarian crisis. There was no pressure either from U.S. President Donald Trump over the Philippines  bloody war on drugs during a meeting on the sidelines of the summit with President Rodrigo Duterte. Trump told reporters that he had a  great relationship  with Philippines leader, who, a year ago, had branded then-President Barack Obama  a son of a bitch  for questioning his ruthless campaign.  They really hit it off,  Duterte s Communications Secretary Martin Andanar told reporters after the meeting with Trump. A draft of the statement to be issued after a meeting of Southeast Asian leaders made no mention of the flight of Rohingya from military operations in Myanmar s Rakhine state  that the United Nations has described as ethnic cleansing. One paragraph mentioned fleetingly the importance of humanitarian relief for  affected communities  in Rakhine state. The statement was drawn up by the Philippines, current chair of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which includes Myanmar. It did not use the term Rohingya for the persecuted Muslim minority, which Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi has asked foreign leaders to avoid. The government in mostly-Buddhist Myanmar regards the Rohingya as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and does not recognize the term. Over 600,000 Rohingya have fled to refugee camps in Bangladesh since military clearance operations were launched in response to attacks by Rohingya militants on Aug. 25. The plight of the Rohingya has brought outrage from around the world and there have been calls for democracy champion Suu Kyi to be stripped of the Nobel peace prize she won in 1991 because she has not condemned the military s actions. Some ASEAN countries, particularly Muslim-majority Malaysia, have voiced strong concern over the issue recently. However, in keeping with ASEAN s principle of non-interference in each others  internal affairs, it appeared to have been put aside at the summit.  With Myanmar having ethnically cleansed 600,000 Rohingya Muslims in just two months, it s time for ASEAN to transcend its do-nothing approach to atrocities among its members,  said  Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, in a Twitter message. The ASEAN leaders did agree that they should not take a lull in the dispute over the South China Sea for granted.  While the situation is calmer now, we cannot take the current progress for granted,  they said in a statement drafted ahead of a meeting with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang.  It is in our collective interest to avoid miscalculations that could lead to escalation of tensions.  China claims almost all of the sea, one of the world s busiest waterways. Taiwan and four ASEAN nations - Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Brunei - have competing claims. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte suggested ahead of the summit that, despite their differences, the leaders should not discuss the South China Sea.  We have to be friends. The other hotheads would like us to confront China and the rest of the world on so many issues,  he said on Sunday.  The South China Sea is better left untouched.  At the meeting s formal opening on Monday, he pointed to other triggers for a threat of violence in the region, including terrorism, violent extremism, and piracy on the seas.  The menace of illegal drug trade continues to endanger the very fabric of our society,  he said. More than 3,900 people have been killed in the war on drugs that Duterte declared when he took office last year. His government says the police act in self-defense, but critics say executions are taking place with no accountability. The United States and the Philippines, a former U.S. colony, have been strategic allies since World War Two. But their relations have been strained by anti-U.S. outbursts from Duterte and his enthusiasm for better ties with Russia and China. However, the animosity of the past appears to have been all-but forgotten, and Duterte - who has been called the  Trump of the East  for his brash style and coarse language - told the U.S. president:  We are your ally. We are an important ally.  Trump was criticized earlier this year after he praised Duterte during a phone call for the  great job  he was doing to counter illegal narcotics. The two leaders seem to have warmed to each other after meeting for the first time on Saturday at a meeting of Pacific Rim leaders in Vietnam. On Sunday, Duterte crooned hit Filipino love song  Ikaw  (You) at a gala dinner in Manila, saying it was on  the orders  of Trump. One of the song s verses begins:  You are the light in my world, a half of this heart of mine . On the last leg of a marathon Asia tour that has taken him to Japan, South Korea, China and Vietnam, Trump told reporters that he had made significant progress on trade issues.  We ve made some very big steps with respect to trade, far bigger than anything you know,  he said, describing his trip as fruitful and adding:  It was red carpet like nobody, I think, has probably ever seen.

Saudi-led coalition wants Yemen weapons checks strengthened before main port reopens,"DUBAI (Reuters) - The Saudi-led military coalition fighting in Yemen said it will continue to block the main aid route into the country until it is satisfied its Houthi opponents cannot use it to bring in weapons. The coalition closed all air, land and sea access to Yemen last week following the interception of a missile fired toward the Saudi capital, saying it had to stem the flow of arms to the Houthis from Iran. Aid agencies warned the move would worsen the humanitarian crisis in the country, where the war has left an estimated seven million people facing famine. Ports controlled by Yemen s exiled government would reopen soon, the coalition said on Sunday in a statement issued by the Saudi mission at the United Nations. However other ports, including Houthi-controlled Hodeidah   where some 80 percent of Yemen s food supplies enter   will remain closed until a U.N. verification regime is reviewed to ensure no weapons reach the Houthis, the statement said.  The coalition, in consultation and full agreement with the legitimate government, will begin steps related to re-opening of airports and ports in Yemen to allow the transport of humanitarian and commercial cargo,  the statement said. It said the first steps will start within 24 hours and will include the southern ports of Aden and Mukalla and the Red Sea port of al-Mokha, which are all controlled by Hadi s government. The coalition asked U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to send a delegation to Riyadh to  review current inspection measures to reinforce and introduce a more effective inspection and verification regime (UNVIM) aimed at facilitating the flow of humanitarian and commercial supplies and prevent smuggling of weapons, ammunition and missile parts...  Saudi Arabia has accused arch-foe Iran of supplying the ballistic missile which was shot down near Riyadh airport without causing any casualties. Iran has denied the accusation.  The United Nations and international aid organizations have repeatedly criticized the coalition in the past for blocking aid access, especially to the north, which is held by the Iran-aligned Houthis battling the Saudi-led coalition. More than 10,000 people have been killed in the conflict, which pits the internationally recognized government, backed by Saudi Arabia and its allies, against the Houthis and forces loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh. The Saudi-led coalition has been targeting the Houthis since they seized parts of Yemen in 2015, including the capital Sanaa, forcing President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to flee and seek help from neighboring Saudi Arabia.

Smog chokes Indian capital as emergency measures fail to bring relief,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - A thick cloud of toxic smog 10 times the recommended limit enveloped India s capital, New Delhi, on Monday, as government officials struggled to tackle a public health crisis that is well into its second week. A U.S. embassy measure showed levels of poisonous airborne particles, known as PM 2.5, had reached 498 on Monday afternoon, compared with the upper limit of  good  quality air at 50. India s weather office said rain was forecast over the next three days which could help clear the smog.  Light rainfall is likely in states surrounding Delhi and in Delhi over the next three days, and this could result in a change in wind pattern in the region,  Charan Singh, a scientist at India Meteorological Department, told Reuters.  Smog will start to abate starting tomorrow.  But Skymet, India s only private weather forecaster, said dense smog would continue over Delhi and the surrounding area for at least the next two days. The Supreme Court is due to hear a petition filed by a New Delhi lawyer to direct government authorities to tackle the  intolerable and unbearable air pollution . The Delhi state government declared a public health emergency last week after pollution levels spiked, a yearly phenomenon blamed on a combination of illegal crop burning in northern states, vehicle exhaust and dust. Over the weekend, authorities began using fire trucks to spray water in parts of the capital to keep the dust and other air particles down, but it has had little effect.  A senior federal government official said there was little more that could be done.  We can only do this much, and now we will have to wait for rains to clean the atmosphere,  said Prashant Gargava, an official at the Central Pollution Control Board. Gargava, who is in charge of monitoring air quality, said Delhi s air has been consistently in the  hazardous  zone, despite measures such as a halt to construction and increasing car parking charges four-fold to encourage people to use public transport. The PM 2.5 airborne particles are about 30 times finer than a human hair. The particles can be inhaled deep into the lungs, causing respiratory diseases and other ailments. Hospitals have seen a surge of patients coming in with respiratory complaints, according to media reports.  Every second we are damaging our lungs, but we cannot stop breathing,  said Arvind Kumar, the head of the chest and lung surgery department at the Sir Ganga Ram hospital. United Airlines said it had resumed flights from Newark, New Jersey, to New Delhi on Sunday, after suspending the service temporarily over concern about the bad air. Authorities decided to reopen schools on Monday after closing them temporarily for a few days last week, but the decision is likely to add more vehicles on the road.  Enforcement agencies said they were unable to impose a blanket ban on the movement of commercial trucks. Primary school teacher Aarti Menon said her family had been wearing face masks, even when indoors.  Not everyone can afford an air purifier or air-conditioned car. We are all living in hell,  said Menon, a mother of two teenage daughters. The National Green Tribunal, an environment court, has directed the city government and neighboring states to stop farmers from burning crop stubble. But the governments have not been able to do so. New Delhi-based non-government group TARA Homes for Children, which supports 60 poor children, said it was seeking donations to buy at least five air purifiers.   Some of the children have breathing issues and couldn t go to school,  said a volunteer at the group. ",worldnews,"November 13, 2017 ",1

France frets over internal threat two years after Paris attacks,"PARIS (Reuters) - Two years after militants killed 130 people in coordinated attacks across Paris, French officials say there remains an unprecedented level of  internal  threat from both within and outside the country. With Islamic State losing ground in Iraq and Syria, hundreds of French citizens - and in some cases their children - have started to return to France, leaving the government in a quandary over how to deal with them. For the first time as president, Emmanuel Macron will pay tribute on Monday to the victims of the mass shootings and suicide bombing that took place across Paris and in the city s northern suburb of Saint-Denis on Nov. 13, 2015. The attacks, the deadliest on French soil since World War Two, prompted the country to strike back, joining international military operations targeting IS and other Islamist militant groups in Iraq, Syria, Libya and elsewhere. There has also been the passage of more stringent French legislation, with the most recent law, effective this month, giving police extended powers to search properties, conduct electronic eavesdropping and shut mosques or other locations suspected of preaching hatred. Conservative politicians say the regulations don t go far enough, while human rights groups express alarm, saying security forces are being given too much freedom to curtail rights.  Macron - often parodied for his  on the one hand, on the other hand  policy pronouncements - has emphasized the need to balance security and liberty. While he has ended the state of emergency brought in after the attacks, heavily armed soldiers still patrol the streets of Paris daily, and barely a week goes by without a police operation to round up suspects.  According to the interior ministry, extraordinary measures have helped intelligence agencies thwart more than 30 attacks in the last two years. Last week, the police arrested nine people and another was apprehended in Switzerland in a coordinated counter-terrorism operation.   What worries us are plans for terrorist attacks prepared by teams that are still operating in fighting zones in Syria and Iraq,  Laurent Nunez, head of France s internal intelligence agency DGSI told French daily Le Figaro in a rare interview. The risk of a home-grown attack also remains strong, with a risk of more attacks from isolated individuals using  low-cost  methods such as cars or knives to kill, he said. The hypothesis of a car bomb attack or suicide bomber cannot be excluded either although his services had not uncovered any such plan, he said. Of particular concern is what to do about hundreds of French citizens who went to fight with IS and may now seek to return home, now that the militant group has lost nearly all the territory its self-proclaimed caliphate ruled in Syria and Iraq.  We know that the will of the jihadists to take action is intact,  Nunez said. Visiting Abu Dhabi last week, Macron said those returning would be studied on  a case-by-case  basis.  Some of them will be coming back (by their own means), others will be repatriated and some, in specific circumstances, will be facing trial with their families in the countries where they are currently, Iraq in particular,  he said.  A majority doesn t want to come back to France given the legal proceedings they face upon their return. But some women, widows, with their children, are inclined to travel back,  French prosecutor Francois Molins said.  We should not be naive. We are dealing with people who are more  disappointed  than  sorry.  (This version of the story adds dropped words in first paragraph) ",worldnews,"November 12, 2017 ",1
Over half of Spaniards want early national election: poll,"MADRID (Reuters) - More than half of Spanish voters favor an early national election, a survey showed on Monday, as support waned for a minority government embroiled in the country s worst political crisis in decades. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy imposed direct rule on the region of Catalonia after it held an independence referendum on Oct. 1 that Spanish courts had declared illegal. The term of the minority government led by his center-right People s Party (PP) expires in 2020, but 55 percent of respondents in Monday s survey said they wanted a ballot before then. The figure in an equivalent survey in October was 49 percent.  The poll was taken by pollsters Metroscopia for newspaper El Pais newspaper between Nov. 6 and 8 as former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont   whose government was sacked by Rajoy   pursued his campaign for the region s independence from self-imposed exile in Belgium.  Authorities in Madrid have called an election in Catalonia for Dec. 21. Rajoy was given a second term in October 2016 when the PP won the most votes but failed to take a parliament majority. The PP s weakness in parliament has meant the government has struggled to pass legislation, including the 2018 budget. Support for the PP, if the elections were held today, slipped to 26.1 percent in November from 26.9 percent in July. Backing for Ciudadanos (Citizens), a pro-Spanish unity party originally from Catalonia, jumped to 22.7 percent from 18.5 percent, putting it equal second with the Socialists. The poll reflected an official survey taken at the beginning of October that showed support for Ciudadanos had risen during the Catalan crisis, which has become Spaniards  second-largest issue of concern after unemployment. Left-wing Podemos, which supports a negotiated referendum on Catalan independence, saw voting intentions drop to 14.7 percent from 18.7 percent previously, the Metroscopia poll showed.

"It's all his fault: Italy's left obsessed with Renzi, not foes","ROME (Reuters) - National elections are looming and Italy s left seems bent on engineering its own defeat as Democratic Party (PD) leader Matteo Renzi continues to come under fire from potential allies.    The PD emerged badly bruised in a Sicilian regional vote last week, coming in a distant third to a center-right coalition and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement in a contest that many saw as a dry run for a national election due by May.     Though a weekend poll showed the PD has dropped six percentage points in six months, it remains locked in a three-way race with 5-Star and a center-right coalition that includes four-time Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi s Forza Italia (Go Italy!). The economy is growing at its fastest pace in seven years and migrant arrivals have fallen dramatically, two factors the ruling PD hopes will help it win over moderate and progressive voters who would never choose Berlusconi and are wary of the untested 5-Star. But a group of left-wing lawmakers who split from the PD earlier this year accuse Renzi of taking the party too far to the right and turning it into his personal fiefdom; and so far they are refusing to make peace.   Former Prime Minister Massimo D Alema, who orchestrated the dramatic schism, never passes up a chance to attack Renzi. Pietro Grasso, the Senate president and a former anti-mafia magistrate who abruptly left the PD last month, quipped that  the PD doesn t exist any more .     The PD and its potential allies could still be key players after the vote if they can only agree to round on their rivals instead of Renzi in the few months left before the election.   The fast-talking 42-year-old Florentine has not made it easy on himself. Just last month he clashed with the most popular member of his own party - Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni.    Just days before Bank of Italy Governor Ignazio Visco s mandate was to expire, Renzi blindsided Gentiloni with a parliamentary motion inviting the premier not to give the central banker another six-year term.   The PD accused Visco of doing too little to head off banking crises that cost taxpayers up to 23 billion euros ($26.8 billion) this year in salvage operations on sinking lenders.    To defuse a dispute with President Sergio Mattarella, who formally names Bank of Italy chiefs and who backed Visco, Gentiloni ignored Renzi s appeal.     The Visco affair has opened a fault line  in the party, said a PD lawmaker from Sicily who asked not to be named.  Two power systems are squaring off, one outside the current Italian establishment and one inside. Renzi is on the outside.    Using a soccer analogy, a government source and PD member told Reuters the Visco affair revealed Renzi to be increasingly unpredictable.     Three years ago Renzi was the Diego Maradona of Italian politics, the source said, but now he s more like Antonio Cassano, a tantrum-prone Italian soccer star whose volcanic temper caused problems on the field.    Like Maradona, he was a little hard to handle, but it was OK because the team won,  the source said.  But now he s more like Cassano, whose volatile personality offset his talent and hurt his team.    Under the new electoral law, Renzi and other party secretaries will personally pick their candidates for next year s vote. Many inside the PD are not speaking publicly, but the rebels who have split with the party are holding nothing back.  The reunification of the center left requires a change in policy and leadership,  D Alema said last week.  Laura Garavini, a PD lawmaker close to Renzi, told Reuters that tensions within the party persist.     The idea was that after the split they would disappear, but they haven t,  she said.    Another source of tension on the left has been Renzi s agreement with center-right rivals last month to pass a proportional electoral law that favors pre-vote coalitions, angering the PD splinter party that doesn t want to play second fiddle to Renzi.    Senate President Grasso quit the PD hours after the law passed, criticizing Renzi. The PD breakaway party, known as the MDP, is now courting Grasso as their possible leader.   The latest poll had the PD at 24.3 percent, trailing 5-Star that stood at 29.3 percent, while the center-right is pulling 36.5 percent.        If the PD stops its internal bickering... we can win 40 percent,  Renzi said on a TV talk show last week.  That s easier said that done, as the Sicilian lawmaker explains:  In the PD, we re all equally unpleasant to each other. The category of friendship does not exist. Everyone thinks they re smarter than everyone else.  ",worldnews,"November 13, 2017 ",1
PNG threatens to forcibly remove asylum seekers from abandoned Australian detention center,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Papua New Guinea Immigration Minister Petrus Thomas said authorities would take steps on Monday to forcibly remove around 450 men who remain in an abandoned Australian detention center without food or running water. Hundreds of men have barricaded themselves into the Manus Island center for more than 13 days without regular food or water supplies, defying attempts by Australia and Papua New Guinea to close the facility, saying they fear for their safety if removed to transit centers.   We will be taking steps with relevant authorities to move the residents based on serious exposure to health risk for the food of everyone that is remaining,  Thomas said in a statement issued late on Sunday. As of 5.00 p.m. (0700 GMT) Monday, no moves had been made by the government to remove the men, several asylum seekers inside the center told Reuters via email. One of the asylum seekers barricaded inside the center said on Monday that water supplies have been destroyed after Papua New Guinea workers entered the site and drained rainwater collected in tanks and garbage bins.  Immigration came and bored holes in the water tanks where we had been collecting rain water,  he said, asking to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals from Papua New Guinea authorities.  They also demolished the well we built.  Running water and electricity to the center were disconnected two weeks ago after Australian security withdrew and the camp closed on Oct. 31. The center had been declared illegal by a Papua New Guinea Court. The United Nations has warned of a  looming humanitarian crisis  among the asylum seekers, who are drawn largely from Afghanistan, Iran, Myanmar, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Syria. Australia has used the center, and a camp on the tiny Pacific island of Nauru, to detain asylum seekers who try to reach its shores by boat. It says boat arrivals will never enter Australia, even if found to be refugees, as that would encourage people smugglers in Asia. Under a refugee swap deal, the United States has agreed to accept potentially up to 1,250 asylum seekers from Manus and Nauru, in return for Australia taking refugees from Central America. The United States has so far only accepted 54 refugees. New Zealand has offered to resettle 150 asylum seekers, but Australia has rejected the offer.

China says regional cooperation should not be politicized,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Monday that regional cooperation should neither be politicized nor exclusionary, responding to U.S. President Donald Trump s use of the term  Indo-Pacific  during his trip to Asia.  Indo-Pacific  has grown in usage across diplomatic and security circles in Australia, India and Japan in recent years, shorthand for a broader and democratic-led region in place of the  Asia-Pacific , which to some places an authoritarian China too firmly at the center.  Trump and his team have given it fresh currency in recent days, starting during stops in Tokyo and Seoul, building on the rhetoric of his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, who last month talked of the need to support a  free, open and thriving Indo-Pacific . Although Trump was addressing a meeting alongside the APEC summit of Asia-Pacific leaders in the Vietnamese city of Danang on Friday, he repeatedly referred to the Indo-Pacific region and mentioned the importance of India in his speech. Asked about China s view of the Indo-Pacific concept, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said that peaceful development and win-win cooperation were the trends of the times.   All sides can come up with their own plans and positions on how to promote regional cooperation,  Geng told a daily news briefing in Beijing.   But we hope that plans and positions can accord with and conform to this trend, can suit the general trend of events in the world, and that the relevant plans and positions are open and inclusive, benefiting the promotion of win-win cooperation by all sides, and avoid politicized or exclusionary arrangements.  China has been busy promoting President Xi Jinping s Belt and Road initiative, an extensive infrastructure plan to recreate the ancient Silk Road, linking Asia with the Middle East and Europe, which critics say is more about spreading Chinese influence. China says it is simply a development project for common prosperity that any country is welcome to join. ",worldnews,"November 13, 2017 ",1
Australian publisher delays book alleging China influence in Australia,"BEIJING (Reuters) - One of Australia s largest independent publishers said it decided to delay the publication of a book that alleges widespread Chinese government influence in Australian institutions due to legal concerns. Sydney-based Allen & Unwin said in a statement on Sunday it had decided to delay publication of the book,  Silent Invasion , following  extensive legal advice . It said the book s author, Clive Hamilton, was unwilling to delay publication and requested the return of the book s rights.   Hamilton said the publisher s chief executive, Robert Gorman, sent him an email on Wednesday saying the reason for the delay was due to concerns over possible legal action from Beijing. The email from Gorman, which was reviewed by Reuters, said the scheduled publishing date of April next year  was too soon to publish the book and allow us to adequately guard against potential threats to the book and the company from possible action by Beijing .  The email cited fears of a  defamation action . Allen & Unwin s statement on Sunday, from Louise Cornege, its head of publicity, did not specify which court cases it was referring to. Gorman did not respond to requests for comment. Hamilton, an Australian who has previously published eight books with Allen & Unwin, said the  shadow cast by Beijing is enough to make them so nervous about the consequences of publishing criticism of the Communist Party . Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said on Monday that, while she was unaware of the specific contractual details between the author and publisher, she  would be concerned if there were any attempts to stifle free speech in Australia, particularly at the behest of a foreign government . China s State Council Information Office, which doubles as the ruling Chinese Communist Party s spokesman s office, did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent on Sunday.  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a daily news briefing on Monday that he was unaware of the issue, but that China was committed to developing exchanges and cooperation with Australia in all areas on the basis of mutual respect and equality. Concern in Australia that Beijing may be extending its influence in the country has become a topic of political debate and media coverage over the past year. In June, Australian Broadcasting Corporation and Fairfax Media, publisher of the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age newspapers, published reports saying that there was a concerted campaign by China and its proxies to  infiltrate  the Australian political process and institutions to promote Chinese interests. China has denied the claims in the reports, which the Chinese Foreign Ministry has said were  totally unfounded and irresponsible . Fairfax and the ABC declined to comment. Australia s Attorney-General George Brandis said in June that  the threat of political interference by foreign intelligence services is a problem of the highest order and is getting worse . He said the Australian government had conducted a  comprehensive review  and planned to strengthen the country s espionage and foreign interference laws. Hamilton said his book was the  first comprehensive national study of Beijing s program of exerting influence on another nation . The book documented the influence and penetration of the Chinese Communist Party in Australian political parties, universities and cultural organizations, as well as the Chinese diaspora in Australia, he said in a telephone interview. The delay of the book comes after two international publishing houses - Springer Nature, which publishes science magazines Nature and Scientific American, and Cambridge University Press - were criticized recently for restricting access to articles on sensitive subjects in China. In August, Cambridge University Press, which had initially blocked online access to hundreds of scholarly articles in China reversed its position and reposted the material, following an outcry over academic freedom. Cambridge University said at the time that the move to block content had been a  temporary decision . Springer said early this month that it had pulled access to a small number of articles in China to comply with regulations, adding that it viewed the move as regrettable but necessary. Beijing has said all publications imported into China must comply with Chinese laws and regulations. ",worldnews,"November 13, 2017 ",1

Exclusive: $6 for 38 days work: Child exploitation rife in Rohingya camps,"COX S BAZAR/KUTUPALONG, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Rohingya refugee children from Myanmar are working punishing hours for paltry pay in Bangladesh, with some suffering beatings and sexual assault, the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) has found. Independent reporting by Reuters corroborated some of the findings. The results of a probe by the IOM into exploitation and trafficking in Bangladesh s refugee camps, which Reuters reviewed on an exclusive basis, also documented accounts of Rohingya girls as young as 11 getting married, and parents saying the unions would provide protection and economic advancement. About 450,000 children, or 55 percent of the refugee population, live in teeming settlements near the border with Myanmar after fleeing the destruction of villages and alleged murder, looting and rape by security forces and Buddhist mobs. Afjurul Hoque Tutul, additional superintendent of police in Cox s Bazar, near where the camps are based, said 11 checkpoints had been set up that would help prevent children from leaving.  If any Rohingya child is found working, then the owners will be punished,  he said. Most of the refugees have arrived in the past two and a half months after attacks on about 30 security posts by Rohingya rebels met a ferocious response from Myanmar s military. Described by the United Nations human rights commissioner Zeid Ra ad Al Hussein as a  textbook example of ethnic cleansing , Myanmar s government counters that its actions are a proportionate response to attacks by Rohingya  terrorists . The IOM s findings, based on discussions with groups of long-term residents and recent arrivals, and separate interviews by Reuters, show life in the refugee camps is hardly better than it is in Myanmar for Rohingya children. The IOM said children were targeted by labor agents and encouraged to work by their destitute parents amid widespread malnutrition and poverty in the camps. Education opportunities are limited for children beyond Grade 3.   Rohingya boys and girls as young as seven years old were confirmed working outside the settlements, according to the findings. Boys work on farms, construction sites and fishing boats, as well as in tea shops and as rickshaw drivers, the IOM and Rohingya residents in the camp reported. Girls typically work as maids and nannies for Bangladeshi families, either in the nearby resort town of Cox s Bazar or in Chittagong, Bangladesh s second-largest city, about 150 km (100 miles) from the camps. One Rohingya parent, who asked not to be identified because she feared reprisals, told Reuters her 14-year-old daughter had been working in Chittagong as a maid but fled her employers. When she returned to the camp, she was unable to walk, her mother said, adding that her daughter s Bangladeshi employers had physically and sexually assaulted her.  The husband was an alcoholic and he would come to her bedroom at night and rape her. He did it six or seven times,  the mother said.  They gave us no money. Nothing.  The account could not be independently verified by Reuters but was similar to others recorded by the IOM. Most interviewees said female Rohingya refugees  experienced sexual harassment, rape and being forced to marry the person who raped her , the IOM said. Across Bangladesh s refugee settlements, Reuters saw children wandering muddy lanes alone and aimlessly, or sitting listlessly outside tents. Many children begged along roadsides. The Inter Sector Coordination Group, which oversees UN agencies and charities, said this month it had documented 2,462 unaccompanied and separated children in the camps. The actual number was  likely to be far higher , it said. A preliminary survey by the UNHCR and Bangladesh s Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commission has found that 5 percent of households - or 3,576 families - were headed by a child. Reuters interviewed seven families who sent their children to work. All reported terrible working conditions, low wages or abuse.  Muhammad Zubair, dressed in a dirty football shirt, his small stature belying his stated age of 12 years old, said he was offered 250 taka per day but ended up with only 500 taka ($6) for 38 days work building roads. His mother said he was 14 years old.  It was hard work, laying bricks on the road,  he said, squatting in the doorway of his mud hut in the Kutupalong camp. He said he was verbally abused by his employers when he asked for more money and was told to leave. He declined to provide their identities.  Zubair then took a job in a tea shop for a month, putting in two shifts per day from 6am to past midnight, broken by a four-hour rest period in the afternoon. He said he wasn t allowed to leave the shop and was only permitted to speak to his parents by phone once.   When I wasn t paid, I escaped,  he said.  I was frightened because I thought the owner, the master, would come here with other people and take me again.  Many parents also pressure their daughters to marry early, for protection and for financial stability, according to the IOM findings. Some child brides are as young as 11, the IOM said. But many women only became  second wives,  the IOM said. Second wives are frequently divorced quickly and  abandoned without any further economic support . Kateryna Ardanyan, an IOM anti-trafficking specialist, said exploitation had become  normalized  in the camps.  Human traffickers usually adapt faster to the situation than any other response mechanism can. It s very important we try to do prevention.  Ardanyan said.  Funding dedicated to protecting Rohingya men, women and children from exploitation and abuse is urgently needed.    ",worldnews,"November 13, 2017 ",1

Iranian-backed militias routed in last Syrian militant stronghold,"AMMAN (Reuters) - Islamic State militants regained control of Albu Kamal, their last stronghold in Syria, after Iranian-backed militias who claimed to have captured the city a few days earlier were ambushed and forced to retreat, tribal leaders, residents and a war monitor said on Monday. Fighters from Lebanese Shi ite Hezbollah in Syria who joined forces with Iraqi Shi ite fighters crossing the border into Syria were taken by surprise by militants hiding inside tunnels in the heart of the city they said they had taken on Wednesday, they said. The Shi ite fighters had launched a ground offensive on the city, in Syria s eastern Deir al Zor province where the Euphrates river meets, after months of mainly heavy Russian bombardment against the city that killed dozens of civilians and caused widespread destruction.  Islamic State militants began surprise attacks with suicide bombers and rocket attacks after the Iranian militias were duped that Daesh (Islamic State) had left the city,  said Qahtan Ghanam al Ali, a tribal leader in touch with relatives. The Syrian army had on Thursday declared victory over Islamic State, claiming it had killed many militants while scores surrendered. It said the capture of Albu Kamal marked the collapse of the militants  three-year reign in the region.  The army made no mention of the loss of Albu Kamal but Hezbollah s media unit said intensive aerial strikes pounded Islamic State hideouts in the western countryside of the city. The offensive was spearheaded by elite forces from Hezbollah fighting inside Syria alongside an array of Iraqi and Afghan Shi ite militias that had entered from Iraq, a commander in that alliance told Reuters.  These militant attacks lead to big human losses in the ranks of fighters supporting the regime,  the U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.       Albu Kamal, a major supply and communications hub for the ultra-hardline militants between Syria and Iraq, was a big prize for the Iranian-backed militias. The militants  control of the city and its sister border town of al Qaim on the Iraqi side had disrupted the strategic Baghdad-Damascus highway that had long been a major arms supply conduit by Iran to its Syrian ally. The Syrian opposition and some Western countries say Iran s strong military intervention on the side of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, alongside its backing of other Shi ite militias, is fuelling the sectarian dimension of the Syrian civil war by radicalizing mainstream Sunni rebels. An overstretched Syrian army is now more than ever dependent on Shi ite militias on the ground and Russia s military fire power to recapture ground from Sunni insurgents. Islamic State, the jihadist group that once laid claim to a self-styled  caliphate  spanning swathes of Syria and Iraq, has seen its proto-state crumble in recent months under the pressure of multiple offensives. On Sunday, jets believed to be Russian intensified their third day of bombing of Albu Kamal and its outskirts, with at least 50 civilians, mostly women and children, killed since Friday, the monitor and residents said.  In retaliation for their losses, Iranian militias who were forced to withdraw shelled villages east of the city where hundreds of families who fled Albu Kamal had found temporary refuge, the U.K.-based war monitor said. In one air strike on the town of Sukariya, east of the city, at least thirty people were killed, mostly women and children from three families, two former residents of the city in contact with relatives said. Other aerial strikes hit villages of Marshada and Sousa near the river crossing where hundreds of civilians were targeted as they fled in small boats and dinghies, they added. Albu Kamal has been a target of intensive strikes believed to be conducted by Russia across Deir al Zor province which has killed hundreds of civilians in recent months, according to the monitor and local figures. Military experts and Syrian opposition figures say Russia has stepped up a  scorched earth  policy in the province with its aerial bombing in recent months to secure a rapid military victory at any price for its military and its allies.

Taiwan tells U.S. it does not want to cause trouble in Taiwan Strait,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan has assured the United States it has no intention of causing trouble in the Taiwan Strait, the self-ruled island s envoy to a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders said on Monday.  The comments by James Soong came after he told reporters in the Vietnamese city of Danang at the weekend that he had good exchanges with both U.S. President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson during informal moments between summit events.  We don t want to create trouble in the Taiwan Strait, and lead the U.S., China and Japan, and all observers, to think we are a troublemaker. The whole world doesn t hope for Taiwan to be a troublemaker,  Soong said in response to a question on his interactions with Trump and Tillerson.  We hope to use peaceful means to solve relevant problems.  Soong also said he had a  natural interaction  with Chinese President Xi Jinping.  Relations between Beijing and Taipei have nosedived since President Tsai Ing-wen was elected last year. China believes she wants formal independence for Taiwan, a red line for Beijing. For her part, Tsai says she wants to maintain peace with China but will defend Taiwan s democracy and security. China has suspended a regular dialogue mechanism with Taiwan since Tsai came to power and stepped up military exercises around the island. It has also increased diplomatic pressure by winning over another two of the island s dwindling number of diplomatic allies. Soong, who is chairman of the China-friendly People First Party, emphasized at the summit that Tsai had repeatedly talked about seeking peaceful relations and stability with China. This month, Xi told Trump in Beijing that Taiwan was the most important and sensitive issue in Sino-U.S. ties.  ",worldnews,"November 13, 2017 ",1
Former head of Chinese news agency expelled from party for graft,"BEIJING (Reuters) - The retired former head of a Chinese state-run news agency has been expelled from the ruling Communist Party for graft, an anti-corruption watchdog said on Monday. Liu Beixian, editor-in-chief of the China News Service until retiring in February 2015, accepted bribes and expensive gifts while abusing his power to obtain financial gain for private enterprises, the watchdog, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, said in a statement. The commission said Liu, 62, also violated regulations by flying first class multiple times and he was uncooperative when being investigated.  As a leading cadre, Liu Beixian lost his ideals and convictions and had serious thoughts of privilege,  the commission said, adding that the evidence would be transferred to relevant judicial authorities for prosecution. It was not possible to reach Liu or a legal or family representative for comment. Liu was put under investigation in August for  serious disciplinary violations , a euphemism for graft. The China News Service is run under the auspices of the cabinet s Overseas Chinese Affairs Office, and is designed to serve as a news source for Chinese communities in places like Hong Kong and self-ruled Taiwan. It is separate from Xinhua, China s official news agency. Liu began working at the China News Service in 1983 and was its Hong Kong bureau chief from 1997 to 2000, according to his official resume. The former British territory was handed back to China in 1997. President Xi Jinping has mounted a sweeping campaign against deep-rooted corruption since taking office five years ago, jailing or meting out lesser punishments to hundreds of thousands of officials.

Australian PM's support falls to new lows amid citizenship crisis,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull slumped to a new low in a poll released on Monday as his government cobbled together a deal with the main opposition party to stem a citizenship crisis that has left his government hanging precariously to power. Turnbull has been heavily criticized for failing to act decisively in a crisis that has so far seen his deputy, along with six other lawmakers, ejected from parliament because they were dual citizens, leaving Turnbull presiding over a minority government.  In the latest twist in a drama that has played out over several months, independent lawmakers threatened over the weekend to use their new-found power in the lower house to push through controversial legislation that has been blocked by the government, including a Royal Commission into the banking sector.   The latest Newspoll, published by The Australian, showed the main opposition Labor Party leading Turnbull s Liberal-National party coalition on a two-party basis, marking a 23rd consecutive loss since Turnbull ousted Tony Abbott to become prime minister in September 2015. Turnbull, then riding high in the polls, cited the fact that Abbott lost 30 consecutive Newspolls to justify the spill. On a personal basis, Turnbull s support crumbled from 41 percent to 36 percent. At the time of becoming prime minister, his support was at an all-time high of 55 percent.  He s probably had one of the fastest falls in personal standing in our history,  former Liberal Party leader John Hewson told Australian Broadcasting Corp television.  And worse still, no outcomes that really matter to the average voter.  The citizenship saga has overshadowed Turnbull s attempts to turn the domestic agenda to voter-friendly issues like tax reform, infrastructure and housing affordability. A contentious national survey on same-sex marriage and a checkered rollout of a multibillion dollar broadband network have added to perceptions of chaos in the country s leadership. With Turnbull in Vietnam for a meeting of Asia-Pacific leaders, his foreign minister and acting prime minister Julie Bishop told reporters the polls were  not surprising  and the government had a plan to resolve the dual citizenship issue. Dual citizenship is banned for members of parliament under Australia s constitution in a bid to prevent split allegiances. But adherence to that rule has only come under the spotlight in the current crisis, with the High Court confirming a strict interpretation of the law. With both sides of politics threatening to out lawmakers from the other side as dual citizens, the government and opposition agreed on Monday to a deadline of Dec. 1 for all politicians to disclose the birthplace of their parents and grandparents.

Singapore founder's grandson names lawyer in contempt case,"SINGAPORE/CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts (Reuters) - A nephew of Singapore s prime minister said a contempt of court proceeding against him, stemming from comments he made about the country s legal system, was  meritless  and he had appointed a lawyer to represent him. The Singapore attorney-general s office started court proceedings in August against Li Shengwu over a Facebook post in which he said the Singapore government is  very litigious and has a pliant court system.  Li, who is a grandson of the city state s founding leader Lee Kuan Yew, said at the weekend he had retained Singapore attorney Abraham Vergis, of the firm Providence Law Asia, to represent him.  It s sad that the Singapore government continues to press these meritless charges against me,  Li, a U.S.-based academic, told Reuters. Vergis, a veteran litigation lawyer, appeared at the Singapore High Court on Monday in a closed-door conference on the case. He said the case was likely to be a drawn out process and when asked how Li planned to proceed, Vergis told Reuters:  It is premature to be talking about that.  Lawyer Francis Ng, the senior state counsel from the attorney general s chambers, declined to comment. Singapore parliament last year passed a bill that made it punishable by up to three years in prison or a fine of up to S$100,000 (US$73,530) for anyone who alleges the country s judiciary is bias. Ng has previously described Li s Facebook post as  an egregious and baseless attack  on the Singapore legal system. On Aug. 4, Li said he did not mean to attack the Singapore judiciary and he had amended the  private  post to avoid misunderstanding, though he hasn t disclosed what changes he made. Li told Reuters in separate comments in an interview in August that he had left the country in July after friends expressed concerns he might be detained by the authorities. In the interview, Li did not identify the friends or specify the information they had. Reuters has no independent evidence that Li faced any threats to his safety.  In Singapore, it is possible that one can be detained and interrogated for some time without a lawyer,  Li said at the time. The case relates to a feud between Lee Kuan Yew s three children over the fate of Lee s house, which earlier this year gripped the nation not accustomed to such disputes erupting into public view. Lee Hsien Yang and sister Lee Wei Ling accused their elder brother, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, of abusing power to try to save the house as a historic monument in defiance of their father s wishes. The premier called a special sitting of parliament to  clear the air  over the issue and afterwards said the debate had failed to find any substantial evidence of abuse of power. Lee Kuan Yew, who died in 2015 at the age of 91, had lived in the house for most of his life. ",worldnews,"November 13, 2017 ",1
Suspected Indonesian radicals armed with bows and arrows burn down police complex,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian police shot dead two men suspected of burning down a police station complex in a jihadist-inspired attack after they fired at them with bows and arrows, officials said on Monday. All the main buildings at the police headquarters in Dharmasraya regency in West Sumatra were burned to the ground in Sunday s attack. There were no casualties.   We are investigating links between the fire and the two terrorists who were killed,  said national police spokesman Rikwanto, adding that a jihadist message was found scrawled on a piece of paper on one of the suspects.     He added that firefighters had found two suspects near the complex and reported them to police. The suspects tried to shoot at police with bows and arrows and were shot dead. Police and police buildings have been the primary targets for militants in Indonesia for many years, because of a sustained crackdown by the anti-terrorism force on home-grown radicals. Detachment 88 - known locally as  Densus 88  - has managed to stamp out or weaken many radical Islamist networks. But the world s largest Muslim-majority nation has seen a recent resurgence in radicalism, inspired largely by Islamic State. A series of small-scale attacks since early 2016 have been linked to Islamic State, which is believed to have thousands of sympathizers in Indonesia.  ",worldnews,"November 13, 2017 ",1
Southeast Asia summit draft statement skips over Rohingya crisis,"MANILA (Reuters) - A draft of the statement to be issued after a Southeast Asian summit makes no mention of the exodus of Rohingya Muslims from  Myanmar s Rakhine state following a military crackdown that has been described by the United Nations as ethnic cleansing. One paragraph of the communique, seen by Reuters on Monday, mentions the importance of humanitarian relief provided for victims of natural disasters in Vietnam and a recent urban battle with Islamist militants in the Philippines, as well as  affected communities  in northern Rakhine state. The statement was drawn up by the Philippines, current chair of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) - which includes Myanmar - whose leaders met for a plenary session in Manila on Monday. The draft did not give any details of the situation in northern Rakhine or use the term Rohingya for the persecuted Muslim minority, which Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi has asked foreign leaders to avoid. The government in mostly-Buddhist Myanmar regards the Rohingya as illegal migrants from Bangladesh and does not recognize the term. Well over 600,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh to find shelter in refugee camps after military clearance operations were launched in response to attacks by Rohingya militants on security posts on Aug. 25. The plight of the Rohingya has brought outrage from around the world and there have been calls for democracy champion Suu Kyi to be stripped of the Nobel peace prize she won in 1991 because she has not condemned the Myanmar military s actions. In September, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the situation in Rakhine was best described as ethnic cleansing. Some members of ASEAN, particularly Muslim-majority Malaysia, have voiced concern. However, in keeping with ASEAN s principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of one another, the issue appears to have been put aside at the summit. In September, Malaysia disavowed a statement issued by the Philippines on behalf of ASEAN s foreign ministers as misrepresenting  the reality  because it did not identify the Rohingya as an affected community in Rakhine state. Suu Kyi, who did not mention the crisis in a speech after arriving in Manila on Sunday, criticized ASEAN s principle of non-interference herself in 1999 when she was fighting for democracy in a country then ruled by a military junta.  This policy of non-interference is just an excuse for not helping,  she wrote in an opinion column in the Thai daily the Nation at the time.  In this day and age, you cannot avoid interference in the matters of other countries.  Roberto Romulo, a former Philippine foreign minister, told the Philippine news channel ANC that there appeared to be no discussion about the Rohingya at the ASEAN summit.  They re treating with a great deal of respect a discredited Nobel Peace Prize winner like Aung San Suu Kyi,  he said. Amnesty International Philippines representative Wilnor Papa told ANC that the ASEAN leaders would talk about  terrorism and peace and order ... but there are a whole lot of elephants in the room they won t be talking about, that people are trying to ignore.

Australian publisher delays book alleging China influence in Australia,"BEIJING (Reuters) - One of Australia s largest independent publishers said it decided to delay the publication of a book which alleges widespread Chinese government influence in Australian institutions due to legal concerns. Sydney-based Allen & Unwin said in a statement on Sunday that it decided to delay publication of the book,  Silent Invasion , following  extensive legal advice . It said the book s author, Clive Hamilton, was unwilling to delay publication and requested the return of the book s rights.   Hamilton said the publisher s chief executive, Robert Gorman, sent him an email on Wednesday saying that the reason for the delay was due to concerns over possible legal action from Beijing. The email from Gorman, which was reviewed by Reuters, said the scheduled publishing date of April next year  was too soon to publish the book and allow us to adequately guard against potential threats to the book and the company from possible action by Beijing .  The email cited fears of a  defamation action . Allen & Unwin s statement on Sunday, from Louise Cornege, its head of publicity, did not specify which court cases it was referring to. Gorman did not respond to requests for comment. Hamilton, an Australian who has previously published eight books with Allen & Unwin, said the  shadow cast by Beijing is enough to make them so nervous about the consequences of publishing criticism of the Communist Party . China s State Council Information Office, which doubles as the ruling Chinese Communist Party s spokesman s office, did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent on Sunday. Its foreign ministry did not immediately reply to a faxed request for comment sent on Monday. Concern in Australia that Beijing may be extending its influence in the country has become a topic of political debate and media coverage over the past year. In June, Australian Broadcasting Corporation and Fairfax Media, publisher of the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age newspapers, published reports saying that there was a concerted campaign by China and its proxies to  infiltrate  the Australian political process and institutions to promote Chinese interests. China has denied the claims in the reports, which the Chinese Foreign Ministry has said were  totally unfounded and irresponsible . Fairfax and the ABC declined to comment. Australia s Attorney-General George Brandis said in June that  the threat of political interference by foreign intelligence services is a problem of the highest order and is getting worse . He said the Australian government had conducted a  comprehensive review  and planned to strengthen the country s espionage and foreign interference laws. Hamilton said his book was the  first comprehensive national study of Beijing s program of exerting influence on another nation . The book documented the influence and penetration of the Chinese Communist Party in Australian political parties, universities and cultural organizations, as well as the Chinese diaspora in Australia, he said in a telephone interview. The delay of the book comes after two international publishing houses - Springer Nature, which publishes science magazines Nature and Scientific American, and Cambridge University Press - were criticized recently for restricting access to articles on sensitive subjects in China. In August, Cambridge University Press, which had initially blocked online access to hundreds of scholarly articles in China reversed its position and reposted the material, following an outcry over academic freedom. Cambridge University said at the time that the move to block content had been a  temporary decision . Springer said early this month that it had pulled access to a small number of articles in China to comply with regulations, adding that it viewed the move as regrettable but necessary. Beijing has said all publications imported into China must comply with Chinese laws and regulations. ",worldnews,"November 13, 2017 ",1
Exclusive: Japan to delay multi-billion dollar fighter jet development - sources,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan will delay a decision to develop a new advanced fighter jet, four sources said, as military planners struggle to settle on a design and officials splash out on new U.S. equipment such as ballistic missile interceptors and F-35 stealth planes. Faced with a growing military threat from North Korea and increased activity by Chinese air force jets over the East China Sea, Japan is under pressure to improve its defenses on two fronts. Any delay to the new fighter, known as the F-3, will raise a question mark over the future of what could be one of the world s most lucrative upcoming military contracts, estimated at more than $40 billion to develop and deploy.  A decision after the first half of 2018 would be too late for it to be included as a core program in a new five-year defense equipment plan beginning April 2019 that Japan will reveal at the end of next year.        The direction is for the F-3 decision to be put back,  said one the sources who have knowledge of the discussion. The people who spoke to Reuters asked not to be identified because they are not authorized to talk to the media. They said the decision, on whether to forge ahead as a domestic program or seek international collaboration, would now likely come after 2018.          Regarding the F-3 decision, including whether we will delay a choice, we have haven t come to any conclusion,  a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Defence Acquisition Technology & Logistics Agency said. Analysts estimate developing the F-3 could cost $40 billion, a figure described another source as an  initial cost.   With a defense budget of around $50 billion that has increased in the past few years at just under an annual 1 percent, that outlay, even spread out over years of development, represents a major undertaking.  It would come at a time when Japan is spending a record amounts on U.S. equipment, including Lockheed Martin Corp s F-35 jet, Raytheon defense missiles and Boeing Co and Textron Inc s tilt-rotor Osprey troop aircraft.  In 2013, Japan procured 118 billion yen ($1 billion) of equipment through the U.S. government s Foreign Military Sales (FMS) system. By last year, that outlay had quadrupled to 486 billion yen. President Donald Trump in Tokyo last week called on Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to purchase additional U.S.-made weapons as his administration pushes Washington s allies to contribute more to their joint defense.     For now, that defense is focused on countering the threat posed by North Korean ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons.  Japan s defense forces, however, want the F-3 to counter growing Chinese air power in the skies over the western Pacific and East China Sea where Tokyo and Beijing are locked in a territorial dispute. Japanese fighters scrambled a record 806 times to intercept Chinese planes in the year that ended March 31.  A second role for the yet-to-be-built fighter is to reinforce Japan s defense industry by giving Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) and its suppliers their first fighter jet program since Japan built its F-2 fighter two decades ago.  Mitsubishi Heavy, the maker of the World War Two-era Zero fighter, in January 2016 tested a prototype jet, the ATD-X. Developed for around $350 million, it was seen as the first step toward a new homegrown frontline stealth fighter.  While support for a domestic-only program is strong among some government officials, other bureaucrats are worried about the potentially enormous expense of developing components from scratch. They support international collaboration to share costs with overseas partners and tap their technology.   What we have now is a flying box  without all the systems that constitute a fighter such as weapons and sensors, said another of the sources.  Possible overseas partners include BAE Systems, a leading designer of the high-altitude Eurofighter interceptor backed by the British government, F-35 builder Lockheed Martin and Boeing, maker of the F-18 strike fighter. All have responded to initial requests for information from Ministry of Defence overseeing F-3 plans. ",worldnews,"November 13, 2017 ",1
"Strong quake hits Costa Rica, no reports of major damage","SAN JOSE (Reuters) - A strong 6.5 magnitude quake struck the Pacific coast of Costa Rica near its capital city San Jose on Sunday night, but there were no initial reports of injuries or significant damage to infrastructure. Costa Rican President Luis Guillermo Solis said authorities were gathering information and asked residents to remain calm and to be prepared for any possible aftershocks.  A Reuters witness said the quake was felt very briefly in San Jose, but it was enough to startle residents.   We re very scared. It s been years since we felt such a strong one,  said Otto Vargas, a university professor in San Jose, who was home with his family when the shaking started. The quake hit in a rural area near the popular beach tourism city of Jaco, where there are few tall buildings. It did not trigger a tsunami threat in the Pacific.  Firefighters in Jaco said there were no reports of victims or major damage, but said there were some electrical poles that had come loose and fallen. Social media showed images of supermarkets in Jaco with merchandise strewn across the aisles. The Costa Rican Red Cross said it had no reports of casualties.  Neighboring El Salvador s civil protection agency tweeted that the quake caused some electrical posts to fall, while the civil protection agency in neighboring Panama said there were no reports of damage there. The quake, initially measured as much as 6.8 magnitude, was centered 43 miles (69 km) southwest of San Jose at a depth of 12.3 miles (20 km), the U.S. Geological Survey said.

United resumes Newark-Delhi flights after halt due to poor air quality,"NEW YORK/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - United Airlines said it had resumed flights from Newark, New Jersey to New Delhi, India on Sunday, after suspending the service temporarily over concerns about poor air quality in the Indian capital. UA Flight 82 had been canceled on Friday and Saturday, data from flight tracking website FlightRadar24 showed, while the airline s website said it had waiver policies in place for passengers traveling to, from or through Delhi until Monday. UA Flight 82 has resumed operations, but  we will continue to monitor conditions over the next few days , a spokesman said. The third-largest U.S carrier is monitoring advisories as the New Delhi region remains under a public health emergency, and is coordinating with respective government agencies, the United Airlines spokesman had earlier told Reuters. Last week, New Delhi declared a pollution emergency as toxic smog hung over the city for days, with tourism operators reporting cancellation of bookings for the Christmas holidays. U.S. rivals Delta Air Lines Inc and American Airlines Group Inc said they do not operate flights to New Delhi, while several Asian airlines contacted by Reuters said they had not canceled flights.  Verisk Maplecroft, a risk consultancy, says India has the worst air quality out of a list of 198 countries it measures, and that New Delhi ranks among the world s top 10 most polluted cities with many urban areas around the capital also among those with the worst air quality.  At the national level, India tops the index rankings (i.e. the country with the worst air quality), followed by Bangladesh and Thailand,  said Richard Hewston, Verisk Maplecroft s global head of environment and climate change. The company s Air Quality Index assesses the atmospheric concentrations of fine particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers, known as PM 2.5.
