Democrats on a U.S. House Energy and Commerce subcommittee said that the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) must play a more aggressive role in mandating self-driving car safety. A Republican draft package of 14 bills would allow NHTSA to exempt up to 100,000 vehicles per year from federal motor vehicle safety rules, which currently prevent the sale of self-driving vehicles without human controls. It would also bar states from setting self-driving rules and prevent NHTSA from preapproving self-driving car technologies. We simply cannot have cars that stop at state lines,  Representative Robert Latta said at a hearing of the subcommittee. This isnt the government saying you have to get in a self-driving car. This is government make sure that industry can innovate. Latta said he hoped to win committee approval of a bipartisan legislative package by the end of July. General Motors Co, Alphabet Inc, Tesla Inc and others have been lobbying Congress to pre-empt rules under consideration in California and other states that could limit self-driving vehicle deployment. Representative Frank Pallone, a Democrat, said that under the Republican proposal, states would be barred from regulating self-driving car safety without a guarantee that NHTSA will step in to set binding rules. We need to be sure that we get this right and that safety is the first priority, Pallone said. Democrats noted that the administration of President Donald Trump, a Republican, has not nominated a candidate to head NHTSA, which has a number of vacant senior positions. NHTSA did not sent an official to testify. Two automaker trade associations said in testimony it is essential they do not face a patchwork of self-driving state rules. They said NHTSA will have to approve exemptions. Republicans, citing competition from other countries and the rising number of traffic deaths, say it is urgent Congress approve sweeping legislation to ensure automakers and technology companies test the vehicles inside the United States.  The administration of former Democratic President Barack Obama last year unveiled voluntary guidelines on self-driving cars. Trumps Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao has vowed to quickly update those.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

[nL1N1JN0M6] We always believed that the Muslim ban that President Trump imposed soon after assuming office had no basis in facts and would not help fight terrorism, Irans Mohammad Javad Zarif told a joint news conference in Berlin with his German counterpart. Zarif called the U.S. decision the greatest gift for militant groups seeking new recruits. Separately, Zarif tweeted: A bigoted ban on Muslims will not keep US safer. Instead of policies empowering extremists, US should join the real fight against them. Zarif said the travel ban punished people who had never been convicted of a terrorist act, while people from other countries involved in past attacks would not be affected. For some terrorism and support for terrorism is measured by the amount of arms they buy from the U.S, and not by actually being involved in acts of terrorism, he said, in an apparent reference to recent U.S. approval of $110 billion in arms sales to Saudi Arabia. Saudi citizens are not affected by the travel ban. Zarif did not mention Saudi Arabia by name but the ultra-conservative Sunni Muslim kingdom is the arch-foe of Shiite Iran in the region.

Kushner took on Abbe D. Lowell, the newspaper said, joining other senior administration figures including U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Vice President Mike Pence and Trump himself in hiring private attorneys. The White House has come under increased scrutiny since Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller and a number of congressional committees launched investigations into whether there were ties between Russia and Trumps 2016 election campaign team.  Trump and his key aides have repeatedly denied any collusion with Moscow. Mueller is examining Kushners meetings with the Russian ambassador and a Russian banker as part of a broad enquiry, the New York Times said. But there are no signs that Kushner is the target of an investigation and Kushner has promised to cooperate, the newspaper added. The 36-year-old Kushner, a real estate developer with no previous government experience, had at least three previously undisclosed contacts with the Russian ambassador to the United States during and after the 2016 presidential campaign, seven current and former U.S. officials told Reuters in May. When Mueller became special counsel in May, he left a job at WilmerHale, a legal firm that also employs another lawyer for Kushner, Jamie Gorelick.    When Bob Mueller left WilmerHale to become special counsel and three of our colleagues joined him, we asked Mr. Kushner to get independent legal advice on whether to continue with us as his counsel, Gorelick said in a statement to the Times.  He engaged Abbe Lowell to advise him and then decided to add Mr. Lowell to the team representing him in the various inquiries into the Russia matter, she said.  Trump on Monday demanded that investigators apologize for looking into Russian interference and possible collusion with his election campaign, accusing predecessor President Barack Obama of having colluded or obstructed, but he did not provide evidence.

The justices narrowed the scope of lower court rulings that had completely blocked key parts of a March 6 executive order that Trump had said was needed to prevent terrorism attacks, allowing his temporary ban to go into effect for people with no strong ties to the United States. [tmsnrt.rs/2seb3bb] The court issued its order on the last day of its current term and agreed to hear oral arguments during its next term starting in October so it can decide finally whether the ban is lawful in a major test of presidential powers. In a statement, Trump called the high courts action a clear victory for our national security, saying the justices allowed the travel suspension to become largely effective. As president, I cannot allow people into our country who want to do us harm. I want people who can love the United States and all of its citizens, and who will be hardworking and productive, Trump added. Trumps March 6 order called for a blanket 90-day ban on people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen and a 120-day ban on all refugees while the government implemented stronger vetting procedures. The court allowed a limited version of the refugee ban, which had also been blocked by courts, to go into effect. Trump issued the order amid rising international concern about attacks carried out by Islamist militants like those in Paris, London, Brussels, Berlin and other cities. But challengers said no one from the affected countries had carried out attacks in the United States. Federal courts said the travel ban violated federal immigration law and was discriminatory against Muslims in violation of the U.S. Constitution. Critics called it a discriminatory Muslim ban. Ahmed al-Nasi, an official in Yemens Ministry of Expatriate Affairs, voiced disappointment. We believe it will not help in confronting terrorism and extremism, but rather will increase the feeling among the nationals of these countries that they are all being targeted, especially given that Yemen is an active partner of the United States in the war on terrorism and that there are joint operations against terrorist elements in Yemen, he said. Groups that challenged the ban, including the American Civil Liberties Union, said that most people from the affected countries seeking entry to the United States would have the required connections. But they voiced concern the administration would interpret the ban as broadly as it could. Its going to be very important for us over this intervening period to make sure the government abides by the terms of the order and does not try to use it as a back door into implementing the full-scale Muslim ban that its been seeking to implement, said Omar Jadwat, an ACLU lawyer. During the 2016 presidential race, Trump campaigned for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. The travel ban was a signature policy of Trumps first few months as president.  In an unusual unsigned decision, the Supreme Court on Monday said the travel ban will go into effect with respect to foreign nationals who lack any bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.  A lack of a clearly defined relationship would bar from entry people from the six countries and refugees with no such ties. Hawaii Attorney General Douglas Chin, who successfully challenged the ban in lower courts, said that students from affected countries due to attend the University of Hawaii would still be able to do so. Both bans were to partly go into effect 72 hours after the courts decision. The Department of Homeland Security and the State Department pledged to implement the decision in an orderly fashion. We will keep those traveling to the United States and partners in the travel industry informed as we implement the order in a professional, organized, and timely way, a State Department spokeswoman said. Trump signed the order as a replacement for a Jan. 27 one issued a week after he became president that also was blocked by federal courts, but not before it caused chaos at airports and provoked numerous protests. Even before the Supreme Court action the ban applied only to new visa applicants, not people who already have visas or are U.S. permanent residents, known as green card holders. The executive order also made waivers available for a foreign national seeking to enter the United States to resume work or study, visit a spouse, child or parent who is a U.S. citizen, or for significant business or professional obligations. Refugees in transit and already approved would have been able to travel to the United States under the executive order. The case was Trumps first major challenge at the Supreme Court, where he restored a 5-4 conservative majority with the appointment of Neil Gorsuch, who joined the bench in April. There are five Republican appointees on the court and four Democratic appointees. The four liberal justices were silent. Gorsuch was one of the three conservative justices who would have granted Trumps request to put the order completely into effect. Fellow conservative Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a dissenting opinion in which he warned that requiring officials to differentiate between foreigners who have a connection to the United States and those who do not will prove unworkable.  Todays compromise will burden executive officials with the task of deciding - on peril of contempt - whether individuals from the six affected nations who wish to enter the United States have a sufficient connection to a person or entity in this country, Thomas wrote. The state of Hawaii and a group of plaintiffs in Maryland represented by the American Civil Liberties Union argued that the order violated federal immigration law and the Constitutions First Amendment prohibition on the government favoring or disfavoring any particular religion. Regional federal appeals courts in Virginia and California both upheld district judge injunctions blocking the order. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The stay had initially only protected 114 detainees from the Detroit area. U.S. DistrictJudge Mark Goldsmith sided with lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union who filed an amended complaint on Saturday seeking to prevent Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from deporting Iraqis from anywhere in the United States.  The ACLU argued those being deported could face persecution, torture, or death because many were Chaldean Catholics, Sunni Muslims, or Iraqi Kurds and that the groups were recognized as targets of ill-treatment in Iraq. Goldsmith agreed with the ACLU on the grave consequences deportees may face, writing in his seven-page opinion and order that: Such harm far outweighs any interest the Government may have in proceeding with the removals immediately. On Thursday, Goldsmith ordered a stay in the Michigan Iraqis deportation for at least two weeks while he decided whether he had jurisdiction over the merits of deporting immigrants who could face physical danger in their countries of origin. He expanded his stay on Monday to the broader class of Iraqi nationals nationwide, saying it applies to the removal of all Iraqi nationals in the United States with final orders of removal who have been or will be detained by ICE. There are 1,444 Iraqi nationals who have final deportation orders against them, although only 199 of them were detained as part of a nationwide sweep by immigration authorities, federal prosecutors said in court on Monday. Those detained had convictions for serious crimes, including rape and kidnapping, ICE said. Goldsmith also said his stays were designed to give detainees time to find legal representation to appeal against their deportation orders, and to give him time to weigh the question of his jurisdiction. Daniel Lemisch, acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, called the opinion highly extraordinary. But its a very extraordinary circumstance because of the on-the-ground situation in Iraq, Lemisch said by phone, referring to the danger faced by possible deportees.  ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt praised the ruling for saying that the lives of these individuals should not depend on what part of the United States they reside and whether they could find a lawyer to file a federal court action. Goldsmiths order came the same day the U.S. Supreme Court handed a victory to President Donald Trump by reviving parts of a travel ban on people from six Muslim-majority countries. The roundup in Michigan followed Iraqs agreement to accept deportees as part of a deal that removed the country from Trumps revised temporary travel ban. Some of those affected came to the United States as children and committed their crimes decades ago, but they had been allowed to stay because Iraq previously declined to issue travel documents for them. That changed after the two governments came to the agreement in March. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

(Reuters) - At a glitzy weekend gathering of donors to the powerful Koch brothers network, much of the talk was about the conservative political groups criticism of the healthcare bill moving through the U.S. Senate. That opposition suggests billionaires Charles and David Koch, powerful players in Republican politics, remain at odds at least on some key issues with President Donald Trump, whose campaign last year they refused to back. But beyond healthcare, the Kochs and their operatives have welcomed much of the fledgling administrations actions, including efforts to roll back federal regulations, the decision to pull out of the Paris global climate accord, a Veterans Administration reform bill and the appointment of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. Koch officials say their network has better access to the Trump administration than they expected given past frictions, partly because former Koch operatives have been hired in key administration jobs. Overall, weve made tremendous progress on the federal level that we havent been able to make in the last 10 years, said James Davis, a spokesman for Freedom Partners, a Koch-backed advocacy group. Vice President Mike Pence has played a key role, meeting privately with Charles Koch on Friday, as well as Marc Short, a former member of the Koch network who is now Trumps point man in Congress.  Charles Koch, addressing more than 400 supporters gathered at The Broadmoor luxury resort in Colorado for the event, touted the progress the organization is making, particularly since the 2016 election. When I look at where we are  at the size and effectiveness of this network  Im blown away, he said. Im more optimistic now than ever. The Koch brothers have been a force in American politics since the 1980s. Their influence has largely been powered by a fortune centered on Koch Industries, the second-largest privately held company in the United States with annual revenues of more than $115 billion from interests in energy, chemicals and other sectors.  Both Trump and the Koch network have incentives to build warmer ties. The Kochs could end up spending hundreds of millions to preserve the Republican majority in Congress during next years midterm elections. Attendees to the weekend meeting had to donate at least $100,000 to be invited. Koch-funded groups such as Freedom Partners could also help build support among conservative activists for tax reform and other Trump administration agenda items. During the 2016 campaign, the Kochs kept their distance from Trump. Charles Koch spoke out against Trumps proposed Muslim registry, invoking a comparison to Nazi Germany. The network did not actively work to defeat Trump during the Republican primary. But when he secured the nomination, the group did not spend money backing him or criticizing Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. By contrast, the Koch network spent more than $120 million in the 2012 election to defeat President Barack Obama.  For his part, Trump lumped the Kochs in with other special-interest groups, boasting that he did not need their money and that they could not influence him. But the Koch network beganshowing its clout in the spring when it worked with the White House to push the House of Representatives healthcare bill in a more conservative direction.  Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity, a Koch advocacy group, teamed with Pence and Short, Trumps legislative affairs director, to help get the measure through the House.  Pence is viewed as a trusted friend of the Koch network, dating to his time as a congressman.  At the meeting with Charles Koch on Friday they discussed healthcare and tax reform, Phillips and other Koch aides said.  Short is a former Pence aide and Koch alumni, having run the Koch political organization that became Freedom Partners. Stephen Ford, a speechwriter for Pence, has worked for Freedom Partners.  Koch operatives were encouraged when the White House recently cooled to the idea of a tax on imports, the so-called border adjustment tax advocated by House Speaker Paul Ryan.  Americans for Prosperity and Freedom Partners mounted a media and public-pressure campaign against the border tax. Phillips has met with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on the issue. Mnuchins chief of staff, Eli Miller, served as the Ohio director of AFP.  Mnuchin has since come out against the tax in meetings with members of Congress, Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina said at the donor retreat.  On the veterans bill, Koch group Concerned Veterans of America was able to work with one of their own. Darin Selnick, a former senior adviser to that group, is now a top aide to Trumps Secretary of Veterans Affairs David Shulkin.  That group is working with the White House on the more than 130 federal judicial vacancies Trump must fill, partnering with conservative legal advocate Leonard Leo, who has become a trusted Trump adviser on the issue.  Leo joined Charles Koch on stage at a donor event on Saturday night. A Koch group,  Concerned Veterans of America, mounted a grassroots campaign to secure Neil Gorsuchs confirmation to the Supreme Court.  Yet some stark policy differences remain between the Kochs and the Trump administration.  The Kochs, who are proponents of criminal justice reform, are frustrated with the Department of Justices effort to crack down on low-level drug offenders. They also disagree with Trumps hardline immigration stance.  Asked about the Koch networks successes, a White House aide did not expressly address the networks goals, but said Trump has already made tremendous progress toward making our country prosperous and safe again.  In interviews with attendees at the donor summit, opinions on Trump were mixed, but even some critics found reason to praise the administration. Several mentioned Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, an advocate of charter schools and vouchers.  Other attendees were effusive in their praise of Trumps actions so far.  Hes walks the walk, said Al Hartman, CEO of a property management firm in Houston. Hes doing exactly what everyone wants done. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Five months into Trumps presidency, the survey spanning 37 nations showed U.S. favorability ratings in the rest of the world slumping to 49 percent from 64 percent at the end of Barack Obamas eight years in the White House.  But the falls were far steeper in some of Americas closest allies, including U.S. neighbors Mexico and Canada, and European partners like Germany and Spain.  Trump took office in January pledging to put America First. Since then he has pressed ahead with plans to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, announced he will pull out of the Paris climate accord, and accused countries including Canada, Germany and China of unfair trade practices.  On his first foreign trip as president in early June, Trump received warm welcomes in Saudi Arabia and Israel, but a cool reception from European partners, with whom he clashed over NATO spending, climate and trade.  Just 30 percent of Mexicans now say they have a favorable view of the United States, down from 66 percent at the end of the Obama era. In Canada and Germany, favorability ratings slid by 22 points, to 43 percent and 35 percent, respectively.  In many European countries, the ratings were comparable to those seen at the end of the presidency of George W. Bush, whose 2003 invasion of Iraq was deeply unpopular.  The drop in favorability ratings for the United States is widespread, the Pew report said. The share of the public with a positive view of the U.S. has plummeted in a diverse set of countries from Latin America, North America, Europe, Asia and Africa.  The survey, based on the responses of 40,447 people and conducted between Feb. 16 and May 8 this year, showed even deeper mistrust of Trump himself, with only 22 percent of those surveyed saying they had confidence he would do the right thing in world affairs, compared to 64 percent who trusted Obama.  Both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, with confidence ratings of 27 percent and 28 percent respectively, scored higher than Trump. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, with a confidence rating of 42 percent, scored highest among the four leaders in the survey.  The countries with the lowest confidence in Trump were Mexico, at 5 percent and Spain at 7 percent. The only two countries where ratings improved compared to Obama were Russia, where confidence in the U.S. president surged to 53 percent from 11 percent, and Israel, where it rose 7 points to 56 percent.  Globally, 75 percent of respondents described Trump as arrogant, 65 percent as intolerant and 62 percent as dangerous. A majority of 55 percent also described him as a strong leader.  The survey showed widespread disapproval of Trumps signature policy proposals, with 76 percent unhappy with his plan to build the wall on the border with Mexico, 72 percent against his withdrawal from major trade agreements and 62 percent opposed to his plans to restrict travel to the U.S. from some majority-Muslim countries.  On the positive side, the survey showed that 58 percent of respondents had a positive view of Americans in general. And in many regions of the world, a majority or plurality of respondents said they expected relations with the United States to stay roughly the same in spite of Trump.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Twenty-two million Americans would lose insurance over the next decade under the U.S. Senate Republican healthcare bill, a nonpartisan congressional office said on Monday, complicating the path forward for the already-fraught legislation. After the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) score, Senator Susan Collins, a moderate Republican, said she could not support moving forward on the bill as written. Collins opposition highlights the delicate balance that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell must strike as he tries to deliver a legislative win to President Donald Trump by reconciling the Republican Partys moderate and conservative wings. Moderate senators are concerned about millions of people losing insurance. Key conservative senators have said the Senate bill does not do enough to repeal Obamacare. The CBO assessment that an additional 15 million people would be uninsured in 2018 under the bill and its prediction that insurance premiums would skyrocket over the first two years prompted concern from both sides.  McConnells goal was to have a vote on the bill before the July 4 recess that starts at the end of this week. But several Republicans, including Collins, have said they would not approve a procedural motion that would clear the way for a vote. McConnell can afford to lose just two Republican senators from their 52-seat majority in the 100-seat Senate, which would allow passage of the bill with Vice President Mike Pence casting the tie-breaking vote.   If you are on the fence ... this CBO score didnt help you, so I think its going to be harder to get to 50, not easier, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said of the bills prospects. The CBO score is also likely to amplify criticism from industry groups such as the American Medical Association, which said earlier on Monday that the Senates bill violated the doctors precept of first, do no harm. The CBO is only able to assess the impact of legislation within a 10-year window, but it said that insurance losses are expected to grow beyond 22 million due to deep cuts to the Medicaid insurance program for the poor and disabled that are not scheduled to go into effect until 2025.  Trump and Republicans in Congress made repealing and replacing Obamacare, former Democratic President Barack Obamas signature domestic legislation, a central campaign promise. The pressure is on for them to deliver now that they control the White House, House of Representatives and Senate. Republicans view Obamacare as costly government intrusion and say that individual insurance markets are collapsing. Obamacare expanded health coverage to some 20 million Americans by expanding Medicaid and mandating that individuals obtain health insurance. The CBO score was released just hours after Republicans revised the bill, adding a measure that would penalize people who let their insurance coverage lapse for an extended period. The move followed criticism that the original bill would result in a sicker - and more expensive - insurance pool.  At least four conservative Republicans - Senators Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Ron Johnson and Mike Lee - have expressed opposition to the Senate legislation.    Moderate Republicans have warned against replacing Obamacare with legislation that is too similar to the version passed by the House, saying it would cause too many people, especially those with low incomes, to lose health coverage. The CBO estimated that the House bill would cause 23 million people to lose insurance. Trump had called the House bill mean and asked Senate Republicans to come up with more generous legislation. Democrats uniformly oppose both the House and Senate versions of the bill. CBOs report today makes clear that this bill is every bit as mean as the House bill, Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, told reporters. The White House in a statement on Monday criticized the CBO for issuing a flawed report and said its assessments should not be trusted blindly. Trump and McConnell have been working to shore up support. The president called key conservative senators over the weekend, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said.  Both Cruz and Johnson said they were concerned about CBO estimates that insurance premiums would initially rise as much as 30 percent over the first two years before declining. Doesnt help the people whose premiums skyrocket next year, Cruz told reporters. Kind of a problem, isnt it? Johnson said of the short-term premium increase. Johnson and Paul have said they will oppose the procedural motion that would allow the Senate to move forward to a vote. Cruz is drafting suggested fixes. Paul remains opposed to the bill.     The first moderate Republican to oppose the bill, Senator Dean Heller, is already facing political fallout. America First Policies, a political group run by former Trump campaign staffers, said it would air healthcare-related attack ads against Heller, who faces a competitive re-election race in Nevada next year. Senator Rob Portman, of Ohio, who has not said whether he supports the bill, was dressed down by McConnell during a Monday leadership meeting, a senior Republican aide told Reuters.  Ohio participates in Obamacares Medicaid expansion, and Republican Governor John Kasich has criticized the Senate bill. Portmans office did not respond to a request to comment. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida said his governor, fellow Republican Rick Scott, would be on Capitol Hill this week to discuss the bills impact on the state. Constituent and industry groups have been critical of the Senate bills proposal to reduce the Medicaid healthcare program for the poor and point to the CBO analysis that it would disproportionately affect older adults. Under Senate rules, the bill must replicate savings projected in the House version that passed last month. It cleared that critical hurdle, with the CBO estimating it would decrease the budget deficit by $321 billion over 2017-2026. A revision to the bill that imposes a penalty for prolonged lapses in insurance coverage addresses the original bills provision to drop the Obamacare penalty on those who do not have insurance. Experts had warned that canceling the fine could lead to a sicker insurance pool because young and healthy people would not face consequences for failing to purchase insurance.  The bill would impose a six-month waiting period for anyone who lets their health insurance lapse for over 63 days and then wants to re-enroll in a plan in the individual market. The 15 million people the CBO estimates would be uninsured in 2018 is largely due to the repeal of the penalty associated with being uninsured. The CBO did not evaluate the revised version that included the new waiting period. Insurer Blue Cross and Blue Shield said it was encouraged by the inclusion of incentives for continuous coverage. Molina Healthcare said it preferred the Obamacare mandate, said that and the Senate bill, even after revised, would simply delay care. If the Senate passes a bill, it will either have to be approved by the House, the two chambers would have to reconcile their differences in a conference committee, or the House could pass a new version and bounce it back to the Senate.

At a closely watched first meeting between the two, Trump and Modi appeared to get along well. Modi pulled in Trump for a bear hug on the stage as the cameras rolled in the Rose Garden. I deeply appreciate your strong commitment to the enhancement of our bilateral relations, Modi told him. I am sure that under your leadership a mutually beneficial strategic partnership will gain new strength, new positivity, and will reach new heights. Trump was also warm but made clear he sees a need for more balance in the U.S.-India trade relationship in keeping with his campaign promise to expand American exports and create more jobs at home. Last year the U.S. trade deficit with India neared $31 billion. Trump said he would like a trading relationship that is fair and reciprocal.  It is important that barriers be removed to the export of U.S. goods into your markets and that we reduce our trade deficit with your country, he said. Trump said he was pleased about an Indian airlines recent order of 100 new American planes and that the United States looked forward to exporting more energy, including major long-term contracts to purchase American natural gas. These energy contracts are being negotiated and we will sign  trying to get the price up a little bit, Trump said. Modi came to Washington looking to revitalize a relationship that thrived under former President Barack Obama but has appeared to flag as Trump courted Indias rival China in an effort to persuade Beijing to do more to rein in North Korea. Modi effusively praised Trump, hailing his vast and successful experience in the business world and great leadership for U.S.-India ties, which he said should lend an aggressive and forward looking agenda to our relations. Trump accepted Modis invitation to visit India, the White House said in a statement, but no time frame was given for the trip. Modi harked back to Trumps Make America Great Again campaign slogan to stress that his agenda for his country was little different than Trumps. I am sure that the convergence of my vision for New India and President Trumps vision for making America great again will add new dimensions to our cooperation, he said. Trump did not mention U.S. differences with India on immigration and the Paris climate accord. The future of our partnership has never looked brighter, Trump said as both leaders underscored the importance of the defense and security relationship. As they met, a Pentagon agency said the U.S. State Department has approved the possible sale to India of a Boeing C-17 transport aircraft with an estimated cost of $366 million. The United States also has offered to sell a naval variant of the Predator drone made by U.S. defense contractor General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, the White House said in a statement, a deal that would be worth more than $2 billion. The United States has become the leading supplier of defense equipment to India, signing contracts worth more than $15 billion since 2008. On Monday evening, Trump and Modi had a working dinner, the first time Trump has played host to a foreign dignitary at a White House dinner. Trump administration officials have pointed to both leaders impact on social media - each has more than 30 million Twitter followers - as proof they are cut from the same cloth. If the chemistry is good, everything else gets sorted, said an Indian official. The only way is up. How much up we go depends on the leaders. If they click, we go up higher. Trade, however, remains an irritant, and on Saturday, leading U.S. congressmen complained in a letter to Trump that high-level engagement had failed to eliminate major barriers to U.S. imports and investment and had not deterred India from imposing new ones. Indian officials reject suggestions that Modis Make in India platform is protectionist and complain about the U.S. regulatory process for generic pharmaceuticals and rules on fruit imports. They stress the future importance of the huge Indian market to U.S. firms and major growth in areas such as aviation which will offer significant opportunities for U.S. manufacturers. Among the Indian business executives in Washington for Modis visit was Ajay Singh, chairman of Indian budget airline SpiceJet, which in January announced a deal to buy up to 205 aircraft from Boeing, worth up to $22 billion at list prices. Singh told Reuters that according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, the deal would sustain up to 132,000 jobs. The market is growing 20-25 percent a year. Even at todays pace you need 100 more planes a year just to keep pace with the market and we are not getting anywhere close to that number. As our economy grows ... we can potentially create a lot of jobs for Americans in the United States, he said. Boeing has estimated India will need 1,850 new aircraft worth $265 billion by 2036 to meet demand for air travel. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"
"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In less than three months, President Donald Trumps nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court, Justice Neil Gorsuch, is already staking out ground on the courts right, adding his voice to the biggest controversies including Trumps travel ban targeted at six Muslim-majority countries, gun control, religious rights and gay rights. In a flurry of activity at the court on Monday, Gorsuch showed his inclination to rule from a spot occupied by fellow conservative Justice Clarence Thomas. At a minimum, he is so far living up to Trumps claim that he would be a conservative in the mold of the man he replaced, Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last year. Thomas, appointed by President George H.W. Bush in 1991, is seen by legal experts as the most conservative of the nine justices and is known for his idiosyncratic views of some legal issues. The court has a 5-4 conservative majority. Two of the conservative majority, Anthony Kennedy, and to a lesser extent Chief Justice John Roberts, sometimes side with the liberals. Liberal groups and Democratic senators had vociferously opposed Gorsuchs appointment, with the evidence so far suggesting their depiction of him as a dogged conservative was largely correct. Justice Gorsuch has shown himself to be the conservative ideologue many predicted he would be and not the moderating check on the executive branch as others suggested he would be, said Michele Jawando, a lawyer with the liberal Center for American Progress. Conservatives, meanwhile, are delighted. Their hope that Gorsuch, 49, would be a solid vote on the right, would appear to be well founded. Gorsuch is rapidly becoming my favorite justice, said Ilya Shapiro, a lawyer with the libertarian Cato Institute. The new justice, formerly an appeals court judge in Colorado, was sworn in on April 10 after Democrats made a concerted effort to block his confirmation by the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate. Gorsuch has not been shy to make his voice heard since day one on the bench when, during three one-hour arguments, he sparred with attorneys no fewer than eight times. Im sorry for taking up so much time, I apologize, he said, smiling, after one such lengthy exchange. Gorsuch has asserted himself on paper as well. His one opinion for the court, in a case about debt collection, was unanimous. But its not unusual for new justices to be assigned a first opinion to write where the court is in broad agreement. In the cases where the court has been divided, he has reliably stuck with the conservative wing while showing something of an independent streak similar to Thomas. Gorusch nailed his colors to the mast in a series of written opinions and votes on Monday. In the biggest dispute before the justices, the court handed a partial win to Trump by partly reviving his travel ban that he has said is needed for security reasons but opponents criticize as discriminatory. The ban was blocked by lower courts and the high court agreed to hear oral arguments in its next term starting in October. Gorsuch, with two of the courts other conservatives, said they would have voted to allow the entire ban to go into effect. When the court also declined to hear what would have been a major gun rights case on whether the constitutional right to keep firearms for self-defense extends outside the home, only two of the nine justices dissented. One was Thomas. The other was Gorsuch. A gay rights case saw a similar pattern, with Thomas, Gorsuch and fellow conservative Samuel Alito the only dissenters as the court threw out an Arkansas court ruling that allowed the state to refuse to list both same-sex spouses on birth certificates. Gorsuch has also showed a willingness to quibble with his colleagues on what might seem minor points. In the courts big ruling on Monday in a religious rights case, the justices were split 7-2 on allowing a church to apply for state funding to re-pave its school playground. Gorsuch wrote a separate concurring opinion, joined by Thomas, in which he explained in part why he agreed with all of the majority opinion, except for one footnote that limited it. It could be that he is more similar to Thomas than Scalia. If he continues this pattern it might be significant, said Ilya Somin, a libertarian law professor at George Mason University.

The legislation passed the Senate by a nearly unanimous margin two weeks ago, looking like it might complicate President Donald Trumps desire for warmer relations with Moscow, where officials have denounced new sanctions. A White House official said the Trump administration felt some provisions in the bill would interfere with its ability to use sanctions to try to influence Russia. There are some provisions in the Senate bill that would unprecedentedly impair Treasurys ability to wield its sanctions tools, risk endangering the transatlantic sanctions coalition, and weaken the State Departments ability to credibly signal that we would calibrate our sanctions in response to Russian behavior, the official said in an emailed statement, requesting anonymity. Republican Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a co-author of the legislation, said he hoped for progress within the next day or two on a procedural issue that has kept the House from taking up the Countering Irans Destabilizing Activities Act, which also includes the new sanctions against Russia. The measure must pass the House, where Trumps fellow Republicans control a larger majority than in the Senate, before it can be sent for Trump to sign into law or veto. House Republican leaders said last week that the Senate bill violated a constitutional requirement that any bill affecting government revenues must originate in the House, something known as a blue slip violation. House aides also said leadership had not yet decided whether to vote on the Senate bill once the blue slip issue was resolved, or first refer it to House committees, which could further delay or change it. Democrats said they were skeptical about the blue slip explanation, noting that the issue had resolved very quickly in recent years for other bills. Corker said Senate Republicans remained solidly behind the legislation. Ive heard no one here have second thoughts, by the way he told Reuters. If you find one, please tell me.

Republican House of Representatives Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry released a proposed defense policy bill intended to address military readiness and the Department of Defenses unfunded requirements list, which is hovering at $33 billion, House staff told reporters on Monday. The $621.5 billion proposed base spending plan for the Pentagon and defense related expenses at the U.S. Department of Energy was more than 13 percent higher than the 2018 defense spending budget cap of $549 billion which would need to be raised by Congress for the legislation to be enacted. The proposal also included $75 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) to pay for ongoing wars. This funding would not count against the budget caps. The House proposal would put total defense-related spending at $696 billion for fiscal 2018.  Trumps budget proposal included $65 billion for OCO funding, and total spending of $668 billion.  If enacted, the House proposal would mean the Pentagon could commit to buying 17 more F-35 jets from Bethesda, Maryland-based Lockheed Martin Co for a total of 87 in 2018. It would increase the Army by 10,000, to 486,000 active service troops.  The proposal would allow the Pentagon to buy a total of 22 Boeing Co F-18s, up from 14 in Trumps budget proposal. The proposal also gives the Navy authorization for an additional five ships above Trumps original budget request. The ships include an Arleigh Burke class destroyer made by General Dynamics Corp and Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc and a total of three Littoral Combat Ships built by Lockheed Martin and Australias Austal Ltd. The proposal also includes defense acquisition reform measures that would change how the Pentagon buys services and would allow the military to buy commercial off the shelf products from existing business to business e-commerce markets, such as Amazon.com Inc or W W Grainger Inc.

It was not clear whether the legislation represented a break in the political logjam that has left the countrys fifth-largest state without a full-year operating budget for two fiscal years and threatens to downgrade its credit rating to junk. Republican Governor Bruce Rauner and the Democrat-led legislature face a Friday deadline to pass a budget or risk the consequences of a third-straight year of fiscal futility, including the halt of state-funded road projects and a suspension from national lottery programs. A committee hearing is set for Tuesday on a bill, filed Monday by a top Democratic ally of House Speaker Michael Madigan, to freeze property taxes for four years through 2020, except for Chicago.  Under state Representative Michael Zalewskis plan, debt-service and pension payments would be excluded from the freeze, and cash-strapped school systems that have been placed on a financial watch list by Illinois would be exempt, including Chicagos struggling public school system. While Senate Democrats passed a two-year tax freeze last month, Rauner and lawmakers from his party have been pushing for a four-year freeze on property taxes. Madigan told reporters on Monday that a House Democratic spending outline would be made public on Tuesday before a planned meeting of the four legislative leaders, but he declined to offer details. Once thats in place, the question is: Can we work together to find the revenue to pay for that spending plan? Thats where we come up against Governor Rauners demands for an extreme-right agenda, Madigan said. Rauner has also insisted on changes to pensions and the way injured workers are compensated by employers, as well as term limits for certain state officials. Madigan revealed his own demands on Sunday, including a school funding revamp bill already passed both chambers. House Republican Leader Jim Durkin insisted that any tax increase match the duration of a property tax freeze before he would be willing to help secure Republican votes. Were looking at four years on both, and nothing more than that, Durkin told reporters at a news conference in the state capital. Rauners office directed an inquiry from Reuters to Durkins office. A spokesman for Durkin later declined specific comment on Zalewskis legislation, saying only it was being reviewed. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

In closing arguments at the end of a month-long trial in Manhattan federal court, Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Lockard told jurors that thenon-profit Alavi Foundation, the buildings majority owner, knew its minority partner, Assa Corp, was a front for Irans government and helped hide that fact. They knew that when that secret got out, they stood to lose everything, he said. The government wants to seize the 36-story building at 650 Fifth Avenue, likely worth close to $1 billion, to benefit people with judgments against Iran relating to bombings and other attacks. John Gleeson, arguing for Alavi, did not dispute that Alavi knew Assa was owned by Irans state-controlled Bank Melli when it entered into a partnership with it in 1989. But he said the foundation, established in the 1970s by the Shah of Iran to promote Persian and Islamic culture in the United States, was led to believe that Assa was sold before 1995, and was misled when it tried to learn more. At every turn, it was either ignored, or given the run-around, or lied to, Gleeson said. Lockard told jurors that Alavi continued to turn rental income from the building over to Assa after the United States imposed sanctions on Iran in 1995, violating those sanctions. He pointed to evidence including testimony from former Alavi board member Seyed Mojtaba Hesami-Kiche, a key government witness. He said a letter from another former board member to Irans Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei referred to the United States as the Great Satan and suggested Alavi was working for Iran. Lockard acknowledged that much of the evidence was from before 1995, but said Alavi personnel did not forget who controlled Assa when the sanctions took effect. Gleeson described Alavi as a legitimate non-profit raising money for charitable activities. He attacked the credibility of Hesami-Kiche, who was paid by the U.S. government and admitted on the stand that he initially failed to pay taxes on that money. Gleeson is expected to continue his arguments on Tuesday. The government will be allowed a brief response. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Nearly $1 trillion of taxes imposed by the Affordable Care Act will remain in place if the Senate fails to adopt legislation to dismantle the law known as Obamacare, the top Republican on tax policy in the House of Representatives said on Monday. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady told reporters there are no plans to use future tax reform legislation as a secondary route for abolishing the Obamacare levies, should the Senate healthcare effort stall. President Barack Obamas signature healthcare law is funded by a range of taxes on businesses, individuals and investments that Republicans have long sought to eliminate as part of their drive to demolish Obamacare. But failure to overturn the healthcare law could constrain the scope of tax reform, which President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans have billed will be the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax system since the Reagan era. We have never planned to import that $1 trillion of taxes into the tax reform effort, said Brady, one of six principals involved in closed-door discussions to reach agreement on a sweeping tax reform package.  Those taxes are a big drag on the economy, and I think, very harmful for local businesses and those who have healthcare, which is why its critical that the Senate complete its work. Brady said tax reform legislation would have a harder time lowering taxes without healthcare legislation. House Republicans, including Speaker Paul Ryan, say that eliminating Obamacares taxes would make it easier for tax reform to include big tax cuts by lowering the revenue target that tax legislation would have to hit.   Brady spoke just before the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released a widely anticipated analysis of Senate legislation to repeal and replace much of Obamacare. The CBO report showed that the Senate healthcare bill would eliminate about $700 billion in Obamacare tax revenues over a decade. That is nearly $200 billion less than the tax cuts in the healthcare bill that passed the House last month, which reduced health coverage more dramatically and cut the federal deficit by less. Senate Republican leaders want to hold a vote on their bill this week. If the Senate approves the bill, the House and Senate would have to reconcile the differences and send a single piece of legislation to the White House for Trumps signature.

People with a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States are spared from the temporary ban affecting people from six Muslim-majority countries and all refugees that the justices on Monday allowed to go partially into effect. Theres no precedent for something like this that Im aware of, said Jeffrey Gorsky, a former legal adviser to the State Departments Visa Office, referring to the new bona fide standard. Gorsky said the standard is likely to sow confusion among U.S. consular officials who have to make visa decisions and could require another court decision to determine what constitutes a connection to the United States sufficient to allow entry. The Supreme Court agreed to decide the legality of Trump order in its next term, which begins in October. Justice Clarence Thomas argued that the court should have granted Trumps request to implement the travel ban in full while the legal fight continues. Todays compromise will burden executive officials with the task of deciding - on peril of contempt - whether individuals from the six affected nations who wish to enter the United States have a sufficient connection to a person or entity in this country, Thomas wrote, joined by two fellow conservative justices. In Mondays ruling, the high court gave a few examples of connections that qualify. For individuals, a close family relationship is required.  Bona fide connections to entities, it said, must be formal and documented. That would include students who have been admitted to a U.S. school and workers who have accepted an offer of employment from an American company, the court said. It noted that Trumps executive order already allowed for case-by-case waivers for people with connections to the country. On the other hand, the justices said, relationships created for the purposes of evading the travel ban will not be considered valid. For instance, an immigration agency cannot add foreigners to client lists and then secure their entry by claiming injury from their exclusion. The March 6 order called for a 90-day ban on travelers from Libya, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen and a 120-day ban on all refugees to enable the government to implement stronger vetting procedures. Trump cited national security concerns as the reason for the order. Stephen Legomsky, chief counsel for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services under former President Barack Obama, said lawsuits could claim that a bona fide relationship was ignored.  While Legomsky said he believes the vast majority of cases will be clear cut, courts will have to determine whether visiting a close friend or taking part in a wedding could also qualify. In theory, you could say if somebody is coming for tourism and has made a reservation for a hotel, theres now a U.S. interest in bringing them to the United States. The hotel is a U.S. entity, Gorsky said.  Some lawyers also said the vagueness of the bona fide standard was license for the Trump administration to interpret it broadly. Its just like a green light to the government to do what it wants to do, said Kiyanoush Razaghi, a Maryland-based immigration attorney who deals with primarily Iranian clients. Who is going to tell us what is the definition of bona fide relationship?  The difficult job of judging foreigners claimed connections could land back in the lower courts in Maryland and Hawaii that had originally blocked Trumps travel ban, said Stephen Vladeck, a professor University of Texas School of Law.   We could have dozens of these cases between now and September, Vladeck said, adding that the Supreme Court would not be likely to weigh in on them on a case-by-case basis. David Martin, a former U.S. Department of Homeland Security official and now a professor at the University of Virginia, said the ruling was carefully tailored and should be manageable for officials to enact. Part of the reason, Martin said, is the case-by-case waiver process that was already envisioned in the executive order. I think there will be some litigation over the extent of the reach of this bona fide relationship but Idont think it will be as burdensome as the dissenters suggest, Martin said.

OMAR JADWAT, DIRECTOR OF THE AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNIONS IMMIGRANTS RIGHTS PROJECT Jadwat, who argued the appellate case on the executive order, said in a statement: President Trumps Muslim ban violates the fundamental constitutional principle that government cannot favor or disfavor any one religion. Courts have repeatedly blocked this indefensible and discriminatory ban. The Supreme Court now has a chance to permanently strike it down. WILLIAM STOCK, OUTGOING PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN IMMIGRATION LAWYERS ASSOCIATION  Stock said the bona fide connections to the United States cited by the court as a requirement for admission to the country might include those on employer-sponsored visas, family-sponsored green card applications, people who are admitted by schools in the United States as students and those collaborating on research with people in the United States.  The court seems to be saying if a family in Iran had prepaid for Disneyland, they probably have a demonstrable connection to the United States that might allow for issuance of a visitor visa, Stock said. If a person says Ive heard of Disneyland and Id really like to see it, that probably doesnt get them in. In a statement, Perez vowed to keep fighting the ban, which he called unconstitutional and an assault on American religious freedom.   As a nation, our diversity is our greatest strength, and we cannot allow such prejudice to shut the doors of progress. Democrats will continue to fight this hatred every step of the way, Perez said.   Great news for our national security, the rule of law and @POTUS, Strange said on Twitter, referring to Trump.

Senator John Cornyn, a member of the Republican leadership who is on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told the Council on Foreign Relations on Thursday that he was concerned by Chinas attempts to ensure that its military catches up to the U.S. Defense Department in terms of technology. China is using every tool at its disposal to close the technology gap between the United States and that country, and in the process, to eliminate our militarys technological advantage, he said in his speech. Cornyns office provided Reuters with a copy of the address on Monday. To combat this, Cornyn plans to introduce a bill in Congress that would update the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, an interagency panel led by the Treasury Department that reviews proposed transactions to ensure they do not pose a challenge to national security. The law firm Covington and Burling LLP, which follows CFIUS, said in a note after the speech that it believed that Cornyns proposed legislation may ultimately become law. Senator Cornyn is among the most influential members of the Senate, and there appears to be an emerging bipartisan consensus that CFIUS should be strengthened, the firm said in an analysis on Friday. Cornyn said the legislation would be called the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act, and would ensure that CFIUS focuses its investigations on countries which pose the biggest threat to the United States. It would also give CFIUS the authority to look at a broader range of deals, including joint ventures based outside the United States and smaller, minority-position investments which would give the investing companies access to sensitive information, Cornyn said. Cornyns office did not respond to a query on Monday regarding when the bill would be introduced. CFIUS already has a reputation for being tough on high-tech deals, and has been known in particular to block transactions that involve sophisticated semiconductors. The bill will not expand the committee, which will disappoint those who had pushed for the Agriculture Department to become a member of the panel.

All countries in the region need to do more to combat terrorism, but recent disputes among the GCC countries only serve to hurt efforts to fight ISIS and counter Iran, Republican Senator Bob Corker wrote in a letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.  His action could increase pressure on members of the Gulf Cooperation Council to settle the crisis. The GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman.  Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates imposed a boycott on Qatar, their tiny but wealthy neighbor, on June 5, accusing it of supporting terrorism. They have sent it 13 demands including closing al Jazeera television, curbing relations with Iran, and paying reparations. Under U.S. law, major foreign U.S. arms sales are submitted for review to a small group of lawmakers, including the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, before they can go ahead. Trump considered Corker as a potential vice president and secretary of state, and he works closely with the White House. The administration would be unlikely to ignore his resistance to the arms sales, and U.S. officials said they considered his statement part of a broader effort to solve the Qatar crisis. A State Department official noted that Tillerson called on Sunday for the countries involved to sit down together and discuss ways forward. The official declined comment on arms sales beyond saying the department remains committed to working with lawmakers. It was not immediately clear what sales would be affected. Trump has announced billions of dollars in arms sales since taking office in January. He sees weapons sales as a way to create jobs in the United States. A Corker aide said his action would not affect sales that had already been reviewed by Congress or non-lethal assistance, including training. One sale already cleared by Congress was for up to $350 billion in precision-guided munitions and other offensive weapons to Saudi Arabia. In his letter, Corker said he was pleased with Trumps recent trip to Saudi Arabia, which included a GCC summit.  Unfortunately, the GCC did not take advantage of the summit and instead chose to devolve into conflict, Corker wrote. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller, along with several congressional committees, are investigating allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia used cyber attacks and fake media stories to help Republican Trump against his Democratic Party opponent, Hillary Clinton. The reason that President Obama did NOTHING about Russia after being notified by the CIA of meddling is that he expected Clinton would win... and did not want to rock the boat. He didnt choke, he colluded or obstructed, and it did the Dems and Crooked Hillary no good, he wrote on Twitter. Russia has denied meddling in the election and Trump has repeatedly called the investigations a witch hunt. In a Fox News interview broadcast on Sunday, Trump said he had learned that Obama had known about the Russia issue long before the election but that he did nothing about it.   An official from Obamas White House, who spoke on condition of anonymity, rejected Trumps criticism and noted that Obama had raised the meddling issue directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Obama administrations interest in making sure the response was bipartisan wasnt for the sake of being bipartisan. It was necessary because we needed the buy-in from state and local election administrators  many of whom were Republican partisans and/or skeptical of federal government, the official said. The White House referred any questions about the Russia investigations to Trumps personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz.  Representatives for Kasowitz did not immediately reply to requests for comment on Trumps latest statement.  With 4 months looking at Russia...they have zero tapes of T (Trump) people colluding. There is no collusion & no obstruction. I should be given apology! Trump said in another Twitter post on Monday. The Obama administration formally accused Russia in October of a campaign of cyber attacks against Democratic Party organizations ahead of the Nov. 8 election. In December, Obama ordered intelligence agencies to review cyber attacks and foreign intervention in the election and to deliver a report before he left office on Jan. 20. The intelligence agencies said in January they had concluded that Moscow tried to tilt the election in Trumps favor, including by hacking into senior Democrats emails and leaking them.  Following a weekend Washington Post report about the Obama administrations responses to the Russian matter, the top Democrat on the U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff, criticized the Obama administration on Sunday for not taking earlier and tougher action against Russia.

Participants included Chelsea Manning, the transgender U.S. Army soldier who served seven years in prison for leaking classified data before former President Barack Obama granted her clemency.  Honored to represent the ACLU at this years NYC Pride March, Manning said on Twitter, posting a photo of her riding in a red convertible. Started to lose my voice from screaming so much, Manning, who was released from a military prison in May, added.  A group of marchers heading down New Yorks Fifth Avenue carried photographs of U.S. President Donald Trump and his press secretary, Sean Spicer, as others waved banners bearing the word RESIST and the rainbow flag of the Pride movement. In contrast, a smattering of anti-Trump signs in San Francisco was drowned out by a desire to let loose. Its too good a day to be upset about Trump, said Richard Babb, 66, of San Francisco.  In New York, Brad Hoylman, a Democratic lawmaker in the New York State Senate, said lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people were under assault by the Trump administration. He already rolled back rights for transgender students, for example, and the list is on and on, he said. So we have a lot more work to do, thats why we are here today. As a candidate, Trump promised to protect gay people. But his move in February to revoke the Obama administrations guidance letting transgender students choose which gender bathroom they use, and his executive order last month to promote religious liberty have been seen by some as discriminatory.  The New York marchs grand marshals this year include the American Civil Liberties Union, which was chosen for its history of litigation defending gay rights; Brooke Guinan, a transgender woman who works as a firefighter in the city; and Geng Le, a gay rights activist in China. Pride this year is showing that we are here, we are queer, and we are not going to sit down for anything less than full rights, full equality, said Austin Anderson, a 28-year-old advertising worker at the New York event.      The march route ends on Christopher Street in Manhattans West Village to commemorate the riots that broke out there in 1969 after police raided the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar, in an event seen as a turning point in the gay rights movement. New Yorks first Pride march started close by a year later.  In San Francisco, revelers had to pass through one of dozens of metal security detectors to get into the main plaza. Happy Pride everyone! a security monitor yelled to the crowd, as people cheered and saluted. Have fun today. Two gay cousins attended the parade dressed in tutus and unicorn headbands.  We see this as a party, not a political protest, Qiaira McPeters, 18, said. Despite that, McPeters said that she feels things for gay people have been getting worse.  Gay people are getting beat up all the time, she said.  In Seattle, hundreds of people marched downtown in unusually hot weather, many in skimpy outfits and carrying pink balloons. A rainbow flag was hoisted to the top of the citys iconic Space Needle.  Seattle Mayor Ed Murray, the first openly gay person to hold that job, joined the parade with his husband, Michael Shiosaki. Today we celebrate our unity, he said in a video posted on Twitter. The Seattle Police Department, which put rainbow-colored decals on their patrol cars, said a group of people blocked the parade route for about 30 minutes to hold a sit-in in honor of Charleena Lyles, the black mother slain by city police a week ago.

Collins, a moderate Republican who has not taken a formal stance on the bill, said she was concerned it would cut Medicaid too deeply and said she wants to see an upcoming analysis by the Congressional Budget Office before making a decision. I have very serious concerns about the bill, she said on ABCs This Week program. Its hard for me to see the bill passing this week. Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has pushed for a vote before the July 4th Independence Day holiday recess that begins at the end of this week. He can afford to lose the support of only two Republicans in the face of unanimous Democratic opposition. Five Republican senators have announced they will not support the bill, which is designed to repeal and replace Obamacare, in its current form. One of those senators, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, called on Sunday for a slowdown in the process to give the Senate and the public time to evaluate the healthcare bill. We dont have enough information. I dont have the feedback from constituencies who will not have had enough time to view the Senate bill. We should not be voting on this next week, he said on NBCs Meet the Press. Another senator who has announced that he does not support the current version of the bill, Rand Paul of Kentucky, said he would back it if the Senate reached an impasse on healthcare. If we get to impasse, if we go to a bill that is more repeal and less big government programs, yes Ill consider partial repeal, Paul said on ABC. The Senates 142-page proposal, worked out in secret by a group led by McConnell, aims to deliver on a central campaign promise of President Donald Trump to undo former President Barack Obamas signature healthcare law, which has provided coverage to 20 million Americans since it was passed in 2010. Republicans view the law, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, as a costly government intrusion and say individual insurance markets created by it are collapsing. I think they have, at best, a 50-50 chance of passing this bill, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said on ABC. He said Democrats are doing everything we can to fight this bill because its so devastating for the middle class. The House of Representatives has passed a measure similar to the Senate plan. The Senate would phase out Obamacares expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor more gradually than the House bill, waiting until after the 2020 presidential election, but would enact deeper cuts starting in 2025.

Both rallies attracted only a few dozen supporters, with nearly as many counterprotesters at one of the events on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. That contrasted with recent marches that have filled U.S. cities with hundreds of thousands of people protesting Trump policies they believe harm immigrants, women and other groups. Richard Spencer, an avowed white nationalist and founder of the so-called alt-right movement, drew about 100 supporters to the rally at the Lincoln Memorial, a monument to the president associated with the end of slavery in the United States. In remarks to reporters before his speech, Spencer said he was disappointed with Trumps presidency so far, and was waiting for the president to enact the policies he promised during his campaign. Wheres the Muslim ban? said Spencer, who following Trumps election victory was filmed saying Hail Trump and drawing Nazi-like salutes at a conference. Wheres the wall? he added, referring to Trumps plan to increase barriers along the U.S. border with Mexico. As Spencer addressed the crowd, two protesters unfurled a banner in front of him that read: NO LONGER SILENT WE WILL BE HEARD. Speakers led the crowd in chants of Unite the Right, as counter-protesters heckled from the sidelines. A short distance away in front of the White House, Trump supporters gathered to denounce celebrities such as the comedian Kathy Griffin and the actor Johnny Depp, who have both made joking allusions to Trump being assassinated. Both celebrities have apologized. Among the scheduled speakers was Michael Flynn Jr., the son of retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, who briefly served as Trumps national security adviser before being fired, and Roger Stone, a longtime Trump adviser. Stone withdrew, citing security concerns. Speakers at the rally said they were also angered by a recent production of Shakespeares Julius Caesar in New York Citys Central Park for its portrayal of the assassinated Roman ruler as a Trump-like blond populist in a business suit.

(Reuters) - Officials with the conservative U.S. political network overseen by the Koch brothers say they are unhappy with the healthcare bill that may be voted on by the Senate this week and will lobby for changes to it. At a weekend event with conservative donors, top aides to Charles Koch, the billionaire energy magnate, said the Senate bill does not go far enough to dismantle former President Barack Obamas signature healthcare law, also known as Obamacare. We have been disappointed that movement has not been more dramatic toward a full repeal, said Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity, a grassroots advocacy group backed by Charles Koch and his brother, David. The Senates 142-page proposal, worked out in secret by a group led by Senate Majority Leader McConnell, aims to deliver on a central campaign promise of President Donald Trump to repeal Obamacare, which has provided coverage to 20 million Americans since its passage in 2010. Republicans view the law, formally called the Affordable Care Act, as a costly government intrusion and say individual insurance markets created by it are collapsing. Phillips and other aides to the Koch network told Reuters they want to see the Senate bill do more to roll back Obamacares expansion of the Medicaid program for poor and disabled Americans. They also contend the bill does not do enough to reform the U.S. healthcare system and cut costs. The aides said lobbying efforts to reshape the bill are continuing ahead of a planned vote. Similar concerns helped steer the Houses version of the bill in a more conservative direction. A primary mover of that effort, Mark Meadows, a Republican congressman from North Carolina, attended the Koch donor event. Meadows, chairman of the conservative Freedom Caucus in the House, said he is prepared to support the Senate bill if it clears that chamber, a sign that quick action to land the legislation on Trumps desk is possible. However, Meadows said the Senate version of the bill would need to be amended to allow insurers who sell plans on Obamacares insurance exchanges to offer less-expensive plans that do not comply with that laws coverage requirements. Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who currently opposes the Senate bill, has offered an amendment along those lines. Cruz attended the Koch event here, as did Senators Jeff Flake of Arizona and Ben Sasse of Nebraska, who remain undecided. Meadows also seeks an amendment that would allow some consumers who have private health savings accounts to deduct the cost of insurance premiums from their taxes. Senate leaders have set a goal of passing the healthcare measure by the end of this week, ahead of the July 4 congressional recess, which would then send it back to the House. If the Senate passes legislation this week that is palatable to the House, Meadows said it is conceivable the House could pass that version and choose to forgo a formal conference committee that would reconcile the Senate and House bills. That, he said, could result in sending the bill to Trumps desk for his signature before the recess. Getting a vote by the end of the week could be difficult. Five Senate Republicans, including Cruz, have publicly voiced their opposition to the current Senate draft. No Senate Democrats are expected to back it, which means McConnell cannot afford to lose more than two Senate Republicans. As a sign of the Koch networks influence, Phillips said his organization is prepared to spend as much as $400 million before next years congressional elections to advocate for the networks conservative causes.

The lawmakers, from the Republican and Democratic parties, said in a letter to Trump that high-level engagement with India had failed to eliminate major trade and investment barriers and had not deterred India from imposing new ones. Many sectors of the Indian economy remain highly and unjustifiably protected, and India continues to be a difficult place for American companies to do business, they wrote,  noting that a 2017 World Bank report ranked India 130th out of 190 countries for ease of doing business. The lawmakers - Republican House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady and Ranking Member Richard Neal, and Republican Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch and Ranking Member Ron Wyden - said the bilateral economic  relationship severely underperforms as a result of Indias failure to enact market-based reforms. They said the barriers covered multiple sectors and included high tariffs, inadequate protection of intellectual property rights, and inconsistent and non-transparent licensing and regulatory practices. Among U.S. goods affected were solar and information technology products, telecommunications equipment and biotechnology products, they said. The lawmakers also pointed to limitations on foreign participation in professional services, restrictive foreign equity caps for financial, retail, and other major services sectors and barriers to digital trade and Internet services. The list is long and growing, they said. Modi is due to meet with about 20 leading U.S. CEOs in Washington on Sunday before his first meeting with Trump on Monday at the White House, when he will seek to revitalize ties that have appeared to drift, in spite of the priority they were afforded under former President Barack Obama. While progress is expected in defense trade and cooperation, Trump, who campaigned on an America First platform has been irritated by the growing U.S. trade deficit with India and has called for reform of the H1B visa system that has benefited Indian tech firms. Other signs of friction have included Trump accusing New Delhi of negotiating unscrupulously at the Paris climate talks to walk away with billions in aid.

The decision, confirmed by three U.S. officials, would break with longstanding protocol at the State Department over how to identify offending countries and could prompt accusations the Trump administration is prioritizing security and diplomatic interests ahead of human rights.  Tillerson overruled his own staffs assessments on the use of child soldiers in both countries and rejected the recommendation of senior diplomats in Asia and the Middle East who wanted to keep Iraq and Myanmar on the list, said the officials, who have knowledge of the internal deliberations. Tillerson also rejected an internal State Department proposal to add Afghanistan to the list, the three U.S. officials said. One official said the decisions appeared to have been made following pressure from the Pentagon to avoid complicating  assistance to the Iraqi and Afghan militaries, close U.S. allies in the fight against Islamist militants. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity. Foreign militaries on the list can face sanctions including a prohibition on receiving U.S. military aid, training and U.S.-made weapons unless the White House issues a waiver. Human rights officials expressed surprise at the delisting, which was expected to be announced on Tuesday, the officials said, as part of the State Departments annual Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report. A State Department official said the TIP reports contents were being kept under wraps until its release and the department does not discuss details of internal deliberations. The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Under the Child Soldiers Prevention Act of 2008, the U.S. government must be satisfied that no children are recruited, conscripted or otherwise compelled to serve as child soldiers in order for a country to be removed from the list and U.S. military assistance to resume. In the lead-up to Tuesdays report, the State Departments Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, which researches the issue and helps shape U.S. policy on it, along with its legal office and diplomatic bureaus in Asia and the Middle East concluded that the evidence merited keeping both countries on the list, the officials said. Officials said that although the report had been finalized there was always the possibility of last-minute changes. Human Rights Watch said removing Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, from the list would be a completely premature and disastrous action that will effectively betray more children to continued servitude and rights abuses. The decision also would put the Trump administration at odds with the United Nations, which continues to list the Myanmar military, along with seven ethnic armed groups, on its list of entities using and recruiting child soldiers. Whats particularly astonishing is this move ignores that the U.N. in Burma says that it is still receiving new cases of children being recruited by the Myanmar military, said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. Rights groups have long accused Myanmar of using child soldiers. Bordering both China and India, Myanmar is also of growing strategic importance to the United States at a time of increasing encroachment in the region by China, which has sought closer relations with its neighbor. Iraq, which has received more than $2 billion in U.S. arms and training over the last three years, was added to the State Departments Child Soldier Prevention Act Listin 2016. However, the flow of U.S. assistance has continued. Former President Barack Obama handed out full or partial waivers regularly, including last year to Iraq, Myanmar, Nigeria, South Sudan and others out of 10 countries on the list. Last years State Department report said some militias of Iraqs Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), an umbrella group of mostly Shiite Muslim factions with ties to the Iraqi government and backed by Iran, recruited and used child soldiers. The report said that despite the PMF being funded by the government, Baghdad struggled to control all of its factions. The government did not hold anyone accountable for child recruitment and use by the PMF and PMF-affiliated militias. Human Rights Watch said in January that it had learned that militias had been recruiting child soldiers from one Iraqi refugee camp since last spring. The broader TIP report, the first of Trumps presidency, is sure to be closely scrutinized for further signs that under his America First approach there will be little pressure brought to bear on friendly governments, especially strategically important ones, for human rights violations at home.

Five Republican senators have announced they will not support the bill, which is designed to repeal and replace Obamacare, in its current form. White House officials said on Friday that Trump has been in touch with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and made calls on Thursday and Friday to other lawmakers. Trumps role is expected to become more pronounced in coming days as the vote nears. Senate Republican leaders may rely on the deal-making former businessman to lean on conservative senators who are balking at the bill. Were pleasantly surprised with a lot of the support thats already come out and I think well continue to work through (it,) in particular the four individuals who have expressed some ideas and concerns, White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters at a White House briefing. With all Democrats expected to oppose the measure, the Republicans can afford to lose the support of only two of their 52 members if they want to pass the legislation. After Spicer spoke, Republican Senator Dean Heller became the fifth Republican opponent on Friday, saying he would not support the bill in its current form.  This bill thats currently in front of the United States Senate is not the answer, Heller, a moderate who is up for re-election in 2018, said at a news conference in Las Vegas. That could add Hellers name to Trumps call list. A White House official said the Trump has pushed his team to stay involved and plans to flex his negotiating muscle, the official said. An outside political group aligned with the White House, America First Policies, said it is planning an advertising campaign targeting Heller for his opposition to the bill. Healthcare stocks closed down 0.1 percent on Friday, clawing back some losses after the sector dropped sharply late in the session on Hellers announcement. The Senates 142-page proposal, worked out in secret by a group led by McConnell, aims to deliver on a central Trump campaign promise to undo former President Barack Obamas signature healthcare law, which has provided coverage to 20 million Americans since it was passed in 2010. Republicans view the law, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, as a costly government intrusion and say individual insurance markets created by it are collapsing. On Thursday, four of the Senates most conservative members said the new plan failed to rein in the federal governments role. Rand Paul, who has rejected the plan along with fellow Republican Senators Ted Cruz, Mike Lee and Ron Johnson, said fundamental problems remained that would leave taxpayers subsidizing health insurance companies. Trump, in an interview with Fox News that aired on Friday morning, called the group of conservative lawmakers four very good people. Its not that theyre opposed, he said. Theyd like to get certain changes. And well see if we can take care of that. Trump said getting approval would require traveling a very, very narrow path but that I think were going to get there. Its going to be a good bill, Trump said in a separate Fox News interview to air on Sunday.   For the House of Representatives version of healthcare, Trump held regular meetings with representatives at the White House. He celebrated the bills narrow passage last month in a Rose Garden event with House Republican leaders.  Trump later criticized the House bill privately as mean and this week called for a health plan with heart. He indicated the Senate plan met that request. McConnell said in an interview with Reuters last month that he told Trump early on in the process that he did not need his help but that there may be a role for him later. The Senate bill maintains much of the structure of the Houses but differs in key ways. It would phase out Obamacares expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor more gradually, waiting until after the 2020 presidential election, but would enact deeper cuts starting in 2025. It also would provide more generous tax subsidies than the House bill to help low-income people buy private insurance. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters that while Trump retains the authority to dismiss special counsel Robert Mueller, he has no intention of doing that. Trump voiced concern in a TV interview on Fox News on Friday about what he said was the close relationship between former FBI Director James Comey and Mueller, who was named to take over the Russia investigation after Trump fired Comey. Hes very, very good friends with Comey, which is bothersome, Trump told Fox News. Look, there has been no obstruction. There has been no collusion. There has been leaking by Comey. Lawmakers investigating allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election have raised questions about whether Comeys May 9 firing was an attempt by Trump to stop the Russia probe. While White House officials have said the firing was due to concerns about Comeys actions at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Trump told an interviewer the Russia investigation was one of his concerns in taking the action. But the president insists his campaign did not collude with Russia and that his firing of Comey did not obstruct justice. Theres been no collusion, no obstruction and virtually everybody agrees to that, Trump told Fox, adding that Mueller is an honorable man and hopefully hell come up with an honorable solution. Russia denies it meddled in the U.S. presidential election. In excerpts from a separate interview, Trump criticized President Barack Obama for inaction in the face of Russian meddling.  Well I just heard today for the first time that Obama knew about Russia a long time before the election, and he did nothing about it, Trump said, according to excerpts from a Fox News interview to be broadcast on Sunday.  In congressional testimony on Wednesday, Jeh Johnson, who headed the Homeland Security Department under Obama, said his department had warned about hacking into voter databases.

The UAE denied the allegations in a statement to AP. The AP report said U.S. forces have been involved in interrogations of detainees, citing senior American defense officials.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Congressional leaders are quietly working on a bipartisan deal to raise the U.S. debt ceiling within weeks, hoping to prevent the difficult debt issue from snarling a budget fight to come in September, a senior Democratic budget writer said on Friday. John Yarmuth, top Democrat on the U.S. House of Representatives Budget Committee, told Reuters there is bipartisan interest in raising the debt limit before August. There is talk going on, there is leadership conversation about this, said Yarmuth, who added that House Democrats do not plan to demand concessions from Republicans in exchange for supporting a debt limit increase. Unlike most countries, the U.S. government has a statutory limit on how much money it can borrow to cover the budget deficit that results from Washington spending more than it collects in taxes. Only Congress can raise that limit.  The Trump administration has warned the debt limit will need to be raised in the fall. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin last month moved the target deadline for action to September from October, saying tax receipts are coming in slower than expected. Senate Republicans remain in contact with the administration on the issue, but dont have further updates on their plans, a senior aide said. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi has said Democrats will support a clean debt-limit bill, free of conditions. Conservative Republicans in the House Freedom Caucus have traditionally voted against clean increases and have already indicated they would like to raise the debt limit less than requested by the Trump administration. Congresss agenda is crowded, with healthcare legislation pending and a deal needed by late September on funding the government. Raising the debt limit adds another obligation. Over the past decade, raising the limit went from a routine job to a politically charged negotiation. In 2011, under former Democratic President Barack Obama, Republicans began demanding concessions in exchange for their votes to raise the limit. As a result, the nation twice went to the brink of busting the debt ceiling before an agreement could be reached. Yarmuth said Democrats are not opposed to attaching a debt ceiling increase to bipartisan legislation, but warned against adding poison pills.  I dont think our side wants to play games with this, he said. Bipartisan discussions in the Senate on the debt limit have not begun, a leadership aide confirmed.      Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told reporters earlier this week that the responsibility for raising the limit lies with Republicans and warned against tying the debt limit to deficit-creating tax cuts for the rich.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump could find Democratic support for a corporate tax reform package if a comprehensive tax code overhaul runs aground over Republican infighting, a Democratic lawmaker told Reuters on Friday. Representative John Yarmuth, top Democrat on the House of Representatives Budget Committee, predicted Trumps promise to deliver the biggest tax reform since Ronald Reagan would have to be scaled back if the Republican-controlled Senate fails next week to adopt legislation dismantling Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act. The Trump administration and Republican congressional leaders are trying to agree in closed-door talks on a comprehensive 2017 tax reform bill that would cut taxes for individuals and businesses and overhaul the U.S. tax code. Their aim is to unveil legislation in September.  But a Republican effort to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, which would could ease the path to tax reform, faces difficulties in the Senate, where a healthcare measure is opposed by enough lawmakers to block passage. Yarmuth, a Kentucky Democrat, said there are also few signs that House and Senate Republicans can unify their fractured caucuses to pass a fiscal 2018 budget resolution, which they must do to enact tax reform without Democratic votes. Tax reform is going to be really difficult, Yarmuth said. If they limited it to corporate tax reform, I think theres an opportunity to get it home and get it done on a bipartisan basis. Trump wants to cut business tax rates to 15 percent. Yarmuth said a fair amount of Democrats agree that the current 35 percent corporate tax rate is too high and should be more competitive with other countries. A bipartisan package could lower the corporate tax rate to 25 percent or 28 percent and include measures to help small businesses, Yarmuth said.    Republicans have thus far balked at the idea of a narrow corporate tax deal. On Thursday, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady said Republicans would reject tax legislation that left the corporate rate at around 28 percent.   But tax rate targets have eluded Republican efforts to hammer out a deal. Some lawmakers say a defeat for the Senate healthcare bill would make tax reform harder by leaving in place hundreds of billions of dollars in Obamacare taxes Meanwhile, the House Budget Committee hopes to send a budget proposal to the floor next week that would include a procedural path for tax reform to proceed with only Republican votes, panel members said. They warned that any Republican deal within the committee did not ensure speedy passage in the Republican-led House, where conservative Republicans want a budget that includes steep cuts to domestic spending, which more moderate Republicans oppose. Yarmuth said Republicans, at one point, considered using language in a 2018 budget proposal - known as reconciliation instructions - for both tax reform and healthcare, a move that could keep hopes for dismantling Obamacare alive if the Senate fails to pass a bill.

Four conservative lawmakers said they could not support it in its current form, leaving Republicans short of the votes they need for passage. Democrats are united in opposition.     The 142-page proposal, worked out in secret by a group led Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, aims to deliver on a central campaign promise of President Donald Trump by rolling back former President Barack Obamas signature healthcare law, which has provided coverage to millions of Americans since it was passed in 2010. Republicans view the law, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, as a costly government intrusion into the private marketplace. Trump welcomed the bill but indicated that changes may be in store. I am very supportive of the Senate #Healthcarebill. Look forward to making it really special! he wrote on Twitter. Trump urged the House of Representatives to pass a similar bill in May, only to criticize it in private as mean once it passed. He said on Wednesday he wanted a health plan with heart.  Democrats immediately attacked the legislation as a callous giveaway to the rich that would leave millions without coverage. The president said the House bill was mean, said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. The Senate bill may be even meaner. Obama weighed in on Facebook. If theres a chance you might get sick, get old, or start a family  this bill will do you harm, he wrote. The Senates most conservative members said the plan did not do enough to scale back the U.S. governments role. This current bill does not repeal Obamacare. It does not keep our promises to the American people, said Senator Rand Paul, who along with fellow Republican Senators Ted Cruz, Mike Lee and Ron Johnson said they could not support it in its current form. Shares of hospital companies and health insurers rose on the bills release, with the overall S&P 500 healthcare sector closing up 1.1 percent at an all-time high. The initial proposal I think is more generous and more positive to the industry than expected, said Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager with Gabelli Funds. Over months of often bitter debate, Republicans have struggled to craft legislation that lowers costs and reduces government involvement, while minimizing the inevitable disruptions that would come with a revamp of a sector that accounts for one-sixth of the worlds largest economy. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that the House bill would kick 23 million Americans off their health plans, and the legislation is unpopular with the public. Fewer than one in 3 Americans supports it, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. The Senate measure maintains much of the structure of the House bill, but differs in several key ways. The Senate bill would phase out Obamacares expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor more gradually than the House version, waiting until after the next presidential election in 2020, but would enact deeper cuts starting in 2025. It would also allow states to add work requirements for some of the 70 million Americans who depend on the program.  The legislation also provides more generous tax subsidies than the House bill to help low-income people buy private insurance.  Those subsidies would be based on income, rather than the age-based subsidies contained in the House bill - a major improvement, according to Republican Senator Susan Collins, a key moderate who has expressed concern over the bills impact on the poor.  The Senate legislation provides less money, however, for the opioid epidemic, allocating $2 billion in 2018, compared with  $45 billion over 10 years in the House version.  Both versions would repeal the 3.8 percent net investment income tax on high earners, a key target for Republicans.  They also would repeal a penalty imposed on large employers that do not provide insurance to their workers, and remove the fine that Obamacare imposes on those who choose to go uninsured. Policy experts said that would keep more young, healthy people out of the market and likely create a sicker patient pool. The Senate bill would provide money to stabilize the individual insurance market, allotting $15 billion a year in 2018 and 2019 and $10 billion a year in 2020 and 2021. It proposes defunding Planned Parenthood for a year, but abortion-related restrictions are less stringent than the House version because of uncertainty over whether they would comply with Senate rules. They could be included in another Senate bill. McConnell said Democrats chose not to help frame the bill, which Republicans say would fix a collapsing health marketplace. Republicans believe we have a responsibility to act, and we are, he said. Democrats say they offered to help fix Obamacare but were rebuffed. The bills real-world impact is not yet known, but the CBO is expected to provide an estimate early next week. As lawmakers spoke about the legislation on the Senate floor, a protest erupted outside McConnells personal office, with many people in wheelchairs blocking a hallway, holding signs and chanting: No cuts to Medicaid. U.S. Capitol Police said 43 protesters were arrested and charged with obstruction. Aside from the quartet of conservatives, none of the other 48 Republican senators appeared to reject the bill out of hand. But several said they would check with home-state constituents before taking a position.

Comey was leading the investigation into allegations Russia tried to sway the election toward Trump and the possibility Trump associates colluded with Moscow when the president fired him on May 9, sparking a political firestorm. Look there has been no obstruction, there has been no collusion, Trump told Fox News Channel in an interview set to air on Friday. Fox released a partial transcript of the interview on Thursday. The former head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation testified before a Senate committee that Trump had asked him to drop a probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynns alleged ties to Russia. Earlier on Thursday, Trump said he did not make and does not possess any tapes of his conversations with Comey, after suggesting last month he might have recordings that could undercut Comeys description of events. I have no idea whether there are tapes or recordings of my conversations with James Comey, but I did not make, and do not have, any such recordings, Trump wrote on Twitter. Lawmakers investigating allegations of Russian interference in the U.S. election had asked the White House for any such recordings. Shortly after dismissing Comey, Trump mentioned the possibility of tapes in a Twitter post. James Comey better hope that there are no tapes of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press! Trump tweeted on May 12. Allegations of ties to Russia have cast a shadow over Trumps first five months in office, distracting from attempts by his fellow Republicans in Congress to overhaul the U.S. healthcare and tax systems. Trump has privately told aides that the threat of the existence of tapes forced Comey to tell the truth in his recent testimony, a source familiar with the situation said. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, said Trump still had questions to answer about possible tapes. If the president had no tapes, why did he suggest otherwise? Did he seek to mislead the public? Was he trying to intimidate or silence James Comey? And if so, did he take other steps to discourage potential witnesses from speaking out? Schiff said in a statement. CNN reported on Thursday that two top U.S. intelligence officials told investigators Trump suggested they publicly deny any collusion between his campaign and Russia, but that they did not feel he had ordered them to do so.  Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and National Security Agency Director Admiral Mike Rogers met separately last week with investigators for special counsel Robert Mueller and the Senate Intelligence Committee, according to CNN.  The two officials said they were surprised at Trumps suggestion and found their interactions with him odd and uncomfortable, but they did not act on the presidents requests, CNN reported, citing sources familiar with their accounts. Reuters was unable to verify the CNN report. In his interview with Fox, Trump expressed concern about what he described as the close relationship between Comey and Mueller, who was appointed to take over the investigation after Comey was fired. Well hes very, very good friends with Comey, which is very bothersome, Trump said, according to the Fox transcript.

I think it strikes a balance. He added that the blueprint can still be amended and probably will. Three members of the Senate Republican leadership - John Cornyn of Texas, John Thune of South Dakota, and John Barrasso of Wyoming - all put out supportive statements, saying the bill would help improve the affordability of healthcare. Barrasso said the bill was not perfect, and we will be working to improve on this draft.

Lamar Alexander of Tennessee listed a number of benefits for his constituents in the draft, including that it makes no change in Medicare benefits.

Bill Cassidy of Louisiana: Im undecided. I have to read the text. Marco Rubio of Florida said he will decide how to vote on health care on the basis of how it impacts Florida. Dean Heller of Nevada said he had serious concerns about the bills impact on Medicaid in his state. Susan Collins of Maine said it was too soon to judge the bill and she has some concerns about cuts to Medicaid after 2025 and defunding of Planned Parenthood. Rob Portman of Ohio said in a statement that he continued to have real concerns about the Medicaid policies in the bill, especially those that affect drug treatment. He said his decision will depend on what is in the final version of the bill. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said, Im going to read it. James Risch of Idaho: Its a work in progress. Ask me again when we see the final product. John McCain of Arizona said he is reading the bill. Its a big thing, we just found out about it. I am just waiting until I can absorb the entire bill. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said in a statement that any replacement plan must be a net improvement over Obamacare, and he would be reviewing the draft legislation over the next several days.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - After weeks of discussions behind closed doors, the U.S. Senate unveiled a draft of its healthcare bill on Thursday that would overhaul the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare.  The House of Representatives narrowly passed its healthcare bill last month. If the Senate passes its bill, the House will either have to vote on the Senate version of the legislation or the two chambers will have to reconcile their differences in a conference committee.  Obamacare extended coverage to some 20 million additional Americans through both subsidized private insurance and an expansion of Medicaid. Since its passage in 2010, Republicans have campaigned on repealing the program and argued that the law is too costly and represents undue government interference in Americans healthcare.  Here is how the two bills compare on their main provisions:  Under Obamacare, more than 30 states, including about a dozen states with Republican governors, expanded the Medicaid government health insurance program for the poor and disabled. Both bills would roll back the expansion and significantly overhaul the program, which provides insurance to nearly 70 million people. SENATE: The draft legislation would phase out Obamacares expansion of Medicaid over three years, from 2021 to 2024. It would then overhaul the program and reduce its federal funding more than the House bill would, beginning in 2025. HOUSE: The bill would allow the Medicaid expansion to continue until Jan. 1, 2020. After that date, expansion would end, and people who enrolled in the expansion could not re-enroll once they leave. Medicaid funding would be capped on a per-person basis. SENATE: The bill would repeal most Obamacare taxes beginning after Dec. 31, 2016, including the 3.8 percent net investment income tax on wealthy Americans. The tax on branded prescription brands would be repealed in 2018, and the legislation would delay the so-called Cadillac tax on high-cost employer-provided insurance. It would also provide more generous tax credits for the purchase of private health insurance for people between zero and 350 percent of the federal poverty level based on income. Under Obamacare, those between 100 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level were eligible for tax credits.  HOUSE: The bill would repeal most Obamacare taxes retroactively after Dec. 31, 2016, and delay the Cadillac tax to 2026. It would provide flat age-based tax credits for the purchase of private health insurance ranging from $2,000 to $4,000 per year that would be capped at upper-income levels.  Both bills would repeal the penalties associated with the individual mandate that nearly everyone purchase health insurance or else pay a fine, and the mandate that employers provide insurance to employees.  SENATE: The legislation would maintain the popular Obamacare provision that young adults be allowed to stay on their parents health insurance until age 26. It would also prevent insurers from discriminating against those with pre-existing conditions, but would give states flexibility to opt out of so-called essential health benefits, such as maternity care and prescription drug coverage, that experts said could make it harder for some sick people to find affordable plans. The bill would also allow insurers to charge older Americans up to five times more than younger Americans. HOUSE: The bill would allow young adults to remain on their parents insurance until age 26. It would allow states to opt out of essential health benefits and Obamacares requirement that insurers charge sick and healthy people the same rates. It would also let insurers mark up premiums by 30 percent for those who have a lapse in insurance coverage of about two months or more. Insurers could charge older Americans up to five times more than younger Americans. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

U.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith in Michigan issued an order staying the deportation of the Iraqis for at least two weeks as he decides whether he has jurisdiction over the matter. Goldsmith said it was unclear whether the Iraqis would ultimately succeed.  The arrests shocked the close-knit Iraqi community in Michigan. Six Michigan lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives urged the government to hold off on the removals until Congress can be given assurances about the deportees safety. The Michigan arrests were part of a coordinated sweep in recent weeks by immigration authorities who detained about 199 Iraqi immigrants around the country. They had final deportation orders and convictions for serious crimes.  The roundup followed Iraqs agreement to accept deportees as part of a deal that removed the country from President Donald Trumps revised temporary travel ban.  Some of those affected came to the United States as children and committed their crimes decades ago, but they had been allowed to stay because Iraq previously declined to issue travel documents for them. That changed after the two governments came to the agreement in March. A U.S. Department of Justice spokeswoman could not immediately be reached for comment on the ruling. Lee Gelernt, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union representing the Iraqis in Michigan, said: The courts action today was legally correct and may very well have saved numerous people from abuse and possible death. The U.S. government has argued that the district court does not have jurisdiction over the case. Only immigration courts can decide deportation issues, which can then only be reviewed by an appeals court, it said. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has said that people with convictions for murder, rape, assault, kidnapping, burglary and drugs and weapons charges were among the Iraqis arrested nationwide. The ACLU argued that many of those affected in Michigan are Chaldean Catholics who are widely recognized as targets of brutal persecution in Iraq.  Some Kurdish Iraqis were also picked up in Nashville, Tennessee. In a letter on Thursday, Tennessee Representative Jim Cooper, a Democrat, asked the Iraqi ambassador whether Iraq would be able to ensure safe passage for them if they were returned.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""NEW YORK (Reuters) - The latest lawyer hired to represent U.S. President Donald Trump in the federal investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election is an ex-Marine who likens some cases to war. I fight hard, John Dowd said in an interview. I believe thats what Im supposed to do. I am not a snowflake, I can tell you that. Snowflake is a disparaging term for people considered overly sensitive and fragile that has been adopted by some Trump supporters to mock liberals. Dowd, who spoke with Reuters on Wednesday, is a mirror of his client in many ways. He has a no-holds-barred, hyperbolic style and a history of attacking prosecutors, congressional Democrats and the media. The 76-year-old Washington lawyer, who retired from the firm of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld in 2014, brings criminal defense and government investigation experience to Trumps legal team.  The team, led by New York lawyer Marc Kasowitz, is tasked with responding to Robert Mueller, the special counsel named by the Justice Department to probe whether anyone associated with Trump or his campaign had any illegal dealings with Russian officials or others with ties to the Kremlin. Russian officials have denied meddling in the U.S. election, and Trump denies any collusion by his campaign. In what Dowd said would be his last major trial, he defended  billionaire hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam in one of the biggest insider trading cases of all time.  Rajaratnam was convicted of all 14 insider trading counts and sentenced to 11 years in prison in 2011. Former Assistant U.S. Attorney Reed Brodsky, who prosecuted the case, said Dowd put on a strong defense in the face of overwhelming evidence. This is war, and I will defeat you, Brodsky recalled Dowd declaring in one phone conversation. Dowd confirmed the sentiment on Wednesday. It is a war, he said of such cases. His tactics in the Rajaratnam case reflected that belief. Dowd aggressively challenged the prosecutions stance on what constituted insider trading. He also fought the governments wiretaps of his clients cell phone, claiming investigators gamed the system.   Brodsky said he believed the physically commanding 6-foot-4-inch-tall Dowd would be a ferocious defender of the president.  In a manner similar to Trump, Dowd lashed out at what he perceived to be improper leaks by prosecutors and the Federal Bureau of Investigation during the Rajaratnam case, singling out then-Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in particular.  He sat in the back of the courtroom with his press dogs, Dowd said. It was the most atrocious thing Ive ever seen. Dowd also went after reporters. Bharara, who declined to comment on Wednesday, last weekend retweeted an intemperate 2011 email the defense lawyer sent to a Wall Street Journal reporter he accused of whoring for the prosecution. In another encounter with the press caught on camera, Dowd swore at and gave the middle finger to a CNBC reporter.    Like Trump, Dowd has a tendency to put his own spin on adverse news. After the Rajaratnam verdict, Dowd argued the defense is winning because the prosecution chose not to pursue 23 other allegations of insider trading. The score is 23-14, he told reporters. In a 2007 congressional probe of politically motivated firings of U.S. Attorneys, Dowd complained of McCarthyism when his client, former Justice Department official Monica Goodling, was criticized by Democrats for invoking the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination. Dowd represented U.S. Senator John McCain on congressional ethics charges in the 1980s Keating Five banking scandal and conducted the Major League Baseball investigation that led to former Hall of Famer Pete Rose being banned from the sport for betting on games while he was manager of the Cincinnati Reds. Dowd would not discuss legal strategy for Trump but said the team the president had assembled was great. Were all fighters, he said.  Though his hiring was first reported Friday, a person familiar with the matter said Dowd has been working with the team for weeks. Dowd said he knew Kasowitz partner Michael Bowe, who is also representing Trump, and met with Kasowitz at the end of May. Jay Sekulow, another member of the team, has been appearing on television on Trumps behalf. Dowd also said he talked with the president but declined to describe their conversation. He called Trump a fighter for the people and said the president had done nothing wrong. A onetime military lawyer with the U.S. Marine Corps, Dowd noted his shared service in declining to criticize Mueller, a Marine platoon leader during the Vietnam War. Bobby is doing what he has to do and hell do a good job, said Dowd. Hes a fellow Marine and hes a good man. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Knopf.  The book, as yet untitled, is about the search for justice, not just in criminal cases but in life and society in general, Knopf said in a statement on Thursday. Publication is expected in January 2019. Bharara said his book would be about the law, integrity, leadership, decision making, and moral reasoning. It addresses what it means to do the right thing, how to avoid doing the wrong thing, and the role of thoughtfulness in making the best choice, Bharara said in a statement. In 2009, President Barack Obama appointed Bharara to serve as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, which includes Manhattan.  During seven and a half years as the chief federal prosecutor in that region, Bharara oversaw several notable corruption and white-collar criminal cases, as well as prosecutions of terrorism suspects. Preet Bhararas life experience, coupled with his standing as a U.S. Attorney and the cases he tried as prosecutor, makes him uniquely qualified to write this book, said Sonny Mehta, editor-in-chief for Knopf, which is a division of Penguin Random House. Bharara, now a distinguished scholar in residence at New York Universitys law school, was unexpectedly fired by Trump on March 11 after refusing to step down. He had been among 46 U.S. attorneys who were told a day earlier to submit their resignations. In November, Bharara met with Trump at Trump Tower in New York City, three weeks after the presidential election, and said at the time that they had a good meeting and he agreed to remain in his post as a federal prosecutor. He was fired a few months later. This month, Bharara told ABC News in an interview that he received unusual phone calls from Trump after the election that made him uncomfortable. He said he was fired after declining to take the third call.  Bharara said he believed Trumps calls to him violated the usual boundaries between the executive branch and independent criminal investigators. Knopf spokesman Paul Bogaards said on Thursday that Bharara addresses the circumstances of his firing in the book proposal. Whether the book itself goes into the details of Bhararas firing remains an open question, Bogaards said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Republican Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, has indicated he wants to get moving on this quickly, and we want to honor that, Ryan said at his weekly news conference. The Countering Irans Destabilizing Activities Act, which also includes new sanctions against Russia, passed the Senate 98-2 last week, a vote that looked like it might complicate President Donald Trumps desire for warmer relations with Moscow. The measure must pass the House before it can be sent to Trump to sign into law or veto. The House parliamentarian found that the legislation violated a constitutional requirement that any bill affecting government revenues must originate in the House, something known as a blue slip violation. Democrats said they were skeptical about the explanation, noting that previous blue slip issues had been resolved in a matter of minutes. Kevin Brady, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, told reporters he had sent the Senate a solution clearing the way for it to take the bill back, change it and move it forward. Ben Cardin, ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told Reuters the change did not appear to substantively alter the legislation and that staff was reviewing it to determine how to move ahead. Senior Senate Democratic aides said any bill involving sanctions or fines could be interpreted as affecting U.S. revenues. Trumps fellow Republicans hold a larger majority in the House than in the Senate. Some lawmakers and congressional aides said the White House was concerned about a provision that would require Trump to obtain Congress approval before easing any sanctions on Russia. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson urged Congress last week to ensure that any sanctions package would give Trump the flexibility to adjust sanctions. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the administration would not take a position before the bill advanced through the House. However, he acknowledged the White House needed to work with Congress on some areas of the measure. Ryan said he did not yet know if it would go through the formal markup debate and amendment process. Democrats have said that process could delay the bill for months.

The White House brought together venture capitalists and executives from the telecommunications and drone, or unmanned aerial system, industries to discuss how the government can speed technologies to market. The meeting, which lasted more than three hours including breakout sessions, is part of Trumps effort to tap industry experts on how to boost U.S. competitiveness in various fields and create jobs. On Monday, Trump met with the heads of 18 U.S. technology companies including Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp, seeking their help to make the governments computing systems more efficient. He will meet with energy industry leaders next week.     We want them to create new companies and lots of jobs, Trump told the executives on Thursday. Were going to give you the competitive advantage that you need. In attendance were chief executives of several drone companies including Kespry Inc, AirMap, Airspace Inc, Measure UAS Inc, Trumbull Unmanned, and PrecisionHawk Inc.

Senior executives at Xcel Energy Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and CenturyLink Inc also took part. Venture capital firms included Revolution LLC, headed by AOL co-founder Steve Case, 500 Startups, Cayuga Ventures, Epic Ventures and Lightspeed Ventures. Obama administration rules opened the skies to low-level small drones for education, research and routine commercial use. The Trump administration is considering whether to expand drone use for deliveries beyond the view of an operator. Security issues would need to be addressed. The Federal Aviation Administration in March estimated that by 2021 the fleet of small hobbyist drones will more than triple and commercial drones will grow tenfold to about 442,000. Last year, regulators cleared the way for next-generation 5G wireless networks, with expected speeds at least 10 times and maybe 100 times faster than todays 4G networks. Testing is under way and deployment is expected around 2020 but infrastructure hurdles remain.

Eighty-three percent also favor barring gun purchases by those on federal no-fly or watch lists, the survey found. But gun owners were far less supportive than non-owners of creating a federal database to track gun sales or to ban assault-style weapons and high-capacity magazines. The survey of 3,930 U.S. adults, including 1,269 gun owners, in March and April, provided a snapshot of American views on guns and gun policies as the nation grapples with gun violence. On June 14, an Illinois man opened fire on Republican members of Congress with legally purchased guns during a baseball practice near Washington, wounding Louisiana Representative Steve Scalise.  A few hours later, a UPS driver opened fire with a handgun inside a United Parcel Service Inc delivery center in San Francisco, killing three co-workers before fatally shooting himself. Some advocates called for a renewed push for gun control measures, as the Republican-controlled Congress has sought to relax existing gun laws. The National Rifle Association has opposed expanded background checks and argued the government was already being notified when someone on a no-fly list attempts to buy a gun. Pews survey respondents often diverged based on whether they were gun owners or non-owners, Republicans or Democrats and urban or rural residents. Overall, 52 percent of Americans say gun laws should be stricter than they are today, according to Washington-based Pew.

In a letter to the banks lawyers made public on Thursday, five Democrats who have been seeking financial information about Trump argued U.S. federal laws protecting banking customers confidentiality did not apply to requests from Congress. The bank could also circumvent privacy concerns by obtaining disclosure consent from the president and his family, they said. Given President Trumps repeated assertions that he does not have ties to Russia, such disclosure would ostensibly be in his interest, they wrote. Deutsche Bank said on Thursday that its lawyers would respond in due course.  We reiterate that while we seek to cooperate, we must obey the law, the bank said in an emailed statement. Investigations are underway in Washington into claims of collusion between Trumps inner circle and Russia during his 2016 presidential campaign - which both the president and Moscow have denied. Public records show Deutsche Bank loaned Trump millions of dollars for real-estate ventures. As well as details about those transactions, the lawmakers are seeking information about a Russian mirror trading scheme that allowed $10 billion to flow out of Russia. In January, Deutsche Bank agreed to pay $630 million in fines over the scheme, which could have been used to launder money out of Russia. In the letter, dated Wednesday, Maxine Waters, ranking Democrat on the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, and four peers reiterated requests for information and gave Deutsche Bank until June 29 to respond. They first asked the bank in May to share what it might know about Trumps real-estate business and whether the president had financial backing from Russia. Deutsche Banks Washington-based external counsel responded to that request earlier this month by saying it was barred from sharing information about Trumps finances. We hope that you will understand Deutsche Banks need to respect the boundaries that Congress and the courts have set in an effort to protect confidential information, the banks law firm, Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, wrote. A disclosure document posted on the U.S. Office of Government Ethics website last week showed liabilities for Trump of at least $130 million to Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas[DBKGK.UL], suggesting the German bank is one of Trumps biggest lenders. They included one exceeding $50 million for the Old Post Office, a historic Washington property where Trump has opened a hotel. The Democrats do not have the power to compel Deutsche Bank to comply with their request. The Financial Services Committee has subpoena power but Republican committee members, who are in the majority, would have to cooperate. No Republicans signed any of the letters to Deutsche Bank. The Russian mirror trades involved, for example, buying Russian stocks in rubles for a client and selling the identical value of a security for dollars for a related customer.

With the window for tax reform narrowing, lobbyists and analysts say Congress could abandon comprehensive tax reform for simple tax cuts to reduce the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 28 percent, well above the 15 percent advocated by President Donald Trump. But House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady, one of six principals involved in closed-door efforts to agree on legislation, told CNBC that such a measure would not meet the Republican goals of bolstering economic growth and enhancing U.S. business competitiveness overseas.   Its not acceptable to me. I dont think its acceptable to the House or anyone else, for that matter. Look, that wont make us competitive, Brady said. Just doing low rates is a little like putting supercharged fuel in an old clunker of a tax car. Theres no question itll go faster. It cant keep up with the newer models on the road, he added. Weve got to go after a competitive design.  Brady spoke as principals prepared to meet later on Thursday. Members of the group have vowed to make good this year on a top Republican campaign pledge to overhaul the U.S. tax system. But while the principals have met three times, the discussions have major issues to resolve. How low we can get these rates; how do we stop businesses from continuing to leave the U.S.; and more importantly, how do we bring those supply chains back; how we deal with issues like full and unlimited expensing  those are still parts of this discussion, Brady said.  Brady and House Speaker Paul Ryan are pushing for changes outlined in the A Better Way agenda released a year ago, including a border adjustment tax that would tax imports but exempt export revenues from federal tax. The measure could raise more than $1 trillion in revenue to help pay for tax cuts and effectively resolve the problem of corporations shifting profits overseas.

All we do is win, win, win, he told a cheering crowd. His first tweet on Thursday morning praised the special people there. A feisty Trump spoke for more than an hour at a rally in Cedar Rapids that was similar to those he held during last years presidential campaign. It included protesters escorted out by police, Trump attacking the news media and supporters waving signs saying Drain the Swamp in Washington. Trumps first trip to Iowa since taking office on Jan. 20 came against a backdrop of problems in Washington. His legislative agenda is struggling to gain traction, a federal investigation of alleged Russian meddling into the election and possible collusion with Trumps campaign continues, and his approval rating is below 40 percent in most polls. But Trump touted job gains and an improving stock market as evidence that his economic policies are working, and he lauded his wealthy appointees such as his top economic adviser Gary Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs executive, and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, a billionaire known for his investments in distressed industries. In those particular positions, I just dont want a poor person  does that make sense? Trump said.     He also vowed he would eventually get funding for a border wall with Mexico, possibly with solar panels attached, despite congressional refusal thus far. Were thinking about building the wall as a solar wall, he said. Pretty good imagination, right? Its my ideas. Solar panels along the wall are among proposals that have been submitted by companies to the Department of Homeland Security, according to media reports. Buoyed by Republican victories in special congressional elections in Georgia and South Carolina on Tuesday, Trump blasted his opponents as unbelievably nasty and said cable news anchors appeared stunned by the Democratic losses. Unable to get Democrats to join Republicans in major legislative efforts, Trump said the wounding by a gunman last week of Republican Representative Steve Scalise in Alexandria, Virginia, had fostered a spirit of unity. But he did not sound optimistic about breaking through the partisan divide any time soon. Trump said he doubted he would have help from Democrats in getting major healthcare legislation through the U.S. Congress. He wants the Senate to join the House of Representatives in approving legislation soon to overhaul the signature domestic achievement of his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama. If we went and got the single greatest healthcare plan in the history of the world we would not get one Democrat vote because theyre obstructionists, Trump said. Looking to foreign policy, Trump complained about the bad hand he had been dealt, such as North Koreas nuclear program. His comments came days after American student Otto Warmbier died after returning in a coma from captivity in North Korea. On Tuesday, Trump had tweeted that he has basically given up on getting help from Chinese President Xi Jinping on North Korea after investing a lot of effort to coaxing Beijing to use its influence on Pyongyang. I do like President Xi, said Trump, who was with the new U.S. ambassador to China, former Iowa Governor Terry Branstad. I do wish we would have a little more help on North Korea.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States pressed China to exert more economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea to help rein in its nuclear and missile programs during a round of high-level talks in Washington on Wednesday. The meeting of top U.S. and Chinese diplomats and defense chiefs was held a day after President Donald Trump said Chinas efforts to use its leverage with Pyongyang had failed, raising fresh doubts about his administrations strategy for countering the threat from North Korea. The death of American university student Otto Warmbier this week, after his release from 17 months of imprisonment in Pyongyang, has further complicated Trumps approach to North Korea, his top national security challenge. We reiterated to China that they have a diplomatic responsibility to exert much greater economic and diplomatic pressure on the regime if they want to prevent further escalation in the region, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters at a joint news conference with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. Mattis vowed to continue to take necessary measures to defend ourselves and our allies against North Korea, which is working to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the United States. But with the long-standing option of pre-emptive military strikes seen as far too risky for now, Trumps aides are stressing economic and diplomatic pressure. Tillerson said Trump would make a state visit to China this year, and Mattis said both sides agreed to expand military-to-military ties, signaling the new administrations determination to continue efforts to improve relations between the worlds two largest economies, despite frustration over North Korea. North Korea topped the agenda at the newly established Diplomatic and Security Dialogue, which paired Tillerson and Mattis with Chinese State Councilor Yang Jiechi and General Fang Fenghui, chief of joint staff of the Peoples Liberation Army. While the U.S. officials stressed agreement on the goal of North Korean denuclearization, the talks also dealt with Chinas sweeping territorial claims in the South China Sea, with the Americans reaffirming opposition to Beijings militarization of islands it is building in the strategic waterway. Tillerson urged China to help crack down on illicit North Korean activities that fund its nuclear and missile programs, and said the Chinese had agreed their companies should not do business with sanctioned North Korean entities. Tillerson stressed the need to choke off funding sources including money laundering, labor export and computer hacking. Countries around the world and in the U.N. Security Council are joining in this effort, and we hope China will do their part as well, he said. China, North Koreas main trading partner, has been accused of not fully enforcing existing U.N. sanctions on its neighbor, and has resisted some tougher measures. Washington has considered further secondary sanctions against Chinese banks and other firms doing business with North Korea. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said China did not exert so-called economic or diplomatic pressure in its interactions with other countries. What we do is to develop friendly and cooperative relations on the basis of five principles of peaceful coexistence, the  spokesman, Geng Shuang, told a regular briefing on Thursday. Trump has had high hopes for cooperation from China to exert influence over North Korea, leaning heavily on Chinese President Xi Jinping for his assistance. The two leaders met in Florida in April and Trump has  praised Xi for working on the issue, despite only modest steps so far by Beijing. At the same time, Trump has mostly held back on attacking Chinese trade practices, which he railed against during the presidential campaign. While I greatly appreciate the efforts of President Xi & China to help with North Korea, it has not worked out. At least I know China tried! Trump wrote on Twitter on Tuesday, a day after Warmbier died following his return from captivity in a coma. The tweet puzzled even Trumps own aides. Asked whether Trump had lost faith in Chinas ability to restrain North Korea, Mattis said the presidents view represented Americans frustration with Pyongyangs provocations and after seeing a young man go over there healthy, and with a minor act of mischief, come home dead, basically. Later on Wednesday, Trump said in a speech in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, that the United States has a great relationship with China and I really like President Xi. The talks followed what a U.S. official said on Tuesday were new movements detected by U.S. spy satellites at North Koreas nuclear test site. But it was unclear if Pyongyang was preparing for a sixth nuclear test. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A healthcare bill being unveiled by U.S. Senate Republicans on Thursday is expected to roll back the Obamacare expansion of the Medicaid healthcare program for the poor and reshape subsidies to low-income people buying private insurance. Those subsidies are expected to be linked to recipients income, a major improvement from a healthcare overhaul bill passed in the House of Representatives that tied them solely to age, Republican Senator Susan Collins said on Wednesday. The Washington Post reported that the bill would also repeal most of the taxes that pay for the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, give states wider latitude to opt out of its regulations and eliminate federal funding for Planned Parenthood, a healthcare provider that offers abortion services.  The healthcare bill will be released to the Republican Senate Conference on Thursday morning and posted online, senators said. A vote could come as soon as next week, several senators said. Senate Republicans have been working behind closed doors for weeks on legislation aimed at repealing and replacing major portions of Obamacare, former Democratic President Barack Obamas signature healthcare law. Obamacare extended insurance coverage to millions of Americans through both subsidized private insurance and an expansion of Medicaid. There is an urgency to get this done because of the continued collapse of the Obama healthcare law, Senator John Barrasso, a member of the Senate Republican leadership, told CNN. People across the country are suffering pain and the pain is getting worse as insurance companies are pulling out. Democrats accuse Republicans of sabotaging Obamacare, and say the Republican healthcare bill is aimed at cutting taxes for the wealthy. Democratic Senator Patty Murray of Washington said in a statement that leaked details of the bill indicated it was every bit as devastating for families bank accounts and healthcare coverage as the disastrous bill that passed in the House. President Donald Trump and fellow Republicans campaigned last year on a pledge to replace and repeal Obamacare, which they described as ineffective and government intrusion in a key sector of the economy.          Some Republican senators voiced concern on Wednesday about the rush to consider the major legislation as their partys leaders prepare to unveil it. Republican Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin said he wanted to read the bill and discuss it with constituents before he votes. Id find it hard to believe well have enough time, he said, adding that if he did not get enough information, I wont be voting yes. Democrats hoping to block the healthcare measure in the Republican-led Senate need at least two Republicans to defect. The Democrats have criticized the behind-the-scenes meetings, and blocked Senate committees on Wednesday from meeting for over two hours in protest.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, defending the closed-door sessions, has said all Senate Republicans have had a chance to participate in meetings on the bill, and that Democrats are not interested in overhauling Obamacare. Once the plan is unveiled, Senate Republicans will face a skeptical public that thinks the House version would be harmful for low-income Americans and people with pre-existing health conditions, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday.  Trump told a rally in Iowa on Wednesday night that he hoped the Senate would come up with a really good bill. Ive been talking about a plan with heart, Trump said. He had privately called the House legislation mean, according to congressional sources. Several weeks of negotiations over the bill have been plagued by tensions between moderates and conservatives. Much of the battle has been over how quickly to phase out the Medicaid expansion that took place under Obamacare. Moderates favored a seven-year phase-out, but the Senate leadership proposed three years starting in 2020. There was also an argument over Medicaids growth rate going forward, with conservatives favoring lowering the growth rate in 2025. Thats what were told it might be, said Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana.  Cassidy said senators had also been told the legislation would continue funding cost-sharing subsidies made available to help low-income Americans under Obamacare for a couple of years. Collins, a moderate Republican from Maine, said she wanted to read an assessment by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office on its impact on cost and insurance coverage before making her decision.  The first concern is how many people will lose coverage and what do the demographics of that group look like, she said.  An estimated 23 million people could lose their healthcare under a similar plan narrowly passed last month by the Republican-controlled House, according to the CBO.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""JERUSALEM (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trumps son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, met Israeli and Palestinian leaders on Wednesday to try to revive long-fractured Middle East peacemaking that Washington acknowledged will take some time. Kushner, a 36-year-old real estate developer with little experience of international diplomacy or political negotiation, arrived in Israel on Wednesday morning and was due to spend barely 20 hours on the ground. Video showed him giving Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a friend of Kushners father, a handshake and a hug as they prepared to sit down with the Israeli ambassador to Washington, the U.S. ambassador to Israel and other senior officials for preliminary discussions. This is an opportunity to pursue our common goals of security, prosperity and peace, Netanyahu said. Jared, I welcome you here in that spirit. I know of your efforts, the presidents efforts, and I look forward to working with you to achieve these common goals. Kushner replied: The president sends his best regards and its an honor to be here with you. Kushner did not speak to the media or take questions, maintaining the circumspect profile he has established since Trump took office in January. U.S. officials and Israeli leaders underscored that forging peace will take time and stressed the importance of doing everything possible to create an environment conducive to peacemaking, the White House later said in a statement. Kushner traveled to Ramallah, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, for two hours of talks with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas after iftar, the evening meal that breaks the daily Ramadan fast. Abbas spokesman Nabil Abu Rdainah said all major issues at the heart of the conflict were discussed. U.S. officials called the trip part of an effort to keep the conversation going rather than the launching of a new phase in the peace process, saying that Kushner and Jason Greenblatt, the presidents special representative for international negotiations, are likely to return often. Trump has described peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians as the ultimate deal and made it a priority. As well as receiving both Netanyahu and Abbas in the White House, he visited the region last month. But it remains unclear what approach Trump, via Kushner and Greenblatt, plans to take on resolving one of the worlds most intractable conflicts.  For at least two decades, the goal of U.S.-led diplomacy has been a two-state solution, meaning an independent Palestinian state living side-by-side and at peace with Israel. But when Trump met Netanyahu in Washington in February, he said he was not fixed on two states saying, Im looking at two-state and one-state, and I like the one that both parties like. Netanyahu has in the past given conditional backing to two states. But ahead of his last election victory in 2015, he promised there would never be a Palestinian state on his watch, a remark seen as an attempt to shore up right-wing support. In discussions with Greenblatt before Kushners visit, Palestinian sources said the phrase two-state solution had not been used. Palestinian sources said that ahead of Kushners meeting with Abbas, they had been asked to draw up a list of 12 bullet point demands they would want met in any negotiations.  They saw it as a helpful exercise in focusing on core elements rather than an oversimplification of a complex issue. Trump administration officials have said that if they are going to make progress on peace, they do not want to get bogged down in process but to move rapidly on tackling what are known as final status issues, the complexities around Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, water resources, security and borders. Those have long been thorny problems in the multiple rounds of peace negotiations launched by both Republican and Democratic presidents since the mid-1990s. It remains unclear what new approach Trumps administration may have to untangling disputes that blend politics, land, religion and ethnicity and have defied resolution for 70 years.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Frustrated Democrats pondered the partys future and questioned its campaign messaging on Wednesday after a demoralizing defeat in a Georgia congressional race widely seen as a referendum on President Donald Trumps young administration. In the most expensive congressional election in U.S. history, Republican Karen Handel, a former Georgia secretary of state, defeated political newcomer Democrat Jon Ossoff by 4 percentage points on Tuesday in a suburban Atlanta district that Republicans have held since the 1970s. The special election, to fill the seat vacated by Tom Price after Trump appointed him health and human services secretary, did not change the balance of power in Washington where Republicans control the White House and both chambers of Congress. But it was a demoralizing blow to Democrats hoping Georgia would be a breakthrough for a party trying to harvest electoral victories from the grassroots anti-Trump activism seen in marches on Washington and boisterous crowds at town hall meetings around the country. The district was seen as within reach to Democrats because Trump won there last November by only 1 percentage point. Democrats also lost a special election in South Carolina on Tuesday in a race Republicans were widely expected to win. Democrats lost two other contested special elections earlier this year for Republican-held seats in conservative Kansas and Montana. That makes the party 0-for-4 in this years races for Republican-held congressional seats. Ossoff race better be a wake up call for Democrats - business as usual isnt working, tweeted Representative Seth Moulton of Massachusetts. We need a genuinely new message, a serious jobs plan that reaches all Americans, and a bigger tent. Several prominent Democrats said the party needed to rethink its approach heading into next years congressional elections, when Democrats need to pick up 24 seats to regain control of the House of Representatives. Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut told MSNBC that Democrats needed to focus on economic growth and get back to being a big tent party. The outcome also raised questions about the future of House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Republican groups spent millions on television ads linking Ossoff to Pelosi, portraying him as a captive of the partys liberal wing despite Ossoffs efforts to present a more moderate image. In South Carolina, Charleston attorney and Democratic political newcomer Joe Cunningham said on Wednesday he would seek the House seat now held by Republican Mark Sanford, but that if elected he would not back Pelosi as the Democratic leader. The Democratic Party needs new leadership now, Cunningham tweeted.  The road to a Democratic House majority runs through dozens of districts similar to the affluent, well-educated northern suburbs of Atlanta where Ossoff was defeated, and the outcome there is likely to reassure Republicans already nervous about their chances of holding control under Trump next year. The win in Georgia also could strengthen the political will of Republicans in Congress evaluating their next steps on a tax package and what opinion polls show is a deeply unpopular replacement of President Barack Obamas signature healthcare law. Trump was quick to celebrate the Georgia win and accused Democrats of standing in the way of a legislative agenda bogged down by infighting and investigations into whether his campaign colluded with Russia in last years presidential election. At a rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on Wednesday night, Trump said: If Karen Handel had lost, they would have blamed it on me. And dont forget, this happened in Montana, in Kansas, he added. They dont get it. They havent figured it out yet. You know theyre still trying to figure where all those voters came from, he said of Democrats.  Despite the string of losses in special elections, some Democrats said there were reasons to be encouraged. In all four states, Democrats bolstered their historical performance in districts they lost by double-digit margins last year. The unpopularity of Trump and the Republican healthcare bill - along with the historic trend that the party holding the White House loses seats in midterm elections - gives Democrats hope for capturing the House in 2018. Democrats have a target-rich environment next year, starting with 23 Republican-held districts where Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton won a majority of the vote.

President Donald Trump will meet with the chief executives of General Electric Co, Honeywell International Inc and AT&T Inc AT&T Inc, major drone industry firms and venture capitalists in the latest effort by the White House to focus on innovative technologies as a way of spurring job growth. Michael Kratsios, the White Houses deputy chief technology officer, told reporters the goal of the sessions is to find ways the United States can maintain its leadership creating and fostering entirely new technologies that will drive our economic growth. The chief executives of several unmanned aerial system, or drone, companies including Kespry Inc, AirMap, Airspace Inc, Measure UAS Inc, Trumbull Unmanned, and PrecisionHawk Inc are attending the White House sessions. Senior executives at Xcel Energy Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and CenturyLink Inc are also taking part as are venture capital firms including AOL co-founder Steve Case who heads Revolution LLC, 500 Startups, Cayuga Ventures, Epic Ventures and Lightspeed Ventures. The administration wants to promote the development and commercialization of emerging technologies and speed the development of unmanned aerial vehicles or drones and 5G wireless technology, Kratsios said. The Obama administration implemented rules that opened the skies to low-level small drones for education, research and routine commercial use. The Trump administration is considering whether to expand drone use for purposes such as deliveries where aircraft would fly beyond the sight of an operator. Security issues would need to be resolved. The FAA in March estimated that by 2021 the fleet of small hobbyist drones will more than triple and the commercial drone fleet will increase tenfold to about 442,000.  Last year, the FCC cleared the way for 5G, a lightning-fast next generation of wireless services. Testing is under way and deployment is expected around 2020. New 5G networks are expected to provide speeds at least 10 times and maybe 100 times faster than todays 4G networks. The next generation of wireless signals needs to be much faster and far more responsive to allow advanced technologies such as virtual surgery or controlling machines remotely, regulators say. The networks could help wirelessly connect devices such as thermostats or washing machines to facilitate the internet of things. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two studies that President Donald Trump hopes will buttress his case to cut the number of refugees are at the heart of a fight between senior White House adviser Stephen Miller and career U.S. government officials over immigration policy, four current and former officials said.  Trump in March ordered the U.S. State Department and other agencies to tally only the costs of resettling refugees but not the benefits that policy experts said refugees can also bring, including tax revenues, professional skills and job creation. A current official said Miller had convened meetings with State Department staffers to discuss the refugee cost reports. When department specialists proposed including refugees economic contributions in the studies to produce a more balanced assessment, Miller rebuffed the idea, one current and one former U.S. official said. The White House said Miller did not hold meetings on the specific subject of the cost reports and that Trumps overall fiscal year 2018 budget proposal sought to make transparent the net budgetary effects of immigration programs and policy. The current and former officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they believe, however, that the administration wants to help make a case to restrict refugee flows by creating a skewed analysis. Its a policy outcome in search of a rationale, said a former U.S. official familiar with the debate. The White House disputed the notion that Miller was seeking to tailor the outcome of the reports, which are to be compiled mainly by the State Departments Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration (PRM).  The idea that we are ordering biased reports is false, said Michael Short, a White House spokesman. The tensions over the reports, due in September, have not been previously reported. Miller has a history of backing curbs on immigration. He  was the architect of Trumps order in January suspending the refugee program for 120 days and refugees from Syria indefinitely. That order, which also temporarily barred travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries, was largely blocked by the courts, as was a second executive order. Miller was not available for an interview. R.C. Hammond, a senior adviser to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, said a department staffer who attended budget meetings recalled Miller suggesting the State Department review the methodology and findings of existing studies on refugees. Essentially, suggesting we learn how others have examined the issue and see if there is anything we can learn, Hammond said in an email. My colleague did not take away the sense that any instructions were given to include or not include certain information. Hammond he did not identify the State Department staffer. Tensions in the government over Trumps immigration policies began with Trumps executive order, which prompted about 900 State Department employees to sign an internal memo dissenting against it in January. Weeks later, the right-wing Breitbart website, which has close ties to the White House, published a story calling for the firing - among others - of the two top officials in the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Refugee Resettlement and three senior officials at the PRM bureau. Breitbart listed the officials by name, but it did not mention the reports on refugee costs. Career officials cannot be fired, but can be reassigned. There is no evidence the five have been reassigned. Trump promised a hardline immigration policy during his 2016 presidential campaign. He called at one point for a complete ban on Muslims entering the United States, citing security reasons amid a series of attacks worldwide by Islamist militants. For the first report, Trump ordered a tally of the estimated long-term costs of the United States Refugee Admissions Program at the Federal, State, and local levels, along with recommendations about how to curtail those costs. Trump directed that the second report estimate how many refugees are being supported in countries of first asylum (near their home countries) for the same long-term cost as supporting refugees in the United States, taking into account the full lifetime cost of Federal, State, and local benefits, and the comparable cost of providing similar benefits elsewhere. Refugee policy experts said that while more refugees can be supported in third-country camps for a given sum than settled in the United States, that support does not provide a permanent solution as resettlement can. Most studies show that refugees entering the United States require more government services than immigrants as a whole. But scholars differ over the long-term economic impact of accepting refugees, which can depress low-skilled workers wages and require all workers to help pay for social services that refugees receive. During their first eight years in the United States, refugees receive more in benefits than they pay in taxes, a study published this month by the nonprofit National Bureau for Economic Research said. After the eighth year, taxes paid tend to be greater than the benefits received, by an average of $21,000 over a 20-year period, the study found. Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors limiting immigration, agreed that accountings such as those Trump ordered should not be limited to costs.  Its only fair to consider any fiscal benefits, she said. The four current and former U.S. officials said the high-level White House focus on the reports has sent a clear signal about the outcome Trump wants. When the White House calls and expresses interest...in a report of this nature, given all the things that the national security council and people around the president have to worry about, that sends an enormously profound signal to the bureaucracy, one of the former officials said.

The June 9-13 poll shows that a majority of the country thinks the American Health Care Act would be harmful for low-income Americans, people with pre-existing health conditions and Medicaid recipients.  Overall, 41 percent of American adults oppose the House plan, while 30 percent support it. Another 29 percent said they dont know, according to the poll.  Itll make peoples deductibles skyrocket said Shannon Sowards, 39, of Memphis, Tennessee, a Trump supporter who took the poll. So Im not for this healthcare act. Im for insurance for everyone. The Senate is expected to release its full plan on Thursday. (Click here to view the poll's topline results: tmsnrt.rs/2sqhmM3) The gap between what Republicans say their plan will do and what people think it will do further complicates matters for Senate Republicans, who already have been criticized for drafting their bill in secret. It would be great if a politican had the nerve to be brutally honest and tell people that healthcare costs are going up, said Joseph Antos, a healthcare expert at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. None of them seem to. For years, Republicans have promised voters they would replace Democratic former President Barack Obamas healthcare law, which they say is too costly and intrusive. When House Republicans pitched their health plan earlier this year, U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan boasted that it would lower premiums, protect people with pre-existing conditions and improve public access to high-quality, low-cost healthcare. U.S. Representative Tom MacArthur of New Jersey, who helped shape the House bill, said it would make coverage of pre-existing conditions sacrosanct for all Americans. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, however, presented a different view of the bill. It estimated that under the House plan 23 million people would lose their health coverage by 2026 in an effort to cut the federal deficit. According to the poll, nearly 60 percent of adults said they thought it would make insurance more expensive for low-income Americans and people with pre-existing conditions. Fifty-seven percent said it would make Medicaid less available, and 69 percent said it would cut federal money for Planned Parenthood. Thirteen percent felt that the House plan would improve the quality of their healthcare, and 9 percent said it would make their healthcare cheaper. About 28 percent of Americans said they would be less likely to support their congressional representative if he or she supported the House plan. Another 16 percent said they would be more likely to support their representative and 33 percent said it would make no difference. Republican respondents were more supportive of the House plan than others. And even those Republicans who did not like the House plan said that it is probably an improvement over the current healthcare system. Its not going to change my political views said Barb Huntington, 64, of Murrells Inlet, South Carolina, a Trump supporter who took the poll.  Huntington, who buys health insurance through her states Obamacare exchange, said her premiums went up by $25 per month this year. Huntington said she would not be surprised if they keep going up no matter what the Republicans do. Its going to be like that every year, and well be lucky to have what we have, she said. The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English across the United States. It gathered responses from 1,492 adults, including 671 Democrats and 501 Republicans. It has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points for the entire group, 4 percentage points for Democrats and 5 percentage points for Republicans.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russian hackers targeted 21 U.S. state election systems in the 2016 presidential race and a small number were breached but  there was no evidence any votes were manipulated, a Homeland Security Department official told Congress on Wednesday. Jeanette Manfra, the departments acting deputy undersecretary of cyber security, testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded the Kremlin orchestrated a wide-ranging influence operation that included email hacking and online propaganda to discredit Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and help Donald Trump, a Republican, win the White House in November. The Russia issue has cast a shadow over Trumps first five months in office. The extent of interference by Russian hackers, and whether they or others could interfere in future elections, has been the source of speculation and media reports for months. Russia has repeatedly denied responsibility for any cyber attacks during the election. Trump has variously said Russia may or may not have been responsible for hacking but has dismissed allegations his associates colluded with Moscow as fake news. Manfra and other officials testifying on Wednesday said U.S. elections are resilient to hacking in part because they are decentralized and largely operated on the state and local level. Senator Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with the Democrats, voiced skepticism, saying only a small number of votes in key battleground states would need to be altered to tip the scales in an election. A sophisticated actor could hack an election simply by focusing on certain counties, King said. I dont think it works just to say its a big system and diversity will protect us. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate panel, expressed frustration at Manfras refusal to identify which states had been targeted. Arizona and Illinois last year confirmed that hackers had targeted their voter registration systems. Samuel Liles, another senior DHS cyber official, likened states targeted or scanned to a thief walking by homes to scout for weaknesses, and breaches to breaking through a front door. Special Counsel Robert Mueller, a former FBI director, met on Wednesday with senior Senate Judiciary Committee members to ensure there was no conflict between his investigation of potential collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign and the panels probe of what led to Trump firing Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey. Trump acknowledged on Friday he was under investigation in the probe of alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 race and possible collusion by his campaign, and seemed to assail the Justice Department official overseeing the inquiry. Mueller was examining whether Trump or others sought to obstruct the probe, a person familiar with the inquiry told Reuters. Jeh Johnson, who led the Homeland Security Department until the end of the Obama administration, told the U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee his department had issued warnings about hacking into voter registration databases. Asked why the Obama administration did not do more to warn the public, Johnson said: We were very concerned that we would not be perceived as taking sides in the election, injecting ourselves into a very heated campaign. He told the House committee, which is investigating alleged Russian meddling in the election, that the notices did not get the attention he would have liked, blaming the emergence of a 2005 videotape - in which Trump brags about sexual conquests - for distracting the American public.

Representative Jody Hice of Georgia said his proposal was an important step to ensure the personal safety of lawmakers in light of recent events, an apparent reference to an attack last week in which a gunman opened fire on Republican members of Congress practicing for a charity baseball game. Personal protection and being able to defend oneself against an assailant is part of the fabric of our Constitution, which is why I am an ardent believer in the Second Amendment, Hice said in a statement, referring to U.S. legal guarantees of the right to keep and bear arms. While members of Congress are all average Americans, it is clear that we also have a bulls eye on our backs, Hice added. In light of recent events, its incredibly important that congressmen and women maintain the ability to provide for their own safety, regardless of the city or state. Hice said he introduced the measure on Tuesday, less than a week after a gunman opened fire on Republican lawmakers at the baseball practice in Alexandria, Virginia, a Washington suburb.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Transportation Committee on Wednesday proposed legislation to privatize the U.S. air traffic control system and make other aviation changes, but it faces an uncertain future in Congress. The panel plans to consider the bill next Tuesday, and the full House will vote in mid-July, said the committees Republican chairman, Representative Bill Shuster. This is about saving the taxpayers money, Shuster told reporters on Wednesday. Maintaining the status quo is unacceptable. The legislation would make it illegal for an airline to bump an already boarded passenger from a flight. In April, a United Airlines passenger was forcibly removed from his seat, prompting public outrage. The airline banned the practice.\t The bill would also require the U.S. Transportation Department to clarify regulations for compensating passengers, including that there is no maximum compensation, and would legally bar the use of cellphones and other mobile devices for phone calls during flights. No airline currently allows in-flight calls from personal phones. In April, the Federal Communications Commission said it planned to halt a regulatory process that could have led to in-flight calls on airplanes. The legislation also requires large and medium-sized airports to provide clean private rooms in all terminals for nursing mothers.  Airlines would have to post a prominent link on their website on services offered in the event of a widespread computer outage. Many airlines have been hit by computer system outages over the last year. The most controversial proposal is the privatization of air traffic control. Earlier this month, President Donald Trump unveiled a plan to modernize air traffic control and lower flying costs. Under the proposal, air traffic control would be spun off from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and put under the oversight of a nonprofit corporation. Congressman Shuster said airlines would have three seats on the 13-member board: one for major airlines, one for cargo carriers and one for regional airlines. The Trump administration has proposed giving airlines two seats on the board, while Shuster last year proposed giving airlines four seats. Shuster aims to address concerns among private plane owners and rural airports by barring the new air traffic control entity from charging general aviation operators user fees.  Critics say the plan would hand control of a key asset to special interests and big airlines. A coalition of five general aviation groups said in a statement on Wednesday that they would not support the bill, saying it was fundamentally flawed. The Airline Owners and Pilots Association said the bill has a high potential for unintended consequences as well as increased costs and uncertainty. Shusters bill would reauthorize the FAA for six years and also has provisions to speed up a decision by the Transportation Department on whether to allow expanded commercial drone use. The Transportation Department would also have to consider whether to require airlines to stock emergency medicine for children aboard flights. The legislation would also authorize significantly higher funding for a program that subsidizes commercial air service to rural airports, which the Trump administration budget proposed eliminating. The Senate Commerce Committees chairman, Senator John Thune, said on Tuesday that he was not planning to include air traffic control privatization in the FAA reauthorization, a committee aide said. The administration and Shuster say they would not charge the private entity for the governments air traffic control assets and would bar Congress from reviewing fees charged by the board. Executives from United, Hawaiian Airlines Inc, American Airlines Inc and Southwest Airlines Co, strongly back the proposal. The FAA spends nearly $10 billion a year on air traffic control funded largely through passenger user fees, and has spent more than $7.5 billion on next-generation air traffic control reforms in recent years. It is unclear whether privatization would speed the rollout of new systems such as satellite-based aircraft tracking that replaces ground radar dating back to World War Two.

It was Washingtons strongest language yet on a dispute that erupted after the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic ties and transport links to isolate Qatar.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""MOSCOW/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Angered by expanded U.S. sanctions, Russia on Wednesday canceled a high-level meeting between Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov and U.S. Undersecretary of State Thomas Shannon. The move cast some uncertainty over plans for the first face-to-face meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the upcoming G20 summit on July 7-8 in Hamburg, Germany. With two weeks to go, a senior White House official said no plans for a bilateral meeting had been finalized. Nothing has been canceled because nothing has been set, the official said. Moscow said it was obliged to cancel the diplomatic meeting after the U.S. government on Tuesday added 38 individuals and organizations to its list of those sanctioned over Russian activities in Ukraine.  The new U.S. sanctions were a continuation of the trend set by the Obama administration aimed at ruining relations between our countries, Ryabkov said in a statement posted on the website of Russias Foreign Ministry. U.S.-Russian relations have already been strained by allegations that Moscow interfered in the U.S. presidential election last year and Trumps first five months in office have been dogged by a controversy over whether his campaign team colluded with Russia. Trump has said he wants to explore whether Washington and Moscow can work together on issues of mutual concern, such as fighting Islamic State insurgents in Syria. But tensions between the two nations have escalated. On Sunday, the U.S. military shot down a Syrian military jet. That prompted Russia to change its military posture. The Kremlin said the expanded U.S. sanctions undermined Washingtons assertions it wanted dialogue with Moscow, calling the new sanctions a political gift to Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, who visited Trump at the White House on Tuesday. The U.S. State Department said it regretted the Russian cancellation, but remained open to future discussions to try to bridge bilateral differences. The new sanctions only reinforced existing sanctions, which have been updated twice a year since they were first imposed, the department said. Lets remember that these sanctions didnt just come out of nowhere. Our targeted sanctions were imposed in response to Russias ongoing violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of its neighbor, Ukraine, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement. The Kremlin said earlier on Wednesday that Russian forces were not present in eastern Ukraine, which is controlled by pro-Russian separatists.  The United States and the European Union have imposed several rounds of sanctions on Russian companies and individuals in response to Russias role in the Ukraine conflict. Lawmakers in the U.S. Senate last week also backed additional sanctions to punish Russia for alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, its annexation of Ukraines Crimea region, and support for Syrias government in the six-year-long civil war. Ryabkov was meant to be meeting Shannon in St Petersburg on Friday to discuss problems in bilateral ties. But Ryabkov, in the same statement on Wednesday, accused the United States of failing to propose anything tangible to improve relations. He said: Previous multiple waves of American sanctions havent achieved the result which their initiators had hoped for. Any new attempts to make Russia bow down will be just as futile.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans in the U.S. Congress, unable so far to resolve deep disagreements over spending for the fiscal year starting on Oct. 1, are mulling whether to seek a bipartisan budget deal with Democrats similar to one reached nearly four years ago. With only 20 working days to go before a lengthy August recess, some Republican lawmakers say a bipartisan agreement could help clear a legislative schedule crammed with other top priorities, including a separate budget resolution, tax reform, infrastructure and an increase in the federal debt limit. In December 2013, Republican Representative Paul Ryan, now speaker of the House of Representatives, and Democratic Senator Patty Murray worked out a two-year deal that canceled some spending cuts in fiscal 2014 and 2015 in return for some longer-term spending reductions. The Ryan-Murray agreement was promptly enacted into law. A bipartisan deal could avert a restrictive spending plan that would cap funding for U.S. agencies and a government shutdown threatened by President Donald Trump. I think what we need is another Ryan-Murray sort of proposal, said Republican Representative Mike Simpson, a senior member of the House of Representatives Appropriations Committee, which is in charge of writing annual spending bills. Speaking to reporters after a House Republican meeting, Simpson said the idea was in the early stages. Republicans, who control the House and Senate, have lashed out at deep spending cuts that Trump has proposed. But they are divided over how much top-line spending should be appropriated next year, including for a military buildup Trump wants. A bipartisan negotiation is just one of several options. Another would rush one massive spending bill for fiscal 2018 through the House in July, instead of the dozen separate appropriations bills that Congress tries to write every year. Doing so would allow Republicans to tout an accomplishment to their constituents in August during a year that has so far seen few legislative achievements. Given the limited time to write such a bill, Ryan might have to resort to just passing a national security spending bill that would fund the military and other security activities. Some Republicans want to boost military spending to $640 billion, which would require deep cuts to non-defense programs that are popular among Republican moderates.   Congress must also pass a budget resolution to facilitate tax reform legislation. The House Budget Committee hopes to mark up such a measure before June 30, panel members said.

Republicans in the chamber have been working for weeks behind closed doors on legislation aimed at repealing and replacing major portions of the Affordable Care Act, former Democratic President Barack Obamas signature healthcare law, popularly known as Obamacare. The effort has been plagued from the start by tensions between moderates and conservatives, which surfaced again on Tuesday. Democrats have also criticized the behind-the-scenes meetings, staging a protest on the Senate floor on Monday. Republicans are writing their healthcare bill under the cover of darkness because they are ashamed of it, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer charged.  President Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to repeal Obamacare. The 2010 law extended insurance coverage to millions of Americans through both subsidized private insurance and an expansion of Medicaid. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives narrowly approved its version of repeal last month. Trump has urged the Republican-led Senate to pass a more generous bill than that approved by the House, whose version he privately called mean, according to congressional sources. An estimated 23 million people could lose their healthcare under the House plan, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday the Senate healthcare bill would be different from the House version, but he did not elaborate. In the Senate, moderates including Senator Shelley Moore Capito have argued for a long, seven-year phase-out to the Medicaid expansion that happened under Obamacare. But Senator John Thune, a member of the Republican leadership, said on Tuesday the phase-out in the bill might just be three years. Capito said on Tuesday she was also concerned the Senate healthcare plan might cap Medicaid spending and shift it to a lower growth rate in 2025. Thats an issue, she said. Senate conservatives also seemed wary of the emerging bill. Ted Cruz, a member of a core group of 13 Republicans who have been working on the legislation, told reporters the bill did not yet do enough to lower health insurance premiums. If it is going to pass, the bill is going to have to make meaningful steps to reduce premiums, he said. Given the opposition of all Senate Democrats to repealing Obamacare, Republican leaders will need the support of at least 50 of the chambers 52 Republicans to ensure passage. McConnell announced a discussion draft would be laid out on Thursday. The bill will be brought to the Senate floor once the CBO has assessed its cost and impact, likely next week, McConnell said. Thune said the bill was not yet finalized, saying: Were trying to get definitive determinations on a range of issues. Vice President Mike Pence predicted that new healthcare legislation would be enacted this summer. I want to assure you, before this summer is over ... President Donald Trump and this Congress will keep their promise to the American people, and we will repeal and replace Obamacare, Pence told a meeting of the National Association of Manufacturers.

Icahn has an 82 percent stake in oil refiner CVR Energy Inc (CVI.N). He has also recommended the White House change the biofuels program that would reduce costs to CVR and other refining companies.

(Reuters) - Georgia Republican Karen Handel won the most expensive congressional race in history on Tuesday, avoiding a Democratic upset in a race that was widely seen as a referendum on President Donald Trump. By a margin of 52 percent to 48 percent, the former Georgia secretary of state defeated Democrat Jon Ossoff, a political newcomer who sought to wrest control of a suburban Atlanta district that has elected Republicans to Congress since the 1970s.       The election will not significantly change the balance of power in Washington, where Republicans control the White House and both chambers of Congress. But it could give Republicans a boost in confidence as they struggle to advance health and tax legislation that has been bogged down by infighting and investigations into whether Trumps campaign colluded with Russia in last years presidential election. Handel said at her victory rally that she knew it was going to require all hands on deck for Republicans to hold on to the district. Tonight I stand before you, extraordinarily humbled and honored at the tremendous privilege and high responsibility that you ... have given me, Handel told a boisterous crowd that chanted Trumps name. Ossoff and Handel both tried to focus on local issues and avoided mentioning Trump, whose approval rating sits at 37 percent, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling.  But that did not stop Trump from weighing in on Twitter, urging voters to support Handel before the election and celebrating her victory afterward. Fantastic job, we are all very proud of you! he posted Tuesday night. Spending on the race reached at least $57 million, nearly twice the previous record, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a watchdog group. The special election was held to fill the seat vacated by Tom Price after Trump appointed him as secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Democrats celebrated the fact that they had turned a conservative stronghold into a competitive district. We showed the world that in places where no one thought it was even possible we could fight (that) we could fight, Ossoff told supporters. But the defeat was sure to prompt soul-searching in a party that is shut out of power in Washington and has steadily lost influence at the state level in recent years. Despite spending more than $30 million, Ossoff lost the district by a wider margin than Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. Democrats also lost a special election in neighboring South Carolina on Tuesday, where Republican Ralph Norman easily prevailed over Democrat Archie Parnell in a seat formerly held by Republican Mick Mulvaney, who is now serving as Trumps budget director.

Trump has held high hopes for greater cooperation from China to exert influence over North Korea, leaning heavily on Chinese President Xi Jinping for his assistance. The two leaders had a high-profile summit in Florida in April and Trump has frequently praised Xi while resisting criticizing Chinese trade practices. While I greatly appreciate the efforts of President Xi & China to help with North Korea, it has not worked out. At least I know China tried! Trump wrote on Twitter. It was unclear whether his remark represented a significant shift in his thinking in the U.S. struggle to stop North Koreas nuclear program and its test launching of missiles or a change in U.S. policy toward China. I think the president is signaling some frustration, Christopher Hill, a former U.S. ambassador to South Korea, told MSNBC. Hes signaling to others that he understands this isnt working, and hes trying to defend himself, or justify himself, by saying that at least they tried as opposed to others who didnt even try. Chinas Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday that China had made unremitting efforts to resolve tensions on the Korean peninsula, and that it had always played and important and constructive role. Chinas efforts to resolve the peninsula nuclear issue is not due to any external pressure, but because China is a member of the region and a responsible member of the international community, and because resolving the peninsula nuclear issue is in Chinas interests, ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a daily news briefing.  On Tuesday, a U.S. official, who did not want to be identified, said U.S. spy satellites had detected movements recently at North Koreas nuclear test site near a tunnel entrance, but it was unclear if these were preparations for a new nuclear test - perhaps to coincide with high-level talks between the United States and China in Washington on Wednesday. North Korea remains prepared to conduct a sixth nuclear test at any time when there is an order from leadership but there are no new unusual indications that can be shared, a South Korean Defense Ministry official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.  Seoul was in close consultation with Washington over the matter, the official added.     North Korea last tested a nuclear bomb in September, but it has conducted repeated missile test since and vowed to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland, putting it at the forefront of Trumps security worries. U.S.-CHINA DIALOGUE The Trump statement about China was likely to increase pressure on Beijing ahead of Wednesdays Diplomatic and Security Dialogue, which will pair U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis with Chinas top diplomat, State Councilor Yang Jiechi, and General Fang Fenghui, chief of joint staff of the Peoples Liberation Army. The State Department says the dialogue will focus on ways to increase pressure on North Korea, but also cover such areas as counter-terrorism and territorial rivalries in the South China Sea. The U.S. side is expected to press China to cooperate on a further toughening of international sanctions on North Korea. The United States and its allies would like to see an oil embargo and bans on the North Korean airline and guest workers among other moves, steps diplomats say have been resisted by China and Russia. In a sign that U.S.-Chinese relations remain stable, a White House aide said Trumps daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, were invited by the Chinese government to visit the country later this year. Trump has hardened his rhetoric against North Korea following the death of Otto Warmbier, a University of Virginia student who died on Monday in the United States after returning from captivity in North Korea in a coma. In a White House meeting with visiting Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko, Trump criticized the way Warmbiers case was handled in the year since his arrest, appearing to assail both North Korea and his predecessor, President Barack Obama. What happened to Otto is a disgrace. And I spoke with his family. His family is incredible ... but he should have been brought home a long time ago, Trump said. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the United States holds North Korea accountable for Warmbiers unjust imprisonment and urged Pyongyang to release three other Americans who are detained. Chinese state-run newspaper the Global Times, published by the official Peoples Daily, said Chinese officials must be wary that Warmbiers death might push Washington to put greater pressure on Beijing. China has made the utmost efforts to help break the stalemate in the North Korean nuclear issue. But by no means will China, nor will Chinese society permit it to, act as a U.S. ally in pressuring North Korea, the Global Times said in an editorial. If Washington imposes sanctions on Chinese enterprises, it would lead to grave friction between the two countries, said the paper, which does not represent Chinese government policy. Trumps tweet about China took some advisers by surprise. A senior administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the United States had limited options to rein in North Korea without Chinese assistance. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said a meeting between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is less likely following Warmbiers death. Spicer said Trump would be willing to meet Kim under the right conditions, but clearly were moving further away, not closer to those conditions.

Investigators are also looking at whether payments from foreign clients to Flynn and his company, the now-inactive Flynn Intel Group,were lawful, according to two separate sources with knowledge of the broad inquiry into Flynns business activities. That includes payments by three Russian companies and a Netherlands-based company, Inovo, controlled by Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin, they said. The FBIs interest in Kian has not been previously reported. Kian played a central role in securing and overseeing the Inovo contract, two people with knowledge of that project said. It is not clear whether Kian is a target of the criminal investigation or whether investigators are trying to build a fuller understanding of how Flynns company operated. A person recently interviewed by the FBI in connection with the Flynn investigation said agents from the bureaus criminal division had asked as much about Kian and his work on the project with Alptekin as they had about Flynn.  Kian did not respond to repeated requests for comment, nor did the lawyer he recently hired, Robert Trout. The FBI declined to comment. Flynns lawyer, Robert Kelner, did not respond to requests for comment. Alptekin declined to comment for this story but last month told Reuters that he was satisfied with the work done by Flynn Intel Group and denied any wrongdoing. The FBI has been investigating whether Flynns consulting firm lobbied on behalf of Turkey- after being paid $530,000 by Inovo -without making the proper disclosure,Reuters reported earlier this month. The federal investigation is being run by special counsel Robert Mueller. Mueller has a mandate to investigate contacts between Russia and Trumps 2016 election campaign team and any related matters. Flynn was fired by the Trump administration in February after officials said he mischaracterized a series of phone calls with Russias ambassador last December.  The top Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight andGovernment Reform, which has separately been looking into whether Flynn made false statements in applying for security clearance, said he was also scrutinizing Kian. I have an interest in Bijan Kian and his interactions with General Flynn based on specific documents already obtained by the Committee, Elijah Cummings told Reuters in an email. Kelnerhas sought immunityfor Flynn in exchange for his testimony, saying his clientcertainly has a story to tell. In private conversations with potential clients, Kian portrayed himself as a rainmaker for Flynn, tapping into  connections cultivated during a five-year tenure as a director at the U.S. Export-Import Bank, according to one person who worked with the firm. Alptekin told Reuters in May thathis firm hired Flynn Intel Group to research Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulens activitiesin the United States, which he suspected were poisoning relations between the United States and Turkey. Like Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, Alptekin blamed a failed coup in Turkey last July on followers of Gulen. Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since 1999, has denied involvement in the attempted coup and dismisses Turkeys allegations that he heads a terrorist organization. Kian oversaw key elements of the project that emerged, including a still-unfinished documentary on Gulen, according to two people involved in the project. Inovo paid Flynn Intel Group a total of $530,000, starting in September, according to a Justice Department filing by the company in March. Flynn Intel Group paid $80,000 to Inovo in consultancy fees, according to the filing, which does not provide more detail on why payments were made in both directions. On Sept. 19, Kian and Flynn met in New York with Turkeysforeign minister and energy minister, who is Erdogans son-in-law, according to a person with knowledge of the meeting. In late October, Kian invited staff of the House Homeland Security Committee to Flynn Intel Groups headquarters in Virginia.The meeting was called to show off new mobile phone security technology, but Kian also used the opportunity to try to get a congressional hearing on Gulen, according toa personat the meeting. At that point, the Flynn Intel Group had only disclosed its work for Alptekins Inovo in a filing with Congress. It had not mentioned Inovos ties to Turkey. When Justice Department officials became aware months later that Kian and other Flynn Intel Group officials had met with Turkish officials they insisted on a fuller disclosure, people involved in those discussions said. The Flynn Intel Group made the more detailed disclosure in its March filing with the Justice Department under the Foreign Agents Registration Act that said the work that Flynn and Kian did for Inovo could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.

The program features a three-year initiative to help coordinate crime-fighting efforts among federal, state, local and tribal law enforcement and prosecutors, Sessions said in unveiling the new National Public Safety Partnership. Trump, a Republican, made tough-on-crime rhetoric a focus of his 2016 campaign. The new program stems from an executive order he signed in February mandating that the Justice Department provide support for local law enforcement. We have a duty to make sure our country does not abandon all the progress we have made against crime over the past few decades, Sessions said at a national meeting of law enforcement officials. His remarks were released by the Justice Department. Sessions did not disclose any new funding for the initiative, which will focus on gun crime, drug trafficking and gang violence. The federal government will provide help in areas that include training, crime analysis, gun violence, community engagement and investigations. A spike in violent crime in 2015 continued into the first half of last year, with big cities seeing an average increase in murders of almost 22 percent compared with the same period the year before, Sessions said. The dozen cities chosen for the program are Birmingham, Alabama; Indianapolis; Memphis, Tennessee; Toledo, Ohio; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Buffalo, New York; Cincinnati; Houston; Jackson, Tennessee; Kansas City, Missouri; Lansing, Michigan; and Springfield, Illinois.  Sessions said more communities could be announced for the partnership this year. The 12 cities were picked because they have levels of violence well above the national average and are ready to receive training and aid, Justice Department spokesman Devin OMalley said. Federal prosecutors and law enforcement officials also helped choose them, he said. Chicago and nine other cities that were in a pilot program called the Violence Reduction Network will also take part in the initiative. Trump had vowed in January to bring federal intervention to bear to quell gun violence in Chicago.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has begun considering legislation that would cover military action in Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, Libya and Yemen against the Islamic State, al Qaeda and other Islamist militant groups. I have always believed that its important for Congress to exercise its constitutional role to authorize the use of force, the committees chairman, Republican Senator Bob Corker, told a hearing on Tuesday. As President Donald Trump has ordered stepped-up military activity in Syria, Afghanistan and elsewhere, members of Congress also want Trump to present a strategy for defeating Islamic State and other militant groups. Its difficult for us to carry out our responsibility unless we know what the commander in chief needs, Senator Ben Cardin, the committees top Democrat, said.  The Trump administration, like former President Barack Obamas, has been using a 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) against al Qaeda passed after the Sept. 11 attacks as the legal basis for a wide range of military action since. Although there is bipartisan support for Congress to debate and vote on a new AUMF introduced by Republican Senator Jeff Flake and Democratic Senator Tim Kaine, the measure faces stiff opposition.  Lawmakers have introduced war authorizations repeatedly in the past several years. But they have failed to advance amid sharp divisions in Congress over whether, or how, to limit commanders use of military resources. Many war-weary members of Congress also do not want to vote for anything that might become a foreign military quagmire consuming taxpayer dollars or leading to widespread U.S. casualties. Trump has ordered stepped-up military operations against Islamic State and delegated more authority to his generals. U.S.-led forces said on Tuesday they had shot down an armed pro-Syrian regime drone near the border between Iraq and Syria. A U.S. warplane shot down a Syrian army jet over Syria on Sunday. Democratic Senator Tom Udall voted for the 2001 authorization while he was a member of the House of Representatives.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department bluntly questioned on Tuesday the motives of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates for their boycott of Doha, saying it was mystified the Gulf states had not released their grievances over Qatar. In Washingtons strongest language yet on the Gulf dispute, the State Department said the more time goes by, the more doubt is raised about the actions taken by Saudi Arabia and the UAE. At this point, we are left with one simple question: Were the actions really about their concerns regarding Qatars alleged support for terrorism or were they about the long-simmering grievances between and among the GCC countries, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said, referring to the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council.     The State Departments comments came in contrast to the language taken by U.S. President Donald Trump who has accused Qatar of being a high level sponsor of terrorism. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar are key American allies. The fact the State Department bluntly questioned Riyadh and Abu Dhabis actions in public suggests Washington was keen for the parties to end the dispute.  Weve just said to the parties involved: Lets finish this. Lets get this going, Nauert said.  Qatar hosts a vital U.S. military base, Al Udeid, to which more than 11,000 U.S. and coalition forces are deployed or assigned and from which more than 100 aircraft operate. The United Arab Emirates, which along with Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain imposed the measures to isolate Qatar, has said the sanctions could last for years unless Doha accepted demands that the Arab powers plan to reveal in coming days.  The State Department, headed by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, was encouraging all sides to de-escalate tensions and engage in constructive dialogue, Nauert said. A U.S. official said Washington is urging Qatar to take steps to defuse the crisis, including signing on to proposals being drawn up the Treasury Department to strengthen controls against financing of militant groups. But this official and a second U.S. official said it was inaccurate to single Qatar out, and that the Saudis, Emiratis and other Gulf states face similar challenges in countering terrorist financing. Qatars foreign minister, who is expected to travel to Washington next week, said Doha would not negotiate with its neighbors to resolve the Gulf dispute unless they first lift the trade and travel boycott they imposed two weeks ago. He added that Doha still believed a solution was possible.  Now that it has been more than two weeks since the embargo started, we are mystified that the Gulf states have not released to the public nor to the Qataris the details about the claims that they are making toward Qatar, Nauert added. There was no immediate comment from Riyadh or Abu Dhabi. Qatars ambassador to the United States, Meshal Hamad al-Thani, welcomed the State Departments statement, tweeting: We are confident in the ability of the U.S. to resolve this crisis. Qatar has denied accusations by its neighbors that it funds terrorism, foments regional instability or has cosied up to their enemy Iran. The first U.S. official said the dispute is driven more by economic rivalries, historical tensions and the personal dynamics of Gulf leaders than by the specific demands the Saudis and Emiratis are making on Qatar. The dispute has opened a rift among some of the main U.S. allies in the Middle East. Since the dispute erupted, Trump has taken a tougher stance against Qatar, while the State Department had sought to remain neutral. Nauert said Tillerson had three phone calls and two in-person meetings with the Saudi foreign minister. Tillerson also spoke by phone three times with Qatars foreign minister and with the Qatari emir. The UAEs ambassador to the United States said last week a list of demands for Qatar was being compiled and would soon be handed to the United States. He said they would broadly address support for terrorism, meddling in the internal affairs of these countries and attacks through Qatari-owned media platforms. The Pentagon has said the boycott was hindering U.S. ability to plan for long-term operations in the region. Al Udeid is where command for the anti-Islamic State air campaign takes place. Meanwhile, Qatars attorney general said on Tuesday his country has evidence that the hacking of Qatars state news agency was linked to countries that have severed ties with Doha.

AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson, Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure and CenturyLink Inc CEO Glen Post will be among the executives discussing advanced technologies such as unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, 5G wireless technologies and universal broadband, officials said. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Trump will see demonstrations of how these technologies will contribute to the 21st century economy and how the government can ensure that their safe adoption leads to the best possible outcomes for the American worker and American businesses. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai, Deputy Chief Technology Officer Michael Kratsios, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, White House National Economic Director Gary Cohn and FAA and NASA officials will attend small group meetings before the group meets with Trump at about 11 a.m. EDT (1500 GMT). Venture capital firms and portfolio companies also are expected. Last year, the FCC cleared the way for 5G, a lightning-fast next generation of wireless services that lead to universal access to broadband wireless. Testing is under way and deployment is expected around 2020. New 5G networks are expected to provide speeds at least 10 times and maybe 100 times faster than todays 4G networks, the FCC said. Policymakers and mobile phone companies have said the next generation of wireless signals needs to be much faster and far more responsive to allow advanced technologies such as virtual surgery or controlling machines remotely. They face regulatory hurdles to adding infrastructure to create the system. The 5G networks could help wirelessly connect devices such as thermostats or washing machines to facilitate the internet of things. They could improve road traffic by monitoring sensors in streetlights and cars. It could even help detect air pollution using sensors in trees. The FAA in March estimated that by 2021 the fleet of small hobbyist drones will more than triple and the commercial drone fleet will increase tenfold to about 442,000. The Obama administration implemented rules that opened the skies to low-level small drones for education, research and routine commercial use. The Trump administration still is considering whether to allow a sweeping expansion in drone use for purposes such as deliveries where aircraft would fly beyond the sight of an operator.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Top Republicans from Congress and the Trump administration vowed on Tuesday to complete tax reform by the end of 2017, despite party infighting and political distractions from investigations of alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. In a speech to U.S. manufacturers, House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said President Donald Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress hoped to complete the job in the autumn, with a new tax system in place by the beginning of 2018. The goal is to get tax legislation to the floor of Congress during the first two weeks of September, Trump economic adviser Gary Cohn told technology industry representatives at the White House.    Republicans are promising the biggest tax overhaul since the Reagan era, saying a simplified system with tax cuts for individuals and businesses, along with reforms to eliminate taxes on the foreign profits of U.S. corporations, can boost economic growth and create jobs. Independent analysts say there is no evidence that tax cuts drive long-term economic growth. Democrats contend that the Republican tax measures are designed to benefit wealthier Americans. I am here to tell you we are going to get this done in 2017. Why are we going to get this done in 2017? Because we need to get this done in 2017, Ryan told a conference hosted by the National Association of Manufacturers, a powerful Washington lobby group. This will create jobs. That is what this is all about, jobs, jobs, jobs, good-paying jobs, he said. The  effort has drawn warnings and criticism from Democrats. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Republican moves to grant new tax breaks to the wealthy could jeopardize Democratic support for an increase in the governments borrowing authority later this year.   Shortly after Ryans speech, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosis office called his remarks a poor attempt to distract from a lack of Republican initiatives on job creation. The Trump administration and Republicans in Congress face mounting pressure from U.S. businesses and their electoral base to deliver tax reform, a top 2016 campaign pledge that could determine whether Republicans retain control of Congress in the 2018 midterm elections. It was not clear whether Republicans can overcome infighting over healthcare legislation and government spending to move forward on tax reform.     Earlier in the day, Vice President Mike Pence assured the same audience that tax reform would be done this year, in remarks echoed by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a CNBC television interview.  Ryan and Mnuchin are among six officials trying to craft a tax deal in closed-door discussions with Cohn, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and the Republican chairmen of two tax committees. Were comparing and contrasting various versions of reform to get the best possible one that gives us the lowest possible rates and most internationally competitive tax system, and the best one we can pass, Ryan told CNBC after his speech.  The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC is up nearly 20 percent while the S&P 500 .SPX has added 14 percent since Trump's election in November, as investors bet he would spark economic growth by cutting taxes and boosting infrastructure spending.  The Trump administration and Republican leaders in Congress have agreed that tax reform should eliminate estate and alternative minimum taxes, both levies on the wealthy. They also want to allow U.S. corporations to repatriate trillions of dollars in profits held overseas at a reduced tax rate and  eliminate taxes on future foreign profits.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trumps administration is exploring hardening its approach toward Pakistan to crack down on Pakistan-based militants launching attacks in neighboring Afghanistan, two U.S. officials tell Reuters.  Potential Trump administration responses being discussed include expanding U.S. drone strikes, redirecting or withholding some aid to Pakistan and perhaps eventually downgrading Pakistans status as a major non-NATO ally, the two officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Other U.S. officials are skeptical of the prospects for success, arguing that years of previous U.S. efforts to curb Pakistans support for militant groups have failed, and that already strengthening U.S. ties to India, Pakistans arch-enemy, undermine chances of a breakthrough with Islamabad.  U.S. officials say generally they seek greater cooperation with Pakistan, not a rupture in ties, once the administration finishes a regional review, due by mid-July, of the strategy guiding the 16-year-old war in Afghanistan.  The discussions include officials from across the Trump administration, including the White House and the Defense Department, both of which declined comment on the review before its completion. Precise actions have yet to be decided. But Pakistans embassy in Washington warned against scapegoating Pakistan to explain the stalemate in Afghanistan, pointing instead to Afghanistans own troubled internal dynamics. It also noted past Pakistani efforts to battle militants and expressed willingness to work with the United States and Afghanistan on border management. Singling out Pakistan and pinning the entire blame on Pakistan for the situation in Afghanistan is neither fair nor accurate, nor is it borne out by the ground realities, said Abid Saeed, press minister at the embassy. Experts on Americas longest war argue that militant safe havens in Pakistan have allowed Taliban-linked insurgents a place to plot deadly strikes in Afghanistan and regroup after ground offensives.  Although long mindful of Pakistan, the Trump administration  in recent weeks has put more emphasis on the relationship with Islamabad in discussions as it hammers out a regional strategy to be presented to Trump, who took office in late January, one official said. Weve never really fully articulated what our strategy towards Pakistan is. The strategy will more clearly say what we want from Pakistan specifically, the U.S. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Other U.S. officials question whether any mix of carrots and sticks can get Islamabad to change its behavior. At the end of the day, Washington needs a partner, even if an imperfect one, in nuclear-armed Pakistan, they say. The United States is again poised to deploy thousands more troops in Afghanistan, an acknowledgment that U.S.-backed forces are not winning and Taliban militants are resurgent. Without more pressure on militants within Pakistan who target Afghanistan, experts say additional U.S. troop deployments will fail to meet their ultimate objective: to pressure the Taliban to eventually negotiate peace. I believe there will be a much harder U.S. line on Pakistan going forward than there has been in the past, Hamdullah Mohib, the Afghan ambassador to the United States, told Reuters, without citing specific measures under review.  Kabul has long been critical of Pakistans role in Afghanistan.  Pakistan fiercely denies allowing any militants safe haven on its territory. It bristles at U.S. claims that Pakistans spy agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) directorate, has ties to Haqqani network militants blamed for some of the deadliest attacks in Afghanistan. A senior Pakistani government source, speaking on condition of anonymity, doubted the Trump administration would press too hard, saying: They dont want to push Pakistan to abandon their war against terrorism. Pakistani officials point towards the toll militancy has taken on the country. Since 2003, almost 22,000 civilians and nearly 7,000 Pakistani security forces have been killed as a result of militancy, according to the South Asia Terrorism Portal, which tracks violence. But the Pentagon, in a report to Congress released on Tuesday, explicitly accused elements of Pakistans government of supporting Afghanistan-focused militant groups, including the Taliban and Haqqani Network, who it said retained freedom of action within Pakistan.  It called Pakistan the most influential external actor affecting Afghan stability. Pakistan won the status as a major non-NATO ally in 2004 from the George Bush administration, in what was at the time seen in part as recognition of its importance in the U.S. battle against al Qaeda and Taliban insurgents. The status is mainly symbolic, allowing limited benefits such as giving Pakistan faster access to surplus U.S. military hardware. Yanking the title would be seen by Pakistan as a major blow. Some U.S. officials and experts on the region scoff at the title. Pakistan is not an ally. Its not North Korea or Iran. But its not an ally, said Bruce Riedel, a Pakistan expert at the Brookings Institution think tank.  Lisa Curtis, prior to becoming senior director for South and Central Asia at the National Security Council, co-authored a report with Husain Haqqani, Pakistans former ambassador to Washington, in which they recommended the Trump administration warn Pakistan the status could be revoked in six months.  Thinking of Pakistan as an ally will continue to create problems for the next administration as it did for the last one, said the February report, published by the conservative Hudson Institute think tank. It was unclear how seriously the Trump administration was considering the proposal. The growing danger to Afghanistan from suspected Pakistan-based militants was underscored by a devastating May 31 truck bomb that killed more than 80 people and wounded 460 in Kabul.   Afghanistans main intelligence agency said the attack - one of the deadliest in memory in the Afghan capital - had been carried out by the Haqqani network with assistance from Pakistan, a charge Islamabad denies. Washington believes the strikes appeared to be the work of the Haqqani network, U.S. officials told Reuters. U.S. frustration over the Haqqanis presence in Pakistan has been building for years. The United States designated the Haqqani network as a terrorist organization in 2012. U.S. Navy Admiral Mike Mullen, then the top U.S. military officer, told Congress in 2011 that the Haqqani network was a veritable arm of the ISI. Any U.S. pivot in its approach would be sharply different than the one taken at the start of the Obama administration, when U.S. officials sought to court Pakistani leaders, including Army chief General Ashfaq Kayani. David Sedney, who served as Obamas deputy assistant secretary of defense for Afghanistan, Pakistan and Central Asia from 2009 to 2013, said the attempt to turn Islamabad into a strategic partner was a disaster. It didnt affect Pakistans behavior one bit. In fact, I would argue it made Pakistans behavior worse, Sedney said. MORE DRONES, CASH CUT-OFF Pakistan has received more than $33 billion in U.S. assistance since 2002, including more than $14 billion in so-called Coalition Support Funds (CSF), a U.S. Defense Department program to reimburse allies that have incurred costs in supporting counter-insurgency operations. Last year, the Pentagon decided not to pay Pakistan $300 million in CSF funding after then-U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter declined to sign authorization that Pakistan was taking adequate action against the Haqqani network.  U.S. officials said the Trump administration was discussing withholding at least some assistance to Pakistan. Curtis report singled out the aid as a target. But U.S. aid cuts could cede even more influence to China, which already has committed nearly $60 billion in investments in Pakistan.  Another option under review is broadening a drone campaign to penetrate deeper into Pakistan to target Haqqani fighters and other militants blamed for attacks in Afghanistan, U.S. officials and a Pakistan expert said. Now the Americans (will be) saying, you arent taking out our enemies, so therefore we are taking them out ourselves, said the Pakistan expert, who declined to be identified. Pakistans army chief of staff last week criticized unilateral actions such as drone strikes as counterproductive and against (the) spirit of ongoing cooperation and intelligence sharing being diligently undertaken by Pakistan.

The Countering Irans Destabilizing Activities Act, which also includes new sanctions against Russia, passed the Senate 98-2 last week, an overwhelming vote that looked like it might complicate President Donald Trumps desire for warmer relations with Moscow. But the measure must still pass the House before it can be sent to Trump to sign into law, or veto, and the House parliamentarian found that the legislation violated a constitutional requirement that any bill that raises revenue for the government must originate in the House, something known as a blue slip violation. The final bill, and final language, violated the origination clause in the Constitution, Representative Kevin Brady, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, told reporters. Democrats suggested that Republicans were stalling the bill out of loyalty to Trump, whose administration has criticized the sanctions package as potentially too restrictive. In the past, Democrats said, House leaders had overcome such objections without discussion by quickly voting on identical versions of Senate legislation. This is nothing but a delay tactic and the public shouldnt be fooled by complex-sounding parliamentary procedure, said Representative Eliot Engel, ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Republicans insisted it was a procedural, not a policy, matter, noting that the Russia amendment to the Iran bill was 100 pages long and passed in the Senate only last week. I strongly support sanctions against Iran and Russia to hold them accountable, Brady said. Brady said House leaders were working with the Senate and House Foreign Affairs Committee to determine how to proceed, but the Senate could address the issue by quickly updating the bill and sending it back to the House. Trumps fellow Republicans hold a majority of 52 seats in the 100-member Senate, and a more commanding 238- to 193-seat margin in the House. Brady could not predict when the House might vote,  including whether it would be before Congress summer recess starts at the end of July. Cory Fritz, a spokesman for Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House foreign affairs committee, said the committee is reviewing the bill.

The House of Representatives reconvened on Tuesday. It will be in session for the next nine weekdays, along with the Senate, which reconvened on Monday. Both chambers will take a break from July 1-9, then return and work July 10-28. After that, Capitol Hill will be quiet through the annual August vacation. Trump set high expectations as a candidate and early in his presidency, promising to repeal and replace Obamacare, invest in infrastructure and work to cut taxes and regulations. These pledges have helped fuel a powerful stock market rally. Trumps only big domestic policy win, aside from killing a handful of Obama-era regulations, has been Senate approval 10 weeks ago of a new Supreme Court justice. The White House has not sent Congress a legislative proposal on any major issue. Trump has been swamped by investigations into possible ties between his campaign and alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. In Congress, the House has approved an Obamacare rollback bill, but it has stalled in the Senate. On Tuesday, Vice President Mike Pence predicted a Republican healthcare bill would be enacted by the end of summer. Competing tax reform plans have divided Republicans in both chambers. No firm infrastructure plan has emerged, and lawmakers have not yet formulated a budget plan for 2018. Urgent budget deadlines will follow the August break, and later in the year, lawmakers will begin focusing on the 2018 congressional elections. Here is a look at key dates coming up. June 20: Special House elections in Georgia and South Carolina. June 30: Congress starts Independence Day break. July 7-8: Trump attends G20 summit in Germany, his first face-to-face meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. July 28: Congress adjourns for five-week summer recess. July-August: U.S. Treasury may no longer be able to postpone the federal debt limit, although this may not arrive until late 2017. Sept. 5: Congress reconvenes.

After Trump officially names him, he must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate.  The NLRB, which oversees union elections and disputes between workers, unions, and employers, has been controlled by Democrats for nearly a decade, and they currently have a 2-1 majority with two vacancies. The board, when fully stocked, includes three members from the presidents party and two from the opposing party. Under Trump, lawyers and business groups expect the board to roll back a series of policy changes adopted during the administration of former President Barack Obama.  Chief among those was a 2015 decision that expanded the circumstances in which a company is considered a joint employer liable for legal violations by contractors, staffing agencies, and franchisees.  The NLRB is also expected to revisit new rules designed to speed up the union election process that business groups say favor unions, and decisions allowing workers to use company email accounts to organize and to picket on employers private property. Kaplan, who did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday, previously worked for Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives crafting employment-related legislation, including a bill that would undo the new union election rules.

In a series of floor motions, inquiries and lengthy speeches, Democrats criticized the closed-door meetings that Republicans have been holding to craft a replacement for Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act. They called for open committee hearings and more time to consider the bill before a Senate vote, which Republicans say could come in the next two weeks, although a draft bill has yet to emerge publicly. Lacking the votes to derail or change the Republican process, the maneuvers by the Democratic minority seemed more aimed at highlighting Republican efforts on a controversial issue. Polls have said that a majority of Americans disapprove of the Obamacare replacement that has passed the House of Representatives and that Senate Republicans are now considering. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said that the closed-door Republican meetings on healthcare amounted to the most glaring departure from normal legislative procedure that I have ever seen.  Republicans are writing their healthcare bill under the cover of darkness because they are ashamed of it, Schumer charged. The resulting legislation would likely throw millions out of health insurance, he said, while granting a big fat tax break for the wealthiest among us. Senators are not obligated to hold meetings in the open, but Democrats pointed out that there were lengthy committee meetings and many days of floor debate on Obamacare before it passed in 2010. Several Democrats moved for the healthcare legislation to be referred to Senate committees for hearings, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused. McConnell said all Republican senators have been involved to some degree in healthcare meetings and that Democrats would have a chance to amend the legislation they produce, once it is brought to the Senate floor. Were going to have a meeting on the Senate floor, all hundred of us, with an unlimited amendment process, McConnell said. So there will be no failure of opportunity. Senate Republican leaders would like a vote on healthcare legislation in July, before the July 4 recess if possible. But Republicans have struggled to coalesce around a bill, with moderates and conservatives pushing in different directions. Senate Republicans also face pressure from the right. In the House, conservatives have written to McConnell to express concern about reports that say the Senate may water down the House bill. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court agreed on Monday to decide whether the U.S. Constitution limits how far lawmakers can go to redraw voting districts to favor one political party over another in a case that could have huge consequences for American elections. The high court has been willing to invalidate state electoral maps on the grounds of racial discrimination, as it did on May 22 when it found that Republican legislators in North Carolina had drawn two electoral districts to diminish the statewide political clout of black voters. But the justices have not thrown out state electoral maps drawn simply to give one party an advantage over another. The justices will take up Wisconsins appeal of a lower court ruling last November that state Republican lawmakers violated the Constitution when they created state legislative districts with the partisan aim of hobbling Democrats in legislative races. The case will be one of the biggest heard by the Supreme Court during its term that begins in October. The case involves a long-standing practice known as gerrymandering, a term meaning manipulating electoral boundaries for an unfair political advantage. The lower court ruled that the Republican-led legislatures redrawing of state legislative districts in 2011 amounted to an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander. A panel of three federal judges in Madison ruled 2-1 that the way the Republicans redrew the districts violated the U.S. Constitutions guarantees of equal protection under the law and free speech by undercutting the ability of Democratic voters to turn their votes into seats in Wisconsins legislature. In a possible sign of deep ideological divisions among the nine justices over the issue, the courts conservative majority granted Wisconsins request, despite opposition from the four liberal justices, to put on hold the lower courts order requiring the state to redraw its electoral maps by Nov. 1. That means Wisconsin will not need to put in place a new electoral map while the justices consider the matter. A Supreme Court ruling faulting the Wisconsin redistricting plan could have far-reaching consequences for the redrawing of electoral districts due after the 2020 U.S. census. State and federal legislative district boundaries are reconfigured every decade after the census so that each one holds about same number of people, but are sometimes draw in a way that packs voters who tend to favor a particular party into certain districts so as to diminish their statewide voting power. Wisconsin Republican Attorney General Brad Schimel welcomed the justices decision to hear the states appeal and called the states redistricting process entirely lawful and constitutional. The case in the short term could affect congressional maps in about half a dozen states and legislative maps in about 10 states, before having major implications for the post-2020 redistricting, according to the New York University School of Laws Brennan Center for Justice. Wisconsins gerrymander was one of the most aggressive of the decade, locking in a large and implausibly stable majority for Republicans in what is otherwise a battleground state, said Brennan Center redistricting expert Thomas Wolf. Its a symptom of politics going haywire and something that we increasingly see when one party has sole control of the redistricting process. Justice Anthony Kennedy, a conservative who sometimes sides with the courts liberals in major cases, could cast the decisive vote. Kennedy, writing in a 2004 case, indicated he may be open to the idea that racial gerrymanders could violate the Constitution. Though a workable standard defining it did not exist, he suggested one might emerge in a future case. Democrats have accused Republicans of taking improper actions at the state level to suppress the turnout of minority voters and others who tend to support Democrats and maximize the number of party members in state legislatures and the U.S. House of Representatives. Republicans call their actions lawful. Republicans control the U.S. Congress. They also have majorities in an all-time high of 69 of 99 state legislative chambers, according to the Republican State Leadership Committee. After winning control of the state legislature in 2010, Wisconsin Republicans redrew the statewide electoral map. They were able to amplify Republican voting power, gaining more seats than their percentage of the statewide vote would suggest. In 2012, Republicans received about 49 percent of the vote but won 60 of the 99 state Assembly seats. In 2014, the party garnered 52 percent of the vote and 63 Assembly seats. A dozen Wisconsin Democratic Party voters in 2015 sued state election officials, saying the redistricting divided Democratic voters in some areas and packed them in others to dilute their electoral clout and benefit Republican candidates.  The lower court found that redistricting efforts are unlawful partisan gerrymandering when they seek to entrench the party in power, and have no other legitimate justification.  The state argues recent election results favoring Republicans were a reflection of Wisconsins natural political geography, with Democrats concentrated in urban areas like Milwaukee and Madison.

Days after a lone gunman opened fire on U.S. lawmakers at a baseball team practice in Virginia, a conservative group was running a TV ad in Atlanta that, with no evidence, appears to link the Democratic candidate, Jon Ossoff, to the shooting spree. Ossoff called the ad shameful in a statement. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution newspaper reported that Ossoffs Republican opponent, Karen Handel, also condemned the ad. It was an ugly, last-minute twist in the Ossoff-Handel contest for the U.S. House of Representatives seat vacated by Tom Price, who resigned after becoming Trumps secretary of the Health and Human Services Department. Total spending in the Georgia race for all candidates has topped $56 million, including tens of millions by outside groups, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a campaign finance watchdog in Washington, D.C., easily topping the previous record of $29.5 million set in a 2012 Florida race. Out of the total, $51.9 million has been spent on Handel and Ossoff, the Center for Responsive Politics said. Envelopes containing a white powder turned up last week in the home mailboxes of Handel and a few neighbors, prompting a probe by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The Washington Post reported that the powder was only baking soda and both candidates now are traveling with bodyguards. The district spans affluent and increasingly diverse suburbs north of Atlanta. It has elected Republicans for decades, but Trump carried it by only 1 percentage point in 2016. Ossoff, 30, initially drew national attention with the slogan Make Trump Furious, inspiring volunteers from as far away as Oregon to knock on doors and make phone calls for him. Handel, a 55-year-old former Georgia secretary of state, has painted Ossoff as an inexperienced tool of national liberal interests who does not live in the district he hopes to represent. Like Ossoff, Handel rarely mentions Trump. Whatever the outcome, the race will not significantly alter the balance of power in Washington, where Republicans control the House by a wide margin. But victory could provide a blueprint for Democrats on how to win outside of their urban, coastal strongholds.  Democrats fell short in special House elections earlier this year in Kansas and Montana, in districts that Trump won by double-digits.

(Reuters) - Democrat Jon Ossoff no longer talks about making President Donald Trump furious. But he may be on the verge of doing just that. Ossoff, a political newcomer who launched his congressional campaign in the Republican-leaning northern suburbs of Atlanta by urging supporters to make Trump furious, now speaks in the measured tones of a moderate consensus builder and rarely mentions the president by name. Local economic development and cutting wasteful government spending are Ossoffs talking points in a race against Republican Karen Handel that has shattered records as the most expensive congressional contest in U.S. history. Polls show it is headed for a tight finish in Tuesdays special election. An Ossoff victory would rattle Republicans already nervous about next years congressional midterm elections, and offer Democrats a template on how to campaign in suburban swing districts as they try to erase the 24-seat Republican majority in the House of Representatives. It would send a very strong message across the country that we can win these kinds of seats, said Representative Dan Kildee, a Michigan Democrat who campaigned with Ossoff in Georgia this week. Democrats have much riding on the outcome. On the surface, conditions seem ripe for a nationwide Democratic renaissance, with a historically unpopular Republican president entangled in an investigation for possible obstruction of justice and the Republican agenda largely stalled in Congress. But Democrats lost two special House elections earlier this year in conservative Kansas and Montana districts that Trump won by double digits last November. A failure in a more competitive district in Georgia, which Trump carried by just 1 percentage point, would be a morale killer for a party that has struggled to develop a coherent message beyond Were not the party of Trump. Democrats have steadily lost ground in recent years in state and local races. Republicans not only control the White House and both chambers of Congress, but also hold 33 governors offices, the most in nearly a century. Infighting between grass-roots progressives and the partys more mainstream wing has plagued Democrats, who have appeared increasingly vulnerable to Republican attacks portraying them as coastal elites out of touch with working-class Americans. Ossoffs Make Trump Furious slogan quickly endeared him to national anti-Trump activists and pushed him well ahead of 17 rivals in polls in Aprils non-partisan primary in a district represented by Republicans for decades. It wasnt enough. The 30-year-old former congressional staffer and documentary filmmaker fell just short of a majority, and outright victory, forcing a closely watched run-off against Handel for the House seat vacated by Tom Price, the new secretary of health and human services who was first elected to the House in 2004.  But the grassroots enthusiasm has made Ossoff a fundraising machine. He raised a stunning $24 million by the end of May, five times the amount raised by Handel, a former Georgia secretary of state. Republican outside groups have helped her make up some of the difference, spending nearly $9 million on her behalf, according to fundraising reports. Total spending has approached $40 million, obliterating the previous record of $30 million for a Florida congressional race in 2012. While he benefits from the grassroots anti-Trump fervor, Ossoff has deliberately avoided making the race a referendum on Trump. On the campaign trail and in ads, he promises to work with Republicans and focuses on his plans to bolster local economic development, protect access to healthcare, particularly for women, and cut wasteful spending to pay for new priorities. Ossoff said voters in the district are not demanding that he lead an anti-Trump resistance. I think voters are more concerned with accountability and results than they are with political drama, he said in an interview after a meeting with millennial supporters. While voters concerns about the administration have grown, he said, Fundamentally what folks are looking for is representation that will work across the aisle to deliver a higher quality of life. Handel, who also rarely mentions Trump and has argued that the race should be about who has the values and experience to best serve the district, says Ossoff is misrepresenting himself. Hes trying to portray himself as something that he is not. He is Nancy Pelosis hand-picked candidate, Handel told reporters this week after greeting diners at a local hamburger restaurant, repeating a line about House Democratic leader Pelosi that has featured prominently in attack ads against Ossoff by outside groups. He is an ultra-liberal. His values do not align with this district, she said. Some of her supporters agree. Terry Anderson, 67, a retired IT worker from Cobb County, said he did not believe Ossoff was sincere. He sounds more like a moderate Republican all the time, he said. But Brenda Carswell, 61, a retired American Express employee from the city of Tucker who said she typically has switched back and forth between Republicans and Democrats - Ive voted for some Bushes and Ive voted for some Clintons - said she is backing Ossoff. Hes been mostly discussing issues that people care about. The problems in our area are more important than most of what they talk about in Washington, she said. Trump, who visited Georgia to raise money for Handel in late April, is watching closely. On Twitter, he criticized Ossoff, and after Ossoff was forced into a runoff he crowed that Democrats failed in Kansas and are now failing in Georgia. Trump called the race Hollywood vs. Georgia. Several recent polls have given Ossoff a slight edge heading into Tuesday, while showing that there are few voters who are still undecided. Democrats say the increasingly diverse area exemplifies the sort of educated and affluent suburban district that Democrats will need to win to recapture the House. Georgia-based Democratic strategist Tharon Johnson said Ossoffs non-ideological messaging should be a model for a party that needs moderates, independents and disaffected Republicans next year. Hes done a good job of positioning himself as a sensible Democrat, he said. He doesnt need to tell voters what is wrong with Trump - people see the drama and the problems every day.

Andrew Weissmann, who headed the U.S. Justice Departments criminal fraud section before joining Muellers team last month, is best known for two assignments - the investigation of now-defunct energy company Enron and organized crime cases in Brooklyn, New York - that depended heavily on gaining witness cooperation. Securing the cooperation of people close to Trump, many of whom have been retaining their own lawyers, could be important for Mueller, who was named by the Justice Department as special counsel on May 17 and is investigating, among other issues, whether Trump himself has sought to obstruct justice. Trump has denied allegations of both collusion and obstruction.  Flipping witnesses is a common, although not always successful, tactic in criminal prosecutions. Robert Ray, who succeeded Kenneth Starr as the independent counsel examining former President Bill Clinton, noted that Trumps fired former national security advisor, Michael Flynn, has already offered through his lawyer to testify before Congress in exchange for immunity, suggesting potential willingness to cooperate as a witness. It would seem to me the time is now to make some decisions about what you have and what leverage can be applied to get the things you dont have, Ray said, referring to Muellers team. Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, Trumps son-in-law Jared Kushner and others close to the president already have hired their own lawyers to help navigate Muellers expanding probe and ongoing congressional investigations. Kathryn Ruemmler, who served as White House counsel under former President Barack Obama, said Weissmann is willing to take risks to secure witness testimony that other prosecutors might not. Ruemmler worked with Weissmann on the Justice Departments Enron task force that investigated the massive corporate fraud that led to the companys 2001 collapse.  Ruemmler recalled that Weissmann had a hunch that former Enron treasurer Ben Glisan would be willing to talk despite already having pleaded guilty without agreeing to cooperate. So Weissmann had U.S. marshals bring Glisan before the grand jury from prison, Ruemmler said.  Other prosecutors might have feared Glisans testimony could contradict their theory of the case, Ruemmler said, but Weissmanns gamble paid off when the former executive became a key witness. Hes not afraid to lose, and that is sometimes an unusual quality, Ruemmler said of Weissmann. Weissmann also led lengthy negotiations with lawyers for Andrew Fastow, Enrons former chief financial officer and a star prosecution witness in the case, gaining leverage from the fact that prosecutors had indicted Fastows wife, also a former Enron employee, on tax fraud charges. Both pleaded guilty, and Fastow testified against former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling, who was convicted in 2006. Fastow declined to comment. Glisan could not be reached for comment. Representatives for Mueller and the Trump legal team declined to comment. Critics have said say Weissmanns hardball approach can lead to prosecutorial overreach. A number of Enron convictions were overturned on appeal, and Skillings 24-year sentence was later reduced by 10 years. Defense lawyer Tom Kirkendall, who represented clients related to the Enron case, said the task force intimidated witnesses and misinterpreted the law. But Sam Buell, a former prosecutor who was a member of the Enron task force, called such criticism routine in high-stakes cases. Mueller has several other highly experienced lawyers on his team, including U.S. Deputy Solicitor General Michael Dreeben. Trump has also been building a legal team led by New York lawyer Marc Kasowitz, with veteran Washington defense lawyer John Dowd recently coming aboard. Before his work relating to Enron, Weissmann served as a federal prosecutor in the organized crime bureau in Brooklyn. In 1997, he and trial partner George Stamboulidis brought down one of the countrys most powerful mob bosses, Vincent the Chin Gigante, with the help of turncoat witnesses. We cut our teeth in the organized crime section, said Stamboulidis, now in private practice. And the only way you can make those cases is to get people to cooperate, even when the oath of Omerta (a Mafia code of silence and non-cooperation with authorities) was strong and in full play.

In what is billed as a major speech, House Speaker Paul Ryan will seek to dispel the notion that tax reform is adrift by describing what a U.S. tax code overhaul will look like, according to a source close to Ryans office.  The speaker will emphasize the importance of permanent reforms and reject the notion that legislation should do little more than reduce tax rates, the source said. He will underscore the need for international corporate tax reforms in remarks to the National Association of Manufacturers. Aides said he is not expected to delve into the details of tax proposals. The Wisconsin Republican delivered a similar optimistic message to lobbyists and campaign donors in Virginia over the weekend, adding that he expected Congress to finalize legislation to dismantle Obamacare by mid-summer, according to a source familiar with the Speakers comments. Originally expected to unveil tax reform legislation in the spring, Republicans are under pressure from business lobbyists to make good on campaign pledges to reform the tax code and pass healthcare legislation. Lawmakers also need legislative victories to stave off Democratic challenges in next years congressional mid-term elections.          What Ryan needs to do is refocus folks on the rationale for having tax reform, not just the political rationale, but the economic rationale, said Jeff Kupfer, a former economic adviser to President George W. Bush. Markets have been anticipating lower taxes. Major stock indexes have hit multiple record highs from Trumps election to the end of the first quarter, on bets he would improve economic growth by cutting taxes and boosting infrastructure spending. The tax reform debate has largely moved behind closed doors, where Ryan is trying to hammer out an agreement with Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, White House economic adviser Gary Cohn and Republican chairmen of the two congressional tax committees. The aim is to unveil tax reform legislation in September.  Outside those discussions, lawmakers have begun to talk about legislation that would do little more than cut taxes, with temporary reductions financed by the federal deficit.

Trump announced a partial rollback of the normalization of relations with Cuba on Friday in Miami, the heartland of Cuban exiles, in a theater named after the leader of the failed U.S.-backed Bay of Pigs invasion of the island in 1961. It was a grotesque spectacle straight from the Cold War, Rodriguez said in Vienna, during a tour of European countries, in a news conference broadcast live in Cuba. Trumps speech before an audience that included people Cuba considers terrorists, included dramatic flourishes like a Cuban- American exile playing the U.S. national anthem on his violin. The U.S. president stopped short of breaking diplomatic relations with Cuba, restored in 2015 after more than five decades of hostility and leaves many recent agreements between the two countries intact. However, it will tighten restrictions on Americans traveling to the Caribbean island, hurting the booming Cuban tourism industry and clamp down on U.S. business dealings with Cubas military. It is necessary to wait for the U.S. government to announce regulations that implement these measures before opining on their reach and depth, Rodriguez said. He added, however, that they would inevitably hit U.S. companies and citizens by restricting their ability to invest in or travel to Cuba, while also hurting the Cuban people. It will wreak economic damage not just on Cubas state companies but also on the cooperatives and private sector workers, he said.  Moodys Investor Service released a report on Monday saying the U.S. revision of its Cuban policy was credit negative for the island, coming at a time when the country was already suffering liquidity problems due to weakening economic support from its crisis-wracked ally Venezuela. The Cuban foreign minister said Trumps hope of separating the people from the military, who were simply the people in uniform, was infantile.    On the contrary, these measures reinforce our patriotism, our dignity and our decision to defend national independence by all means, he said. Meanwhile, the partial rollback of the detente would fall flat with the majority of Americans, who supported the normalization of relations with Cuba, and with whom the country would continue working, Rodriguez added. In response to Trumps demand to return fugitives sought by the United States, Rodriguez said Cuba considered them fighters for civil liberties.  These persons will not be returned to the United States, he said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - One of President Donald Trumps personal lawyers said in television interviews on Sunday that the president was not under investigation for obstruction of justice, but when pressed on the assertion, said he was not certain. The fact of the matter is the president has not been and is not under investigation, Jay Sekulow, a new member of Trumps legal team, said on CBS Face the Nation in one of four interviews he gave on Sunday. There have been multiple news reports and a tweet from Trump himself on Friday that began with: I am being investigated. Challenged on Fox News Sunday about the issue, Sekulow said he could not be certain Trump was not under investigation but that no one had notified the legal team if that was the case.  It is common for subjects of federal investigations not to know they are under scrutiny, especially in the initial phases.  A source familiar with the Mueller probe said on Thursday that investigators would have to gather a large amount of evidence before an interview with the president would be warranted.  Trump, who has denied any collusion between his campaign and Russia, has frequently lashed out about the allegations, which have overshadowed his administrations efforts to overhaul the healthcare system, cut taxes and boost jobs. Mueller, the special counsel named by the Justice Department to probe the Russia matter, is investigating whether anyone associated with Trump or his campaign had any illegal dealings with Russian officials or others with ties to the Kremlin. Russian officials have denied meddling in the U.S. election. The source familiar with the Mueller probe told Reuters that Mueller was also examining whether Trump or others tried to interfere with the investigation. Sekulow said that Trump, in his tweet, was reacting to a story in the Washington Post, which was the first to report  Mueller was examining whether Trump had tried to obstruct the probe by firing FBI Director James Comey in May. Sekulow acknowledged that he could not be certain that the report was false. I cannot read the mind of the special prosecutor, he said.  Peter Carr, a spokesman for the Mueller team, declined to comment. Sekulow, a conservative activist and radio talk-show host, earlier this month joined Trumps legal team, which is led by Marc Kasowitz.  Sekulow has publicly criticized Comey, whom Trump fired.  In addition to being the author of several books such as Undemocratic: How unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats are stealing your liberty and freedom, Sekulow is the chief counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice, a politically conservative Christian organization. Barak Cohen, a former Justice Department lawyer and now a defense attorney specializing in white-collar crime and investigations, said there was no requirement that the special counsel notify Trump he was under investigation, so the lack of such notice meant nothing. He said, however, that Sekulows comments could mean the White House was taking the position that no investigation exists until Muellers team officially confirms it, disregarding media reports based on anonymous sourcing. Cohen said the first official communication that a target is under investigation typically comes when prosecutors begin requesting documents and other evidence. At that time, defense lawyers often will ask about their clients status. Prosecutors will often answer then to avoid misleading the target. They may not answer if they are trying to build a case and develop further evidence. No answer is probably the most troubling answer in criminal defense, Cohen said.

The justices declined to review the ruling that dismissed claims by Ohios Democratic Party and homeless rights groups that the states perfect form law, which invalidates ballots for even minor errors, deprived thousands of people of their right to vote, violating the federal Voting Rights Act. Such suits must be filed by the federal government, not private citizens, that court held.  The Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless in Cleveland, the Columbus Coalition for the Homeless and the state Democratic Party challenged a pair of 2014 laws. Those laws required county election boards to reject absentee and provisional ballots unless voters had properly and completely filled out the forms that come with the ballots, including with their name, address, birth date and signature.  Ballots were rejected even if the voters identity could be determined despite the errors, the plaintiffs told the justices in legal papers. Some were thrown out for omitting zip codes, using cursive writing instead of print, or writing in the current date instead of a birth date, they said, disenfranchising thousands of voters in recent elections, especially minorities.  The plaintiffs claimed the laws were unconstitutional, violating voters rights to due process and equal protection under the law. They also alleged the laws violated a provision of the Voting Rights Act that outlaws voter disqualification for errors that are not material to determining voter eligibility. Last September the Cincinnati-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found the laws to be mostly legal, striking down only the requirement that absentee voters accurately provide their full address and birth date.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump and Republican leaders in Congress will soon confront a complex challenge for tax reform: how to limit U.S. corporate tax avoidance schemes that take advantage of low tax rates in foreign countries. Congressional and administration staff have begun to examine options to address profit-shifting schemes that include so-called transfer pricing, earnings stripping and tax inversions.  A decision on how to handle these in tax legislation could come before Congress leaves town for its one-week July 4 recess on June 29, officials and lobbyists said. Lawmakers say the current tax code incentivizes profit shifting overseas because of the high 35 percent U.S. corporate income tax rate and rules that allow companies to hold profits abroad tax free until returned to U.S. soil. Without effective measures against tax avoidance, experts and lobbyists said tax legislation could trigger a new exodus of income and assets abroad. Because Trump and Republicans in Congress also want to end U.S. taxes on foreign earnings, companies could eliminate their U.S. tax bills altogether without restrictions.   Tax reduction strategies have been employed for decades by companies including Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O). Independent analysts estimate the federal government misses out on more than $100 billion a year in corporate tax revenues as a result of tax reduction maneuvers. That is equal to one-third of the $300 billion in annual corporate tax revenues. Many schemes seek lower corporate tax bills through transfer pricing - using transactions between business units to shift income abroad. The shift often coincides with the transfer of intangible assets such as intellectual property to low-tax nations where companies can expect single-digit tax rates.   Last week, Senate Finance Committee Democrats asked Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to leave in place regulations adopted under President Barack Obama to combat earnings stripping and tax inversions. Companies use earnings stripping to shift income abroad as tax-deductible interest payments to foreign affiliates. Inversions are international mergers in which U.S. companies move their headquarters to foreign countries with low taxes, if only on paper, to lower their U.S. tax bills. Companies have accumulated some $2.6 trillion in abroad, equivalent to more than three-quarters of the $3.3 trillion in annual government receipts expected this year. BORDER-ADJUSTMENT TAX But the most effective measures against corporate tax avoidance schemes, including House Speaker Paul Ryans controversial border-adjustment tax, or BAT, have proved unpopular, raising the possibility that tax legislation could simply cut the corporate tax rate to 15 percent to reduce the advantages offered by foreign tax havens. Aside from BAT, which taxes imports but not exports, tax reform discussions are also looking at a minimum tax on profits from tax havens, a tax on intangible income and other measures to discourage companies from shifting profits to low-tax countries where they do little actual business, according to aides and lobbyists. Lobbyists said none of the options have enjoyed consensus support in Congress. Meanwhile, the idea of a simple rate cut does not sit well with House Republican leaders.   Even with a low rate, well continue to see U.S. jobs and research and headquarters move overseas, said House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, a leading BAT proponent. Experts warn that the 15 percent rate sought by Trump is well above a 5 percent effective rate that some corporations pay in countries like Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Brady and Ryan are expected to address the issue in coming weeks with Mnuchin, White House economic adviser Gary Cohn, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch. The six are trying to forge legislation that could be unveiled as early as September. Trump has pledged the biggest tax overhaul since Ronald Reagan.

Clarke notified Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly on Friday of his decision, Craig Peterson, an adviser to Clarke, said in a statement, according to the Washington Post and other newspapers. Sheriff Clarke is 100 percent committed to the success of President Trump and believes his skills could be better utilized to promote the presidents agenda in a more aggressive role, the newspapers quoted Peterson as saying.

He had roughly $20 million in income from his new marquee Washington hotel, which opened just down the street from the White House last September. Revenues also increased at Mar-a-Lago, the Florida resort known as the Winter White House. Trump reported income of at least $594 million for 2016 and early 2017 and assets worth at least $1.4 billion. (bit.ly/2sah0ZM) The 98-page disclosure document posted on the ethics offices  website showed liabilities for Trump of at least $130 million to Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas [DBKGK.UL], a unit of German-based Deutsche Bank AG. For example, Trump disclosed a liability to Deutsche exceeding $50 million for the Old Post Office, a historic Washington property where he has opened a hotel.  Trump reported liabilities of at least $110 million to Ladder Capital Corp , a commercial real estate lender with offices in New York, Los Angeles and Boca Raton, Florida. The largest component of Trumps income was $115.9 million listed as golf-resort related revenues from Trump National Doral in Miami, down from $132 million he reported a year ago. Income from many of his other hotels and resorts largely held steady. Revenue from Trump Corporation, his real-estate management company, nearly tripled, to $18 million, and revenue from Mar-a-Lago grew by 25 percent, to $37.25 million. The private club doubled its initiation fee to $200,000 after Trumps election. He earned $11 million from the Miss Universe pageant, after selling the beauty contest back in 2015.  Revenue from television shows like The Apprentice fell to $1.1 million, down from $6 million a year earlier. His assets probably exceeded $1.4 billion because the disclosure form provided ranges of values. The document showed Trump held officer positions in 565 corporations or other entities before becoming U.S. president. His tenure in most of those posts ended on Jan. 19, the day before his inauguration, and in others in 2015 and 2016. Most of the entities involved were based in the United States, with a handful in Scotland, Ireland, Canada, Brazil, Bermuda and elsewhere. Trump has refused to release his tax returns, which would give a much clearer indication of his wealth and business interests.

An Office of Government Ethics spokesman declined to comment on the contents of the report, other than to say that it was certified by the office, which is an ethics watchdog for federal government employees. Trump released a disclosure form in May 2016 that his campaign at the time said showed his net worth was $10 billion. Some critics disputed that figure as overblown.

Laying out his new Cuba policy in a speech in Miami, Trump  signed a presidential directive rolling back parts of Obamas historic opening to the Communist-ruled country after a 2014 diplomatic breakthrough between the two former Cold War foes. But Trump left in place many of Obamas changes, including the reopened U.S. embassy in Havana, even as he sought to show he was making good on a campaign promise to take a tougher line against Cuba, especially over its human rights record. We will not be silent in the face of communist oppression any longer, Trump told a cheering crowd in Miamis Cuban-American enclave of Little Havana, including Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who helped forge the new restrictions on Cuba. Effective immediately, I am canceling the last administrations completely one-sided deal with Cuba, Trump declared as he made a full-throated assault on the government of Cuban President Raul Castro. Cuba later denounced the move as a setback in U.S.-Cuban relations, saying Trump had been badly advised and was resorting to coercive methods of the past that were doomed to fail. The government remained willing to engage in respectful dialogue, it said in a statement. Trumps revised approach calls for stricter enforcement of a longtime ban on Americans going to Cuba as tourists, and seeks to prevent U.S. dollars from being used to fund what the Trump administration sees as a repressive military-dominated government. (tmsnrt.rs/2rBfMTI) But, facing pressure from U.S. businesses and even some fellow Republicans to avoid turning back the clock completely in relations with Cuba, the president chose to leave intact some of his Democratic predecessors steps toward normalization.     The new policy bans most U.S. business transactions with the Armed Forces Business Enterprises Group, a Cuban conglomerate involved in all sectors of the economy. But it makes some exceptions, including for air and sea travel, according to U.S. officials. This will essentially shield U.S. airlines and cruise lines serving the island.  We do not want U.S. dollars to prop up a military monopoly that exploits and abuses the citizens of Cuba, Trump said, pledging that U.S. sanctions would not be lifted until Cuba frees political prisoners and holds free elections. While the changes are far-reaching, they appear to be less sweeping than many U.S. pro-engagement advocates had feared.     Trump based his partial reversal of Obamas Cuba measures largely on human rights grounds. His critics, however, have questioned why his administration is now singling out Cuba for human rights abuses but downplaying the issue in other parts of the world, including Saudi Arabia, a close U.S. ally Trump visited last month where political parties and protests are banned. Trump, however, stopped short of breaking diplomatic relations restored in 2015 after more than five decades of hostilities. He also will not cut off recently resumed direct U.S.-Cuba commercial flights or cruise-ship travel, though his more restrictive policy seems certain to dampen new economic ties overall. The administration, according to one White House official, has no intention of disrupting existing business ventures such as one struck under Obama by Starwood Hotels Inc, which is owned by Marriott International Inc, to manage a historic Havana hotel.     Nor does Trump plan to reinstate limits that Obama lifted on the amount of the islands coveted rum and cigars that Americans can bring home for personal use.     Still, it will be the latest attempt by Trump to overturn parts of Obamas presidential legacy. He has already pulled the United States out of a major international climate treaty and is trying to scrap his predecessors landmark healthcare program. When Obama announced the detente in 2014, he said that decades of U.S. efforts to achieve change in Cuba by isolating the island had failed and it was time to try a new approach. Critics of the rapprochement said Obama was giving too much away without extracting concessions from the Cuban government. Castros government has clearly stated it does not intend to change its one-party political system. Trump aides say Obamas efforts amounted to appeasement and have done nothing to advance political freedoms in Cuba, while benefiting the Cuban government financially. Its hard to think of a policy that makes less sense than the prior administrations terrible and misguided deal with the Castro regime, Trump said in Miami. International human rights groups say, however, that renewed U.S. efforts to isolate the island could worsen the situation by empowering Cuban hard-liners. The Cuban government, which has made clear it will not be pressured into reforms, had no immediate comment. But ordinary Cubans said they were crestfallen to be returning to an era of frostier relations with the United States with potential economic fallout for them. Its like we are returning to the Cold War, said Cuban designer Idania del Rio, who joined a group of friends in a hotel in Old Havana to watch the speech in English on CNN. Trump announced his new approach at the Manuel Artime Theater in the heart of the United States largest Cuban-American and Cuban exile community, whose support aides believe helped him win Florida in the election. The venue is named after a leader of the failed U.S.-backed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961 against Fidel Castros revolutionary government. I have trust in Trump to do the right thing when it comes to Cuba, said Jorge Saurez, 66, a retired physician in Little Havana. Trumps vow to keep the broader decades-old U.S. economic embargo on Cuba firmly in place drew criticism from some U.S. farmers, especially growers of corn, soybeans and rice. Obamas dtente has already lifted exports and raised hopes for more gains, which they said were now in doubt.     Mexicos foreign ministry urged the United States and Cuba to resolve their differences via dialogue. But Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, whose leftist government is Cubas main regional ally, slammed Trumps tightening of restrictions as an offence against Latin America. His speech was aggressive and threatening, ... revealing his contempt and ignorance, President Nicolas Maduro said in a speech. We reject Donald Trumps declarations against our brother Cuba. It is an offence against Latin America. The biggest change in travel policy will be that Americans making educational people-to-people trips, one of the most popular authorized categories, can no longer go to the island on their own but only on group tours. Trumps aides said the aim was to close off a path for Americans seeking beach vacations in a country where U.S. tourism is still officially banned. U.S. Senator Jeff Flake, one of the Republican Partys most vocal advocates for easing rules  on U.S. dealings with Cuba, called for a vote on legislation lifting restrictions on American travel there. But the Republican leadership in Congress has long blocked such a move, and it appears unlikely to budge. Under Trumps order, the Treasury and Commerce departments will be given 30 days to begin writing new regulations, which will not take effect until they are complete. In contentious deliberations leading up to the new policy, some aides argued that Trump, a former real estate magnate who won the presidency vowing to unleash U.S. business, would have a hard time defending any moves that close off the Cuban market. But other advisers have contended that it is important to make good on a campaign promise to Cuban-Americans. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Trump will on Friday announce a plan to tighten rules on Americans traveling to Communist-run Cuba and significantly restrict U.S. firms from doing business with Cuban enterprises controlled by the military, White House officials said. It hurts to be going backwards. To roll back the engagement will only manage to isolate us from the world, said Havana resident Marta Deus, who will try to tune into Trumps speech in Miami, the heartland of Cuban exiles. Deus recently set up an accountancy firm and courier service, to cater to a private sector that has flourished sincealandmark agreement two and a half years ago between former U.S. President Barack Obama and Cuban leader Raul Castro to normalize relations between the former Cold War foes. We need clients, business, we need the economy to move and by isolating Cuba, they will only manage to hurt many Cuban families and force companies to close, she said. The 2014 dealsparked widespread euphoria in Cuba and raised hopes for an improvement in its ailingeconomy. An increased arrival of U.S. tourists thanks to eased restrictions fueled a boom in tourism, especially in Havana, creating demand for more BnBs, restaurants, taxis and tour guides in the fledgling private sector. But critics say the opening failed to improve rights on the island. Trump will justify his partial reversal of Obamas measures to a large extent on those grounds, the White House officials said, and some Cuban dissidents back his tougher stance, saying repression has worsened since the detente. Cuban authorities have stepped up their detentions of activists, often confiscating their telephones and laptops, but they have also been coming down with a heavy hand on self- employed Cubans who appear to be empowering themselves. When the Obama administration stopped condemning human rights violations in Cuba, the regime here said look we can do this and nothing happens, so we can continue repressing more forcefully, said Jose Daniel Ferrer, who leads the Patriotic Union of Cuba, the countrys largest dissident group. Ferrer said his group had 53 activists currently imprisoned due to their political views. Other dissidents agree repression has worsened but say rolling back the detente, which will hurt ordinary Cubans, is not the solution. It will probably not have any benefit in terms of human rights, said Eliecer Avila, the leader of the opposition youth group Somos Mas. The Cuban government has withstood the U.S. trade embargo for more than a half century and will not make any political concessions to the United States due to economic pressure, said Carlos Alzugaray, a retired Cuban diplomat.  I am concerned it will affect the private sector quite a bit and much more than the Cuban government, he said. Without doubt it will impact those in the tourism industry that have benefited from a threefold increase in U.S. visits in the last two years, although it is unclear just how much.

With things going to pot, Ill have to tighten my belt.  This new setback to the Cuban economy will come at a time when it is already wrestling with falling oil shipments from crisis-stricken ally Venezuela and a decline in exports. This is another blow for Cubans and it will hurt our pockets obviously, said Martha Garcia, 51. With the United States, there is no tranquility.

The congressmans status remains critical, Dr. Jack Sava, the director of trauma at the MedStar Washington Hospital Center, told reporters. An excellent recovery is a good possibility. Scalise, 51, sustained injuries to internal organs, broken bones and severe bleeding after being shot in his left hip on Wednesday morning on a baseball field in a Washington suburb. Scalise had been at imminent risk of death when he was first brought into the hospital on Wednesday, and he received many units of transfused blood, Sava said. The congressmans risk of death was now substantially lower because doctors have controlled the bleeding and his vital signs have stabilized. Scalise, who has had two surgeries, will need additional operations and will be in the hospital for a considerable period of time, presumably weeks, Sava said. Because the bullet shattered, there may be hundreds of fragments in Scalises body and doctors do not intend to try to remove them all, Sava said. He declined to describe specific internal injuries. Once recovered, Scalise will be able to walk and hopefully run, the doctor said. He said doctors have turned down Scalises sedation levels enough that he has been able to respond to visiting family members. Scalise, a police officer, a congressional aide and a lobbyist were wounded on Wednesday when a man identified as James Hodgkinson, 66, from the St. Louis suburb of Belleville, Illinois, opened fire on the lawmakers as they practiced for an annual charity baseball game between Republicans and Democrats. Hodgkinson died after being shot by police. A list of Republican lawmakers was found on Hodgkinsons body, CBS News reported, citing an unidentified U.S. official. The list included Representatives Mo Brooks and Jeff Duncan, who were at the practice, and Representative Trent Franks, who was not, CBS said. The note was not considered an assassination list, the network said. The FBI declined to comment on the report. The U.S. Capitol Police and representatives for the three lawmakers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The FBI said that the shooters weapons found at the scene - a 9mm handgun and 7.62mm caliber rifle - had been legally purchased. The FBI continues to process evidence in an effort to assess the potential motivations of the shooter, the agency said in a statement Friday. Hodgkinson had a history of posting angry messages against Trump and other Republicans on social media. Members of Congress took the field at Washingtons Nationals Park on Thursday night for the charity baseball game, many wearing hats to honor Scalise, who has represented Louisiana in the House since 2008.

John Dowd, who has represented key figures in a variety white-collar criminal matters and investigations, has joined the presidents defense team led by New York lawyer Marc Kasowitz, Mark Corallo, a spokesman for the team, said on Friday. Another well-known white-collar Washington lawyer will likely join the team shortly, according to a person familiar with the matter. Dowd, 76, represented U.S. Senator John McCain on congressional ethics charges in the Keating Five banking scandal in the late 1980s and early 1990s. McCain was cleared in the matter. In 1989, Dowds investigation on behalf of Major League Baseball led to former Hall of Famer Pete Rose being banned from the sport for betting on games while he was manager of the Cincinnati Reds. Dowd also defended Galleon Group hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam in a 2011 trial brought by federal prosecutors in New York over insider trading. Rajaratnam was found guilty and sentenced to 11 years in prison. Earlier in his career, Dowd served in the U.S. Marine Corps and was part of a U.S. Department of Justice organized crime unit. He went into private practice in 1978. He worked for many years at the law firm of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, retiring in 2015. Along with Kasowitz and Dowd, the other lawyers on Trumps team so far are Jay Sekulow, a conservative activist with a radio call-in show, and Michael Bowe, a longtime partner in Kasowitzs firm.  Mueller is investigating possible ties between Trumps campaign and the Russian government, which U.S. officials have said meddled in the 2016 election. Russia has denied such interference. The White House has denied any collusion with Moscow. The special counsel also is looking into whether Trump has sought to obstruct the investigation, a person familiar with the inquiry said on Thursday. Former FBI Director James Comey testified earlier this month that Trump asked him to drop the bureaus investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

A trade delegation from Minnesota, one of the largest U.S. agriculture states, vowed to carry on with its planned visit to Cuba next week. Were going to continue to beat the drum and let them (the Trump administration) know that trade is good for agriculture, said Kevin Paap, a farmer in the delegation. Trump signed a presidential directive on Friday rolling back parts of former President Barack Obamas opening to the Communist-ruled country after a 2014 diplomatic breakthrough between the two former Cold War foes. Farm groups saw the move as a step backward in what had been an improving trade relationship between the two countries which are just 90 miles (145 kms) apart, even though agriculture is not directly targeted. U.S. law exempts food from a decades-old embargo on U.S. trade with Cuba, but cumbersome rules on how transactions were executed have made deals difficult and costly. Since Obamas detente, substantial headway has been made, however, with shipments of U.S. corn and soybeans to Cuba soaring 420 percent in 2016 from a year earlier to 268,360 tonnes, U.S. Department of Agriculture data shows. Through the first four months of 2017, total shipments of U.S. grain and soy were 142,860 tonnes, up from 49,090 tonnes during the same period of 2016. While the quantities are dwarfed by total U.S. exports  nearly 56 million tonnes of corn alone last year  the added volumes were welcome as farmers face a fourth year of languishing grain prices and crimped incomes. At a time when the farm economy is struggling, we ask our leaders in Washington not to close doors on market opportunities for American agriculture, Wesley Spurlock, president of the National Corn Growers Association, said in a statement. The group sees an opportunity for $125 million more a year in trade to Cuba. Trumps move could cut off near-term sales and stymie economic development that would drive longer-term demand growth, said Tom Sleight, president of the U.S. Grains Council, a grain trade development organization, in a statement. Neither of those outcomes is favorable for the U.S. ag sector or the Cuban people, he added. Paap said the United States should be doing more to encourage exports.

That policy change could be bad news for airlines that have been helped by demand from solo travelers and families who have booked seats for ad-hoc informal cultural exchanges that had passed muster under former President Barack Obamas loosened rules.  Its going to frustrate airlines who scheduled service on the premise that travel restrictions would eventually be removed, Robert Mann, analyst at R.W. Mann & Co, said. It was an if you build it they will come kind of a philosophy. Now, under directives announced by Trump on Friday, independent travel to Cuba from the United States will once again be forbidden, complicating the already tricky-to-navigate industry.  The new policy will ban most U.S. business transactions with the Armed Forces Business Enterprises Group, a sprawling conglomerate involved in all sectors of the economy, including the hotel and hospitality industry, but make some exceptions, including air and sea travel. [nL1N1JD02O] The presidents directive will essentially shield U.S. airlines and cruise lines now serving the island but dim a potentially bright outlook for travel growth between the countries.  While the industry at large is bracing for weakened demand following the policy shift, specialized travel agents could potentially see a windfall as travelers rush to book authorized organized trips to the island. You cant get through to our call line. Were receiving 10 times the emails we were this morning, Tom Popper, president of travel agency InsightCuba, which organizes legal group tours of the tourism-restricted island, said on Friday. U.S. cruise operators and airlines could lose around $712 million in annual revenues if the Trump administration fully reinstates restrictions on travel, Washington lobby group Engage Cuba said in a recent report. (tmsnrt.rs/2rBfMTI) While Trumps new policy avoids the worst-case scenario of cancelling all commercial flights or severing diplomatic relations, it will still be a blow to a tourism sector betting on Cuba as a new high-growth market.   If the goal is to help Cuban entrepreneurs, adding job-killing regulations on U.S. businesses and increasing government resources to investigate everyday Americans traveling to our island neighbor is not the answer, James Williams, president of Engage Cuba, said in a statement.     Marriott International Inc on Friday urged the White House to improve relations with post-Castro Cuba and recognize tourism as a strategic tool in the effort. Marriott, the worlds biggest hotel chain, operates the Gaviota 5th Avenue Hotel, which is owned by the Cuban military. The Treasury Department said on its website that travel-related commercial engagements established before new regulations from the Office of Foreign Assets Control will be permitted, which appears to exempt the Marriott venture. Airlines for America, an industry trade group, said airlines are reviewing the directive and will continue to comply with all federal rules and regulations regarding travel to Cuba. Obamas initial opening prompted a dash to launch flights into Cuba in mid-2016. Some early entrants, including smaller carriers Frontier Airlines, Silver Airways and Spirit Airlines Inc, have pulled out. While larger U.S. carriers have pared back flights to smaller Cuban cities, American Airlines, Delta, United Continental, Southwest and JetBlue have requested additional flight clearances on various routes to Havana.  Cruise operator Carnival Corp downplayed any impact from the change, saying it was pleased its ships could continue to sail to Cuba. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

No final determination has been made, said the spokesman, who asked that his name not be used.  Rescinding the policy known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, would anger those who have said President Donald Trump is already too tough on immigration enforcement. But leaving it in place would conflict with a promise Trump made on the presidential campaign trail. There was confusion over whether the policy would remain in place late Thursday after the Department of Homeland Security published a notice that it would rescind another Obama-era immigration policy. The other policy, known as Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA, was written in 2014 to protect illegal immigrant parents with children who are U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents. The policy never went into effect because federal courts put it on hold. The head of the Department of Homeland Security, John Kelly, said on Friday that the agency only rescinded the policy that had faced legal challenges. DAPA was immediately enjoined by the courts and it languished in limbo for two or three years, so my action yesterday was just a little housecleaning, Kelly said at a meeting in Miami with Latin American leaders on security in Central America.  DACA that applies to students has not been changed, Kelly said. The DHS statement also said DACA will remain in effect. The White House spokesman said the statement was only meant to clarify that the rescission of the program for parents would have no impact on the program for immigrants who arrived as children.  Trump had pledged on the campaign trail to rescind all of Obamas executive orders on immigration, including DACA.  But as president, he has said his administration was devising a policy on how to deal with individuals covered by DACA. No formal changes have been announced.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Friday sided with employers in a Supreme Court case over the rights of workers to bring class action lawsuits against companies, court documents showed.  Reversing a position staked out earlier by the Obama administration, which backed employees, the administration said in a court filing it would no longer defend the position of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) that employment agreements requiring workers to waive their rights to bring class action claims are invalid. The waivers compel workers to individually arbitrate disputes with their employers rather than bring collective lawsuits with their co-workers.  The NLRB, an independent agency in the federal government, said in letter to the court on Thursday that its own lawyer would represent the board in the employees class action rights case. It is unusual for the government to change positions in a case already pending at the Supreme Court, and marks a sharp break from the administration of former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, which had originally pursued the case on behalf of the NLRB. The NLRB currently has a Democratic majority, isolating it politically from the Republican Trump administration.  In January the Supreme Court agreed to review three lower court rulings, including one involving global professional services firm Ernst & Young, over the legality of the waivers. Employers have increasingly required workers to sign them as part of their arbitration agreements to guard against the rising tide of worker lawsuits seeking unpaid wages. In Fridays court filing, acting U.S. Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall said the Supreme Court should find that class action waivers are legal and enforceable under federal law. Workers that waive the right to collective litigation cannot escape the consequences of that choice, he said.  Companies say the waivers allow for speedier and more cost-effective resolution of workplace disputes. Class action litigation, on the other hand, is harder to fight and can lead to large damages awards.  Workers argue that pursuing their cases individually is prohibitively expensive and, without the prospect of large damages awards that class action litigation can lead to, lawyers will be deterred from taking their cases. The nine Supreme Court justices are expected to issue a ruling on the issue in the courts next term, which starts in October and ends in June 2018.

Robert Mueller, the special counsel named by the department to investigate the Russia matter, is now examining whether Trump or others sought to obstruct the probe, a person familiar with the inquiry said on Thursday. I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! Witch Hunt, Trump wrote on Twitter, referring to his May 9 dismissal of James Comey. Trump did not identify the man but appeared to be questioning the integrity of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the Justice Departments No. 2 official who appointed Mueller on May 17, supervises the probe and wrote a memo to Trump critical of Comey that preceded Comeys firing. Hours later, a source close to Trumps outside legal team said Trump did not intend his tweet to be confirmation of the investigation but rather was reacting to a Washington Post story on Wednesday about the probe. The source spoke on condition of anonymity.  Rosenstein has said privately he may need to recuse himself from matters relating to the Russia probe because he could become a witness in the investigation, ABC News reported on Friday. ABC said Rosenstein told Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand she would have authority over the probe if he were to step aside. The Democratic National Committee called on Rosenstein to recuse himself from the Russia matter, but it said authority over the investigation should be given to Mueller and not another Trump appointee. While the Republican Trump administration initially said Rosensteins letter was the reason the president fired Comey on May 9, Trump later said he did so because of the Russia thing. Comey told a Senate panel last week he believed Trump fired him to undermine the Federal Bureau of Investigations Russia probe. Comey testified that Trump directed him in February to drop an FBI investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn relating to the Russia matter. Comey testified it would be up to Mueller to decide whether Trumps action amounted to obstruction of justice, an act that could be cited in any effort in the Republican-led Congress to impeach him and remove him from office. The Russia issue has cast a shadow over Trumps five months in office. In another indication of the seriousness of the probe, Michael Cohen, a personal attorney to Trump, said he has retained attorney Stephen Ryan, a former assistant U.S. attorney, to represent him in the ongoing probes. Cohen has received a subpoena from one of the congressional committees looking into the Russia issue. Rosenstein has authority over the inquiry because Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself on March 2 after revelations of previously undisclosed meetings with Russias ambassador to Washington while he was a Trump campaign adviser. Brand was confirmed as the No. 3 Justice Department official on a 52-46 vote in the Senate on May 18, with Democrats lining up against her. From 2011 until her confirmation, she was a lawyer for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce business lobbying groups legal arm, which played a major role in marshaling legal opposition to environmental and labor regulations championed by Democratic former President Barack Obama. Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Senate Intelligence Committee member, said she was increasingly concerned Trump would try to fire not only Mueller, but also Rosenstein. The message the president is sending through his tweets is that he believes the rule of law doesnt apply to him and that anyone who thinks otherwise will be fired, Feinstein said. A Trump confidant said this week the president had considered firing Mueller. Rosenstein, who would be responsible for actually dismissing Mueller, told U.S. lawmakers he would fire him only with good cause. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in January that Russia interfered in the presidential race to try to help Trump win, in part by hacking and releasing emails damaging to his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. Moscow has denied any interference. The White House denies any collusion.

Peirce, a Republican, is a former Senate Banking Committee staff member and currently is the director of the Financial Markets Working Group at George Mason Universitys Mercatus Center. She was nominated to the SEC last year by President Barack Obama, but the full Senate never acted on her nomination. Reuters could not immediately confirm the report. The SEC declined to comment, while Peirce and the White House were not immediately available to comment.  Rumors began flying soon after Trumps election win in November that he would put Peirces name forward again for one of the two SEC commissioner posts that have sat vacant for more than a year. If Trump follows tradition, he will suggest a Democrat for the other open slot at the top U.S. securities regulator. Obama had Lisa Fairfax, a George Washington University law professor, as the Democrat last year, but Trump is not expected to tap her. Peirce is no stranger to the SEC. She currently sits on its investor advisory committee and was previously an SEC staff attorney and counsel to former Commissioner Paul Atkins. Peirce could be instrumental in carrying out Trumps work on reforming the regulations coming out of the 2007-09 financial crisis and recession. When she worked on the Senate Banking Committee, Peirce focused on how regulators implemented the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law and helped provide oversight of the SEC. Recently, she edited and contributed to a book published by the right-leaning Mercatus Center that called for totally restructuring the countrys financial regulation.  Last year Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee attempted to block both Peirce and Fairfaxs nominations when neither nominee fully committed to work as commissioners on requiring corporations to publicly disclose their political donations. After finally winning the committee blessing, the two nominations stalled in the Senate as Republicans dragged their feet on approving names put forward by Obama, a Democrat. Peirce could face a rocky time again in the chamber.

President Donald Trump did not attend but in a video address shown on the stadiums giant screen praised the friendly nature of the annual charity event.

For the game, which began in 1909, members of the Senate and House of Representatives donned uniforms representing teams from their constituencies, and many topped them with hats from Louisiana State University, Scalises alma mater, as a tribute. In addition to Scalise, a police officer, a congressional aide and a lobbyist were shot on Wednesday morning when a man opened fire as the Republican lawmakers practiced for the game in the Washington suburb of Alexandria, Virginia.  Nearly 25,000 tickets were sold for the game and it was on track to raise more than $1 million, roughly double what it did last year, organizers said. Ticket sales picked up after Wednesdays shooting, eventually setting an attendance record, the organizers said, as attendees such as Alexander Hilten, 16, of Arlington, Virginia, decided to come to the game for the first time. A lot of times in politics we have divisions but it shouldnt come to violence, he said. Its cool that theyre putting it on even after the shooting. It just shows how resilient these politicians are. The Capitol Police Memorial Fund was added to the list of charities that will receive money raised by the game in honor of two members of Scalises security detail who were at the Wednesday practice session and returned fire. The Washington Nationals Dream Foundation, the Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Washington and the Washington Literary Center are the games other beneficiaries.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The most worrying thing about James Hodgkinson, experts on violent extremism say, is how unremarkable the 66-year-old home inspector from Illinois seemed until he opened fire on Republican lawmakers as they played baseball.  Violent clashes between left-wing and right-wing groups at rallies and protests around the country have increased since the election of President Donald Trump in November.  Experts say detecting and heading off anti-government attacks from people driven by political ideology is increasingly difficult because of the abundance of partisan rancor, particularly on social media.  Hodgkinson wrote a series of strident messages against Trump and other Republicans on his Facebook account. But so have many other Americans as politics have become more polarized in recent years, particularly since the divisive 2016 presidential election campaign. None of Hodgkinsons posts suggested he would end up opening fire at a baseball field outside Washington on Wednesday morning. He wounded a top Republican lawmaker, a Congressional aide, a lobbyist, and a Capitol police officer before being shot himself. He later died from his wounds. In one Facebook post, Hodgkinson wrote: Trump is a Traitor. Trump Has Destroyed Our Democracy. Its Time to Destroy Trump & Co. However, there is no evidence so far that he was linked to any radical or violent groups. Like millions of other Americans, he supported Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who sought the Democratic presidential nomination and condemns violence. Steve Bongardt, who worked until 2015 as an FBI special agent focusing on threat detection, said traditional counter-terrorism tools such as behavioral profiling and surveillance are less effective because so many otherwise harmless people  post virulent messages on social media.  The problem isnt that behavioral profiles dont work. The problem is the utility of them, because they give us so many false positives, said Bongardt, who now heads The Gyges Group, a security firm. Mark Pitcavage, a senior research fellow in the Anti-Defamation Leagues Center on Extremism, said the intensity of  emotions on both sides of the political divide could be dangerous. When you have people with basically mainstream opinions so worked up that theyre willing to commit acts of actual violence, it illustrates in a very stark way how divided our country is right now, Pitcavage said. A spokesman for the Justice Department said the department is considering a possible statute to target ideologically motivated crimes of violence from radical groups or individuals inside the country. Jerry Boykin, executive vice president of the conservative Family Research Council, which a gunman attacked in 2012 over its opposition to same-sex marriage, said Wednesdays shooting showed that both sides need to tone down their rhetoric. This is an opportunity for a fresh start for everybody in a position of leadership, all the way up to the president, Boykin said. Most political violence in the United States still comes from right-wing groups, according to Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino.  However, the United States also has a history of violence from left-wing groups such as the Weather Underground, which was active in the 1970s. It then eased substantially over the past three decades but has risen again in recent years with violence at protests against globalization, police brutality and the Trump administration, Levin said. Left-wing extremists might be the junior varsity, but theyre now on the radar screen, he said. It is too early to say if Hodgkinsons attack was part of a post-election trend of left-wing violence, said J.J. MacNab, a fellow specializing in anti-government extremism at George Washington Universitys Center for Cyber and Homeland Security. We are a cycle-of-violence country. It looks like we may be going into a left-wing phase now, but Im not sure the violent right-wing is ready to shut up yet, MacNab said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Friday will announce a plan to tighten rules on Americans traveling to Cuba and significantly restrict U.S. companies from doing business with Cuban enterprises controlled by the military, senior White House officials said on Thursday. Trump will lay out his new Cuba policy in a speech in Miami that will roll back parts of former President Barack Obamas opening to the communist-ruled island after a 2014 diplomatic breakthrough between the two former Cold War foes. Taking a tougher approach against Havana after promising to do so during the presidential campaign, Trump will outline stricter enforcement of an existing ban on Americans going to Cuba as tourists and will seek to prevent U.S. dollars from being used to fund what the new U.S. administration sees as a repressive military-dominated government. The new policy will ban most U.S. business deals with the Armed Forces Business Enterprises Group (GAESA), a sprawling conglomerate involved in all sectors of the economy, but make exceptions related to air and sea travel, the officials said. This will essentially shield U.S. airlines and cruise lines now serving the island. But even as he curbs Obamas dtente with Cuba, Trump will stop short of closing embassies or breaking off diplomatic relations restored in 2015 after more than five decades of hostility, U.S. officials said. He will also leave in place some other tangible measures implemented by his Democratic predecessor, including the resumption of direct U.S.-Cuba commercial flights, though Trumps more restrictive policy seems certain to dampen new economic ties overall. And, according to one White House official, the administration does not intend to disrupt existing business deals such as one struck under Obama by Starwood Hotels, which is owned by Marriott International Inc, to manage a historic Havana hotel. There are also no plans to reinstate the limits that Obama lifted on the amount of the islands coveted rum and cigars that American can bring home for personal use, one White House official said. As a result, the changes  though far-reaching  appear to be less sweeping than many pro-engagement advocates had feared. Trump will justify his partial reversal of Obamas measures to a large extent on human rights grounds. His aides contend that Obamas easing of U.S. restrictions has done nothing to advance political freedoms in Cuba, while benefiting the Cuban government financially. Saying that the aim was to repair what Trump has called a bad deal struck by Obama with Havana, one U.S. official said the new administration would leave the door open to improved relations if Cuba undertakes democratic reforms such as allowing free and fair elections and the release of political prisoners. International human rights groups say, however, that reinstating a U.S. policy of isolating the island could make the situation worse by empowering Cuban hardliners. The Cuban government has made clear it will not be pressured into political reforms in exchange for diplomatic engagement. At home, Trumps critics have questioned why his administration is now singling out Cuba for its human rights record while insisting that in other parts of the world it will not lecture other countries on the issue. Trump will issue a presidential memorandum when he delivers his speech at the Manuel Artime Theater in Miamis Little Havana district, the heart of Americas Cuban-American and Cuban exile community. The venue is named after a leader of the failed U.S.-backed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961 against Fidel Castros revolutionary government. Republican Senator Marco Rubio, who was played a key role in pushing for Trumps changes, was expected to attend along with U.S. Representative Mario Diaz-Balart and other Cuban-American lawmakers. Under Trumps order, the Treasury and Commerce Departments will be given 30 days to begin writing new regulations and they will not take effect until they are complete. Under the revised travel policy, U.S. officials say there will be tighter enforcement to make sure Americans legally fit the 12 authorized categories they claim to be traveling under, which could spook many visitors, wary of receiving a hefty fine. While tourism to Cuba is banned by U.S. law, the Obama administration had been allowing people to travel to Cuba as part of people to people educational trips for visitors, a classification that a White House official said was ripe for abuse by those looking for beach vacations. Trumps new policy will eliminate such visits by individuals while still allowing them to be done as group tours, and also retaining individual travel under other authorized categories such as religious, artistic and journalistic activities, the official said. But Trumps planned rollback of Obamas policy has drawn opposition from American businesses and the travel industry, which have begun making inroads on the island, as well as many lawmakers, including some of Trumps fellow Republicans. The new policy has come together after contentious meetings within the administration. Some aides have argued that Trump, a former real estate magnate who won the presidency promising to unleash U.S. business and create jobs, would have a hard time defending any moves that close off the Cuban market. But other advisers have contended that it is important to make good on a promise to Cuban-Americans whose support they considered significant in winning Florida in the 2016 election. Miami is home to the largest Cuban-American community. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence has hired a lawyer known for defending government officials in high-profile investigations to help him with probes into whether there were ties between the election campaign of U.S. President Donald Trump and Russia, his office said on Thursday. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Moscow interfered in last years presidential campaign to try to tilt the vote in Trumps favor. Trump, who hired his own lawyer last month for probes by a special counsel and congressional committees, lashed out on Thursday after a report that he was under investigation for possible obstruction of justice. He dismissed as phony the idea that his campaign colluded with any Russian effort to sway the 2016 election. Moscow denies meddling in the campaign. Pence hired Richard Cullen, chairman of law firm McGuireWoods, to help him respond to inquiries from special counsel Robert Mueller, a spokesman said. Cullen is a former federal prosecutor who has long ties to former FBI Director James Comey, whom Trump fired on May 9. He represents former FIFA President Sepp Blatter in the corruption probe into world soccers governing body. U.S. prosecutors have not accused Blatter of wrongdoing. Cullen, who supported Trumps rival Jeb Bush during the race for the Republican presidential nomination, also represented Tom DeLay, a Texas Republican and former majority leader of the U.S. House of Representatives, during the investigation into corrupt Washington lobbyist Jack Abramoff. DeLay was not charged. Pence had been looking at hiring his own counsel for several weeks, and made his decision earlier this week after interviewing several candidates, his office said. The vice president is focused entirely on his duties and promoting the presidents agenda and looks forward to a swift conclusion of this matter, Pence spokesman, Jarrod Agen, said in a statement. Pence has seldom addressed the Russia issue, which has overshadowed Trumps efforts to overhaul the healthcare system, cut taxes and boost jobs - priorities that Pence has worked on intensively with Republican lawmakers. The Washington Post first reported the Cullen hire. Just before the story broke, Trump wrote a pair of angry tweets, suggesting that Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent in the election, should be under investigation instead of him. Earlier on Thursday, Trump called the probe a witch hunt on Twitter. They made up a phony collusion with the Russians story, found zero proof, so now they go for obstruction of justice on the phony story. Nice, Trump wrote. Mueller is investigating whether anyone on Trumps campaign, or associated with it, with him or any of his businesses, may have had any illegal dealings with Russian officials or others with ties to the Kremlin, said one U.S. official familiar with the rough outlines of the probe and who spoke on condition of anonymity. That includes the finances and business dealings of Jared Kushner, who is married to Trumps daughter Ivanka, and is a senior adviser at the White House, the Washington Post reported on Thursday, citing unnamed officials familiar with the matter. Mueller is also looking at a second line of inquiry: whether, if any potential offenses were committed, Trump or others attempted to cover them up or obstruct the investigation into them, the source said. An examination of possible obstruction of justice charges was unavoidable given testimony by Comey, although the issue may not become the main focus of the probe, the source said. Comey told a Senate panel last week he believed Trump fired him to undermine the FBIs Russia probe. He also told the Senate Intelligence Committee in his June 8 testimony that he believed Trump had directed him to drop a related agency investigation into the presidents former national security adviser, Michael Flynn. White House officials, including Pence, initially gave differing reasons for Comeys dismissal, including that he had lost the confidence of the FBI. Pence said on Twitter on May 10 that Trump had made the right decision at the right time to remove Comey as the head of the FBI and praised him for showing strong & decisive leadership to restore trust & confidence of the American people in the FBI. Trump later contradicted his own staff, saying on May 11 he had the Russia issue in mind when he fired Comey. Examining the possibility of obstruction charges will allow investigators to interview key administration figures including Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and possibly Trump himself, said the source familiar with the Mueller investigation. While a sitting president is unlikely to face criminal prosecution, obstruction of justice could form the basis for impeachment. Any such step would face a steep hurdle as it would require approval by the U.S. House of Representatives, which is controlled by Trumps fellow Republicans.

The talks in Washington will involve U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis as well as  Chinas top diplomat, State Councilor Yang Jiechi, and General Fang Fenghui, chief of state of the Peoples Liberation Army, the U.S. State Department said. It will be the inaugural session of the U.S.-China  Diplomatic and Security Dialogue, a framework launched by President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping during a summit in Florida in April. The State Department said the aim was to expand areas of cooperation while narrowing differences on key diplomatic and security issues. U.S.-China ties have warmed since the April summit, in spite of continued U.S. concerns about Chinas pursuit of territory in the South China Sea and a large trade imbalance.      Tillerson has said North Korea will top the agenda next week and made clear that Washington wanted more help from China in pressing Pyongyang to abandon its weapons programs, calling Chinese efforts so far notable but uneven. The focus on North Korea has been sharpened by dozens of North Korean missile launches and two nuclear bomb tests since the beginning of last year.  North Korea says it is working to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the United States, and this week Mattis called it the most urgent threat to U.S. national security. China is party to U.N. economic sanctions on North Korea.  But it remains the countrys main ally and trading partner and has been reluctant to impose the sort of punishing measures experts say are needed to get Pyongyang to abandon its weapons programs. In Beijing, asked about the talks, Chinas foreign ministry spokesman, Lu Kang, said, The two sides are in close communication about the schedule, but the issues discussed will be those that both countries are concerned about and that involve China-U.S. relations. He did not elaborate. On Tuesday, Tillerson said Washington was considering imposing secondary sanctions on foreign firms doing business with North Korea and had been in discussions with Beijing about the activities of entities inside China. A Washington think tank said this week that North Koreas effort to circumvent sanctions was complex but could be defeated by targeting relatively few Chinese firms. The U.N. Security Council expanded targeted sanctions against North Korea this month in the first such resolution agreed by the United States and China since Trump took office. Washington has been pushing for even tougher steps, including an oil embargo, bans of North Koreas airline and overseas workers and interception of its cargo ships.

The program, which was announced by President Barack Obama in 2014, never took effect because it was blocked in federal court.  Obama had hoped that overhauling the U.S. immigration system and resolving the fate of the estimated 11 million people in the country illegally would be part of his presidential legacy.    However, President Donald Trump has vowed to crack down on illegal immigration. The plan unveiled by Obama intended to let roughly 4 million people - those who have lived illegally in the United States at least since 2010, have no criminal record and have children who are U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents - get into a program that shields them from deportation and supplies work permits. However, it was quickly challenged in court by Republican-governed Texas and 25 other states that argued Obama had overstepped the powers granted to him by the U.S. Constitution by infringing upon the authority of Congress.  A federal appeals court blocked the program, and the U.S. Supreme Court let that ruling stand in a 4-4 split decision last year. Kelly said in a statement on Thursday he was rescinding the initiative, known as DAPA, because there is no credible path forward to litigate the currently enjoined policy. An earlier program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), offers some 750,000 immigrants brought to the country illegally as children the chance to attend school and to work.  Trump has previously said his administration was devising a policy on how to deal with individuals covered by DACA, but no formal changes have been announced.

Trump on Thursday reiterated his call for unity in the aftermath of the shooting in the Washington suburb of Alexandria, Virginia. But Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in the House of Representatives, criticized some Republicans who have blamed the shooting on vitriol from the political left. Scalise, a congressman from Louisiana who is the No. 3 House Republican, suffered injuries to internal organs, broken bones and severe bleeding after being shot in the left hip on a baseball field where he and other lawmakers were practicing for a charity baseball game. Scalise underwent a second surgery for internal injuries and a broken leg - his third procedure overall - and remained in critical condition but had shown improvement, MedStar Washington Hospital Center said in a statement on Thursday. Scalise, 51, and three others were wounded when a man identified as James Hodgkinson, 66, from the St. Louis suburb of Belleville, Illinois, opened fire on the lawmakers. The others wounded were a police officer, a congressional aide and a lobbyist. Hodgkinson, who had a history of posting angry messages against Trump and other Republicans on social media, died after being wounded by police. The U.S. Capitol Police said Hodgkinson used a 9 mm handgun and a 7.62-caliber rifle in the shooting, and traces run by investigators showed he evidently acquired the weapons legally. Both were purchased by the shooter from federal firearms licensees, the Capitol Police said in a statement. We currently have no evidence to suggest that the purchases were not lawful. The FBI recovered a cellphone, computer and camera from Hodgkinsons van and was examining them for evidence, the statement said. Trump, who visited Scalise at the hospital on Wednesday, said the congressman was in some trouble but hes going to be okay, we hope.  Its been much more difficult than people even thought at the time, Trump told reporters at the White House on Thursday, adding he also visited the wounded Capitol Police officer at the hospital. Vice President Mike Pence earlier on Thursday said he visited the hospital where Scalise was being treated. Republican members of Congress played their Democratic colleagues in a charity game on Thursday night at Nationals Park, home of the Washington Nationals Major League Baseball team, with thousands of spectators attending. The lawmakers took the field with many wearing hats to honor Scalise. When the members of the Republican team were announced, mention of Scalises name drew a standing ovation throughout the stadium. The shooting has raised questions about lawmakers security, renewed the nations contentious debate over guns and drawn new attention to the harsh rhetoric that reflects Americas political polarization. Trump, in a video message played at the game, said the event had a much deeper level of meaning because of the shooting. In Washington we have our disagreements, but we all agree that we are here to serve this nation we love and the people who call it home, Trump said. Thats the source of unity and more than ever we must embrace it. Many lawmakers in both parties called for unity after the shooting. But at a news conference, Pelosi bristled at comments made by a few Republicans and conservative activists who blamed heated Democratic rhetoric for the incident. The comments made by my Republican colleagues are outrageous, beneath the dignity of the job that they hold, beneath the dignity of the respect that we would like Congress to command. How dare they say such a thing, Pelosi said. She said Republican vitriol and caricatures of her had resulted in calls to my home constantly, threats in front of my family, really predicated on their comments and their paid ads. Pelosi also cited past remarks by Trump, saying: You have a president who says: I could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and nobody would care. She did not specify which comments by Republicans she objected to. Among others, Republican Representative Steve King wrote on Twitter that violence is incited by the leading cultural voices of the Left and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich cited an increasing hostility on the left.

The Republican governor said he approved the measure even though the legislature missed an opportunity to substantially improve the K-12 funding system. The Republican-controlled legislature faced a June 30 deadline set by the Kansas Supreme Court in March to come up with enough funding to meet the state constitutions requirement for adequacy. Alan Rupe, an attorney for school districts that filed a funding lawsuit, said the additional $293 million lawmakers allocated to schools over the next two fiscal years falls far short of what is needed.

Now that the bill has become law, Rupe said he expects the supreme court to set up a process for the state to demonstrate how the measure complies with the constitutional requirement.

At least 69 people have died in the unrest in Venezuela since early April, with hundreds injured. Opposition has been fanned by Maduros plan for July 30 elections for a special assembly to rewrite the constitution, which critics say are stacked in his favor.

A week ago, President Donald Trumps administration and 14 Republican U.S. senators said they wanted the spying authority to be renewed without any changes before it expires at the end of the year. Amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act adopted by Congress in 2008, including a controversial part known as Section 702, broadened the U.S. governments legal authority to conduct surveillance of phone calls, emails and other communications belonging to foreigners who live overseas. U.S. intelligence agencies and U.S. allies consider the law vital to national security, but privacy advocates have criticized Section 702 for allowing the incidental collection of data belonging to an unknown number of Americans without a search warrant. Government surveillance activities under the FISA Amendments Act have violated Americans constitutionally protected rights, the group of about three dozen lawmakers, known as the House Freedom Caucus, said in a statement. We oppose any reauthorization of the FISA Amendments Act that does not include substantial reforms to the governments collection and use of Americans data. The caucus in the U.S. House of Representatives has already had success in challenging the Trump White House and the Republican congressional leadership on other policy issues. It opposed legislation to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system on grounds that it did not do enough to repeal former President Barack Obamas healthcare law, earning concessions on a bill that passed the House in May. The intraparty dissent among Republicans in Congress over Section 702 resembles a debate that took place two years ago, when lawmakers disagreed sharply over whether to curtail a National Security Agency program that collected U.S. call metadata in bulk - a practice exposed publicly by former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden. The dispute led to the brief expiration of the USA Patriot Act before lawmakers passed a law effectively terminating the bulk collection practice. The extent of Section 702 spying was also revealed in disclosures by Snowden, prompting outrage internationally and embarrassing some U.S. technology firms. On Wednesday, a declassified court document, made public in response to lawsuits filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and Electronic Frontier Foundation, revealed that an unidentified U.S. technology company objected in 2014 to participating in a Section 702 program, but was ordered by a judge on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to comply.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate voted nearly unanimously on Thursday for legislation to impose new sanctions on Russia and force President Donald Trump to get Congress approval before easing any existing sanctions on Russia. In a move that could complicate U.S. President Donald Trumps desire for warmer relations with Moscow, the Senate backed the measure by 98-2. Republican Senator Rand Paul and Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, were the only two no votes. The measure is intended to punish Russia for meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, its annexation of Ukraines Crimea region and support for Syrias government in the six-year-long civil war. If passed in the House of Representatives and signed into law by Trump, it would put into law sanctions previously established via former President Barack Obamas executive orders, including some on Russian energy projects. The legislation also allows new sanctions on Russian mining, metals, shipping and railways and targets Russians guilty of conducting cyber attacks or supplying weapons to Syrias government. The legislation sends a very, very strong signal to Russia, the nefarious activities theyve been involved in, Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said as lawmakers debated the measure. If the measure became law, it could complicate relations with some countries in Europe. Germany and Austria said the new punitive measures could expose European companies involved in projects in Russia to fines. The legislation sets up a review process that would require Trump to get Congress approval before taking any action to ease, suspend or lift any sanctions on Russia. Trump was especially effusive about Russian president Vladimir Putin during the 2016 U.S. election campaign, though his openness to closer ties to Moscow has tempered somewhat, with his administration on the defensive over investigations into Russian meddling in the election. Putin dismissed the proposed sanctions, saying they reflected an internal political struggle in the United States, and that Washingtons policy of imposing sanctions on Moscow had always been to try to contain Russia. The bill also includes new sanctions on Iran over its ballistic missile program and other activities not related to the international nuclear agreement reached with the United States and other world powers. To become law, the legislation must pass the House of Representatives and be signed by Trump. House aides said they expected the chamber would begin to debate the measure in coming weeks.  However, they could not predict if it would come up for a final vote before lawmakers leave Washington at the end of July for their summer recess. Senior aides told Reuters they expected some sanctions package would eventually pass, but they expected the measure would be changed in the House. The Trump administration has pushed back against the bill, and his fellow Republicans hold a commanding 238- to 193-seat majority in the chamber. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson questioned the legislation on Wednesday, urging Congress to ensure that any sanctions package allows the president to have the flexibility to adjust sanctions to meet the needs of what is always an evolving diplomatic situation. Previously, U.S. energy sanctions had only targeted Russias future high-tech energy projects, such as drilling for oil in the Arctic, fracking and offshore drilling. They blocked U.S. companies such as Exxon Mobil, where Tillerson was chairman, from investing in such projects. The new bill would slap sanctions on companies in other countries looking to invest in those projects in the absence of U.S. companies, a practice known as backfilling. Also included for the first time are discretionary measures the Trump administration could impose on investments by companies in Western countries on Russia energy export pipelines to Europe. The Senate also voted overwhelmingly on Thursday to add provisions to the bill allowing the U.S. space agency NASA to continue using Russian-made rocket engines and the 100 senators voted unanimously for an amendment reaffirming the U.S. commitment to the NATO alliance.

Republican Governor Greg Abbott signed House Bill 3859 which allows faith-based groups working with the Texas child welfare system to deny services under circumstances that conflict with the providers sincerely held religious beliefs. It was supported by several Christian groups. The bills sponsor, Republican Representative James Frank, said on social media,HB 3859 bans no one and has a mechanism for the state to offer alternative providers to anyone denied the right to be adoptive or foster parents because of the providers religious beliefs.  He said the legislation would help troubled children find homes.  Abbotts office was not immediately available for comment. Democrats and civil rights groups said the bill could allow private, faith-based agencies to block parents who practice a different religion or who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender.  LGBT rights groups have said they would challenge the adoption bill in court, arguing discrimination in the name of religion had no place in the state. This lawsclear intent is to allowservice providers that receive statetax dollars to misuse religion as a license to discriminate against LGBT families and children in the states child-welfare system, said Kathy Miller, president of the Texas Freedom Network, a civil rights group. Texas next month holds a special 30-day session of the Republican-controlled legislature with one item on the agenda, a bill that would limit access to public bathrooms for transgender people.

The draft legislation, while far from becoming law, still represents a victory for General Motors Co, Alphabet Inc, Tesla Inc and other automakers and technology companies seeking to persuade Congress and the Trump administration to pre-empt rules under consideration in California, New York and other states that could limit deployment of self-driving vehicles. The industry also opposed an Obama administration proposal last year that raised the possibility of giving regulators the power to review and approve self-driving car technology before it was put into service, similar to the vetting by Federal Aviation Administration of new technology for aircraft. The 45-page draft package of 14 bills would designate the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration as the lead agency for regulating self-driving cars, pre-empting state rules.  States could still set insurance and registration rules but could not use them as a way to regulate self-driving technologies. California has proposed changes to its self-driving car rules, but automakers said in April it has not gone far enough. One of the bills in the proposal would allow the U.S. Transportation Department to exempt up to 100,000 vehicles per year from U.S. federal motor vehicle safety rules, which currently prevent the sale of self-driving vehicles without steering wheels, pedals and other human controls. Another would declare crash data, other testing and validation reports from automated cars turned over to U.S. regulators to be confidential business information. U.S. Representative Bob Latta, who chairs a key panel overseeing automobile regulation, called the draft legislation an important step in establishing a framework to allow innovators to safely develop and test autonomous vehicles. He said Republicans want to continue working with all parties in a bipartisan manner as we refine language and move toward a consensus package. On Tuesday, a bipartisan trio of U.S. senators said they planned to introduce legislation to remove regulatory roadblocks to the introduction of self-driving cars. Mitch Bainwol, head of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, an auto trade group, told Congress on Wednesday it should work to eliminate state or local laws that could unduly burden or restrict the use of self-driving vehicles in the future.

Richard Cordray, the bureaus director, wrote to correct the record in a letter sent to a congressional panel on Wednesday regarding a recent report critical of the CFPBs work in a high-profile scandal. The five-page letter took issue with multiple conclusions reached in a report released earlier this month by Republican staff on the House Financial Services Committee. Some members of the committee have pushed for Republican President Donald Trump to fire Cordray, who has headed the agency since he was appointed by Obama, a Democrat, in 2012. The report said the CFPB had been an ineffective watchdog against Wells Fargo & Co, missing extensive improper sales practices and taking action only after work on the banks unauthorized accounts scandal had been done by others.  The committees report also depicted the CFPB as reluctant to cooperate with the panels Well Fargo probe. Cordray insisted that his agency had done critical work in policing Wells Fargo, and said the report devolves into various misstatements and allegations about the CFPBs work. The CFPB, along with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the city and county of Los Angeles, struck a $185 million settlement against the bank in September. Cordray argued that improper sales practices were underway at Wells Fargo as far back as 2001, while his agency was only fully staffed in 2014. He maintained the CFPB had acted properly in monitoring the bank, and the CFPBs presence allowed the federal government to provide relief to wronged consumers across the country as part of the settlement. He went on to accuse Republican staff of refusing to receive a September briefing from his staff on Wells Fargo, instead demanding he personally brief them with one days notice, which he was unable to do. He said he also offered to publicly testify at a committee hearing devoted to Wells Fargo, but did not receive an invitation. A committee spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Cordray is one of a handful of remaining regulatory heads that were appointed by Obama.

The offer, made with Putins trademark sardonic humor, came as the Russian president poured scorn on Comey for his role in a row in Washington over alleged Russian meddling in last years U.S. presidential election. At a congressional hearing this month, Comey said Trump asked him to drop an investigation into contacts between Trump associates and Russian officials, while the U.S. president has accused Comey of not telling the truth. Asked about Comey at a question-and-answer session with Russian voters, Putin said it was strange that, while still FBI director, Comey had passed the contents of a conversation he had with Trump to the media via a friend. What is the difference then between the FBI director and Mr. Snowden? Putin said, referring to former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, who was granted asylum in Russia in 2013 after leaking classified information about U.S. spy operations. In this case, he (Comey) is not the head of a special service but a human rights activist who defends a certain position, Putin said. By the way, if he is subject to any sort of persecution in connection with this, we will be ready to give him political asylum in Russia. And he should know about this. Striking a more serious note, Putin said Comey, in his congressional testimony, had produced no proof that Russia had meddled in the U.S. election. I am not familiar in detail with the testimony given by former FBI director Comey, Putin said. Again, he gave no evidence of this (Russian interference). And what about constant U.S. propaganda, constant U.S. support of America-oriented non-governmental organizations by giving them money directly? Isnt it an impact on our minds? Isnt it an attempt to influence how we should behave during election campaigns? This continues year after year, he said. Putin said many heads of state around the world had told him of similar U.S. meddling in their internal affairs. But they would not voice their concerns openly, fearing they would spoil relations with Washington, he said.  As for Russia, we have an opinion of our own, we express it openly.

The Trump administration has urged Congress to increase the debt limit before it heads out for its August recess, but Mulvaney said officials had not decided what form the legislation should take. There are various thoughts about how to get something passed, but I dont think weve settled on how to move forward yet, Mulvaney told reporters at a briefing. Will it be a clean debt ceiling vote? Will it be a debt ceiling vote with some type of reforms attached to it? I dont think weve settled on that.  The U.S. government has a legal limit on how much it can borrow, currently set at about $19.8 trillion. The limit can be increased only by a vote of Congress. The White House has sent mixed signals on how the debt limit should be handled by lawmakers.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin asked lawmakers to pass a bill without any measures attached to it. However, Mulvaney, a conservative Republican, was known to favor using the debt limit as leverage to get spending cuts during his time in Congress, before he was tapped to be budget director.      He downplayed any disagreements within the administration, saying it was not unusual for a Treasury secretary and a budget director to have different views on the debt limit.  It is not a source of division right now in the White House, nor is it a source of division in the party, he said. But on Capitol Hill, the House Freedom Caucus, an influential group of about three dozen conservative Republican lawmakers to which Mulvaney once belonged, has called for any increase in the debt ceiling to be linked to reforms that cut unnecessary spending and work toward balancing the U.S. budget. Freedom Caucus leader Mark Meadows said on Thursday he favored such a conditional raising of the debt ceiling by about $1.5 trillion, which he believes may be somewhat less than what the Trump administration wants. Theres a number of us who are talking about a $1.5 trillion range, as long as there are some structural reforms, some other things that could go along with that, Meadows said in the House Speakers Lobby. Republicans control the White House and both chambers of Congress. Generally, conservative Republicans have attempted to use the debt limit to push fiscal reform, while Democrats and moderate Republicans have opposed such ultimatums. Lower tax revenues this year have forced the U.S. Treasury to borrow more money to cover the federal budget deficit, which may lead to the government hitting its legal debt limit sooner than expected, experts say. Mnuchin said Monday that the government would be able to pay its bills at least through early September. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

But there is no sign in the Democratic-led legislature that a breakthrough in the 23-month impasse could be imminent. Rauner warned on Thursday that the inability to pass a budget could bring devastating and long-lasting ramifications for the nations fifth-largest state. Those include possible junk credit ratings, a halt to state-funded road projects, and suspension from national lotteries. Illinois is limping toward the June 30 end of an unprecedented second-straight fiscal year without a complete spending plan due to an impasse between Rauner and Democratic leaders.  Rauner said he would sign into law a bill package unveiled by Republican legislators on Wednesday that includes a $36 billion budget, a school funding revamp, and several measures he has sought such as a local property tax freeze, term limits for top state officials and cost-saving changes to the system that compensates injured workers. The bills require three-fifths majority votes for passage instead of a simple majority. It is a true compromise  and one I hope the majority in the General Assembly will accept, the governor said in a Facebook video posted on Thursday. Rauner and Democrats continued to blame each other for the budget crisis. House Democrats will continue our work on the budget from Springfield, but as Governor Rauner has met each of our attempts to date with refusal, its clear that the onus is on the governor to show that he is finally serious about working in good faith to end the crisis he has manufactured, House Speaker Michael Madigan said in a statement. If Illinois still lacks a budget when the new fiscal year dawns, the consequences could be big. The states credit ratings could sink to junk, a first for any U.S. state, leaving some investors unable to buy the states debt and others to demand even fatter yields. The state will be suspended from participating in the Powerball and Mega Millions lotteries due to the lack of fiscal 2018 appropriations to pay winning ticket holders, Illinois Lottery spokesman Jason Schaumburg said. The games have generated about $240 million in sales in Illinois so far in fiscal 2017. With no money to pay road contractors, Illinois transportation department is shutting down about 700 ongoing projects that carry a price tag of $2.3 billion, according to department spokeswoman Gianna Urgo. The budget impasse has ballooned Illinois pile of unpaid bills to $15 billion as of Wednesday, fueling litigation by unpaid vendors and others.

The president and first lady Melania Trump were present in the marble-clad courthouse for an investiture ceremony formally welcoming Gorsuch to the top U.S. court. Gorsuch was confirmed by the Senate and sworn in as a justice in April and authored his first ruling last week in a debt-collection case. Trump sat near the front of the ornate, burgundy-draped courtroom as Chief Justice John Roberts offered him and the first lady a warm welcome in opening remarks. The president sat quietly as Roberts administered the judicial oath to Gorsuch and joined the crowd in applauding Gorsuch, smiling broadly.  In appointing Gorsuch, Trump restored the courts 5-4 conservative majority. Trump did not speak at the event. Other notable figures at the ceremony included several members of the Senate Judiciary Committee and attorneys general during George W. Bushs presidency, including John Ashcroft and Alberto Gonzales. Also attending was Kenneth Starr, the former independent counsel who investigated Bill Clinton during his presidency. A special counsel examining whether Trumps presidential campaign team colluded with Russia in the 2016 election is now investigating Trump for possible obstruction of justice. Trumps travel ban is now before the justices after being blocked by lower courts. In deciding whether to allow the travel ban to go into effect, the justices are set to weigh whether Trumps election campaign rhetoric can be used as evidence that the March 6 order was intended to discriminate against Muslims in violation of the Constitution. Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign called for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. The court is currently considering an emergency request from Trumps administration seeking to put the travel ban into effect while litigation continues. Federal judges in Maryland and Hawaii blocked Trumps 90-day ban on travelers from Libya, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The Hawaii judge also blocked a 120-day ban on refugees entering the United States. The injunctions blocking the ban were upheld on appeal. Trump was able to make the appointment of Gorsuch only because the Republican-led Senate last year refused to consider former President Barack Obamas nominee to the court, Merrick Garland.

(Reuters) - Congressman Steve Scalise, the No. 3 Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives, was in critical condition on Wednesday night after he and three others were shot as they practiced for a charity baseball game. The gunman, who had posted angry messages against President Donald Trump and other Republicans on social media, opened fire on a group of Republican lawmakers and colleagues at a baseball field in Alexandria, Virginia, outside Washington. He was wounded in a gunfight with Capitol Hill police at the scene and later died. Scalise was shot in the left hip, suffering broken bones, injuries to internal organs and severe bleeding.  He underwent surgery but would need further operations, the MedStar Washington Hospital Center said. Rep. Steve Scalise, one of the truly great people, is in very tough shape - but he is a real fighter. Pray for Steve! Trump said on Twitter after visiting the hospital on Wednesday night. The gunman, identified by police as 66-year-old James Hodgkinson from the St. Louis suburb of Belleville, Illinois,  fired repeatedly at the men playing on the baseball field on Wednesday morning.  Congressmen at the ballpark described hearing loud noises like the sound of firecrackers and 15 to 20 people lying on the ground and realizing they had only baseball bats to defend themselves against bullets. When he started shooting, he was shooting to kill people. And thank God he wasnt a very good shot, said Representative Joe Barton, the Republican teams manager. Also wounded were a congressional aide and one former aide who now works as a lobbyist, officials said. One Capitol Hill police officer suffered a gunshot wound and another officer twisted an ankle and was released from a hospital, police said. It was not only chaotic but it was a combat situation, Alexandria Police Chief Mike Brown told reporters. While police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it was too early to determine whether it was a deliberate political attack, the shooting intensified concerns about the sharp divide and bitter rhetoric in U.S. politics. FBI special agent Tim Slater declined to comment on whether the gunman had a vendetta against Republicans. We continue to actively investigate the shooters motives, acquaintances and whereabouts that led to todays incidents,  Slater told reporters. No one else was in custody, he said. The gunman was believed to have been in the Alexandria area since March, Slater said. Investigators believe that the suspect had been living out of his vehicle. Wednesdays shooting revived debate about gun rights in America. Virginias Democratic governor, Terry McAuliffe, urged gun control measures.  Scalise has been a strong opponent of gun control measures. Hodgkinson had raged against Trump on social media and was a member of anti-Republican groups on Facebook including, The Road to Hell Is Paved With Republicans, Terminate The Republican Party, and Donald Trump is not my President, a search of his Facebook profile showed. As businessman Trump rose to become the Republican nominee in the 2016 presidential election, his brash style and outspoken views on immigration and other policies led to mass protests, including on the weekend of his inauguration in January.  The charity ballgame between a Republican team and a Democratic team will go ahead as scheduled on Thursday at Nationals Park, home of the Washington Nationals Major League Baseball team. Representative Tim Ryan, who early on Wednesday was practicing for the ballgame with fellow Democrats, told reporters that Washington politicians needed to cool their rhetoric. Weve got to get back to ... where things arent so personal and were so judgmental of each other. Its got to stop. A member of the U.S. Congress got shot because they didnt like (his) political views, Ryan said. Trump, who announced the gunmans death, called for unity. We are strongest when we are unified and when we work together for the common good, he said. In a show of bipartisanship, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan said on the floor of the House: An attack on one of us is an attack on all of us. The Houses top Democrat, Nancy Pelosi, echoed Ryans message. The shooting happened shortly after 7 a.m. There were 20 House members and two senators present, and the shooting lasted about 10 minutes, said Barton. Two lawmakers who were at the scene, Representatives Ron DeSantis and Jeff Duncan, indicated there might have been a political motive in the attack. Duncan said that as he left the field, the man who would later open fire approached him in the parking lot. He asked me who was practicing this morning, Republicans or Democrats, and I said: Thats the Republicans practicing, Duncan told reporters. DeSantis gave a similar account. Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who sought the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, said he had been told that  Hodgkinson had served as a volunteer with his campaign. Let me be as clear as I can be: Violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society and I condemn this action in the strongest possible terms, Sanders said. Ryan, the House speaker, is reviewing rules on how rank-and-file lawmakers can increase their personal security, according to several lawmakers. Members get threats on a regular basis and have trouble determining which are real, House Democratic whip Steny Hoyer told reporters. The shooting took place at Eugene Simpson Stadium Park in the Del Ray neighborhood of Alexandria, across the Potomac River from Washington.       Representative Mo Brooks told CNN that during batting practice, he heard a bam and then a quick succession of shots and saw the gunman shooting through the holes in a chain link fence. When Scalise was shot, he went down on the infield between first and second base, then dragged himself into the grassy outfield as the incident unfolded, leaving a trail of blood,  Brooks said. Two Capitol police officers who were there to provide security for the lawmakers engaged the gunman with pistols, Brooks said. But for the Capitol police and the heroism they showed, it could very well have been a large-scale massacre. All we would have had would have been baseball bats versus a rifle. Those arent good odds, Brooks said. Wednesdays attack was the first shooting of a member of Congress since January 2011, when Democratic Representative Gabby Giffords was seriously wounded in an assassination attempt at a gathering of constituents in Tucson, Arizona. Six people were killed. Giffords resigned from Congress and became an activist for gun restrictions. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - U.S. intelligence agencies have alleged that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election to benefit President Donald Trump. Law enforcement agencies and congressional committees are investigating Russian meddling and possible collusion with members of Trumps campaign. Here is what is publicly known and not known:   How did the investigations begin? Former President Barack Obama ordered U.S. intelligence agencies to assess whether Russia tried to intervene in the  election after a cyber attack on the Democratic National Committee in July 2016 and the publication of thousands of hacked personal emails from Hillary Clintons campaign manager in the month before the Nov. 8 election. Obama told intelligence officials to deliver a report on possible foreign interference before he left the White House in January 2017. What did the intelligence agencies find?  The Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency concluded in a report declassified in January that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a campaign not just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system but to affect the outcome. The agencies said Putin and the Russian government had a clear preference for Trump to win the White House. Putins  associates hacked information, paid social media trolls and backed efforts by Russian government agencies and state-funded media to sway public opinion, the agencies said.  The report stopped short of assessing whether Russia succeeded in swaying the election result. Putin and other Russian officials have repeatedly denied interfering in the U.S. election. How many U.S. investigations are there into Russian election meddling? Comey told the House Intelligence Committee on March 20 that the FBI was investigating Moscows role in the election, including possible collusion with Trumps campaign. The Justice Department announced on May 17 that it had appointed Robert Mueller, a former FBI director, as special counsel to lead an independent Russia probe. Mueller would, if the evidence merits, work in tandem with the FBI to handle any related criminal prosecutions. In addition, there are multiple committees in the Senate and House of Representatives investigating various aspects of Russian election meddling. What has Trump said about Russias role in the election? He has not taken a clear public position. At a July 2016 news conference, Trump addressed an FBI probe into Clintons use of a private email system when she was secretary of state and emails that had possibly been deleted by saying: I will tell you this, Russia: if youre listening, I hope youre able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. He subsequently dismissed reports, including from U.S. intelligence officials, that Russia had attempted to intervene in the election on his behalf.    The first time Trump said he accepted the findings of the intelligence agencies was at a Jan. 11 news conference ahead of his inauguration. As far as hacking, I think it was Russia, Trump said, although he added: It could have been others also. Trump said in May that China may have hacked the emails of Democratic officials to meddle with the election, offering no evidence and countering the view of intelligence officials. Trump has made clear on multiple occasions he believes the Russia investigations have run their course and should be closed. The Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end? he wrote on Twitter on May 8. On May 30, Trump tweeted: Russian officials must be laughing at the U.S. & how a lame excuse for why the Dems lost the election has taken over the Fake News. Did the FBI probe continue after Comeys dismissal? There is no evidence that the FBI ended or paused its investigation after Comeys departure. Andrew McCabe, who is leading the agency as acting director, promised the Senate Intelligence Committee that Comeys firing would not affect the investigation and that he will notify the committee of any attempt to delay or derail it.  Trump on June 6 chose former U.S. Justice Department official Christopher Wray, who represented New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in the so-called Bridgegate scandal, to be the next FBI director. Wray will need Senate confirmation. Why was Comey fired? The White House cited a May 9 letter to Trump from Attorney General Jeff Sessions that attached a memo from Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, on Restoring Confidence in the FBI that recommended Comeys dismissal. Rosensteins memo said Comey erred in July 2016 by announcing the FBI had been examining Clintons use of a private email server and that the case should be closed without prosecution. Rosensteins view was that Comeys decision to make a public statement broke with longstanding FBI precedent and should have been handled by the then-U.S. attorney general, Loretta Lynch. Trump called Comey a showboat and grandstander in an interview with NBC News on May 11, saying that he would have fired Comey regardless of Rosensteins recommendation. Was Comeys firing related to the FBIs Russia probe? Comey told the Senate Intelligence Committee he believes his dismissal was directly related to the FBIs Russia probe. I know I was fired because of something about the way I was conducting the Russia investigation, was in some way putting pressure on him, in some way irritating him, and he decided to fire me because of that, Comey said in his June 8 testimony. Trump asked Comey to end the agencys investigation of Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser, and also to make some sort of public statement that he was not personally under investigation in order to clear the cloud hanging over his presidency, according Comeys testimony. Comey said he found it concerning that Trump would ask him to drop the agencys probe of Flynn and declined to state publicly that Trump himself was not under investigation, in part because it would create a duty to correct if that changed. I need loyalty, I expect loyalty, Trump told Comey at a Jan. 27 dinner, according to Comey. Less than a week before he was fired, Comey told a congressional panel that it made him mildly nauseous that he may have affected the outcome of the election by publicly re-opening and then re-closing the Clinton email probe days before the election. In an unorthodox move, Great America Alliance, an offshoot of a pro-Trump super PAC devoted to promoting the White House agenda, developed a television ad called Showboat to air as Comey testified. The ad claims Comey was consumed with election meddling at the expense of fighting terrorism. Has there been any fallout for Trump associates over contacts with Russia before, during or after the election campaign? Flynn was fired in February. The White House said he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about the contacts he had with Russias ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kislyak, before Trump took office. On May 9, federal prosecutors issued grand jury subpoenas seeking business records from people who worked with Flynn when he was a private citizen. On May 10, the Senate Intelligence Committee issued the first subpoena in its Russia investigation, demanding documents from Flynn. He provided the first batch on June 6. Sessions had to recuse himself from involvement in Russia-related probes at the Justice Department because he had not told Congress of his own contacts with Kislyak in 2016. Rosenstein is handling matters related to Russia and it is he who appointed Mueller as special counsel. Is Trump himself under investigation?  Muellers probe has expanded to include examining whether Trump obstructed justice by attempting to curtail the FBIs probe of Russian meddling, the Washington Post reported on June 14. In the short letter Trump sent to Comey dismissing him from the FBI, he had thanked Comey for informing him that he was not under investigation. Comey has confirmed that Trump was not personally under investigation at any point before his dismissal from the FBI. The Post reported the scope of the probe expanded to include Trump shortly after Comeys dismissal, citing government officials. Trumps personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, denied Trump ever told Comey he needed and expected his loyalty. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"
"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Washington (Reuters) - Republican senators trying to repeal Obamacare are forming  consensus to keep some of the U.S. healthcare laws taxes they long criticized, in hopes of delaying more drastic funding cuts, particularly to the Medicaid program for the poor and disabled.  First proposed by moderate Republicans, the idea is gaining traction among party members, according to five sources involved in or briefed on internal discussions. While no final decisions have been made, a sense of urgency has increased as Republicans draft a replacement bill to former President Barack Obamas healthcare law before Congress goes on recess on June 30. But keeping some of the taxes in the Senate bill risks alienating conservatives. On Tuesday, 45 conservative groups and activists sent a letter to Republican Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, urging the Senate to repeal all Obamacare taxes. One cornerstone tax that could remain is the net investment income tax, which imposes a 3.8 percent surtax on capital gains, dividends and interest, the sources said. The taxes most likely to be abolished directly impact consumers and the health industry, including a tax on health insurance premiums, the so-called Cadillac tax on high-cost employer-provided insurance and the medical device tax. Another proposal being floated is to keep all the taxes from the Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare, but to scale them back. A group of 13 Republican senators led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has not completed a full draft of the bill, but is sending pieces to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to assess the impact of various provisions. The CBOs assessment will help determine which taxes the Senate needs in order to pay for its replacement bill. It is not clear whether McConnell, or more conservative party members such as Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Senator Mike Lee of Utah, are receptive to keeping some of the taxes. I think most of the taxes are going to go away, Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the Senates No. 3-ranking Republican, said on Tuesday. Our members are still having a conversation about if we want to make changes that are in the end going to require some additional revenue. Spokesmen for McConnell and Cruz declined to comment. A spokesman for Lee said he wants Republicans to abolish every tax that was included in a 2015 Obamacare repeal bill that Obama vetoed.  Since Obamacare became law in 2010, Republicans have campaigned on repealing the program that extended insurance coverage to 20 million additional Americans through both subsidized private insurance and an expansion of Medicaid. They have argued that the law is too costly and represents undue government interference in Americans healthcare. President Donald Trump promised to eliminate the law on his first day in office, but Republicans, who control the White House, the House of Representatives and the Senate, have struggled to coalesce around a single plan. Under Senate rules, their bill must replicate the $133 billion in savings projected by preliminary legislation that passed in the U.S. House of Representatives last month. That bill would end Obamacares expansion of Medicaid in 2020, slash its federal funding by more than $800 billion over 10 years and eliminate most of the laws taxes. Moderate Republican senators from states that expanded Medicaid, including Rob Portman of Ohio, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Dean Heller of Nevada, have proposed phasing out the expansion over a seven-year period, from 2020 to 2027, to give state governors more time to cut program costs. That timeframe also prevents senators, who serve six-year terms, from having to run for re-election when Medicaid cuts have been implemented, two former Republican Senate aides said.  Some of Obamacares taxes could also be repealed later when Congress tackles new legislation overhauling the U.S. tax code, two current Senate aides said.  Theres no question that the current debate is not centered on eliminating all the taxes in Obamacare right now, Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina said last week. Under a process called reconciliation, the bill needs at least 50 votes to pass, with Vice President Mike Pence casting the tie-breaking vote if needed. In an interview with Reuters last month, McConnell said he did not yet know how he would get enough votes for an Obamacare repeal. Think of me with a Rubiks cube, sitting there trying to think about what combination will get you to 50, McConnell said.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The Democratic mayor of the nations third largest city also said Republican President Donald Trumps legal and political troubles give Democrats a chance to regain a large slice of the more than 1,000 seats Democrats have lost in Congress and state legislatures since 2008. With Democrats controlling cities and Republicans dominating rural areas, the battle will be fought among swing suburban voters, he added. Its not going to be done in a singular election, Emanuel told Reuters in a wide-ranging, exclusive interview.  The real crux question to me as a party is what I call kitchen table economics, Emanuel said. Home ownership, affordable college, job security, retirement savings and health care are key issues, he said. Chicago has faced fiscal problems and untamed street violence since Emanuel first was elected mayor in 2011. The release in 2015 of a dashcam video showing a Chicago police officer fatally shooting an unarmed teenager led to street protests that hurt the mayors standing with voters. Black Lives Matter sued the city Wednesday, seeking to force Emanuel to agree to federal oversight of proposed police reforms.Emanuel said the Justice Department under President Trump will not participate. I cant wish a different Justice Department, Emanuel said. Instead, he is focused on police body cameras, more training and the hiring of new cops in supervisory roles, he added. Emanuel cited improvements under his leadership, public transportation in particular. Eighty-five percent of our people in the city are happy with our public transportation system. In New York, I dont think you could get 85 people, let alone 85 percent, he said, citing not-yet-published data from an annual ridership survey for the Chicago Transit Authority.  Emanuel blamed Illinois Republican Governor Bruce Rauner for gridlock that has put the states credit rating near junk status and helped bring the Chicago Public Schools to the brink of insolvency. There is a fundamental flaw here in the inability to find a way to say, Yes, Emanuel said.  Rauner spokeswoman Eleni Demertzis said the mayor and Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan are to blame for the states budget stalemate and saying no at every turn. In national politics, Emanuel is positioned to play a role as a leader of Democratic Party efforts to recover from the 2016 electoral defeat. He has served as White House adviser to President Barack Obama and President Bill Clinton and led the 2006 mid-term campaign that returned Democrats to a majority in Congress.  With a 38 percent approval rating in a May Reuters/Ipsos poll, Trumps unpopularity figures to be a dominant issue during the 2018 mid-term elections, Emanuel said. He declined to predict whether Trump will finish his term. Its a parlor game right now, he said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The shooter, identified as James Hodgkinson of Illinois, was also taken to a hospital where he died from gunshot wounds. The following is information about the victims and their medical status after the shootings in Alexandria, Virginia, near Washington: - Majority Whip Steve Scalise, the No. 3 Republican in the House, was shot in the hip and was receiving care at MedStar Washington Hospital Center, his office said. Scalise was out of surgery but remained in critical condition, according to the hospital. As whip, Scalise, 51, from Louisiana, is responsible for rounding up votes for legislation and maintaining order among his partys fractious ranks. A year ago, Scalise and other Republican leaders blocked gun control legislation from coming to a vote on the House floor following a mass shooting at a nightclub in Orlando, Florida. - Matt Mika, a lobbyist for Arkansas-based Tyson Foods Inc and former staffer for two former Republican representatives, was shot in the chest, according to witnesses. In a statement, Mikas family said he was shot multiple times and was in critical condition. Mika served as a White House aide under former President George W. Bush, where he coordinated volunteers, worked with press advance and security details and managed VIP visits. - Zachary Barth, a staffer for U.S. Representative Roger Williams of Texas, was also shot. Williams said on Twitter that he was doing well and expected to make a full recovery. - Capitol Hill police officers David Bailey and Crystal Griner were also among the wounded. Both serve as part of Scalises security detail and were in good condition, according to U.S. Capitol Police Chief Matthew Verderosa.

Five of the officials, including Michigan Health and Human Services Director Nick Lyon, were charged with involuntary manslaughter stemming from their roles in handling the crisis, Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette said in a statement.   Involuntary manslaughter is a felony that carries a sentence of up to 15 years in prison. Lyon, 49, was also charged with one count of misconduct in office. The felony charge carries a sentence of up to five years in prison. Four current and former state and Flint officials were also charged with involuntary manslaughter. The four had all been previously charged with lesser crimes in connection with the water crisis.  The states chief medical executive, Eden Wells, was charged Wednesday with obstruction of justice and lying to police. Michigan Governor Rick Snyder said in a statement that Lyon and Wells have his full faith and confidence and would remain on duty and help in Flints recovery. An attorney for Lyon could not be reached for comment. It was not immediately known if Wells had an attorney. Schuette said his team had not spoken with Snyder as part of the investigation. We attempted to interview the governor. We were not successful, Schuette said. He declined to elaborate. Previously, Schuette, when asked if Snyder was a target in the investigation, said there were no targets but nobody is off the table. Some critics have called for high-ranking state officials, including Snyder, to be charged. Snyder previously said he believed he had not done anything criminally wrong. The governor isnt going to speculate on where the investigation is or is not headed, but he continues to cooperate fully, Snyders spokeswoman Anna Heaton said.  Snyders attorney, Brian Lennon, said in a statement that Snyder was made available to testify under oath this spring after being told a subpoena would be produced, but that never occurred. He added that Snyder previously testified under oath to Congress. Wednesdays charges stem from more than 80 cases of Legionnaires disease, including the fatalities, that were believed to be linked to the water in Flint after the city switched its source to the Flint River from Lake Huron in April 2014. Lyon was aware of the Legionnaires outbreak in Genesee County at least one year before he informed the public, according to court documents. His deliberate failure to inform the public resulted in the death of Genesee Township resident Robert Skidmore, 85, from Legionnaires in December 2015, the documents said.   Wells lied to police about when she became aware of the outbreak, according to the documents. She also threatened a team of independent researchers who were studying the source of the disease, court documents said. Its good to seethat state Attorney General Schuette and his team are taking this matter seriously, Flint Mayor Karen Weaver said in a statement. We allare waiting to see what else the investigation uncovers. The crisis in Flint erupted in 2015 when tests found high amounts of lead in blood samples taken from children in the predominantly black city of about 100,000. The more corrosive river water caused lead to leach from pipes and into the drinking water. Lead levels in Flints drinking water have now fallen below levels considered dangerous by federal regulators, state officials said last January. Others charged with involuntary manslaughter on Wednesday included former state-appointed emergency manager Darnell Earley, former Flint city employee Howard Croft, and former state Department of Environmental Quality officials Stephen Busch and Liane Shekter-Smith.

He dove into the dugout behind first base. Zack Barth, a staffer shot in the leg, ran in from the outfield and landed in Williams arms. Barth texted for help as more bullets flew.

(Reuters) - The suspect who opened fire on Republican lawmakers as they played baseball on Wednesday raged against Republican U.S. President Donald Trump on social media and idolized Bernie Sanders, whom he saw as the only politician who understood the working class. Authorities identified the gunman as James Hodgkinson, a 66-year-old home inspector from the St. Louis suburb of Belleville, Illinois. He died from injuries sustained in a shoot-out with Capitol Hill police who were at the scene in Alexandria, Virginia, outside Washington.  Hodgkinson is believed by investigators to have been a person of strong views, a senior U.S. official said, without elaborating. The Belleville News-Democrat newspaper posted a photograph of Hodgkinson protesting outside a post office there in 2012, wearing sunglasses and a goatee and holding a homemade placard that read TAX the Rich. Hodgkinson was a member of many anti-Republican groups on Facebook including The Road to Hell Is Paved With Republicans, Terminate The Republican Party, and Donald Trump is not my President, his profile showed before it was taken down. Trump won the U.S. presidential election in November. Republicans also control both chambers of Congress. Trump is a Traitor. Trump Has Destroyed Our Democracy. Its Time to Destroy Trump & Co. Hodgkinson wrote in a March 22 post. His profile picture was a U.S. flag with the slogan: Democratic Socialism explained in 3 words: We the People. Hodgkinson went to Washington several weeks ago to protest against Trumps election, his brother told the New York Times. The former mayor of Alexandria, Bill Euille, said he talked with the suspect at the local YMCA most mornings for more than a month, and even tried to help find Hodgkinson a job after seeing he was living out of a gym bag, the Washington Post said. Stephen Brennwald, an Alexandria attorney, also saw Hodgkinson at the YMCA wearing long pants rather than gym attire, and said he often seemed to be staring into space. Its just very freaky to think that this guy who was just sitting in there for weeks, not really doing anything, actually turned out to shoot at people, Brennwald told Reuters.  Hodgkinsons Facebook profile featured a cover photo of Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont who ran unsuccessfully to be the Democratic Partys presidential candidate last year.  Sanders, an independent who ran as a progressive populist but was defeated by Hillary Clinton, said the suspect had apparently volunteered on his campaign. In a statement, Sanders condemned the shooting as a despicable act. One woman who asked not to be named told Reuters that Hodgkinson had contacted her via Facebook as part of a political discussion, but that he subsequently commented on her page that Clinton was a liar and a baby killer. I actually blocked him at one point, the woman said. A bartender at the Pork Barrel BBQ in Alexandria said Hodgkinson started coming in for beers about a month ago.   He was a regular-looking guy that kind of gave you a sense of the creeps, but you cant really put your finger on it, said Christina Shrimshaw, 27, who served him a handful of times but never remembered him discussing politics. He would talk about very mundane things, like golf. He was big into watching the Golf Channel.   A neighbor in Belleville, William Schaumleffel, recalled how in March he heard gunshots and saw Hodgkinson shooting with a long gun toward woods across a corn field from his yard.  I yelled at him: Hey, stop shooting over there. There are houses over there, Schaumleffel said. Hodgkinson did not stop, he added, so he filed a report with the sheriffs office. Hodgkinsons criminal history included a 2006 arrest on battery charges that were later dismissed, as well as multiple traffic violations, according to state records that identified him as a 5-foot, 6-inch (1.67-metre) man weighing 190 pounds (86 kg), with brown eyes. Most of the infractions were ultimately dropped. Hodgkinson had been licensed as a home inspector and real estate appraiser, but did not renew his home inspector license after it expired last year, state records showed. His license to appraise real estate expired in 1997. According to Facebook, Hodgkinson went to Belleville Township High School West and studied flight training at Southwestern Illinois College. Beginning in mid-2015, Hodgkinson began expressing support for Sanders 2016 campaign, and federal records showed he donated $18 to the effort. Bernie is the Only Candidate in Decades that Really Cares about the Working Class, Hodgkinson posted on June 13, 2016. The Belleville News-Democrat published letters he wrote the paper criticizing Republicans, tax policies and income inequality.

The amendment appears intended to avoid the administrations legal case at the U.S. Supreme Court becoming moot on grounds that parts of the executive order have expired. Challengers to the ban, who say the order is intended to discriminate against Muslims, have said in court papers that it should expire on Wednesday, 90 days after the executive order was due to take effect on March 16. A memo issued by the White House, as the Supreme Court considered two challenges to the ban, said parts of the order put on hold would not expire before they can go into effect, and the start date would be when court injunctions were lifted. The move is part of administration efforts to have the high court rule that the controversial ban should immediately go into effect after Trumps first attempts to impose travel restrictions were blocked by lower courts.   Omar Jadwat, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which has challenged the ban, said the need for the revision was a sign of the bans legal flaws. And yet again, these revisions underline that the one thing the president has consistently wanted throughout is a Muslim ban, he added. Lawsuits by Hawaii and Maryland challengers argued that the order violated federal immigration law and a section of the Constitutions First Amendment, which prohibits the government favoring or disfavoring any particular religion. The Trump administration has said it is needed to protect national security. Soon after the memo was issued, Acting Solicitor General Jeff Wall filed court papers saying that it resolved any doubt about the orders effective date.  If the case was moot, the nine justices would have no reason to rule on it and lower court rulings against the administration would remain in place. The Supreme Court on Tuesday gave the Trump administration more time to file papers responding to an appeals court ruling on Monday that upheld a block on the travel ban. The courts action likely delayed any decision on administration requests for the ban to go into effect until at least next week.  Federal judges in Maryland and Hawaii blocked Trumps 90-day ban on travelers from Libya, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The Hawaii judge also blocked a 120-day ban on refugees entering the United States. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals largely upheld the Hawaii injunction on Monday.

The complaint said Trump had not sought congressional approval for any of the payments his hundreds of businesses had received from foreign governments since he took office in January, even though the Constitution requires him to do so. The White House did not respond to requests for comment but has said Trumps business interests do not violate the Constitution. The Trump Organization has said it will donate profits from customers representing foreign governments to the U.S. Treasury but will not require such customers to identify themselves.  At least 30 U.S. senators and 166 representatives are plaintiffs in Wednesdays lawsuit, representing the largest number of legislators ever to sue a U.S. president, according to two lawmakers who are among the plaintiffs. It was the latest in a series of such lawsuits against the Republican president. The Constitutions foreign emoluments clause bars U.S. officeholders from accepting payments and various other gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval. The lawmakers are seeking a judicial order to require Trump to seek Congress assent before he accepts such payments. The presidents failure to tell us about these emoluments, to disclose the payments and benefits that he is receiving, mean that we cannot do our job. We cannot consent to what we dont know, said Richard Blumenthal, the lead senator on the lawsuit, in a conference call on Tuesday.  John Conyers, the lead plaintiff from the House of Representatives, added: President Trump has conflicts of interest in at least 25 countries, and it appears hes using his presidency to maximize his profits. The Justice Department declined to comment.  Similar lawsuits have been filed in recent months by parties including a nonprofit ethics group, a restaurant trade group, and the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia.  They allege that Trumps acceptance of payments from foreign and U.S. governments through his hospitality empire puts other hotel and restaurant owners at an unfair disadvantage and provides governments an incentive to give Trump-owned businesses special treatment.  In a motion to dismiss one such lawsuit on Friday, the Justice Department argued that the plaintiffs had not shown any specific harm to their businesses, and that Trump was only banned from receiving foreign government gifts if they arose from his service as president. On Monday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said partisan politics was behind the lawsuit by the Maryland and District of Columbia officials. Lawmakers rarely sue the president, so there are few federal court decisions the legislators can cite to prove their legal standing to bring Wednesdays case, said Leah Litman, an assistant professor specializing in constitutional law at the University of California, Irvine. A 1997 Supreme Court decision by then-Chief Justice William Rehnquist indicates such cases have standing if the plaintiffs are numerous enough that they could have had a decisive impact on the vote from which they were excluded, said  Tara Grove, a professor specializing in federal courts and constitutional law at William & Mary Law School. Courts are more and more receptive to the idea that a large group of federal lawmakers can sue over being deprived of their constitutionally conferred powers, Grove said. Conyers and Blumenthal said they planned to reach out to their Republican colleagues in Congress to invite them to join the lawsuit. I wont be surprised if a few do, Conyers added.

Scalise was shot in the hip on Wednesday morning as he and other Republican lawmakers practiced for a game against their Democratic rivals in Congress. He was in critical condition after surgery at a Washington hospital. As the majority whip in the House, the 51-year-old Scalise is responsible for rounding up votes and maintaining order among the Republican Partys fractious ranks.  He is in the job largely as a bridge to conservative groups inside the House Republican caucus, but he has struggled at times to prevent them from stymyimg the agenda of the Republican leadership.  Widely seen as well-liked among colleagues, many paid tribute to him in the hours after the attack. Scalise first went to Congress in 2008 following a decade in the Louisiana state legislature, and quickly ascended into the ranks of party leadership.  An ardent supporter of Trump inside the Republican Party, he has an A+ rating from the National Rifle Association, a powerful lobbying group that fights for gun-ownership rights.  Scalise is popular inside his deeply conservative Louisiana district, which encircles New Orleans and Lake Pontchartrain  and includes the swampy bayou region where the Mississippi River spills into the Gulf of Mexico. He won re-election in November with 75 percent of his districts vote. Before becoming majority whip, Scalise was chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee, which includes more than 170 conservative lawmakers.  In 2014, Scalises office confirmed he had addressed a white supremacist group connected to former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke in 2002 when he was a state representative.  Seeking to play down the controversy, Scalises office said he had spoken to hundreds of groups during his political career and was unaware of the views of the European-American Unity and Rights Organization. Scalise has played shortstop in the annual congressional baseball game, which began more than a century ago and pits Democrats against Republicans to raise money for charity. Knowing Steve Scalise as we all do, he is likely really frustrated that he will not be able to play in the baseball game, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a speech about the attack from the House floor on Wednesday.

In addition to the shooting at a baseball field in Alexandria, Virginia, a man dressed in a UPS uniform and armed with an assault pistol opened fire at a United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) package sorting hub in San Francisco, killing three people before turning the gun on himself, police said. Also, one man was shot outside a shopping center near a major sports arena in New York City on Wednesday but it was not immediately clear who opened fire or how badly the victim was hurt, police said. Despite the days carnage, there was no immediate indication that President Donald Trump or his fellow Republicans would shift from their position protecting gun ownership rights. Pro-gun voters lean heavily toward the Republican Party.  Several House Republicans who attended a briefing following the shooting were asked by reporters about the need for gun control legislation. Everyone was focused on the facts of the case and what might be needed to enhance lawmakers security, said Republican Representative Barbara Comstock. The lawmakers did not indicate gun control was discussed. Immediately following mass shootings, politicians typically are hesitant to talk about partisan legislative matters. Aides to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, whose panel would have jurisdiction, were asked if Wednesdays shootings showed the need for legislation. A reply from Goodlatte, provided by aides, said his prayers are with Congressman Steve Scalise and the others injured. Spokesmen for the National Rifle Association (NRA), the powerful pro-gun rights lobbying group and a Republican Party ally, were not immediately available for comment. Democrats, who generally, though not uniformly, are more aggressive about gun control laws, expressed concern following the Alexandria incident, in which Republican Representative Steve Scalise and several other people were shot. There are too many guns on the street, said Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat. Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who sought the Democratic presidential nomination last year, said, Weve got to stop the violence. Democratic Representative Tim Ryan, who described himself as a strong supporter of gun rights, told reporters that does not mean we should not have universal background checks to gauge gun buyers mental health and to check on whether they are on terrorism watch lists. It is entirely appropriate to ask those questions, Ryan said of expanded gun control legislation. Many Republicans recently have opposed expanded background checks for gun buyers and limiting access to assault rifles. Scalise, the No. 3 Republican in the House, has worked to oppose new federal gun controls that he has seen as an assault on the U.S. Constitutions Second Amendment right to bear arms. We dont expect the solutions to this issue ever to be found in the wake of a single tragedy no matter who is shot, no matter how horrific it is, Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, said in a telephone interview. Gun control groups are fighting federal legislation that would relax existing gun laws, especially after Republicans backed by the NRA fared well in last Novembers elections. The Republican-controlled House this year passed a bill making it harder for veterans who have been deemed mentally incompetent to be turned down for gun purchases. Gross said that despite the House vote, the measure is not going anywhere in the Senate. He also said gun control organizations have held back passage in Congress of legislation giving states with concealed weapons laws reciprocity in all other states. A year ago, Congress was in a gun control debate after the shooting deaths of 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Democrats ramped up their pro-gun control push, staging a filibuster in the Senate and a sit-in in the House to disrupt Republican-controlled proceedings. In the end, no legislation passed either chamber to tighten access to guns. Chelsea Parsons, vice president for guns and crime policy at the liberal Center for American Progress, noted however, that since the 2012 shooting in Connecticut resulting in the deaths of 20 first-graders and six staff members at an elementary school, several states have imposed new limits on gun sales.  Theres going to come a breaking point in the disconnect between what Congress is willing to do and what the American people demand, Parsons said.

Rosenworcel served as a commissioner for the regulator until the end of 2016 when lawmakers failed to take up her renomination under former President Barack Obama, handing Republicans a 2-1 majority on the five-seat commission. Rosenworcel did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The agency is working to reverse Obama-era regulations, including the former Democratic presidents landmark 2015 net-neutrality rules prohibiting broadband providers from giving or selling access to certain internet services over others. Rosenworcel, a former FCC official and congressional aide, backed the net neutrality rules in 2015 and put a significant focus on the plight of children without access to broadband service. She showed an independent streak from then-FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, who unsuccessfully sought approval for new rules to allow pay TV subscribers to ditch set-top boxes. In 2013, she also opposed allowing cellphone use in the air. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, tapped by Trump in January, has also said he wants to dismantle other significant regulations as part of a sweeping review he said would remove barriers to business and modernize rules. Pai has also proposed significant changes to local TV ownership limits and plans other changes to media regulations.     If confirmed, Rosenworcel would join Democratic Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, whose term ends on June 30. It is not clear if Clyburn plans to stay on the commission.  Industry and congressional officials also expect Trump to nominate Brendan Carr, a Republican who is currently general counsel at the FCC and an adviser to Pai, to an open seat. Republican Michael ORielly also serves on the panel. Democrats insisted Republicans had agreed in 2015 to reconfirm Rosenworcel as part of a deal to confirm ORielly. Republicans denied there was a deal but the standoff had delayed consideration of telecommunications legislation in the Senate. Pai would be forced to leave the commission if he is not reconfirmed by the end of the year. Better late than never, Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, a Democrat, said in a statement on Rosenworcels nomination. The Senate should now move quickly to confirm her and fulfill the promise that was made two years ago. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

It is intended to punish Russia over issues including alleged meddling in the election, annexation of Ukraines Crimea region and support for the government of Syria in that countrys six-year-long civil war. The measure sets up a process for Congress to review changes in sanctions, puts into law actions previously established via presidential executive order, imposes new sanctions on Russians found guilty of human rights abuses or conducting cyber attacks. [nL1N1JA056] It was introduced amid an intense focus in the U.S. capital on relations with Russia, and investigations by the Department of Justice and congressional committees of whether Russia sought to influence the 2016 U.S. elections to help elect Trump, and whether Trump associates colluded with Moscow as it sought to influence the election. Moscow denies any such activity, which Trump has dismissed as sour grapes by the Democrats he defeated. The Iran bill, including the Russia sanctions amendment, was expected to pass the Senate on Thursday or later on Wednesday. To take effect, the measure would also have to pass the House of Representatives and be signed into law by Trump. If Trump objected, some of its backers said they expected enough congressional support to override a veto. Today the Senate has finally confronted Russia for interfering in our elections.

Before he was killed, a gunman shot and wounded a senior Republican House leader and several others getting ready on an Alexandria, Virginia, field for a charity game between Republicans and Democrats on Thursday in nearby Washington, D.C. The annual Congressional Baseball Game charity event, where Senate and House members from both parties face off together, has raised $600,000 for the Boys and Girls Club, the Washington Nationals Dream Foundation and the Washington Literacy Center, according to several lawmakers and event organizers. The game at Nationals Park may be one of the last vestiges of cooperation between the two sides in the nations capital, where some believe partisan politics is at an all-time high.   Theres such a hatefulness in what we see in American politics and policy discussions right now ... this has got to stop, Representative Rodney Davis, a Republican team member, told CNN in an interview while still wearing his baseball cleats and practice clothes. Davis said the congressional game was a great demonstration that Democrats and Republicans could still get along. We have fun, said a visibly upset Davis. I never thought Id play a baseball game for charity, got to practice at 6:30 in the morning and have to dodge bullets. The gun violence early on Wednesday scarred what is for many almost sacred American ground - the baseball field. Considered Americas so-called national pastime, the game dates back to the 1800s even as it now competes heavily with other popular sports including football and basketball. Ive always felt safe on a baseball field, and now I dont know if Ill ever feel safe on a baseball field again, Representative Chuck Fleischmann, also at the shooting scene, told CNN.  The grassy field once known for roasted peanuts and hot dogs now instead conjures images of a battlefield, fellow Republican Brad Wenstrup, an Army Reserve officer, said on Twitter.  You never expect a baseball field in America to feel like being back in a combat zone in Iraq, but this morning it did, wrote Wenstrup, a congressman from Ohio.  When congressional members were told in a bipartisan briefing that Thursdays baseball game would still be held despite the shooting, they leapt to their feet in a standing ovation, Republican Representative Martha McSally told Reuters. Tomorrow well go out on the field, well root for our team, U.S. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi later told lawmakers from the chamber floor.

Tillerson said it was possible that the Ukrainian government could come to an agreement with Moscow outside the structure of the 2015 accord. I think it is important that we be given sufficient flexibility to achieve the Minsk objectives. It is very possible that the government of Ukraine and the government of Russia could come to a satisfactory resolution through some structure other than Minsk, Tillerson told the House Foreign Affairs Committee. My caution is I wouldnt want to have ourselves handcuffed to Minsk if it turns out the parties decide to settle this through another, a different, agreement, he said. The Minsk peace agreement, brokered by France and Germany and signed by Russia and Ukraine in February 2015, calls for a ceasefire, the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the front line and constitutional reform to give eastern Ukraine more autonomy. As Washington focuses on potential Trump administration ties to Russia, lawmakers have been insisting that no sanctions on Russia be lifted until it complies with the agreement. Tillerson was responding to Representative Eliot Engel, the committees ranking Democrat, who asked if it was in the U.S. interest to relax sanctions on Russia before it fully complied. Engel said the approach suggested by Tillerson would send the wrong signal to Russia.  If they think that were somehow willing to relax the sanctions on them before theyve complied with the Minsk framework and left Crimea, I think it just will encourage Putin to continue his bullying, Engel said.  And who knows where hell strike next. Tillerson spoke at a wide-ranging budget hearing in which he also discussed Trumps China policy and said he expected the administration to complete a review of Afghan policy in the coming weeks. Many members of the U.S. Congress, including some of Trumps fellow Republicans, disagree sharply with his proposal to slash foreign aid and spending on diplomacy. Trump, who wants sharp increases in military spending, sees the proposed cuts as a way to help balance the budget. His critics say such that approach would pose a threat to the countrys security by weakening so-called soft power programs that win international support.

It would be the second consecutive week in which the White House will make a push to show Trump is moving ahead on his top domestic priority - jobs - in spite of investigations into whether he had anything to do with possible Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Trump has refuted those allegations, which have overshadowed his efforts to boost economic growth. Last week was branded infrastructure week with a series of events dealing with fixing the nations decrepit roads and bridges, another plank in Trumps jobs platform. But a congressional hearing on the Russia imbroglio featuring James Comey - the FBI director Trump fired - sucked up all the attention in Washington. Next week will be workforce development week where the White House highlights plans to combat the skills gap. U.S. job openings surged to a record high in April with government data showing employers struggling to find workers with the right skills. Trumps plan has been in the works for months, led by his daughter Ivanka Trump, adviser Reed Cordish, and Trumps secretaries of labor, education and commerce. The White House was mum on the precise details of Trumps plan to expand apprenticeships ahead of his unveiling it in a speech at the Labor Department on Wednesday.  A real estate developer who is familiar with the use of apprenticeship programs in the building trades, Trump has praised Germanys apprenticeship system as a model.  Ivanka Trump discussed the issue with German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the White House in March, and toured a Siemens training center in Berlin in April. Trump will travel to Wisconsin on Tuesday to visit a training program at Waukesha County Technical College with Republican Governor Scott Walker, a former rival in the race to become the 2016 Republican presidential candidate. On Wednesday, Ivanka Trump will hold a roundtable on the issue with 15 CEOs at the White House. The president will then meet with eight governors on Thursday to discuss the topic at the White House. The White House declined to say which CEOs and governors would be there. One thing that likely will not be in Trumps plan: a surge in spending. The White House expects the private sector to take the lead.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said no immediate decision had been made about the troop levels, which are now set at about 8,400.  The Pentagon declined to comment.  The decision is similar to one announced in April that applied to U.S. troop levels in Iraq and Syria, and came as Mattis warned Congress the U.S.-backed Afghan forces were not beating the Taliban despite more than 15 years of war.  \""We are not winning in Afghanistan right now,\"" Mattis said in testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier on Tuesday. \""And we will correct this as soon as possible.\""COMMENTARY: Why a troop surge in Afghanistan is a terrible idea Mattis said the Taliban were surging at the moment, something he said he intended to address.  A former U.S. official said such a decision might allow the White House to argue that it was not micromanaging as much as the administration of former President Barack Obama was sometimes accused of doing.  Critics say delegating too much authority to the military does not shield Trump from political responsibility during battlefield setbacks and could reduce the chances for diplomats to warn of potential blowback from military decisions.  It has been four months since Army General John Nicholson, who leads U.S. and international forces in Afghanistan, said he needed a few thousand additional forces, some potentially drawn from U.S. allies.  Current and former U.S. officials say discussions revolve around adding 3,000 to 5,000 troops. Those forces are expected to be largely comprised of trainers to support Afghan forces, as well as air crews.  Deliberations include giving more authority to forces on the ground and taking more aggressive action against Taliban fighters.  Some U.S. officials have questioned the benefit of sending more troops to Afghanistan because any politically palatable number would not be enough to turn the tide, much less create stability and security. To date, more than 2,300 Americans have been killed and more than 17,000 wounded since the war began in 2001.  Any increase of several thousand troops would leave American forces in Afghanistan well below their 2011 peak of more than 100,000 troops.  The Afghan government was assessed by the U.S. military to control or influence just 59.7 percent of Afghanistans 407 districts as of Feb. 20, a nearly 11 percentage-point decrease from the same time in 2016, according to data released by the U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction.  A truck bomb explosion in Kabul last month killed more than 150 people, making it the deadliest attack in the Afghan capital since the Taliban were ousted in 2001 by a NATO-led coalition after ruling the country for five years.  On Saturday, three U.S. soldiers were killed when an Afghan soldier opened fire on them in eastern Afghanistan.  The broader regional U.S. strategy for Afghanistan remains unclear. Mattis promised on Tuesday to brief lawmakers on a new war strategy by mid-July that is widely expected to call for thousands more U.S. troops.  Senator John McCain, the chairman of the Armed Forces Committee, pressed Mattis on the deteriorating situation during the Tuesday hearing, saying the United States had an urgent need for a change in strategy, and an increase in resources if we are to turn the situation around.  We recognize the need for urgency, Mattis said.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Lieutenant Governor Ralph Northam bested former congressman Tom Perriello in the Democratic primary, while former Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie topped President Donald Trumps former Virginia campaign co-chairman Corey Stewart, according to unofficial returns posted online by the Virginia Department of Elections. The gubernatorial race in Virginia, the only state other than New Jersey electing a new governor this year, is seen as a key test of Trumps popularity ahead of the 2018 mid-term elections for the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. The winner in November will succeed incumbent Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe, who is barred by term limits from running again. Northam sought to stoke Democrats anger toward Trump, calling the president a narcissistic maniac in statewide ads.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Tuesday denounced as a detestable lie the idea he colluded with Russians meddling in the 2016 election, and he clashed with Democratic lawmakers over his refusal to detail his conversations with President Donald Trump. Sessions, a senior member of Trumps Cabinet and an adviser to his election campaign last year, had a series of tense exchanges with Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee during about 2-1/2 hours of testimony as they pressed him to recount discussions with the Republican president. You raised your right hand here today and said you would solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, Democratic Senator Martin Heinrich said. Now youre not answering questions. Youre impeding this investigation.  Sessions refused to say whether he and Trump discussed FBI Director James Comeys handling of an investigation into possible collusion between Trumps campaign and Russia during the election campaign before the president fired Comey on May 9. He also declined to say if Trump opposed Sessions decision to recuse himself from the Russia probe in March, and whether Justice Department officials discussed possible presidential pardons of individuals being looked at in the probe. Democratic Senator Ron Wyden told Sessions: I believe the American people have had it with stonewalling. Americans dont want to hear that answers to relevant questions are privileged. I am not stonewalling, Sessions replied, saying he was simply following Justice Department policy not to discuss confidential communications with the president. Sessions testimony did not provide any damaging new information on Trump campaign ties with Russia or on Comeys dismissal, but his refusal to discuss conversations with Trump raised fresh questions about whether the White House has something to hide. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, which is conducting a parallel Russia probe, said on Twitter that Congress must compel responses using whatever process necessary. Last week, Comey told the Senate committee that Trump had fired him to undermine the FBIs investigation of the Russia matter.  Trumps decision to fire Comey, a move recommended by Sessions despite having already recused himself from the Russia probe, prompted critics to charge that the president was trying to interfere with a criminal investigation. Senator Angus King, an independent, questioned Sessions legal basis for refusing to answer questions after Sessions said Trump had not invoked executive privilege regarding the conversations.  Executive privilege can be claimed by a president or senior government officials to withhold information from Congress or the courts to protect the executive branch decision-making process. Sessions said it would be inappropriate for him to reveal private conversations with Trump when the president has not had a full opportunity to review the questions and to make a decision on whether or not to approve such an answer. Legal experts said there was some merit to Sessions argument. Andrew Wright, a professor at Savannah Law School and associate counsel under former President Barack Obama, said it was not unusual for government employees to refuse to discuss conversations with the president in order to preserve the right to invoke executive privilege later. Sessions clash with the Democratic senators was the latest chapter in a saga that has dogged Trump in his first five months as president and distracted from his domestic policy agenda including major healthcare and tax cut initiatives. The suggestion that I participated in any collusion or that I was aware of any collusion with the Russian government to hurt this country, which I have served with honor for over 35 years, or to undermine the integrity of our democratic process, is an appalling and detestable lie, Sessions said. I have never met with or had any conversation with any Russians or any foreign officials concerning any type of interference with any campaign or election in the United States. Further, I have no knowledge of any such conversations by anyone connected with the Trump campaign. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in a report released in January that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an effort to interfere in the election to help Trump in part by hacking and releasing damaging emails about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Russia has denied any such interference, and Trump has denied any collusion by his campaign with Moscow. Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation in March after revelations that he had failed to disclose two meetings last year with Russias ambassador to Washington, Sergei Kislyak. In his testimony on Tuesday, Sessions addressed media reports that he may have had a third previously undisclosed meeting with Kislyak at Washingtons Mayflower Hotel last year. Sessions said he did not have any private meetings and could not recall any conversations with any Russian officials at the hotel but did not rule out that a brief interaction with Kislyak may have occurred there. A former Republican senator, Sessions was an early supporter of Trumps presidential campaign, but sources say there has been tension between the two men in recent weeks because Trump was annoyed that Sessions recused himself from the Russia probe. Sessions said on Tuesday he did not recuse himself because he felt he was a subject of the investigation himself but rather because he felt he was required to by Justice Department rules.

Tillerson, testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, acknowledged that rapprochement with the communist-ruled island has led to an increase in U.S. visitors and U.S. business ties. However, Tillerson added: We think we have achieved very little in terms of changing the behavior of the regime in Cuba .... and it has little incentive today to change that. His comments came as Trumps aides sought to finalize rules that, according to U.S. officials and people familiar with the discussions, are likely to bar U.S. trade with Cuban enterprises linked to the military  which controls a large part of the economy  and tighten some rules on Americans traveling there.  But the new policy will stop short of closing embassies or breaking off relations re-established in 2015 after more than five decades of hostility, the sources said. In his speech, Trump is expected to claim fulfillment of a campaign promise to the Cuban-American community to tighten the screws on the government of Cuban President Raul Castro. While Tillerson declined to confirm any details, he left no doubt that the Trump administration was prepared to undo some pieces of Obamas policy that it sees as boosting the Cuban government financially, which would violate U.S. law. As were developing these business relationships and as were enjoying the benefits on the economic and development side, are we inadvertently or directly providing financial support to the regime? Our view is we are, Tillerson said. And the question is ... how how do we bring that back into compliance with longstanding statutory obligations he said. Many of Trumps fellow Republicans, and some Democrats, objected to Obamas policy shift, saying he gave too much for too few concessions from Cuba. But Obamas measures have proven popular with the public, U.S. businesses and many lawmakers from both parties. Tillerson agreed that moves toward more normal relations with the United States have helped some Cubans lift themselves out of poverty and provided opportunities for U.S. companies. However, Tillerson said there is a dark side to relations with Cuba, noting that the government in Havana continues to jail political opponents and harass dissidents. We are supportive of the continued economic development, as long as it is done in full compliance with our existing statutes to not provide financial support to the regime, Tillerson said. Thats the focus of our current policy review. But divisions remain within the Trump administration over how far to go. Some aides have argued that Trump, a former real estate magnate who won the presidency promising to unleash U.S. business and create jobs, would have a hard time defending any moves that close off the Cuban market. But other advisers have contended that it is important to make good on a promise to Cuban-Americans whose support they considered significant in winning Florida in the 2016 election. Miami is home to the largest Cuban-American community. One proposal under consideration, according to the U.S. sources, would tighten enforcement to make sure Americans legally fit the authorized categories they claim to be traveling under. Another tougher change being weighed would revert to regulations requiring at least some types of U.S. travelers to seek a special license to travel to Cuba. However, airline officials say they do not expect the Trump administration to revoke any flights to Cuba approved by the Obama administration but said new measures to restrict visits to Cuba could result in less demand for seats.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is weighing imposing sanctions on countries that do business with North Korea and looking for ways to revive strained relations with Russia, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Tuesday. At a committee hearing, he also defended President Donald Trumps plans for steep reductions in U.S. spending on diplomacy and foreign aid. Senators from both major parties charged that such cuts would ultimately hurt America. At the start Tillerson told lawmakers that North Korea had released Otto Warmbier, a U.S. university student held captive for 17 months, and the United States was seeking the release of three other detained Americans.  Washington has sought to increase economic and political pressure on Pyongyang because of its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. The North has conducted five nuclear tests and is believed to be making progress toward an intercontinental ballistic missile that could hit the United States. Tillerson said Washington is discussing North Korea with all of its allies, and seeing some response from China, its biggest trading partner. He said North Korea would top the agenda at  next weeks high-level talks between U.S. and Chinese officials. Tillerson said the United States would have to work with other countries to deny North Korea access to basics such as oil and will have to consider whether to impose sanctions on those doing business with North Korea. We are in a stage where we are moving into this next effort of, Are we going to have to, in effect, start taking secondary  sanctions because countries we have provided information to  have not, or are unwilling, or dont have the ability to do that? Tillerson told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Because the United States has no trade with the North, its strongest way to impose economic pressure is through secondary sanctions that threaten companies from third countries with losing access to the U.S. market if they deal with Pyongyang. Asked whether the United States wanted to see an Iran-style global embargo to deny exports of petroleum and other products to North Korea, Tillerson said that this would only work if Russia and China, the Norths main suppliers, cooperated. Tillerson repeated his view that U.S. relations with Russia  were at an all time-low and still deteriorating. Ties have been strained by differences over Syria, Ukraine and allegations, denied by Moscow, of Russian efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election. He said the administration was trying to find a way to re-establish a working relationship, notably on Syria. It took years of diplomacy with Russia and China to achieve consensus among major powers to impose the sanctions on Iran and a similar result with the North seems unlikely given Beijings reluctance to destabilize its neighbors. Asked if China had lived up to its pledges to crack down on the North, Tillerson said its actions had been uneven, but added: They have taken steps, visible steps that we can confirm. We are in discussions with them about entities inside of China. The purpose of Tillersons appearance, his first of four congressional hearings this week, was to discuss the budget. In all, the Trump proposal cuts about 32 percent from U.S. diplomacy and aid budgets, or nearly $19 billion. Committee members, including some of Trumps fellow Republicans, spoke sharply against the plan. Republicans control both houses of Congress, which sets the federal government budget. Separately, 16 retired senior generals and other ex-military officers said they would submit joint testimony to the Senate on Wednesday about the importance of foreign aid to national security.

Capitol Hill sources who asked not to be named said Trump described the version of the legislation that passed the House last month as mean. That House bill was widely criticized for letting states seek waivers from insurance protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Trump discussed the healthcare bill at a White House lunch he hosted for Republican senators in a bid to help the lawmakers find common ground to move forward with healthcare reform legislation this summer. The White House declined to comment on private conversations between Trump and lawmakers. During the portion of the lunch open to reporters, Trump told the lawmakers their healthcare bill would need to be generous and kind. That may be adding additional money into it, he said, without offering details on how much money might be needed or how it might be used. Trump stepped up pressure for the repeal with a tweet Tuesday morning declaring that the Affordable Care Act, nicknamed Obamacare, is in a death spiral. He cited the governments announcement Monday that some 2 million people who signed up for Obamacare have dropped out this year.  Although Trumps Republican Party has a majority in both houses of Congress, Trump blamed obstructionist Democrats for the lack of progress in repealing President Barack Obamas signature domestic achievement. Senator John Thune, the No. 3 Republican in the Senate, who attended the lunch meeting, said Trump was open to suggestions that some federal cost-sharing payments to health insurers under Obamacare continue in the near term but that the president did not make any definite pronouncements on that issue. Those payments help cover out-of-pocket medical expenses for low-income Americans. Trump has said he might consider withholding them but insurers say that would wreak havoc in the markets. Thune also said Trump did not give any deadlines to the senators on passing the bill. I hope that we can stay on schedule to have floor action before the Fourth of July break, Thune said.       The House of Representatives narrowly approved its version of repeal last month but Senate Republicans have been unable to coalesce around their own version of a bill, with moderates and conservatives pushing in different directions in meetings behind closed doors. The senators Trump invited to lunch included Republicans from both ideological camps. Moderates Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski were on the list as well as conservatives Ted Cruz and Mike Lee. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said senators are closer to bringing up a proposal and other Republicans have predicted for some time that a bill would be ready for a vote before the August recess. Senate aides said the Senate bill was not expected to touch insurance protections that are included in Obamacare for people with pre-existing medical conditions, after the controversy over the House bill that would let states seek waivers from those protections. In states with such waivers, people with pre-existing conditions could still get coverage but they would not be shielded against potentially higher costs. Another senator at the lunch, Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, said after the meeting that there still was a lot of work to do before legislation can be unveiled.  The total bill hasnt been resolved, he said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The move likely delays any high court action on the administrations two emergency applications asking for the ban issued on March 6 to immediately go into effect. The March ban was Trumps second effort to impose travel restrictions through an executive order. An entry on the Supreme Court docket said that the administration can file its new brief on Thursday. Hawaii, which challenged the ban and won in the appeals court, is permitted to file its own brief on June 20, meaning the court is unlikely to act on the emergency application until next week at the earliest.     The court was responding to a request made by Acting Solicitor General Jeff Wall, who said in a letter that the ruling on Monday by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco means the government needs to file a new brief. In an added dramatic twist, Trump himself plans to go to the  Supreme Court on Thursday for the investiture of Justice Neil Gorsuch, an administration official said. Trump nominated Gorsuch in January. Gorsuchs confirmation by the U.S. Senate in April restored the courts 5-4 conservative majority.  Trumps visit to the court would be his first since he became president on Jan. 20 and would put him face-to-face with the nine justices as they consider the fate of his travel ban unless the court acts before then. It is common practice for presidents to attend such events, which are purely ceremonial. The Supreme Court could discuss how to act on the emergency application at its private conference on June 22, a week after the Gorsuch ceremony. Wall wrote that more time was needed because the 9th Circuit ruling in favor of the state of Hawaii is the first addressing the executive order at issue to rest relief on statutory rather than constitutional grounds.  Hawaiis lawyer, Neal Katyal, filed his own letter objecting to the governments timeline, although he agreed that both sides needed to file briefs responding to Mondays ruling. Federal judges in Maryland and Hawaii blocked Trumps 90-day ban on travelers from Libya, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The Hawaii judge also blocked a 120-day ban on refugees entering the United States. The 9th Circuit largely upheld the Hawaii injunction on Monday. In the second case, the Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, on May 25 upheld the Maryland judges ruling. The lawsuits by Hawaii and the Maryland challengers argued that the executive order violated federal immigration law and a section of the Constitutions First Amendment, which prohibits the government from favoring or disfavoring any particular religion. The Supreme Court is weighing emergency applications in both cases, but is likely to act on them together. Trumps first order on Jan. 27 led to chaos and protests at airports and in various cities before being blocked by the courts. The second order was intended to overcome the legal issues posed by the original ban, but was blocked by judges before it could go into effect on March 16.

A person close to the legal team said on Friday Trumps chief personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, expected to file a complaint against Comey early this week to the Justice Departments inspector generals office. I think its going to take a little longer, Mark Corallo, a spokesman for the legal team, said on Tuesday. It may well slip to next week. Corallo also said the complaint may be filed to the Justice Departments Office of Professional Responsibility rather than its Office of Inspector General. Trumps lawyers are sifting through additional information and preparing at least one submission, and a meeting scheduled for Wednesday may clarify the proper avenue for the complaint, he said. The president has responded to Comeys testimony on Thursday to the Senate Intelligence Committee by denying that he tried to interfere with an FBI investigation, and calling the former FBI chief a leaker. In his testimony, Comey said that after Trump fired him last month he gave a memo he wrote about a meeting with the president to a friend in order to have its contents disclosed to the media. In a statement following the testimony, Kasowitz accused Comey of leaking privileged information. Some legal experts have said the information disclosed was not privileged because Trump himself had already publicly discussed their conversations. A former high-ranking Justice Department official familiar with how the inspector general handles complaints said any filing by Kasowitz would most likely be treated as part of an existing investigation into Comeys handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation. This could end up as a footnote in a longer report, the former official said. Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University, said he believes the Comey disclosure violated FBI regulations but said the Office of Professional Responsibility may be reluctant to look into an disciplinary allegation against a former rather than current employee.  The challenge for the Trump team is to find an office that will get to the merits, said Turley. John Lavinsky, a spokesman for the Inspector General, declined to comment.

Republican Senator John Thune, who chairs the Commerce Committee, Bill Nelson, the top Democrat on the panel, and Senator Gary Peters, a Michigan Democrat, said in a joint statement that existing federal vehicle regulations written over recent decades did not account for self-driving cars without a human driver behind the wheel. Thune said the senators hoped to reach agreement based on prioritizing safety, fixing outdated rules, and clarifying the role of federal and state governments. Federal auto regulations pose significant legal hurdles that must be cleared before fully self-driving cars can be sold without steering wheels and gas pedals, a government report said last year. The Senate Commerce Committee is holding a hearing on self-driving cars on Wednesday. Mitch Bainwol, head of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, an auto trade group, will tell the panel that Congress should work to eliminate state or local laws that could unduly burden or restrict the use of self-driving vehicles in the future. The senators are joining a broader movement in Washington to respond to calls from Detroit and Silicon Valley for federal action to set rules for self-driving cars, rather than allowing states such as California to write potentially conflicting rules.  The chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee told Reuters last week he planned to unveil a package of legislation to overhaul federal rules governing self-driving vehicles. Companies such as Alphabet Inc, General Motors Co and Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) are pursuing automated technologies and want unified federal regulations to replace outdated rules and make it simpler to develop and eventually sell the technology across the country. In April, automakers and technology companies urged California to make changes to its proposed state regulations governing autonomous vehicles. Many oppose Californias plan to require a state permit to deploy autonomous vehicles, which must meet performance and design criteria. The U.S. Transportation Department said last week it would unveil revised self-driving guidelines within the next few months, responding to automakers calls for regulations to sanction costly efforts to put autonomous vehicles on the road. Vehicle crashes annually kill more than 35,000 people on U.S. roads and injure 2.4 million. The economic cost of vehicle crashes is at least $240 billion annually, the government says.

Senate staff who manage press access told television network reporters earlier Tuesday that they could no longer film interviews with senators in the hallways of the Capitol without first receiving permission, citing a directive from the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration.  Such interviews, an everyday occurrence in designated areas throughout the Capitol, provide a running insight into legislators thoughts on bills and hearings. The staff said the restrictions were because the number of reporters has swelled due to negotiations on healthcare legislation and high-profile hearings. The directive came from the Senate Rules Committee, which oversees operations on the Senate side of the Capitol, they said. The panel is controlled by Republicans, since they hold the majority in the Senate. Committee Chairman Richard Shelby said in a statement the panel was simply enforcing rules already on the books, adding it has been working with the various galleries to ensure compliance with existing rules in an effort to help provide a safe environment.  The senior Democrat on the panel, Amy Klobuchar, said she was not consulted in advance and objected. In a statement, Klobuchar said she called on Republicans to allow reporters to do their jobs. She added that she had talked to Shelby, who had told her he would not move to change press access without consulting her. We must hold him to it. This is no time for limiting press access in the U.S. Senate  with Russia hearings, Attorney General (Jeff) Sessions testifying, and what appears to be the secretive drafting of a healthcare bill.

The Senate voted 53 to 47 to narrowly defeat legislation that sought to block portions of a new, separate arms sale to Saudi Arabia, agreed during a visit there by President Donald Trump in May. Arms sales to Riyadh have become increasingly contentious in the U.S. Congress, where some lawmakers object that American weapons have contributed to widespread civilian casualties in a Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen. Republican Trumps predecessor Barack Obama, a Democrat,  suspended the planned sale of precision-guided munitions in December because of concerns over civilian casualties in Yemen, where the civil war pits Iran-allied Houthi rebels against the government backed by a Saudi-led Arab coalition. Trump, however, has said he wants to encourage weapons sales as a way to create jobs in the United States.  Senator Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the administration had notified Congress about the start of deliveries on the 2015 sale. He said in a statement that Trumps decision was another reason for the Senate to disapprove the new sale. We need to send a message to both the Trump Administration and the Saudis to work much harder to avoid civilian casualties, expedite humanitarian relief, and push for a peaceful end to the war through a negotiated political settlement, Cardin said. Republicans control both chambers of Congress. A senior congressional aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the notification was received last Thursday. The decision to move ahead with deliveries was first reported by Bloomberg. The 2015 sale included more than 8,000 Laser Guided Bombs for the Royal Saudi Air Force. The package also includes more than 10,000 general purpose bombs, and more than 5,000 tail kits used to inexpensively convert dumb bombs into laser or GPS-guided weapons. Some of the weapons systems included in the sale were made by Raytheon Co and Boeing Co.  The arms deal announced in May was for $110 billion, with options running as high as $350 billion over 10 years. Tuesdays Senate vote, which would block about $500 million of that sale, including precision-guided munitions and other offensive weapons, coincides with Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and other officials in Washington.

The remarks were a blunt reminder of the gloom underscoring U.S. military assessments of the war between the U.S.-backed Afghan government and the Islamist militant group, classified by U.S. commanders as a stalemate despite almost 16 years of fighting. We are not winning in Afghanistan right now. And we will correct this as soon as possible, Mattis said in testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee. Mattis acknowledged that he believed the Taliban were surging at the moment, something he said he intended to address. Some U.S. officials questioned the benefit of sending more troops to Afghanistan because any politically palatable number would not be enough to turn the tide, much less create stability and security. To date, more than 2,300 Americans have been killed and more than 17,000 wounded since the war began in 2001.  The Afghan government was assessed by the U.S. military to control or influence just 59.7 percent of Afghanistans 407 districts as of Feb. 20, a nearly 11 percentage-point decrease from the same time in 2016, according to data released by the U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction. A truck bomb explosion in Kabul last month killed more than 150 people, making it the deadliest attack in the Afghan capital since the Taliban were ousted in 2001 by a NATO-led coalition after ruling the country for five years. On Saturday, three U.S. soldiers were killed when an Afghan soldier opened fire on them in eastern Afghanistan.  Reuters reported in late April that the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump was carrying out a review of Afghanistan, and conversations were revolving around sending between 3,000 and 5,000 U.S. and coalition troops there. Deliberations include giving more authority to forces on the ground and taking more aggressive action against Taliban fighters.  Senator John McCain, the chairman of the Senate committee, pressed Mattis on the deteriorating situation, saying the United States had an urgent need for a change in strategy, and an increase in resources if we are to turn the situation around.

The apps encrypt messages and automatically delete them after they are read, which could run afoul of laws on preserving government records, the senators wrote. While Republicans control both the Senate and the House of Representatives, Democrats in Congress can still request that inspectors general, neutral investigators who check up on various federal offices, look into specific matters.  They also asked the inspectors general if officials in the administration of Republican President Donald Trump are directing employees of government agencies to ignore requests for information from Democrats in Congress. Members of both parties objected after the administration said agencies do not have to honor requests made by senior Democrats on congressional committees. Democrats and public interest groups are worried that the Trump administration is hiding important information about possible wrongdoing and stonewalling potential critics. They are also worried about social media, where Trump has tweeted and then later deleted posts. The office of the Department of Justices inspector general, Michael Horowitz, who also chairs the council of federal inspectors general, declined to comment on the letter.

Inspectors general themselves often rely on archived emails and text messages in investigations. Since Trumps inauguration in January many Washington insiders have embraced messaging apps that promptly destroy chats, encrypt texts and phone calls, and leave no trace of communication on smartphones. Concerns about information security have grown in the wake of the hack of the Democratic partys emails, criticism of candidate Hillary Clintons use of a private server and laws that count communications from non-government accounts as federal records.

The White House did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the proposed legislation.  Trump, who has more than 32 million followers on Twitter for his 8-year-old personal @realDonaldTrump profile, is known for messages on the social media site that are sometimes riddled with spelling and grammar mistakes.  Trump famously sent a tweet at 12:06 a.m. ET (0406 GMT) on May 31 that said: Despite the constant negative press covfefe. The message remained on the internet for hours, spurring a wave of speculation about what Trump intended to say. The message was later deleted.  Trumps next communication that day at 6:09 a.m. ET (1009 GMT) made light of the tweet, saying: Who can figure out the true meaning of covfefe??? Enjoy! Spicer, asked at a news briefing at the time whether people should be concerned about the covfefe tweet, said, no and added, I think the president and a small group of people know exactly what he meant.

The Pentagon needs to give its decision makers and weapons buyers more accurate budget and cost information so they can make better decisions as they modernize weapons systems, the report said.  U.S. President Donald Trumps $4.1 trillion fiscal 2018 budget proposal included $603 billion in defense spending for the Department of Defense as well as nuclear weapons programs at the Department of Energy and other national defense priorities. The GAO report comes as U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis presented lawmakers in the House and Senate with a $33 billion wish list of unfunded military needs. The report said despite increased defense funding under Trump, efforts underway to rebuild readiness for portions of their military forces are at risk without more comprehensive planning efforts at the Pentagon.  The federal agency, which oversees government resources, also said the Defense Department could police global hot spots with less expensive and more numerous regular troops instead of U.S. special forces.  DOD has not taken steps to examine whether additional opportunities exist to reduce the high demand on these (special) forces by sharing some of their responsibilities with conventional forces, the report said.  U.S. President Donald Trumps fiscal 2018 budget proposal gave the military a modest boost to their budget, 3 percent more than what former President Barack Obama had sought in his long-term budget plan. The $574.5 billion for the Department of Defense would go to warfighting readiness and critical program requirements.  GAO said it has made approximately 3,100 recommendations to DOD since 2006. Of these about 1,037 have not been acted on, including 78 priority recommendations. The report released on Tuesday made no new recommendations.

[L1N1J41LS] The Iran bill is due come up for a vote as soon as this week. Besides the provision setting up a process for Congress to review changes in sanctions, the measure would put into law sanctions previously established via presidential executive order, including some on certain Russian energy projects and debt financing in some industries. It would impose new sanctions on Russians found to be guilty of human rights abuses, supplying weapons to Syrias government and conduct cyber attacks on behalf of Russias government, among others. The measure also would allow new sanctions on Russian mining, metals, shipping and railways. The legislation is backed by both Republicans and Democrats, and is expected to easily pass the Senate. It was introduced amid an intense focus in the U.S. capital on relations with Russia, and investigations by the Department of Justice and congressional committees of whether Russia sought to influence the 2016 U.S. elections to help elect Republican President Donald Trump, and whether Trump associates colluded with Moscow as it sought to influence the election.  To become law, the legislation would have to pass the House of Representatives and be signed into law by Trump.

These additional sanctions will ... send a powerful and bipartisan statement to Russia and any other country who might try to interfere in our elections that they will be punished, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement.

The situation in Afghanistan, which U.S. military officials acknowledge is in a stalemate almost 16 years since the war started, has deteriorated in recent months. A truck-bomb explosion in Kabul last month killed more than 150 people, making it the deadliest attack in the Afghan capital since the ouster of the Taliban in 2001. In some cases, Afghan security forces have been forced to abandon more scattered and rural bases, and the government can claim to control or influence only 57 percent of the country, according to U.S. military estimates earlier this year. We are taking a regional approach to this, Mattis told the House Armed Services Committee.  We will take that forward to the president for a decision very soon. Mattis said a request by General John Nicholson, the head of U.S. and international forces in Afghanistan, for additional troops would mostly be made up of troops who would train, advise and assist Afghan forces, potentially putting them with Afghan forces at the brigade level.  Its a fundamental change to how we bring our, what I would call our real superiority, in terms of air support, Mattis said.  At the same hearing, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joseph Dunford said he had gone to Mattis and Trump with some options that might be considered in order to help improve the security situation in Afghanistan. Reuters reported in late April that Trumps administration was carrying out a review of Afghanistan and conversations were revolving around sending between 3,000 and 5,000 U.S. and coalition troops there. Deliberations include giving more authorities to forces on the ground and taking more aggressive action against Taliban fighters.  Some U.S. officials questioned the benefit of sending more troops to Afghanistan because any politically palatable number would not be enough to turn the tide, much less create stability and security. To date, more than 2,300 Americans have been killed and over 17,000 wounded.  On Saturday, three U.S. soldiers were killed when an Afghan soldier opened fire on them in eastern Afghanistan.

Sessions will likely face tough questions at the open Senate Intelligence Committee hearing over his dealings with Russian officials during the campaign and whether he had a role in the firing of former FBI Director James Comey. Until a statement on Monday from committee Chairman Richard Burr, a Republican, it had been unclear whether Sessions would testify in an open or closed setting. Initially, Sessions expected to testify in a closed-door session, said two sources familiar with the attorney generals thinking. But he left the decision up to Burr, the sources said. A Justice Department spokeswoman said that Sessions requested the open setting because he believes it is important for the American people to hear the truth directly from him. Comey told the same panel last week that the FBI had information in mid-February on Sessions that would have made it problematic for the attorney general to continue leading a federal probe into Russian attempts to influence the presidential election. Sessions recused himself from that inquiry in March after media reports that he had been in two previously undisclosed meetings last year with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak. Tuesdays testimony, scheduled to start at 2:30 p.m. (1830 GMT), will be the first for Sessions in a congressional hearing since he became attorney general. During his nomination hearing in January, the former senator told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he had no contacts with Russian officials as part of the Trump campaign. Sessions is likely to be questioned over the truthfulness of his answers in January. A spokesman for the Justice Department said after media reports emerged in March of the meetings that Sessions had answered honestly because the encounters were part of his job as a senator and not as a surrogate of the Trump campaign.     Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, a member of both the Senate intelligence and judiciary committees, has said Sessions should answer questions about his January testimony.  Intelligence Committee members will also likely ask Sessions about a possible third undisclosed meeting with Kislyak that is now under investigation, according to media reports. Sessions, an early supporter of Trumps election campaign, will be the most senior government official to testify to the committee on the Russia issue, which has dogged the Republican presidents early months in office. Critics charged that by firing Comey on May 9, Trump was trying to hinder the FBIs Russia probe. The former FBI chief added fuel to that accusation with his testimony last week. Trump has denied he tried to interfere with the probe.       In his testimony, Comey said he had asked Sessions not to leave him alone with Trump following meetings where he said Trump had asked Comey for his loyalty. The attorney general may also face questions on that. Media reports last week said Sessions offered to resign because of tensions with Trump over his decision to recuse himself from the FBIs Russia probe. The allegations are being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller and several congressional panels, including the Senate Intelligence Committee.

The lavishing of praise and adulation contrasted with the storm enveloping the president as he struggles with myriad crises, including an investigation into possible ties between his election campaign and Russian meddling in the race.  For him, the meeting was a welcome rendering of what he feels are major accomplishments ignored by his detractors, even though major legislative achievements have eluded him thus far.

Weve been about as active as you can possibly be and at a just about record pace, he said. In just a very short time we are seeing amazing results. People are surprised. Its kicking in very fast.

The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  used narrow grounds to reject the Trump administrations bid to undo a Hawaii federal judges decision blocking the temporary ban. It said the Republican presidents March 6 order violated existing immigration law. But the three-judge panel - all Democratic appointees - did not address whether it was unconstitutional discrimination against Muslims. A second court, the Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, on May 25 upheld a Maryland judges ruling that also blocked Trumps 90-day ban on travelers from Libya, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.  The 4th Circuit had ruled that the ban, which replaced an earlier Jan. 27 one also blocked by the courts, drips with religious intolerance, animus and discrimination aimed at Muslims. The 9th Circuit largely left in place a nationwide injunction by Judge Derrick Watson that stopped parts of the order, which Trump said was urgently needed to prevent terrorism in the United States. That ruling came in a lawsuit challenging the order brought by the state of Hawaii, which stated the ban would harm its universities and tourism industry. Even before Mondays ruling, the case was on the fast track to the Supreme Court, where the administration on June 1 filed an emergency request seeking to reinstate the order and hear its appeal of the 4th Circuit ruling. The Supreme Court could act on the administrations request as soon as this week. Trump has been on the losing side in all four court rulings on the March order. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the administration is reviewing Mondays decision and expressed continued confidence that the order is fully lawful and ultimately will be upheld by the Supreme Court. I think we can all attest that these are very dangerous times and we need every available tool at our disposal to prevent terrorists from entering the United States and committing acts of bloodshed and violence, Spicer told a briefing. The 9th Circuit upheld the block on Trumps three-month travel ban for the six countries and four-month suspension of all refugee admissions. But the court pared back part of Watsons injunction in order to allow the government to conduct internal reviews on vetting procedures for these travelers. The administration said the travel ban was needed to allow time to implement stronger vetting measures, although it has already rolled out some new requirements not blocked by courts, including additional questions for visa applicants. Rather than focusing on Trump campaign statements as the Virginia-based court did, the 9th Circuit said the language in the executive order itself did not make a rational case for why a travel ban was needed. The order does not offer a sufficient justification to suspend the entry of more than 180 million people on the basis of nationality, the court wrote, referring the combined populations of the six countries.  Under immigration law, the administration was required to make findings that entry of the people in question would be detrimental to the United States but failed to do so, the court said. Stephen Vladeck, a professor at University of Texas School of Law, said the 9th Circuit provided an easier path for the Supreme Court to keep the travel ban on hold, because it avoided entirely the controversy over Trumps campaign statements.  It provides a very attractive way to leave the injunction in place without setting broader doctrinal rules about which they may have pause, Vladeck said. Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign called for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. Monday was the deadline for the bans challengers to respond to the administrations request that the order be allowed to go into effect. The American Civil Liberties Union, which represents people challenging the ban in the separate Maryland suit handled by the 4th Circuit, filed court papers urging the court not to take up the case, saying the order will become moot on Wednesday, 90 days from when Trump issued it. Lawyers for Hawaii called the order a thinly veiled Muslim ban. Trumps earlier Jan. 27 order also included Iraq among the countries targeted and a total ban on refugees from Syria. The March order was intended to overcome the legal issues posed by the original ban, but was blocked before it could go into effect on March 16. The suits by Hawaii and the Maryland challengers argued that the order violated federal immigration law and a section of the Constitutions First Amendment that prohibits the government from favoring or disfavoring any particular religion. Hawaiis court papers mentioned a series of Trump Twitter posts on June 5. Trump described the order as a watered down, politically correct version of his original one.

(Reuters) - A Montana Republican congressman-elect pleaded guilty on Monday to assaulting a reporter and was ordered to perform community service and receive anger management training. Greg Gianforte, a wealthy former technology executive who campaigned on his support for President Donald Trump, attacked a reporter on May 24, the day before he won a special election to fill Montanas lone seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. Gallatin County Judge Rick West sentenced Gianforte to 40 hours of community service and 20 hours of anger management classes. The judge in Bozeman, Montana, also handed down a six-month deferred jail sentence, allowing Gianforte to avoid time behind bars if he complies with the courts orders.    Ben Jacobs, a political correspondent for Britains Guardian newspaper, said Gianforte body-slammed him, breaking his eyeglasses, when the reporter posed a question about healthcare during a campaign event in Bozeman.  The altercation has been portrayed as a sign of the toxicity that has infused American politics. Critics of Trump say his strident criticism of the media has encouraged violence against journalists, while some of the presidents supporters say reporters in general are unfair in their coverage. This was not a proud moment, but Im ready to move on and we have a lot of work to do in Washington, Gianforte, who is expected to be sworn in later this month, said outside court. Last week Gianforte apologized to Jacobs in a letter, and he sent a $50,000 check to the Committee to Protect Journalists. In return, Jacobs pledged not to sue him. I am confident that he will be a strong advocate for a free press and the First Amendment, Jacobs said in court on Monday. And I even hope to be able to finally interview him once he has arrived on Capitol Hill. Gianforte apologized to Jacobs again in court and said he looked forward to meeting with him later. The judge left open the possibility that Gianforte, after completing his sentence, could have the misdemeanor assault charge formally dismissed, Gallatin County Prosecutor Marty Lambert said by phone. Gianforte initially sought to plead no contest, instead of guilty, but the prosecutor said he insisted on a guilty plea. This is the type of case where a defendant just needs to admit to the court what he did, to plead guilty, and he did that, Lambert said. Gianforte on May 25 defeated Democrat Rob Quist to fill the House seat vacated when Trump appointed Ryan Zinke as interior secretary.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Dozens of Iraqi Chaldean Catholics in Detroit, Michigan were among those targeted in immigration sweeps over the weekend, according to immigration attorneys and family members, some of whom feared they would be killed if deported to their home country where they have faced persecution.  Kurdish Iraqis were also picked up in Nashville, Tennessee in recent days, attorneys, activists and family members told Reuters.  The actions came as part of the Trump administrations push to increase immigration enforcement and make countries, which have resisted in the past, take back nationals ordered deported from the United States. As a result of recent negotiations between the U.S. and Iraq, Iraq has recently agreed to accept a number of Iraqi nationals subject to orders of removal, said Gillian Christensen, a spokeswoman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.      Christensen said the agency arrested individuals who had criminal convictions for violations ranging from homicide to drug charges and had been ordered removed by an immigration judge. She declined to give more details, citing the ongoing nature of the operation. An Iraqi official said Iraqi diplomatic and consular missions would coordinate with U.S. authorities to issue travel documents for the deportees when they can be proven to be Iraqi based on our records and investigation. The Iraqi official said around 100 people were arrested just in Detroit over the weekend. Reuters could not independently confirm all of the cases. The moves come after the U.S. government dropped Iraq from a list of countries targeted by a revised version of Trumps temporary travel ban issued in March.  The March 6 order said Iraq was taken off the list because the Iraqi government had taken steps to enhance travel documentation, information sharing, and the return of Iraqi nationals subject to final orders of removal. There are approximately 1,400 Iraqi nationals with final orders of removal currently in the United States, according to U.S. officials. Iraq had previously been considered one of 23 recalcitrant countries, along with China, Afghanistan, Iran, Somalia and others, that refused to cooperate with ICEs efforts to remove nationals from the United States, according to ICE. At least some of the people who were picked up came to the United States as children, got in trouble years ago and already served their sentences, according to immigration attorneys and local activists. They had been given an effective reprieve from deportation because Iraq would not take them back. I understand these are criminals, but they paid their dues, said Eman Jajonie-Daman, an immigration attorney in Detroit who had been receiving frantic phone calls from clients families over the weekend. But we cannot send them back to die.  Some of the weekend arrests took place in Michigans Macomb County, which Trump won by 53.6 percent in the 2016 Presidential race, backed by many in the Iraqi Christian community. The community is home to many refugees who have fled Iraq in the face of religious persecution, according to the Chaldean Community Foundation.  At least one family of Trump supporters has been affected by the recent enforcement actions. Nahrain Hamama said ICE agents came to her house on Sunday morning and arrested her 54-year-old husband Usama Hamama, a supermarket manager who goes by Sam. He has lived in the United States since childhood and has four U.S.-born children. During the election, all his U.S. citizen relatives were Trump supporters, Hamama said. He forgot his language, he doesnt speak Arabic anymore. We have no family there on both sides. Where would he go? What would he do? How would he live? Hamama said. She fears for his health and that he will be targeted by groups in Iraq because of his religion, made more visible because of a cross tattooed on his wrist.  Sam got in trouble with the law in his 20s, in what his wife called a road rage incident where he brandished a gun during a fight in traffic. He served time in prison and was ordered deported after being released. For the past seven years he has regularly checked in with immigration officials, his wife said. It is a shame that for one mistake, that he paid for legally, now he has to pay with his own life. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The 1.35 million acre (5,463 square kms) area, designated by former President Barack Obama during his final days in office and named for its iconic twin buttes, is the first of 27 national monuments to be reviewed by the Trump administration as part of a plan to increase development on federal lands. My job is to make sure that I ... reflect the concerns of Utah, and reflect the concerns of the taxpayers and the public who own the lands, and I think weve done that, Zinke told reporters in a teleconference about his interim recommendation sent to Trump on Saturday. Zinke toured Utah for four days before making the recommendation. His report said that the Antiquities Act, used by past presidents to declare monuments, should cover the smallest area compatible with protecting important sites.  Therefore... the Secretary of the Interior recommends that the existing boundary of the (Bears Ears) be modified to be consistent with the intent of the act. Rather than designating a vast monument, as Obama did, it would have been more appropriate to identify and separate the areas that have significant objects to be protected to meet the purposes of the Act, Zinkes report said. More study is necessary to determine how much smaller Bears Ears should be, Zinke said, and that decision will not be made until all of the 27 monuments are reviewed.  Jamie Williams, president of The Wilderness Society, said Zinkes recommendation was nothing less than an attack on the future of all American monuments, parks and public lands, and was against the wishes of the overwhelming majority of Americans.  A public comment period that closed in late May generated hundreds of thousands of comments, with the majority expressing hope that monuments like Bears Ears remain protected. Zinke also recommended that tribes be allowed to co-manage cultural areas within the resized monument - a nod to Native Americans who had lobbied for protections for the territory - and that Congress review conservation policies in the area. His recommendation to Trump set the tone for the administrations broader review, triggered by an executive order in April. Trump had argued that previous administrations abused their right to designate monuments under the Antiquities Act of 1906 and put millions of acres of land, mainly in western states, off limits to drilling, mining, logging and ranching without adequate input from locals. The review is likely to add fuel to a heated national debate over Washingtons role in Americas wildest spaces. Environmentalists and tribal groups support federal oversight, but many state political leaders, conservatives and industry groups say the lands should generate money for business, creating jobs, or yielding revenue for education and other public services. While the land encompassed by the Bears Ears monument is not believed to contain huge amounts of coal, oil or gas, several other monuments on Zinkes review list do - making the Bears Ears decision symbolically important to industry groups. Kathleen Sgamma, president of the Western Energy Alliance, representing oil and gas companies, said Zinkes approach was sensible. Its clear that Bears Ears was an overreach, and was much larger than necessary to protect cultural resources.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

President Donald Trump and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, both Republicans, suggested in their proposed budget last month to increase federal funding for charter schools, which are public schools that are run independently from local districts, typically by a corporation. We have a huge opportunity to score major funding increases for our movement, said National Alliance for Public Charter Schools President Nina Rees at an annual meeting. But if you dont speak up now, we may never have as good a chance to make a difference for our students. More than three million children across the country attend charter schools, Rees said. The budget also proposed increasing money for other school choice programs, primarily giving families vouchers to pay private school tuition. The overall education budget would be cut by $9 billion under the Trump administrations plan, which Congress must still approve. The two major teacher unions, the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers, have said the budget would slash public school funding to free up money for private initiatives. Democrats have supported charter schools in the past, but now are nervous about associating themselves with Trump policies, Rees said. Republicans have long wanted to pursue ideas different from the traditional state schools. Rees told the meeting that some Republicans could give charter schools a lower priority than other issues on their legislative agenda.  All of us need to understand that accepting the presidents support for charter schools doesnt tie us to his whole agenda, Rees said. Last week, DeVos faced hostile questions from a U.S. Senate committee about her voucher ideas, with her mostly responding that she was only exploring the possibility of a program. Past Republican proposals would provide vouchers via tax credits for parents. Supporters say vouchers could give children in neighborhoods with weak public schools the chance to receive a better education at local private institutions. Critics say vouchers are intended to boost private-sector profits with public money, and that the suggested subsidy amounts are too low to make tuition affordable for the poorest parents.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump suffered another legal setback on Monday as a second federal appeals court refused to revive his travel ban on people entering the United States from six Muslim-majority nations in a dispute headed to the U.S. Supreme Court. The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  used narrow grounds to reject the Trump administrations bid to undo a Hawaii federal judges decision blocking the temporary ban. It said the Republican presidents March 6 order violated existing immigration law. But the three-judge panel - all Democratic appointees - did not address whether it was unconstitutional discrimination against Muslims. A second court, the Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, on May 25 upheld a Maryland judges ruling that also blocked Trumps 90-day ban on travelers from Libya, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.  The 4th Circuit had ruled that the ban, which replaced an earlier Jan. 27 one also blocked by the courts, drips with religious intolerance, animus and discrimination aimed at Muslims. The 9th Circuit largely left in place a nationwide injunction by Judge Derrick Watson that stopped parts of the order, which Trump said was urgently needed to prevent terrorism in the United States. That ruling came in a lawsuit challenging the order brought by the state of Hawaii, which stated the ban would harm its universities and tourism industry. Even before Mondays ruling, the case was on the fast track to the Supreme Court, where the administration on June 1 filed an emergency request seeking to reinstate the order and hear its appeal of the 4th Circuit ruling. The Supreme Court could act on the administrations request as soon as this week. Trump has been on the losing side in all four court rulings on the March order. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the administration is reviewing Mondays decision and expressed continued confidence that the order is fully lawful and ultimately will be upheld by the Supreme Court. I think we can all attest that these are very dangerous times and we need every available tool at our disposal to prevent terrorists from entering the United States and committing acts of bloodshed and violence, Spicer told a briefing. The 9th Circuit upheld the block on Trumps three-month travel ban for the six countries and four-month suspension of all refugee admissions. But the court pared back part of Watsons injunction in order to allow the government to conduct internal reviews on vetting procedures for these travelers. The administration said the travel ban was needed to allow time to implement stronger vetting measures, although it has already rolled out some new requirements not blocked by courts, including additional questions for visa applicants. Rather than focusing on Trump campaign statements as the Virginia-based court did, the 9th Circuit said the language in the executive order itself did not make a rational case for why a travel ban was needed. The order does not offer a sufficient justification to suspend the entry of more than 180 million people on the basis of nationality, the court wrote, referring the combined populations of the six countries.  Under immigration law, the administration was required to make findings that entry of the people in question would be detrimental to the United States but failed to do so, the court said. Stephen Vladeck, a professor at University of Texas School of Law, said the 9th Circuit provided an easier path for the Supreme Court to keep the travel ban on hold, because it avoided entirely the controversy over Trumps campaign statements.  It provides a very attractive way to leave the injunction in place without setting broader doctrinal rules about which they may have pause, Vladeck said. Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign called for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. Monday was the deadline for the bans challengers to respond to the administrations request that the order be allowed to go into effect. The American Civil Liberties Union, which represents people challenging the ban in the separate Maryland suit handled by the 4th Circuit, filed court papers urging the court not to take up the case, saying the order will become moot on Wednesday, 90 days from when Trump issued it. Lawyers for Hawaii called the order a thinly veiled Muslim ban. Trumps earlier Jan. 27 order also included Iraq among the countries targeted and a total ban on refugees from Syria. The March order was intended to overcome the legal issues posed by the original ban, but was blocked before it could go into effect on March 16. The suits by Hawaii and the Maryland challengers argued that the order violated federal immigration law and a section of the Constitutions First Amendment that prohibits the government from favoring or disfavoring any particular religion. Hawaiis court papers mentioned a series of Trump Twitter posts on June 5. Trump described the order as a watered down, politically correct version of his original one.

An island-wide referendum on Sunday favored statehood in a 97 percent landslide, though voter turnout reached just 23 percent as opponents of Governor Ricardo Rossellos push to become a state boycotted the vote. The non-binding plebiscite is not expected to sway the U.S. Congress, which would have to agree to make Puerto Rico a state. Currently a U.S. territory, the island is struggling with $70 billion in debt and a 45 percent poverty rate, and is not viewed as a priority in Washington.   Rossello, who campaigned on a push for statehood, said in a telephone interview with Reuters that he will go to the U.S. capital this week to urge federal lawmakers to begin the process of admitting Puerto Rico into the union. We will make sure this becomes an issue, Rossello said. The vote comes at a critical time for Puerto Rico, whose hazy status - which dates to its 1898 acquisition by the United States from Spain - has contributed to its ongoing economic crisis. Last month, the island filed the biggest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. Its woes make statehood even more urgent, Rossello said. Statehood brings stability, allows us to have fewer rule-changes from Congress, provides resources to our people, he said.  Sundays referendum, which cost Puerto Rico between $5 million and $7 million, according to government estimates, was the islands fifth since 1967 - and the third in which pro-statehood sentiments triumphed, though none have moved Congress to act. If the U.S. is going to go to Venezuela and Cuba and Afghanistan and push democracy abroad, theyve got to do the same with their own territories, he said.  But Puerto Ricans are skeptical the islands status will change. This has all been a waste of time, said taxi driver Felix Salasarar, 54, adding that federal lawmakers will look at the voter turnout and say, wheres the will of the people?  Working against the governor may be a perception in Washington that Sundays vote was not fair.  The U.S. Department of Justice in April called on Rossello to change ballot language that initially did not give voters an option to remain a U.S. territory.  Rossello told Reuters he made that decision because the territory option - which Rossello equates to colonialism - already lost in a previous status referendum, in 2012, making this years vote a choice between statehood and independence.  The Justice department viewed the language as politically unfair to millions of Puerto Ricans who favor territory status, prompting Rossello to add the territory option. But the Justice department never reviewed or approved the new language. To be sure, Sundays results do not reflect the true nature of Puerto Ricans views on statehood, which are fairly evenly divided between those who favor it and those who do not, based upon historical election results. Statehooder Rossello, for example, won his own election with just 42 percent of the vote. But that, the governor said, is how democracy works: Everybody knows that those who go through the voting process have a louder voice than those who dont, he said. Carolina Santos, a single working mother struggling to make her mortgage payments, said bankrupt Puerto Rico has more important things to worry about than a status vote.

Payments to the presidents enterprises from foreign and domestic governments through his hospitality empire draw business away from Maryland and D.C. venues and put local governments under pressure to give Trump-owned businesses special treatment, according to the complaint.  Foreign and domestic government payments to Trumps businesses were the target of a similar lawsuit brought in January by plaintiffs including an ethics nonprofit group, and Democratic lawmakers have blasted them as potential corrupting influences on Trump. The Trump Organization has said it will donate profits from customers representing foreign governments to the U.S. Treasury but will not require the customers to identify themselves.  Every time the president has spoken about drawing a line between his presidency and his businesses, hes walked those promises back, said D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine said at a news conference on Monday. The case by Racine and Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh, both Democrats, has a better chance in court as the first government action over allegations that Trump, a Republican, violated the Constitutions so-called emoluments clauses, legal experts said.  Democratic attorneys general have taken a lead role in challenging Trump policies, successfully blocking executive orders restricting travel from some Muslim-majority countries.  The Maryland and D.C. attorneys general are seeking an order in U.S. District Court in Maryland preventing Trump from continuing to receive government payments beyond his salary.  White House press secretary Sean Spicer on Monday rejected the claim that Trumps business interests violated the Constitution and said partisan politics were behind the lawsuit. Trumps lawyers will likely move to dismiss the case, he said. The Justice Department declined to comment.  Trumps ownership in hundreds of businesses hurts Maryland and D.C. and violates emoluments clauses in the Constitution that bar the president from accepting gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval as well as from domestic governments under any circumstances, according to the  complaint.  While Trump turned over management of the umbrella Trump Organization in January to a trust controlled by his two elder sons, he still owns his businesses, including the Trump International Hotel in Washington, and can draw revenue from them at any time. The attorneys general argued they had standing to sue Trump because their citizens will be harmed if payments to Trump are used to influence his allocation of federal funds. They also said local hospitality companies, including state-owned facilities, are being harmed.  The Justice Department on Friday argued in the other lawsuit that the plaintiffs lacked legal standing to sue because they cannot allege enough specific harm caused by Trumps businesses.  The attorneys general have a better chance of establishing standing, legal scholars said, although they are divided over whether the AGs will ultimately succeed. Plaintiffs typically only have standing to file lawsuits under federal law if they can show they have been injured and a court ruling would remedy the harm.  Fordham Law School Professor Jed Shugerman said state governments special duty to protect their citizens means they face a lower bar to standing in federal court, and the AG lawsuit should proceed.  However, Derek Muller, a professor at Pepperdine University School of Law, said it was unclear that this harm could be remedied by a favorable ruling.  The government has also said Trump hotel revenue does not fit the definition of an improper payment under the Constitution. Payments to Trumps hotels do not qualify as a violation of the emoluments clause, which is intended to cover personal services performed by the president, the government said. If the Justice Department is correct, the emoluments clause has no meaning whatsoever, said Frosh, the Maryland official.  The president can stand over here with his president of the United States hat and hes not allowed to take payments. But he takes a step over here and puts on his businessman hat, they can funnel as much money to him as they want. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The high court, in a 8-0 ruling authored by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, found that a provision in federal law that defines how people born overseas can be eligible for U.S. citizenship violated the U.S. Constitutions equal protection guarantee.  The ruling, however, may not help the man who brought the case, New York resident Luis Morales-Santana, who was seeking to avoid deportation to the Dominican Republic after being convicted of several offenses. The law requires that unwed fathers who are American citizens spend at least five years living in the United States - a 2012 amendment reduced it from 10 years - before they can confer citizenship to a child born abroad, out of wedlock and to a partner who is not a U.S. citizen. For unwed U.S. mothers in the same situation, the requirement was only one year. In the ruling, the Supreme Court said that until Congress revises the law, both women and men will be covered by the five-year requirement. Ginsburg, known for her work on gender equality before she became a jurist, wrote for the court that in light of the Supreme Courts various rulings regarding the equal protection guarantee since 1971, having separate duration-of-residence requirements for unwed mothers and fathers who have accepted parental responsibility is stunningly anachronistic. The arguments made in defense of the law by former President Barack Obamas administration before he left office in January cannot withstand inspection under a Constitution that requires the government to respect the equal dignity and stature of its male and female citizens, Ginsburg wrote. Morales-Santanas deceased father was an American citizen, while his mother was not. His father failed to meet the laws five-year requirements by 20 days. His lawyer, Stephen Broome, said he is reviewing how the ruling affects his client. Morales-Santana, 54, was born in the Dominican Republican and has lived legally in the United States since 1975. He was convicted of several criminal offenses in 1995, including two counts of robbery and four counts of attempted murder. The U.S. government has sought to deport him since 2000. The high court split 4-4 on the same issue in 2011. In July 2015, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York sided with Morales-Santana and struck down the law at issue, saying it applied impermissible stereotyping in imposing a tougher burden on fathers. The U.S. Justice Department sought to defend the law and asked the high court to take the case. The case is one of several with immigration-related themes that are before the justices at a time when President Donald Trumps administration is pursing efforts to strengthen immigration enforcement.

A government website for the non-binding referendum, Puerto Ricos fifth such plebiscite since 1967, showed 97 percent supported statehood. Only 23 percent of the 2.2 million eligible voters participated in the vote. Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello campaigned for statehood as the best avenue to boost future growth for the island, which has $70 billion in debt, a 45 percent poverty rate, woefully underperforming schools and near-insolvent pension and health systems. From today going forward, the Federal government will no longer be able to ignore the voice of the majority of the American citizens in Puerto Rico, Rossello said in a statement. It would be highly contradictory for Washington to demand democracy in other parts of the world, and NOT respond to the legitimate right to self-determination that was exercised today in the American territory of Puerto Rico, he added. Puerto Ricos hazy political status, dating back to its 1898 acquisition by the United States from Spain, has contributed to the economic crisis that pushed it last month into the biggest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. I voted for statehood, Armando Abreu, a 74-year-old retiree, said after voting. Even if its still a long way off in the distance, its our only hope. Those in favor of statehood for the mainly Spanish-speaking Caribbean island hope the new status would put the territory on equal standing with the 50 U.S. states, giving them more access to federal funds and the right to vote for U.S. president. Under the current system, Puerto Ricos 3.5 million American citizens do not pay federal taxes, vote in presidential elections or receive proportionate federal funding on programs like the Medicaid health insurance system for the poor. The U.S. government oversees policy and financial areas such as infrastructure, defense and trade. Rossello will ask Congress to respect the result, but Puerto Rico is seen as a low priority in Washington.    The islands two main opposition parties boycotted the vote, which gave Puerto Ricans three options: becoming a U.S. state; remaining a territory; or becoming an independent nation, with or without some continuing political association with the United States. Puerto Ricos former governor, Rafael Hernandez Colon, said in a statement: A contrived plebiscite fabricated an artificial majority for statehood by disenfranchising hundreds of thousands of Commonwealth supporters. Rather than heading to the polls, some 500 Puerto Ricans marched on the streets of San Juan, waving Puerto Ricos flag and burning the American flag while chanting in support of independence.   This is a bogus plebiscite. Our future is independence. We need to be able to decide our own fate, said Liliana Laboy, one of the organizers of the protest. Boycotters were also angry about the costly referendum at a time when over 400 schools have closed and many Puerto Ricans are struggling to make ends meet. Schools where voting took place were in poor condition, with cracked paint and bare-bones playgrounds. Puerto Rico spent an estimated $8 million on the campaign and election process, according to a government spokesman. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The U.S. Commerce Departments regulations hit list recommendations follow more than three months of study and consultation with industry on ways to streamline regulations and ease burdens on manufacturing firms.  A Trump administration official with knowledge of the recommendations to be sent to the White House said the Environmental Protection Agencys complex permitting rules will be a key focus, echoing comments to Reuters by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross last month. The 171 public comments submitted by companies and industry groups offer a strong hint to priorities for Commerces streamlining efforts, with numerous industry groups and firms complaining that EPA air quality permit rules for new facilities are often redundant. The report will analyze the submissions and will identify a lot of problems and lay out ways to take responsible actions, said the official, who declined to be identified by name. The process has looked at many regulations finalized under Trumps predecessor, President Barack Obama. A common demand from industry was that the Trump administration should reject a planned tightening of ozone rules under the U.S. Clean Air Acts National Ambient Air Quality Standards, with several groups arguing this would expose them to increased permitting hurdles for new facilities, raising costs. 3M Co (MMM.N) said other permitting requirements under the Clean Air Act contained overlapping rules, redundant requirements, conflicts between rules and undue complexity. The National Association of Manufacturers said the EPAs review requirements for new sources of emissions such as factories can add $100,000 in costs for modeling air quality to a new facility and delay factory expansions by 18 months. It added that EPA should find ways to ease burdens for smaller projects and smaller firms. Also drawing complaints from construction groups and iron foundries is an incoming Occupational Safety and Health Administration rule reducing by 80 percent the amount of crystalline silica dust that can be inhaled. The dust, common on construction sites, can cause lung cancer, according to OSHA, but industry groups say reducing it to those levels will be prohibitively expensive. To meet these much lower levels, new engineering controls and other measures will become necessary within the roofing industry, said the National Roofing Contractors Association. Trump has already taken steps to roll back some not fully completed Obama-era environmental regulations such as restrictions on coal-fired power plants and a clean water rule greatly restricting runoff into small streams. But the Commerce list may target some rules already on the books.    We are at the outset of what we think will be a very intense deregulatory agenda from the Trump team, said Amit Narang, regulatory policy advocate at Public Citizen, a consumer watchdog group. We are concerned that they are looking to gut regulations that benefit workers and benefit consumers. Another OSHA rule that drew industry complaints is one that further reduces worker exposure to beryllium, another potential carcinogen, that became effective on May 20 after a decade-long rulemaking effort. Manufacturing groups including auto parts makers have also targeted labor rules that make it easier for unions to organize workers, expand the number of employees eligible for overtime and govern the reporting of workplace injuries. The range of industry complaints is vast. Mining giant Freeport-McMoRan (FCX.N) argued that planned EPA financial responsibility requirements for hard rock mining operations costing billions of dollars were based on inadequate study and will have disastrous consequences for the mining industry. Guitar maker Taylor Guitars said that permits needed from the Fish and Wildlife Service for mother-of-pearl used to decorate instruments was unnecessarily raising its costs. This declaration requirement does not seem to serve any conservation or other purpose. The shell is not a species that is protected under law, the company said.

No date has been set for the visit, which was agreed during Mays visit to Washington in January, but British media had reported it was planned for October. Mays hold on power has been significantly weakened since the results of a snap election last week cost her Conservative Party a parliamentary majority. In a bid to save her position, May has been trying to form a government with Northern Irelands Democratic Unionist Party, a small faction of social conservatives. British politics is going through an upheaval just a week before talks begin on Britains exit from the European Union, set for 2019.  Trumps public criticism this month of London Mayor Sadiq Khans response to an attack by Islamist militants in London was condemned in Britain.

In a letter seen by Reuters, Sessions told Senator Richard Shelby, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies, that the intelligence committee is the most appropriate place to address matters that came up during Comeys hearing on Thursday. The letter did not say whether Sessions planned to give public testimony or to appear before the panel behind closed doors. In light of reports regarding Mr. Comeys recent testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, it is important that I have an opportunity to address these matters in the appropriate forum, Sessions said in the letter. The committee is the most appropriate forum for such matters, as it has been conducting an investigation and has access to relevant, classified information, he added. The Senate panel is investigating allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. In March, Sessions removed himself from any probe into alleged Russian meddling in the elections, but maintained he did nothing wrong by failing to disclose that he met last year with Russias ambassador. In testimony to the Senate panel on Thursday, Comey accused President Donald Trump of firing him to try to undermine the FBIs investigation of possible collusion by people in Trumps campaign with Russias alleged efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election. Comeys appearance raised new questions about the attorney generals relationship with Russian officials and others with ties to President Vladimir Putin. One question is whether Sessions had any undisclosed meetings with Ambassador Sergei Kislyak or other Russians during the campaign or after Trumps inauguration. In the most eagerly anticipated U.S. congressional hearing in years, Comey told lawmakers the Trump administration had lied and defamed him and the Federal Bureau of Investigation after the president dismissed him on May 9.

Bernie Sanders on Saturday urged a summit of progressive activists who propelled his presidential candidacy to ramp up efforts to win elections and help remake a Democratic Party he deemed a failure. They won those seats by standing up to the ruling class, he said, referring to the British elections and citing wins by progressive U.S. candidates in several state and local races while writing off losses as evidence liberal progressives could still be competitive even in conservative states. But Sanders, who lost the Democratic nomination nearly a year ago to Hillary Clinton, showed little interest in a push by Draft Bernie activists who want him to start his own Peoples Party. Many activists blame establishment Democrats for losing to President Donald Trump by failing to embrace a more populist left-leaning agenda. Sanders headlined the three-day Peoples Summit in Chicago, attended by celebrity activists including actors Danny Glover and John Cusack, which brought together main progressive groups such as National Nurses United, Democratic Socialists of America and People for Bernie.  Many activists said they hoped to transform the momentum from recent protests such as Januarys Womens March in Washington into concrete plans to support a growing wave of grassroots candidates to secure electoral power. We could have 10,000 people marching, but if we dont have some means of translating that into winning political office and enacting a legislative progressive agenda, at the end of the day, what does it amount to? said Nick Brana, the former staffer for theSanders campaign leading the Draft Bernie group. With Trump mired in controversy over incidents such as the firing of former FBI Director James Comey, and Democrats having lost ground in statehouses and in Congress, RoseAnn Demoro, head of the nurses union, said the movement Sanders began was at a tipping point of broadening its support. Leaders with the Democratic Socialists of America said their membership has bloomed from 6,000 before the election to 22,000. Others warned that progressives dont have the fundraising firepower they need or that gains were still fledgling. Were closer but were not yet winning, said activist and writer Naomi Klein. Still, Sanders credited progressives with increasing public acceptance of proposals such as a $15 minimum wage, renegotiating trade policies and offering free college tuition. He got a standing ovation when he said the California Senate recently passed a single-payer health care plan. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Comey delivered scathing remarks about the president on Thursday at a congressional hearing and testified that Trump had asked him to drop a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe into former aide Michael Flynn and his alleged ties to Russia.  Trump said Comeys testimony also vindicated him from allegations that he colluded with Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. James Comey confirmed a lot of what I said. And some of the things that he said just werent true, Trump said at a news conference in the White House Rose Garden. Asked by a reporter if he had told Comey to drop the investigation into former national security adviser Flynn, Trump said, I didnt say that. The reporter then asked, So he lied about that? Well, I didnt say that. I mean, I will tell you, I didnt say that, Trump replied. And there would be nothing wrong if I did say it according to everybody that Ive read today, but I did not say that, he said. In his testimony, Comey also said Trump asked him in January to pledge loyalty to the president, an unusual request that would put in doubt the independence of the FBI.  I hardly know the man. Im not going to say I want you to pledge allegiance. Who would do that? Trump said. Comeys testimony was the most eagerly anticipated U.S. congressional hearing in years. The issue of the Trump election campaigns relationship with Russia has dogged Trumps first months in office and distracted from his policy goals such as overhauling the U.S. healthcare system and making tax cuts. Comey, who was fired by Trump in May, did not make any major disclosures about any links between Trump or his associates and alleged Russian meddling. Asked on Friday if he would be willing to go under oath to give his version of his interactions with Comey, Trump replied, 100 percent. He said he would be happy to speak to special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating allegations that Russia interfered with the election and colluded with Trumps campaign. I would be glad to tell him exactly what I just told you, Trump told a reporter. Several congressional committees, as well as the FBI and Mueller, are looking into the Russia allegations. On Friday, the leaders of the House of Representatives intelligence committees investigation said they had asked Comey for his notes and memos about his discussions with Trump, and asked the White House to produce any recordings or memos of conversations between Trump and Comey. Trump declined to answer questions from reporters about whether recordings existed. Ill tell you about that maybe sometime in the very near future, he said. Trumps offer to testify under oath would pit his word against Comeys before federal investigators. If either Trumps testimony or memos written by Comey about his conversations with the president turn out to be untrue, either man could be charged with lying to federal investigators. A U.S. president is given a wide array of immunities from criminal prosecutions. The U.S. Constitution does not directly address whether the president can be criminally prosecuted, and the area is the subject of legal debate. A president can be charged after leaving office. Trump wrote earlier on Friday on Twitter that the former FBI head had vindicated him by telling the Senate Intelligence Committee that the president had not been personally under investigation in the Russia probe. With a single tweet, Trump also castigated Comey as a leaker for giving an account of his conversation with the president to a law professor who shared it with a news outlet.

The lawsuit, filed in January, said Trump violates the Constitutions emoluments clause, which bars him from accepting gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval, by maintaining ownership over his business empire despite ceding day-to-day control to his sons. In a filing in Manhattan federal court on Friday, the justice department argued that the plaintiffs in the case - an ethics non-profit, restaurant group and hotel events booker - do not have legal standing to sue.  The government also said payments to Trumps hotels do not qualify as a violation of the emoluments clause, which is intended to cover personal services performed by the president. Plaintiffs broad-brush claims effectively assert that the Constitution disqualifies the president from serving as president while maintaining ownership interests in his commercial businesses, the department said in its court filing. A spokesman for ethics watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, one of the plaintiffs, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The lawsuit said businesses such as hotel bookers are injured when foreign governments try to curry favor with Trump by favoring his own enterprises. It said this had even occurred since Trump took office, when China granted him trademark rights after he pledged to honor the One China policy of his White House predecessors. The DOJ on Friday said any payments to Trumps restaurants in New York, a city with 24,000 restaurants, have not caused enough specific harm to plaintiffs to give them the ability to sue.

Trumps aides are nearing completion of a review of relations with Cuba and are expected to send recommendations to his national security team and then to the president in coming days, a U.S. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Plans are in the works for Trump to roll out his new approach on June 16 in a speech in Miami, where he is expected to claim fulfillment of a campaign promise and justify it, at least in part, on human rights grounds, the sources said. But they cautioned that a delay in the announcement is still possible if it takes longer for Trump to make a final decision. While specific changes have not yet been finalized, the sources say Trump is likely to unveil a partial rather than complete rollback of Obamas actions, which included restoration of relations and reopening of embassies after a diplomatic breakthrough in 2014 with Americas former Cold War foe. Among the options under consideration are banning U.S. companies from doing business with Cuban enterprises tied to the military  which controls a large part of the communist-ruled islands economy  and tightening rules on Americans traveling there, according to people familiar with the discussions. With the Cuba review approaching its final stages, both sides of the issue have recently stepped up lobbying to sway Trumps decision. In the letter sent to Trump on Friday, seven of his fellow Republicans warned that rescinding Obamas policies would incentivize Cuba to once again become dependent on countries like Russia and China. Senior officials at the National Security Council met on Friday to begin finalizing a list of recommendations, the sources said. Trumps changes are expected to stop short of breaking diplomatic relations restored two years ago after more than five decades of hostility, administration officials say. But divisions remain within the Trump administration over how far to go, especially given that rapprochement with Cuba has created opportunities for American companies. Some aides have argued that Trump, a former real estate magnate who won the presidency promising to unleash U.S. business and create jobs, would have a hard time defending any moves that close off the Cuban market. But other advisers have contended that it is important to make good on a promise to Cuban-Americans whose support they considered significant winning Florida in the 2016 election. Miami is home to the largest Cuban-American community. The U.S. airline and travel industries have made clear they do not want to see reinstatement of Cuba restrictions. Imposing new regulations on travel to and trade with Cuba would be bad politics, bad policy, and bad for U.S. business, said James Williams, president of Engage Cuba, a Washingon-based lobbying group. But Trump has come under heavy pressure from Cuban-American lawmakers, including Senator Marco Rubio and Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, to roll back Obamas rapprochement. Rubio, a member of the Senate foreign relations and intelligence committees, is seen by Trumps aides as an important figure to cultivate at a time when the members of his administration are under investigation over contacts with Russian officials. Rubio and other Obama critics have argued that he gave away too much to Cuban President Raul Castro for too little in return, especially on human rights. Trumps aides are considering ways to make future engagement moves contingent on the Cuban governments improvement on human rights and political freedoms, U.S. officials say. Such an emphasis would contrast sharply with Trumps approach in other parts of the world where he has insisted the United States would stop lecturing other countries on the issue. Trump - friend of Putin, Sissi, Salman, Duterte, Erdogan - will cite human rights to justify hurting the Cuban people, tweeted Ben Rhodes, Obamas former deputy national security adviser and an architect of his Cuba dtente policy. Trump threatened shortly after his election in November to terminate Obamas approach unless Cuba made significant concessions, something it is unlikely to do.

Forbes reported that based on filings from the Eric Trump Foundation and other charities, more than $1.2 million has no documented recipients past the Trump Organization. Eric Soufer, a spokesman for New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, said in an email that his office was looking into issues raised by the Forbes story. Soufer did not immediately respond to a later request for details about the examination. The Democratic attorney generals office already is investigating allegations of self-dealing at the Donald J. Trump Foundation, the Republican presidents charity. Trump, a New York real estate developer, said in December that he would dissolve the Donald J. Trump Foundation, but Schneidermans office has said it could not be wound down while the investigation was ongoing. Forbes also reported that although donors to the Eric Trump Foundation were told all its money was going to help St. Jude Childrens Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, fight pediatric cancer, more than $500,000 was re-donated to other charities. Many of those charities were connected to Trump family members or interests, including at least four groups that subsequently paid to hold golf tournaments at Trump courses, Forbes said.

(Reuters) - Florida Governor Rick Scott signed amended stand your ground legislation on Friday, making it easier for defendants in the state to successfully claim they were protecting themselves when they commit violence. Previously, the law required defendants to prove that they were using force in self-defense. The new law shifts the burden of proof in pretrial hearings to prosecutors, rather than defendants, to prove whether force was used lawfully. Supporters of stand your ground laws, including the National Rifle Association, the powerful U.S. gun lobby, see the legislation as bolstering civilians right to protect themselves.  Floridas self-defense law was initially passed in 2005, and inspired similar laws in other states. It removes the legal responsibility to retreat from a dangerous situation and allows the use of deadly force when a person feels greatly threatened. Opponents have said the amended law will embolden gun owners to shoot first, citing the 2012 death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin in the Orlando area, which spurred national protests and the Black Lives Matter movement.  The neighborhood watchman who killed him, George Zimmerman, was acquitted of murder after the states stand your ground law was included in jury instructions.

The lawsuit was filed on Thursday in the Cole County Circuit Court in Jefferson City by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Advancement Project on behalf of the NAACP and the League of Women Voters of Missouri.     Missouri has failed to provide necessary mandated funding for voter education, free voter IDs and birth certificates and training for poll workers since the new voting law came into effect on June 1, the ACLU said in the lawsuit. Voters were promised that this law was not about disenfranchising the most vulnerable in our state, said Tony Rothert, legal director of the ACLU of Missouri. The states lack of funding and implementation of this law tells another story.  Maura Browning, a spokeswoman for Missouri Secretary of State John Ashcroft, who is named in the lawsuit, declined to comment on Friday.

The law had been misrepresented by the media, Ashcroft said, according to the newspaper.

It is beyond unacceptable that the state of Missouri has launched a photo ID requirement while not even being prepared, trained, or properly funded for it, Denise Lieberman of the non-profit Advancement Project said in a statement.   Missouris highly restrictive photo ID law was designed to make it harder for people to vote.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - In September 2014, Gilberto Velasquez, a 38-year-old house painter from El Salvador, received life-changing news: The U.S. government had decided to shelve its deportation action against him.  The move was part of a policy change initiated by then-President Barack Obama in 2011 to pull back from deporting immigrants who had formed deep ties in the United States and whom the government considered no threat to public safety. Instead, the administration would prioritize illegal immigrants who had committed serious crimes.  Last month, things changed again for the painter, who has lived in the United States illegally since 2005 and has a U.S.-born child. He received news that the government wanted to put his deportation case back on the court calendar, citing another shift in priorities, this time by President Donald Trump.  The Trump administration has moved to reopen the cases of hundreds of illegal immigrants who, like Velasquez, had been given a reprieve from deportation, according to government data and court documents reviewed by Reuters and interviews with immigration lawyers.  Trump signaled in January that he planned to dramatically widen the net of illegal immigrants targeted for deportation, but his administration has not publicized its efforts to reopen immigration cases.  It represents one of the first concrete examples of the crackdown promised by Trump and is likely to stir fears among tens of thousands of illegal immigrants who thought they were safe from deportation.  While cases were reopened during the Obama administration as well, it was generally only if an immigrant had committed a serious crime, immigration attorneys say. The Trump administration has sharply increased the number of cases it is asking the courts to reopen, and its targets appear to include at least some people who have not committed any crimes since their cases were closed.  Between March 1 and May 31, prosecutors moved to reopen 1,329 cases, according to a Reuters' analysis of data from the Executive Office of Immigration Review, or EOIR. The Obama administration filed 430 similar motions during the same period in 2016.  Jennifer Elzea, a spokeswoman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, confirmed the agency was now filing motions with immigration courts to reopen cases where illegal immigrants had since been arrested for or convicted of a crime.  It is not possible to tell from the EOIR data how many of the cases the Trump administration is seeking to reopen involve immigrants who committed crimes after their cases were closed.  Attorneys interviewed by Reuters say indeed some of the cases being reopened are because immigrants were arrested for serious crimes, but they are also seeing cases involving people who havent committed crimes or who were cited for minor violations, like traffic tickets.  This is a sea change, said attorney David Leopold, former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Before, if someone did something after the case was closed out that showed that person was a threat, then it would be reopened. Now they are opening cases just because they want to deport people.  Elzea said the agency reviews cases, to see if the basis for prosecutorial discretion is still appropriate.  After Obama announced his shift toward targeting illegal immigrants who had committed serious crimes, prosecutors embraced their new discretion to close cases.  Between January 2012 and Trumps inauguration on Jan. 20, the government shelved some 81,000 cases, according to Reuters data analysis. These so-called administrative closures did not extend full legal status to those whose cases were closed, but they did remove the threat of imminent deportation.  Trump signed an executive order overturning the Obama-era policy on Jan. 25. Under the new guidelines, while criminals remain the highest priority for deportation, anyone in the country illegally is a potential target.  In cases reviewed by Reuters, the administration explicitly cited Trump's executive order in 30 separate motions as a reason to put the immigrant back on the court docket. (For a link to an excerpted document: tmsnrt.rs/2sI6aby)  Since immigration cases arent generally public, Reuters was able to review only cases made available by attorneys.  In the 32 reopened cases examined by Reuters:  22 involved immigrants who, according to their attorneys, had not been in trouble with the law since their cases were closed.  Two of the cases involved serious crimes committed after their cases were closed: domestic violence and driving under the influence.  At least six of the cases involved minor infractions, including speeding after having unpaid traffic tickets, or driving without a valid license, according to the attorneys.  In Velasquezs case, for example, he was cited for driving without a license in Tennessee, where illegal immigrants cannot get licenses, he said.  I respect the law and just dedicate myself to my work, he said. I dont understand why this is happening.  Motions to reopen closed cases have been filed in 32 states, with the highest numbers in California, Florida and Virginia, according to Reuters review of EOIR data. The bulk of the examples reviewed by Reuters were two dozen motions sent over the span of a couple days by the New Orleans ICE office.  Sally Joyner, an immigration attorney in Memphis, Tennessee said one of her Central American clients, who crossed the border with her children in 2013, was allowed to stay in the United States after the government filed a motion to close her case in December 2015.  Since crossing the border, the woman has not been arrested or had trouble with law enforcement, said Joyner, who asked that her clients name not be used because of the pending legal action.  Nevertheless, on March 29, ICE filed a two-page motion to reopen the case against the woman and her children. When Joyner queried ICE, an official said the agency had been notified that her client had a criminal history in El Salvador, according to documents seen by Reuters.  The woman had been arrested for selling pumpkin seeds as an unauthorized street vendor. Government documents show U.S. authorities knew about the arrest before her case was closed.  Dana Marks, president of the National Association of Immigration Judges, said that revisiting previously closed matters will add to a record backlog of 580,000 pending immigration cases.  If we have to go back and review all of those decisions that were already made, it clearly generates more work, she said. Its a judicial do-over.

Government tax receipts for early 2017 were 3 percent lower than expected, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said in a May 5 report. Receipts are coming in somewhat lower, and I think thats in expectation of that were going to do tax reform, Mnuchin told a news conference in Ottawa, the Canadian capital, where he met with Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau. Ive been consistent in (saying) we hope Congress deals with the debt limit as soon as possible, but in any event, were not concerned, he added. The weaker tax revenues have forced the Treasury to borrow more money than expected to cover the federal budget deficit, which is putting the government on track to hit its legal debt limit sooner than it forecast, experts say. Mnuchin wants lawmakers to raise Washingtons borrowing limit before they break for a long recess in August. Asked what would happen if Congress did not act before then, he replied: We will be fine if they (Congress) dont do it beforehand. ... We have plans and back-up plans for funding the government. Pressed as to what he had in mind, Mnuchin said: They are Treasury secretary superpowers. President Donald Trump has made tax reform one of his biggest priorities. He has proposed cutting the corporate income tax to 15 percent, down from the current top corporate rate of 35 percent, though because of loopholes few multinational companies pay that rate. Nothing is higher on my priority list than getting tax reform done this year. ... It is critical for economic growth, Mnuchin said. Some Canadian politicians and business leaders are concerned that if Trump cuts corporate taxes, it could make companies north of the border less competitive. As the U.S. moves forward with their plans, well make sure we understand them well to ensure our tax system stays appropriate, said Morneau, who gave no further details. Morneau said he and Mnuchin also spoke about lumber and trade. Canada softwood lumber exports have emerged as a trade irritant ahead of talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement.

Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa, in a more than 2,100-word letter to the White House, asked Trump to rescind unprecedented guidance that told executive agencies they do not have to honor requests for information from lawmakers in the minority party, currently the Democrats. This week in hearings all over Capitol Hill members of both parties have criticized the information block. Democrats have posited that the Trump administration is trying to hide mistakes, problems or wrongdoing from them. Grassley, who has served in the Senate since 1981, called the guidance nonsense and described it as a bureaucratic effort by the Office of Legal Counsel to insulate the executive branch from scrutiny by the elected representatives of the American people.  The Judiciary Committee has jurisdiction over the Justice Department and its Office of Legal Counsel, which published the guidance last month. Grassley said it goes against the U.S. Constitution by misrepresenting how Congress functions and trying to tell the legislative branch how to do its job. It also impedes Democratic lawmakers ability to check up on the president, a responsibility also laid out in the constitution, Grassley wrote in a letter replete with footnotes and case citations. I know from experience that a partisan response to oversight only discourages bipartisanship, decreases transparency, and diminishes the crucial role of the American peoples elected representatives, he wrote.Oversight brings transparency, and transparency brings accountability. The Justice Department declined to comment on Grassleys letter or the guidance. The White House did not return a request for comment. The Office of Legal Counsel has not explained the impetus for publishing the opinion. The guidance did not single out Democrats by name. Instead, it addressed information requests to executive agencies from the highest-ranking lawmaker from the minority party sitting on congressional committees, called ranking members. The Republicans hold the majority in both the Senate and U.S. House of Representatives and therefore chair all the committees, with Democrats as ranking members.  The opinion said that agencies only have to respond to  information requests from committee chairs. Ranking member requests do not trigger any obligation to accommodate congressional needs and are not legally enforceable through a subpoena or contempt proceedings, it said.

The conservative bloc, which has enough members to stymie legislation in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, will play a key role in efforts to agree on a 2018 fiscal plan that could determine whether President Donald Trump and Congress can deliver the biggest tax reform since the Reagan era. The caucus has already called on Republican leaders to secure a tax reform deal by keeping Congress in session through August, when lawmakers are due to take a lengthy summer break.   We need to get tax reform done sooner than later, and by that we should have a real proposal that we start debating before we leave at the end of July, Representative Chairman Mark Meadows, chairman of the Freedom Caucus, told a Heritage Foundation forum. Meadows recommended that Republican leaders acknowledge that there is no consensus on the controversial border adjustment tax proposal favored by House Speaker Paul Ryan to move the tax debate forward.  A border adjustment tax on imports has been promoted as a way both to attack the U.S. trade deficit and generate revenues that would help avoid paying for tax cuts by expanding the national deficit. Trump, however, did not include a border adjustment tax in his proposed budget. Representative Jim Jordan, Freedom Caucus co-founder, said tax reform could have trouble moving forward because House Republicans are having trouble agreeing on a budget with reconciliation instructions needed to allow Republicans to bypass Democrats in passing a tax overhaul. If you dont get a budget agreement, you cant get reconciliation. If you dont have reconciliation, you cant get tax reform, Jordan told the forum. He suggested that Freedom Caucus members could agree to higher budget spending levels if reconciliation instructions included welfare reforms intended to save $400 billion in spending over a decade.  We think that is the key to unlocking this road block that were in. I dont see any other way out of it to get a budget agreement, Jordan said. Meanwhile, Meadows voiced support for allowing U.S. corporations to repatriate an estimated $2.6 trillion in cash held overseas at a reduced 8 percent tax rate. Meadows said the caucus does not plan to support a proposal that would allow full expensing for corporations, a policy backed by House Republican leaders. The policy, which would allow companies to write off capital investments immediately, would be too expensive without the border adjustment tax and revenue-raising proposals that caucus members oppose.

Wade, a 1973 Supreme Court decision protecting a womans right to abortion. For that reason, he signed the bill into law, said the spokesman, Jonathan Starkey, noting that the law takes effect immediately. Trump, a Republican whose election was backed by anti-abortion groups, has promised to appoint justices to the nations top court who would overturn Roe v.

Abortion rights advocates on Friday cheered the Delaware law, which  codifies at the state level provisions of Roe v. Wade. We applaud Governor Carney for sending a strong message that state policymakers will protect womens access to critical reproductive health services in the face of threats at the federal level, said Amanda Allen, senior state legislative counsel at the Center for Reproductive Rights. Elizabeth Nash, an analyst at the Guttmacher Institute, which tracks abortion policy, said the law makes a statement that women are valued citizens in Delaware.

In March, President Donald Trump ordered a review of U.S. vehicle fuel-efficiency standards from 2022-2025 put in place by the Obama administration, saying they were too tough on the auto industry. The push to weaken the rules by the Trump administration comes as automakers are worried that consumers shift to larger vehicles and low gas prices will make it expensive or impossible to meet the regulations. They also fear a prolonged fight with states over the rules could make revising their product plans difficult. Democratic state officials have been increasingly aggressive in challenging Trump administration regulatory rollback efforts. In light of the critical public health and environmental benefits the standards will deliver, if EPA acts to weaken or delay the current standards for model years 2022-25, like California, we intend to vigorously pursue appropriate legal remedies to block such action, the state attorneys wrote in a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency including Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Iowa, Washington State, Oregon and Rhode Island. An EPA spokesman said Friday the agency is reviewing the letter. Automakers including General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co and Toyota Motor Corp say the Obama administration did not conduct a proper review to ensure those rules are feasible. Automakers have met with Trump administration officials in recent months and hope to reach a deal with California and other states on vehicle fuel efficiency standards. Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group, said automakers urge everyone to avoid pre-judging the results of the ongoing review. A process is now under way again for a thoughtful and coordinated analysis, California has opposed weakening the rules, threatened to pursue tougher standards unilaterally and could mount a legal challenge.     The White House plans to hold negotiations with car companies, California and potentially other states. A deal would remove uncertainty for automakers, who need years of lead time to engineer future models and want uniform rules across all 50 states. The Obama administrations rules, negotiated with automakers in 2011, were aimed at doubling average fleet-wide fuel efficiency to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. Under the 2011 deal, the 2022-2025 model year rules had to be finalized by April 2018. The Obama administration completed a review of the 2022-2025 rules days before leaving office. Without a deal, automakers could be forced to meet one set of standards in California and a dozen states that have adopted its rules and other rules in the rest of the country. In 2011, Obama said the rules would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles, but cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years.

Under pressure from business groups and rank-and-file Republicans, Trump officials and congressional leaders still need to decide how much to slash tax rates and if the package should increase the federal budget deficit, administration and congressional sources said. The future of a border adjustment tax, or BAT, proposal from House of Representatives Republicans, meant to boost exports and discourage imports, could also be decided within the next two to three weeks, the administration official said. President Donald Trump has pledged to make a tax overhaul a priority. But after 20 weeks in power and numerous distractions, he has yet to offer a tax bill to Congress. Expectations for legislation have slipped repeatedly, from spring to summer and now after the U.S. Labor Day holiday.   Still, stocks are up since Trumps November election win and companies and wealthy Americans are positioning themselves to realize more income in 2018, betting lower taxes are coming. The head of the House Freedom Caucus, a bloc of three-dozen conservatives capable of stalling legislation, on Friday called on Republicans to acknowledge a lack of consensus on the BAT and produce a tax proposal by the end of July. Trump and fellow Republicans pledged in the election campaign last year to tackle in 2017 the biggest tax overhaul since the Reagan era. But that agenda has been slowed by infighting over dismantling Obamacare and probes of possible ties between Trumps campaign and alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. The Business Roundtable, a powerful lobbying group that represents chief executives, wrote to Trump and congressional leaders this week calling for a shift from listening to action on tax reform. The administration official, who asked not to be named, said there is broad agreement among participants in the talks on the need to cut taxes, simplify the code, eliminate tax breaks, end taxation of U.S. corporate overseas profits and repatriate an estimated $2.6 trillion in corporate profits held overseas.  But key details remain open to question. More meetings are expected among U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, White House economic adviser Gary Cohn, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Paul Ryan, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch and their staff, the official said. After their third meeting on Tuesday, officials had not decided whether to adopt full expensing for corporations, the administration official said. The policy would allow companies to write off the cost of capital investments such as equipment immediately and plow the money back into their businesses.  The official said the aim of the talks is to agree on a framework by mid-year and release legislation soon after lawmakers long August recess. A key decision awaits the House Republicans export-boosting BAT, intended to help pay for reforms while dissuading companies from moving assets, profits and jobs abroad. The BAT, which would tax imports but exempt export revenues from taxation, has run afoul of many Republicans and drawn criticism from the administration. Officials in Congress and the administration are examining options to the BAT that could reduce erosion of the federal tax base, including rules and a minimum corporate tax. Decisions on BAT, revenue neutrality and expensing will help decide if Congress can cut the corporate income tax to 15 percent, as Trump seeks, or 20-25 percent as envisioned by the House Republicans tax plan.

After announcing a deal this week that would dramatically cut the amount of refined sugar that Mexico ships to the United States, officials from the two countries are working with their industries on final language that would govern its operation. At issue is a new right of first refusal granted to Mexico to supply all U.S. sugar needs not met by domestic suppliers or other foreign quota holders. A coalition of American sugar cane and beet farmers and a major refiner want a more explicit guarantee that the U.S. Department of Agriculture, not Mexican producers, will dictate what type of sugar fills that gap. They are worried that a flood of refined sugar will pour in, rather than the raw sugar needed to keep U.S. mills running. The final sticking point stands in the way of resolving a years-long dispute over Mexican access to the highly regulated U.S. sugar market, which is protected by a complex web of subsidies and rationed quotas for foreign producers.  The sugar industry is known for its sway in Washington. But its point of view on Mexican imports is not shared by sugar users such as confectioners and soda makers.  The Trump administration wants to clear away the sugar dispute and a lumber trade row with Canada before starting full-scale negotiations to revise the North American Free Trade Agreement. An industry rarely objects to a government-negotiated  settlement of its anti-dumping case, and U.S. sugar producers could do little to stop the Commerce Department from implementing a final deal after a two-week comment period, said Seattle-based trade lawyer William Perry, who previously worked at Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission. While the industry could ask the International Trade Commission to overturn the settlement that suspends anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duty orders issued in 2014, chances for success look slim. The panel in 2015 rejected a challenge by two sugar refiners to the previous U.S.-Mexico pact. Petitioners are never entirely happy with suspension agreements like this, Perry said. They would rather have anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders with rates high enough to shut out imports. A Commerce spokesman said that Ross hoped the U.S. sugar industry would ultimately endorse the final agreement. Gary Hufbauer, a trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the administration was probably willing to compromise on some industry-specific concerns to help reach its larger NAFTA goals of reducing U.S. trade deficits. The U.S. sugar industry must probably present evidence of new Mexican dumping before going back to Commerce for more changes to the deal, said Daniel Pearson, a senior fellow of the libertarian Cato Institute and former International Trade Commission chairman. They would do well to take this agreement and run with it and see how it works, Pearson said, noting that it raises prices and keeps U.S. refiners well-supplied with raw sugar. Mexico made major concessions to maintain its access to the lucrative U.S. market, agreeing to ship no less than 70 percent of its quota volume as raw sugar to U.S. refineries. It gave ground on nearly all of the U.S. producers demands.  American Sugar Alliance spokesman Phillip Hayes said the final hurdle should be easy to address by making clear that the USDA, not Mexico, can dictate the type and purity level of any additional imports. But Juan Cortina, head of Mexicos main sugar trade group,  said there was no problem with the language because any additional needs would filled with raw sugar, as Mexican producers would have to keep higher inventories of that grade.

Under the U.S. proposal, Washington would have to pay $1.99 billion compared with $2.25 billion for the current year. While Trump has described U.S. funding for the United Nations as peanuts compared to its important work, he complains its share of the peacekeeping bill, currently 28.5 percent, is unfair. In his 2018 budget proposal he requested Congress approve only $1.2 billion for U.N. peacekeeping.  This is $1 billion less than the U.S. peacekeeping bill for the 12 months to June 30, 2017, when the total peacekeeping budget was $7.9 billion. Washington currently owes $417 million for peacekeeping, U.N. officials said. Ultimately the U.S. Congress sets the federal government budget and will decide how much money is made available for U.N. peacekeeping. Republicans, who control both houses, and Democrats have said they do not support drastic cuts proposed by Trump. Under the U.S. proposal to the U.N. budget committee, the largest cuts would be made to some of the most expensive operations in Democratic Republic of Congo, Mali and Sudans Darfur, according to the document seen by Reuters. The 193 U.N. member states are working to negotiate a compromise by the end of the month between the U.S. proposal, at the low end of the scale, and the highest suggestion of $7.72 billion by the African Group, according to the document. Trump also wants to enforce a 25 percent cap on the U.S. contribution to U.N. peacekeeping. The U.N. General Assembly is due to negotiate next year new levels of contributions by countries for 2019, 2020 and 2021. The United States also pays 22 percent of the $5.4 billion U.N. core budget. Guterres has pledged to make U.N. peacekeeping more efficient but has noted that the current budget to fund it is less than one half of 1 percent of global military spending.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Friday pledged new efforts to speed approvals for highways and other projects as part of his proposal for a $1 trillion boost to fix aging U.S. infrastructure. At the U.S. Transportation Department, Trump said his goal was to solve one of the biggest obstacles to creating this new and desperately-needed infrastructure  and that is the painfully slow, costly and time-consuming process for getting permits and approvals to build. Trump said the White House is moving ahead with massive permit reform and setting up a new council to help project managers navigate bureaucratic hurdles. This Council will also improve transparency by creating a new online dashboard allowing everyone to easily track major projects through every stage of the approval process, Trump said. He said the council will make sure that any federal agency that consistently delays projects by missing deadlines will face tough, new penalties.We will hold the bureaucracy accountable. The White House is also creating a new office in the Council of Environmental Quality to root out inefficiency, clarify lines of authority, and streamline federal, state and local procedures so that communities can modernize their aging infrastructure without fear of outdated federal rules getting in the way. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said the department is asking for public input on other changes it can make to speed approvals. Trump said it took four years to build the Golden Gate Bridge and five years to build the Hoover Dam  but today it can take 10 years just to get the approvals and permits needed to build a major infrastructure project. The Republican president, who was a New York-based real state developer before taking office, has repeatedly decried the process of winning approval for highway permitting. It includes 16 different approvals involving 10 different federal agencies being governed by 26 different statutes, Trump said. He spoke in front of two huge charts detailing the hurdles to build highways and held up a massive report that he said was needed before a Maryland highway was built. How can a country prosper under such restraints? Trump asked. Why should we continue to accept what is so clearly unacceptable? I was not elected to continue a failed system  I was elected to change it. The administration proposes $200 billion in government funding over 10 years as part of a goal of getting $1 trillion in public and private infrastructure spending. Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer has said the budget cuts $206 billion in infrastructure spending across several Cabinet departments, however, including $96 billion in planned highway trust fund spending.

President Donald Trumps ordinarily red-hot Twitter handle, @realDonaldTrump, was dormant during the three-hour hearing of the Senate Intelligence Committee, although another Trump helped carry the mantle. Donald Trump Jr., the presidents eldest son, live tweeted throughout Comeys testimony, taking the ex-FBI director to task for his version of what the president told him. Twitter had a field day with other moments of Comeys testimony, including his revelation that he broke a date with his wife in order to have dinner with Trump and his use of the exclamation Lordy. Comeys disclosure that the person who leaked his memos of meeting with Trump was a Columbia Law School professor led to a stampede on the schools website, causing it to crash. Here are some highlights of what excited Twitter during the testimony. Trump Jr. took issue with Comeys comments about whether the president was ordering him to drop the investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Knowing my father for 39 years when he orders or tells you to do something there is no ambiguity, you will know exactly what he means, he tweeted.  (here) Hoping and telling are two very different things, you would think that a guy like Comey would know that, he concluded, adding the hashtag #givemeabreak. (here) With his fathers Twitter handle silent, @DonaldJTrumpJr became the 10th most mentioned Twitter handle in the Comey conversation, according to social media analysis firm Brandwatch. One remark in particular from Comey got the Twittersphere buzzing. Lordy, I hope there are tapes, he told the committee regarding whether Trump had recorded their conversation. Lordy quickly became the focus of numerous memes, animated graphics and calls for T-shirts. Even the Merriam-Webster dictionary got into the act, tweeting out the definition of Lordy as a word used to express surprise or strength of feeling.  (here) Twitter said Comeys Lordy remark was among the top three most tweeted moments during the testimony. Social media also poked fun when Comey revealed a presidential intrusion into his domestic life. I had to call my wife and break a date with her, Comey said. I was supposed to take her out to dinner that night.  Moral of the #Comey testimony: Dont cancel a date with your wife, said CBS-Chicago reporter Jeremy Ross on Twitter.

It said that Russian authorities could also complicate life for Moscows Anglo-American school by altering its legal status.

Gianforte will appear in court in Bozeman on Monday and is scheduled to be sentenced the same day, after he enters his plea, Gallatin County Attorney Marty Lambert said by phone. The altercation has been portrayed as an illustration of the new toxicity of American politics. Critics of President Donald Trump say his strident criticism of the media has encouraged violence against journalists, while his supporters say many reporters are overly aggressive and disrespectful.   Under Montana law, a conviction for misdemeanor assault carries a maximum sentence of six months in jail. Lambert declined to say if his office would recommend jail time. An attorney for Gianforte declined comment. Gianforte, a technology executive, pledged in a letter on Wednesday to donate $50,000 to the Committee to Protect Journalists and apologized to reporter Ben Jacobs, who accused Gianforte of assaulting him on May 24. Gianforte won Montanas lone seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in a special election the next day. Jacobs, a political correspondent for the U.S. edition of The Guardian newspaper, said Gianforte body-slammed him, breaking his eyeglasses, when the reporter posed a question about healthcare during a campaign event in Bozeman.  Gianforte was heard shouting: Get the hell out of here and Im sick and tired of you guys in an audio recording of the incident played repeatedly on cable news television. Gianfortes campaign initially suggested Jacobs instigated the incident by barging into the candidates office and shoving a recording device in his face as he was preparing for a TV interview. But in a letter of apology to Jacobs issued on Wednesday, Gianforte said his physical response to your legitimate question was unprofessional, unacceptable and unlawful. In return for Gianfortes apology and his charitable donation, Jacobs agreed not to bring civil action against the congressman-elect. Jacobs, at Gianfortes request, also sent an email to Lambert, saying he would not object to Gianforte pleading no contest to misdemeanor assault, according to a release of liability document signed by Jacobs. Lambert said his office could still insist that Gianforte plead guilty instead of pleading no contest. In either event, the plea would trigger Gianfortes sentencing. Lambert previously said additional, more serious criminal charges could be brought in the case. But he said on Thursday that after reviewing the evidence and discussing the matter with Jacobs, the prosecutor decided the misdemeanor charge was appropriate. Gianforte defeated Democrat Rob Quist to fill the House seat vacated when Trump appointed Ryan Zinke as interior secretary. He is expected to be sworn in later this month.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former FBI Director James Comey accused President Donald Trump on Thursday of firing him to try to undermine the agencys investigation of possible collusion by Trumps campaign with Russias alleged efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election. In the most eagerly anticipated U.S. congressional hearing in years, Comey told lawmakers the Trump administration had lied and defamed him and the Federal Bureau of Investigation after the president dismissed him on May 9.  During more than two hours of testimony, Comey told the Senate Intelligence Committee he believed Trump had directed him in February to drop an FBI probe into the Republican presidents former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, as part of the broader Russia investigation. Comey would not say whether he thought the president sought to obstruct justice, but added it would be up to special counsel Robert Mueller, who is now investigating the Russia allegations, to sort that out. I dont think its for me to say whether the conversation I had with the president was an effort to obstruct. I took it as a very disturbing thing, very concerning, Comey testified. Sitting alone at a small table facing a bank of senators who fired question after question, Comey gave short, deliberative answers. He painted a picture of an overbearing president he did not trust and who pressured him to stop the FBI probe of Flynn. Trump critics say any efforts by the president to hinder an FBI probe could amount to obstruction of justice. Such an offense potentially could lead to Trump being impeached, although his fellow Republicans who control Congress have shown little appetite for such a move. In a speech to supporters across town, Trump vowed to fight on. Were under siege ... but we will come out bigger and better and stronger than ever, he said. Comey did not make any major disclosures about any links between Trump or his associates and Russia, an issue that has dogged the presidents first months in office and distracted from his policy goals such as overhauling the U.S. healthcare system and making tax cuts. Russia has denied such interference. The White House has denied any collusion with Moscow. Nevertheless, the Russia matter likely will continue to overshadow Trumps presidency, especially as the FBI probe has ensnared not only Flynn but Trumps son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has had to recuse himself from the investigation. Comeys testimony drew renewed attention to Sessions and his relationship with Russias ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kislyak.  After Trump fired Comey, the administration gave differing reasons for his dismissal. Trump later contradicted his own staff and acknowledged on May 11 he fired Comey because of the Russia matter. Asked why he thought Trump fired him, Comey said he did not know for sure. He added: Again, I take the presidents words. I know I was fired because of something about the way I was conducting the Russia investigation was in some way putting pressure on him, in some way irritating him, and he decided to fire me because of that. Comey said repeatedly there were details he could not discuss in a public session, making clear he had sensitive information he could disclose only in a closed session with the senators. Comey said Trumps administration had defamed him in comments made after his firing by saying the FBI was in disarray and that the workforce had lost confidence in its leader. Those were lies, plain and simple, Comey said. His accusations could further mire Trumps administration in legal difficulties. Mueller and several congressional committees are investigating what U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded was an effort by Russia to help Trump win the election. The Russian investigation is going to go on and its not going to stop and the president should have known that, committee member Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein told MSNBC. Trumps personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, said Comeys testimony proved the president was not under any investigation and there was no evidence a single vote was changed as a result of Russian interference in last years election. Kasowitz denied Trump ever told Comey he needed and expected his loyalty, as Comey said. NBC News reported on Thursday that Kushner was expected to meet with staff members of the Senate Intelligence Committee in mid-June.   Comey said he felt he needed to get his account of his conversations with Trump in the public sphere in the hope it might prompt the appointment of a special counsel, which later occurred. Comey said he gave copies of his memo memorializing his talks with Trump to people outside the Justice Department and asked a friend to share its contents with a journalist. Columbia Law School professor Daniel Richman confirmed to Reuters he was the friend to whom Comey was referring. Kasowitz said that we will leave it to the appropriate authorities to determine whether Comeys leak should be investigated. Legal experts questioned Kasowitzs contention that Trumps private encounters with Comey should be considered privileged communications.  Comey said he did not know if there were tapes of his conversations with Trump, but that if so, they should be released. Lordy, I hope there are tapes, Comey said. Republicans on the committee questioned Comey intently but did not attack his integrity or try to treat him roughly, as a witness making accusations against a sitting Republican president might expect. Comey testified he kept notes after meeting with Trump because I was honestly concerned that he might lie about the nature of our meeting, and so I thought it really important to document. From Capitol Hill to San Franciscos Castro district, Comeys appearance attracted television watch parties beckoning politics buffs to taverns, restaurants and living rooms to view an event some likened to the Super Bowl of Washington. U.S. stocks closed slightly higher as the market reacted little to Comeys testimony, viewing his testimony alone as unlikely to mark the end of Trumps presidency.  Comey said Trump did not attempt to get him to drop the overall Russia investigation, just the part of if that related to Flynn, whom the president fired in February for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the extent of his conversations last year with Kislyak. Republican Senator Marco Rubio asked Comey whether he perceived the presidents request to let the Flynn matter go as an order given Trumps position as president, the setting and the circumstances surrounding the conversation.   Yes, Comey replied.     Laura Donohue, a Georgetown University Law Center professor, said if Trump fired Comey to change the course of the Russia investigation, that would constitute obstruction of justice. Both the conversation between Trump and Comey about Flynn and the firing itself were obstructive acts, she said. He wanted to scuttle the investigation - it is hard to see it any other way, she said.  Regarding Sessions, Comey said he did not discuss Trumps pressure to drop the probe into Flynn with the attorney general because the FBI leadership team believed Sessions would later recuse himself from the Russia probe. We were also aware of facts that I cant discuss in an open setting that would make his continued engagement in a Russia-related investigation problematic, Comey said, without giving more details. The Justice Department later issued a statement saying that Sessions recused himself from the Russia probe only because he had been part of Trumps campaign. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said he did not believe Trump had committed a crime even if his personal style was often brash, adding: Ill just say it, if being crude, rude and a bull in a china shop was a crime, Trump would get the death penalty.

The conversations included one in which Comey said he believed Trump had pressured him in February to drop a probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn as part of the broader Russia investigation. Comey said he had asked a close friend who was a Columbia Law School professor to get his story out after Trump fired him as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation on May 9. Daniel Richman, a professor of criminal law at Columbia, confirmed to Reuters he was the person referred to in Comeys testimony. Richman, who is listed as an adviser to Comey in his official biography on the schools website, did not respond to further requests for comments. During his time in office, Trump has raged against the press and its use of anonymous sources.  Following Comeys testimony, Trumps personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz sharply criticized Comey for leaking what he called privileged communications between the president and the then-FBI director. He tried to link Comey with others in the government who he said had selectively and illegally leaked classified information to undermine the administration and suggested that Comey might have broken the law. It would be up to the appropriate authorities to determine whether the leak should be investigated, Kasowitz said. Comey could not be reached for immediate comment.  Some legal experts said Comeys actions did not run afoul of the law. Faiza Patel, co-director of public policy group Brennan Center for Justice, noted that Comey testified that he was careful to avoid putting classified information in memos memorializing his conversations with Trump. Other experts said Kasowitzs claim that Comey leaked privileged information was off the mark, citing the fact that Trump previously had disclosed details about his interactions with Comey. To leak his memo, Comey chose someone who has publicly defended him in the past, including his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clintons emails. A 1984 graduate of Yale Law School, Richman clerked for the U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. He served as chief appellate attorney in the U.S. Attorneys Office in Manhattan from 1987 to 1992, when Comey was also a prosecutor in that office. Richman went on to join the faculty of Fordham University School of Law and moved to Columbia in 2007. He has also served as a consultant to the U.S. Justice and Treasury departments on criminal matters and on advisory committees to former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and New York state Governor Eliot Spitzer.

But former FBI Director James Comeys remarks to a packed hearing of the Senate Intelligence Committee left the Republican president far from unscathed. Comey recounted in vivid detail conversations with Trump that he viewed as an effort to undermine an investigation of possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. He also said Trumps comments after firing him on May 9 that the FBI was in disarray and that its members had lost confidence in Comey were lies, plain and simple. Still, Comey handed Trump and his supporters some fresh ammunition when he confirmed he had told the president the investigation was not focused on him personally. Even Senator Marco Rubio, who was among a number of Republicans who battled Trump for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, seemed to be advocating for him at times during the hearing. Rubio asked Comey why he did not directly tell Trump that he thought the president was making inappropriate requests of him. Comey replied that he did not know. I was a bit stunned, and didnt have the presence of mind, he said. A Republican close to Trump said the president felt very good about Comeys testimony, particularly since it bore out his earlier statement that the former FBI director had told him he was not under investigation. But the cloud from the Russia probe still hangs heavily over Trumps White House.  Comeys firing set the stage for the appointment of a special counsel, Robert Mueller, who has taken over the investigation. Congressional probes, including one by the Senate intelligence panel, are ongoing. Russia has denied interference in last years presidential campaign. The White House has denied any collusion with Moscow. But Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat who sits on the intelligence committee, said the matter was nowhere near over. Its a big investigation, and these are facts. ... You have to dig for, and do a lot of analysis. Several Democrats said Trumps conversations with Comey seemed to build a case of obstruction of justice. The lawyers are going to dig into obstruction of justice, Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat on the intelligence panel, said after the hearing. I believe the evidence just keeps piling up that there has been a very real presidential abuse of power. But Paul Ryan, the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, said Trumps interactions with Comey may have reflected his lack of political experience rather than an effort  to pressure the FBI director. Ryan said Trump may not have been steeped enough in the FBIs independence from the White House. Hes new in government, and so therefore I think hes learning as he goes, he told reporters. Im not saying its an acceptable excuse. Its just my observation. Trump could face even more problems over the coming months if the stream of details leaking out about the Russia investigation continues to grab the spotlight at a time when the White House wants to focus on priorities such as rolling back the Obamacare healthcare law and overhauling the tax code. It distracts the administration and gives Republicans in the House and the Senate, many of whom have not been Trump supporters from the beginning, a reason to keep their distance and not get behind him, said Andy Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, which conducts political polling. Its going to be a long summer, Smith said. Trumps core supporters are hunkering down for a fight. Great America Alliance, one pro-Trump group, spent $400,000 this week running ads attacking Comey, said Eric Beach, who runs the group. The ad lambasted Comey as just another D.C. insider and included images of militant attacks abroad to suggest Comey had not been focused enough on protecting Americans. But the investigation has contributed to a steady erosion of Trumps political capital. According to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll taken from June 1 to 5, even before the Comey testimony - 38 percent of Americans said they approved of Trump, versus 58 percent who disapproved.  I think the situation is getting much more serious for Mr. Trump, said Jon Bond, a political science professor at Texas A&M University. The Mueller investigation is going on.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Throughout the drama of his U.S. Senate testimony on Thursday, James Comey sat ramrod-straight, his mouth set, all business.  It was the posture of a longtime law-enforcement official and former FBI director, someone used to keeping matters close to the vest.  But even the steady, crisp rhythm of his answers could not hide what lay beneath the surface: Comeys dismissal by President Donald Trump last month wounded and angered him.  Beyond testifying to conversations he said he had with Trump concerning the federal probe into ties between Trumps campaign and Russian officials, Comey time and again told the Senate committee before him and viewers across the country he not only has a harsh opinion of the presidents purported conduct, but also of his character.  Just minutes into his testimony, Comey said the president and his aides had chosen to defame him by spreading lies about his job performance, attempting to shred a reputation carefully built during 20 years of government service. Those were lies, plain and simple, and I am so sorry that the FBI workforce had to hear them and that the American people were told them, he said.  Later, Comey testified he began documenting his conversations with the president because of what he called the nature of the person. I was honestly concerned he might lie about the nature of our meeting, Comey said.  Trump, uncharacteristically, stayed silent during Comeys testimony, despite earlier suggestions from White House aides that he might take to Twitter to respond. He never did, ceding the stage, for the moment, to his nemesis.  He left rebuttals to his son, Donald Trump, Jr., who defended Trump on Twitter, and to his outside lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, who denied the president had ever pressured Comey to drop the FBIs probe into Trumps former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. In response to questions from senators, Comey repeatedly cast Trump as a boss or patron trying to secure his loyalty, something that Comey said made him uneasy.  At one point, Comey was asked why his version of events should be believed over the presidents.  Ive tried to be open, fair, transparent and accurate, he said, encouraging senators to examine the two mens consistency track record, demeanor, record over time, that sort of thing. Referring to a Trump comment on social media about the possible existence of tapes that could provide proof of their conversations, Comey said he was so rankled he decided to hand memos of his interactions with the president to a close friend to leak to the media.  Ive seen the tweet about the tapes, Comey said. Lordy, I hope there are tapes.  At the White house, in keeping with Trumps silence, his aides played down the days events. Its a regular Thursday at the White House, Sarah Sanders, the deputy press secretary, told reporters,  as televisions in the West Wing blasted Comeys testimony.  Trump watched at least part of the hearing with his outside legal team, in a dining room at the White House, but Sanders said she did not know if he had seen much of it. Sanders took umbrage when asked if, as Comey had suggested, the president had lied.  I can definitively say the president is not a liar. I think its frankly insulting that question would be asked, she said. After Comeys testimony, Trump delivered a brief speech to a friendly audience at a conference of religious leaders in Washington where he did not mention the controversy. Throughout the hotel ballroom where the event was staged, attendees expressed support for the Republican Trump and distaste for Democrats and the news media. I feel hes doing a wonderful job for our country, said Donna Hubers of Baltimore, who was checking her phone for Comey updates.  There were some lighter, and literary, moments in Comeys testimony.  He recalled at one point that he had to give up a dinner date with his wife because Trump asked to meet him at the White House. That was one of the meetings that Trump allegedly used to pressure Comey to drop the investigation into Flynn. In retrospect, I love spending time with my wife, and I wish I would have been there that night, he said on Thursday, drawing laughs from the senators. Comey also reached into English history to boost his portrayal of Trump. He was asked by Senator Angus King, an independent, whether he took the presidents references to the Flynn probe in the Oval Office as a directive to drop the matter.  Comey replied with a quotation attributed to King Henry II of England, who was at odds with Thomas Becket, the archbishop of Canterbury.  Yes. It rings in my ear as, well, Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest? I was just going to quote that, Senator King said. And the next day, he (Becket) was killed.

House passage of the CHOICE Act is the farthest Republicans have gotten so far in undoing regulations they say hurt small banks and make the government responsible for bailing out big financial institutions should they fail. Republican President Donald Trump is pushing for deregulation across the federal government. Next week the Treasury Department is expected to release the first in a series of reports on lightening financial rules and re-interpreting Dodd-Frank provisions.  Lawmakers in the near future could also approve smaller bits of legislation to undo specific measures in Dodd-Frank, one of the biggest achievements of former President Barack Obama, a Democrat. Earlier on Thursday, Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, a Republican, said he would hold several hearings in coming months with the goal of ultimately passing a meaningful and bipartisan reform package. On a day when the national spotlight was on the Senate testimony of former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey, the fight over repealing Dodd-Frank consumed the House. The bill was approved along party lines by a vote of 233-to-186 after four hours of often-loud debate. The most powerful Democrat in the chamber, Californias Nancy Pelosi, described the legislation as dastardly. The argument even spilled over to a House committee hearing on the budget of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. There, Democratic Representative Rosa DeLauro demanded that acting CFTC chair J. Christopher Giancarlo, a Republican, provide three examples in writing to prove his statement that overregulation was hurting the economy. Authored by Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling, a Republican, the CHOICE Act allows banks to choose between complying with Dodd-Frank or holding onto more capital. While the act was meant to address bankers concerns, many in the banking sector do not support it because they consider the required capital level too high. Also, the American Bankers Association expressed disappointment that the bill had retained Dodd-Frank limits on debit card fees. The act restructures the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, created to guard against fraud in lending. It eliminates the Volcker rule that limits trading activities by banks. Also, the government would no longer be able to designate non-bank institutions as systemically important, which triggers increased oversight. The Congressional Budget Office, a non-partisan evaluator of legislation, estimates the bill would save the federal government $24 billion over a decade, mostly by lifting the governments authority to step in and unwind failing institutions. Republicans described the act as a jobs-creator, saying Dodd-Franks numerous requirements made it impossible for community banks to lend to small businesses. They said changing the independent CFPB would make the agency more accountable to lawmakers. Democrats said the legislation would bring about another economic catastrophe by eliminating vital checks on the financial system. They said the CFPB changes, including eliminating its complaints database, would make it easier for firms to take advantage of consumers along the lines of the housing crisis, where millions were trapped in mortgages they could not afford. The Senate is not expected to take up the bill in its entirety, even though it has Trumps backing. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a leading Democrat, initially conceived of the CFPB and was Obamas first choice to lead it. She is expected to rally opposition in the form of a filibuster against changes to the agency. Still, Crapo lauded the bills passage in the House as a significant and thoughtful effort, a sign he may include some of its provisions in a future bill.  The CHOICE Act makes a positive move away from government micromanagement, and returns to basic principles of safety and soundness and market-driven principles, he said in a statement.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - Former FBI Director James Comey testified before the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee on June 8 about Russian involvement in the 2016 presidential election. President Donald Trumps abrupt firing of Comey on May 9 renewed attention to allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the election to benefit Trump. It also raised questions about the motivations behind Comeys dismissal. The following describes what is publicly known and not known about U.S. investigations into meddling and possible collusion between Russia and members of the Trump campaign: How did the investigations begin? Former President Barack Obama ordered U.S. intelligence agencies to assess whether Russia tried to intervene in the  election after a cyber attack on the Democratic National Committee in July 2016 and the publication of thousands of hacked personal emails from Hillary Clintons campaign manager in the month before the Nov. 8 election. Obama told intelligence officials to deliver a report on possible foreign interference before he left the White House in January 2017. What did the intelligence agencies find?  The Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency concluded in a report declassified in January that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a campaign not just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system but to affect the outcome. The agencies said Putin and the Russian government had a clear preference for Trump to win the White House. Putins  associates hacked information, paid social media trolls and backed efforts by Russian government agencies and state-funded media to sway public opinion, the agencies said.  The report stopped short of assessing whether Russia succeeded in swaying the election result. Putin and other Russian officials have repeatedly denied interfering in the U.S. election. How many U.S. investigations are there into Russian election meddling? Comey told the House Intelligence Committee on March 20 that the FBI was investigating Moscows role in the election, including possible collusion with Trumps campaign. The Justice Department announced on May 17 that it had appointed Robert Mueller, a former FBI director, as special counsel to lead an independent Russia probe. Mueller would, if the evidence merits, work in tandem with the FBI to handle any related criminal prosecutions. In addition, there are multiple committees in the Senate and House of Representatives investigating various aspects of Russian election meddling. What has Trump said about Russias role in the election? He has not taken a clear public position. At a July 2016 news conference, Trump addressed an FBI probe into Clintons use of a private email system when she was secretary of state and emails that had possibly been deleted by saying: I will tell you this, Russia: if youre listening, I hope youre able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. He subsequently dismissed reports, including from U.S. intelligence officials, that Russia had attempted to intervene in the election on his behalf.    The first time Trump said he accepted the findings of the intelligence agencies was at a Jan. 11 news conference ahead of his inauguration. As far as hacking, I think it was Russia, Trump said, although he added: It could have been others also. Trump said in May that China may have hacked the emails of Democratic officials to meddle with the election, offering no evidence and countering the view of intelligence officials. Trump has made clear on multiple occasions he believes the Russia investigations have run their course and should be closed. The Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end? he wrote on Twitter on May 8. On May 30, Trump tweeted: Russian officials must be laughing at the U.S. & how a lame excuse for why the Dems lost the election has taken over the Fake News. Did the FBI probe continue after Comeys dismissal? There is no evidence that the FBI ended or paused its investigation after Comeys departure. Andrew McCabe, who is leading the agency as acting director, promised the Senate Intelligence Committee that Comeys firing would not affect the investigation and that he will notify the committee of any attempt to delay or derail it.  Trump on June 6 chose former U.S. Justice Department official Christopher Wray, who represented New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in the so-called Bridgegate scandal, to be the next FBI director. Wray will need Senate confirmation. Why was Comey fired? The White House cited a May 9 letter to Trump from Attorney General Jeff Sessions that attached a memo from Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, on Restoring Confidence in the FBI that recommended Comeys dismissal. Rosensteins memo said Comey erred in July 2016 by announcing the FBI had been examining Clintons use of a private email server and that the case should be closed without prosecution. Rosensteins view was that Comeys decision to make a public statement broke with longstanding FBI precedent and should have been handled by the then-U.S. attorney general, Loretta Lynch. Trump called Comey a showboat and grandstander in an interview with NBC News on May 11, saying that he would have fired Comey regardless of Rosensteins recommendation. Was Comeys firing related to the FBIs Russia probe? Comey told the Senate Intelligence Committee he believes his dismissal was directly related to the FBIs Russia probe. I know I was fired because of something about the way I was conducting the Russia investigation, was in some way putting pressure on him, in some way irritating him, and he decided to fire me because of that, Comey said in his June 8 testimony. Trump asked Comey to end the agencys investigation of Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser, and also to make some sort of public statement that he was not personally under investigation in order to clear the cloud hanging over his presidency, according Comeys testimony. Comey said he found it concerning that Trump would ask him to drop the agencys probe of Flynn and declined to state publicly that Trump himself was not under investigation, in part because it would create a duty to correct if that changed. I need loyalty, I expect loyalty, Trump told Comey at a Jan. 27 dinner, according to Comey. Less than a week before he was fired, Comey told a congressional panel that it made him mildly nauseous that he may have affected the outcome of the election by publicly re-opening and then re-closing the Clinton email probe days before the election. In an unorthodox move, Great America Alliance, an offshoot of a pro-Trump super PAC devoted to promoting the White House agenda, developed a television ad called Showboat to air as Comey testified. The ad claims Comey was consumed with election meddling at the expense of fighting terrorism. Has there been any fallout for Trump associates over contacts with Russia before, during or after the election campaign? Flynn was fired in February. The White House said he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about the contacts he had with Russias ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kislyak, before Trump took office. On May 9, federal prosecutors issued grand jury subpoenas seeking business records from people who worked with Flynn when he was a private citizen. On May 10, the Senate Intelligence Committee issued the first subpoena in its Russia investigation, demanding documents from Flynn. He provided the first batch on June 6. Sessions had to recuse himself from involvement in Russia-related probes at the Justice Department because he had not told Congress of his own contacts with Kislyak in 2016. Rosenstein is handling matters related to Russia and it is he who appointed Mueller as special counsel. Is Trump himself under investigation?  In the short letter Trump sent to Comey dismissing him from the FBI, he thanked Comey for informing him on three separate occasions that he was not under investigation. Comey has confirmed that Trump was not personally under investigation at any point before his dismissal from the FBI. Trumps personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, said Comeys Senate testimony proved the president was not under investigation. Kasowitz denied Trump ever told Comey he needed and expected his loyalty.

Kobach, a Republican who has become a national leader in pushing for aggressive measures against undocumented immigrants and strengthening voter identification laws, touted his tough on immigration record at an announcement event for next years race.  Strong borders and respect for rule of law are essential to our country and to our state, Kobach said.  Kansas is the sanctuary state of the Midwest. We are the only state in the five state area that has done nothing to discourage illegal immigration.   Measures would include ending sanctuary policies in Kansas counties, cutting public benefits and welfare to undocumented people, ending in-state tuition for undocumented students at state universities and insuring that state and local law enforcement cooperate with federal immigration authorities, he said.  As secretary of state, Kobach was a strong proponent of tightening Kansas voter identification statutes since he was elected in 2010, making the state a symbol for mostly Republican Party supporters who said the rules were meant to prevent voter fraud.  Opponents, mostly Democrats, said they discriminate against minorities and Kobachs efforts faced numerous legal challenges.  Trump created a commission last month to investigate voter fraud following his unsubstantiated claims that millions of people voted illegally for his Democratic rival in the 2016 U.S. election.  Since July 2015, Kobach has secured nine convictions for voter fraud in Kansas, according to a May statement from his office.  Kobach, an Ivy League and Oxford educated former Department of Justice official, said in addition to tackling illegal immigration, he would crackdown on lobbying in state capital Topeka as well as fight tax increases if elected.   He was highly critical of a move by Republican lawmakers on Tuesday to override a veto by Republican Governor Sam Brownback of legislation that would raise taxes, saying there was no need to feed the government monster.  The measure essentially rolls back income tax rate cuts the state enacted in 2012 that led to budget shortfalls. The higher rates are expected to raise $591 million in fiscal 2018, which begins July 1, and $633 million in fiscal 2019, according to a legislative analysis of the bill.

So I think the market thinks thats the likely outcome. JOHN CANAVAN, MARKET STRATEGIST, STONE & MCCARTHY RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY He didnt offer that much that was new. He confirmed all the previously reported concerns. Concerns about the interactions (between Comey and Trump) remain. There was a very muted market response.  It leaves us where we were before. It becomes that much more difficult for the Trump administration to put together a fiscal stimulus package. Anything they could put together with tax reform and infrastructure spending would be a lot smaller than had been expected. You are also pushing back the timing on any fiscal stimulus into 2018, possibly in 2019.  A lot of the initial euphoria for strong fiscal stimulus has already been unwound, primarily in the bond market. Even without fiscal stimulus, the economy would be able to maintain its current momentum. We are looking for steady growth next year. In our view, this would allow the Fed to raise next week and likely one more time this year either in September or in December.

ART HOGAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST AT WUNDERLICH SECURITIES IN NEW YORK To the extent it doesnt seem to be a gottcha moment here, the markets plodding along. Unless something comes out thats outside the realm of the expected, thats what we should expect. I wouldnt say the markets taking action either way here.  The market looked at this as one of three major events today. Along with this youve got the ECB and the UK election. Its a pretty catalyst filled day. It feels like Comey is pretty good at staying in the middle of the fairway in his responses.  If they havent been able to tease anything out of him in the first two hours theyre probably not going to get more. I think the market is looking at this as a non-market moving event much like the ECB meeting was.  THOMAS SIMONS, MONEY MARKET ECONOMIST, JEFFRIES & CO., NEW YORK (The testimony) doesnt appear to be super substantive. My read on the prepared remarks yesterday was that there was nothing particularly stirring there.  I think the market is taking less of an alarmist review of this situation because there is no smoking gun here that there has been any illegal activity by high-ranking officials, so its not particularly impactful for thinking about the impact for Trumps economic agenda to go through or anything like that.  JON ADAMS, SENIOR INVESTMENT STRATEGIST AND PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT BMO GLOBAL ASSET MANAGEMENT IN CHICAGO. We would need to see more evidence as far as explicit direction from the president for there to be a more significant market reaction. Weve been worried about complacency in the market around political risk as investors have become immune to the daily noise out of Washington. We ask does this impact economic growth or earnings growth?, and so far the answer is no to both of those questions.  OMER ESINER, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST AT COMMONWEALTH FOREIGN EXCHANGE IN WASHINGTON. So far we havent had any major surprises or any kind of bombshells released. The dollar-yen ran up a little bit as the testimony got underway, suggesting a little bit of a relief on the fact that we are not likely to get a smoking gun from James Comey that we did not already know. We are not likely to get any new revelation that suggests that the Presidents behavior was anything other than  maybe inappropriate and certainly likely fell short of the bar for obstruction of justice. Outside of a little bit of a move higher in dollar-yen, theres really not much that is going on.   STEPHEN MASSOCCA, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AT WEDBUSH SECURITIES IN SAN FRANCISCO  Its the James Comey show. Nobody cares. None of this is going to matter.

At best what we have here is a president who has zero political experience probably said something he shouldnt have said. I dont see it becoming a bigger issue.  I dont think this is going to move any needle in any direction. Its not significant enough that the Republicans are going to bail on Trump and the Democrats are going to make a lot of noise about it. But at the end of the day people care about unemployment, job growth and more important issues than this, in my opinion. BUCKY HELLWIG, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AT BB&T WEALTH MANAGEMENT IN BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA The hearings should be mostly a non-event for stocks unless there is some kind of unforeseen smoking gun either way  detrimental to the president or beneficial to him. Because the president did not invoke executive privilege, it raises the likelihood that nothing happens during the hearings; i.e., there is nothing secret or detrimental to keep out of the hearings. Separately, it looks like the market is looking for excuses to go higher as it dances around all-time highs.  Earnings are rising, rates are falling (supporting higher PEs), and the technical indicators show the market in an uptrend, so if the hearings maintain the status quo, it could move money off the sidelines into stocks.

From Capitol Hill to San Franciscos Castro district, television watch parties beckoned politics buffs to taverns, restaurants and living rooms to view an event some likened to the Super Bowl of Washington. The drama around Comeys first public appearance since he was fired by President Donald Trump last month drew the kind of communal public interest more often associated with major sporting events and awards shows. Every seat was taken at the Union Pub in Washington, located in the shadow of the building where Comey testified to the Senate Intelligence Committee for about three hours from 10 a.m. EDT (1400 GMT). Comey accused Trump of dismissing him to try to undercut the bureaus investigation into possible collusion between his 2016 presidential campaign team and Russias alleged efforts to influence the election. The pub had promised to buy patrons a round of drinks every time Trump, a prolific Twitter user, tweeted during Comeys testimony - but drinkers were out of luck. The president did not launch a single public retort during the hearing, although his oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., sent several tweets attacking Comey.  (Comey) did in no uncertain terms call Trump a dishonest person, said Jared Sorhaindo, 30, who works as a researcher. That was one of the things that I thought would make Trump fly off the handle. Mark Johnson, 69, self-employed from Rockville, Maryland, was one of the few Republicans in the packed bar and defended the Republican president. It is kind of selective outrage on the part of Democrats, and I dont think that what Trump did rises to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors, Johnson said, referring to one of the standards that can trigger congressional impeachment proceedings against a president. At Houstons Axelrad Beer Garden, a crowd of 200 people applauded when Comey called Trumps rationale for firing him lies, plain and simple. Texas leans Republican but Houston, the largest city in the state, voted overwhelmingly for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in November. So far, no smoking gun, said Cesar Robles, 35, watching the hearing at the bar. Not much is going to be done as a result of the testimony, he said. Back at the Union Pub in the nations capital, Joseph Cortese, a 22-year-old intern working for a Republican congressman, said the hearing was overblown and would not affect Trump or his agenda. Some Democrats have suggested Trump could be impeached and removed from office if he was found to have sought to hinder the Russia probe in a way that obstructed justice. That is seen as very unlikely given Republicans control both chambers of Congress. I think the media and liberals are going to have to move on and accept the fact that Donald Trump is going to be president for the next four years, Cortese said.

Ross told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing that he believes there is a genuine national security issue that must be considered in this case, the second major signal in two days that the Trump administration is preparing new steel import restrictions.   In a speech in Cincinnati on Wednesday, Trump said: Wait until you see what Im going to do for steel and for your steel companies. Were going to stop the dumping, and stop all of these wonderful other countries from coming in and killing our companies and our workers. Youll be seeing that very soon. The steel review under a Cold War-era trade law would result in a thoughtful set of recommendations for Trump to consider for action, Ross said. He has previously said he expected to complete the study by the end of June. Ross identified three kinds of actions that could be recommended: imposing tariffs above the current, country-specific anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties on steel products; imposing quotas limiting the volume of steel imports; and a hybrid tariff-rate quota option that would include quotas on specific products with new tariffs for imports above those levels. Choosing the latter option would help mitigate concerns over steel price inflation from tariffs, Ross said. Some steel users have voiced concerns that import limits would cause price increases that would make them more vulnerable to foreign competitors. The overall impact on inflation, were that to be the route, should be relatively modest, Ross said. So were very mindful of the need both to protect the domestic steel producers from inappropriate behavior on the part of foreign dumpers, but also to protect the steel consumers, the steel fabricators, the auto companies and everybody else who uses steel.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former FBI Director James Comey said on Wednesday that U.S. President Donald Trump asked him to drop an investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn as part of a probe into Russias alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election. In written testimony released the day before he appears before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Comey said Trump told him at a meeting in the White House in February: I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. The testimony puts more pressure on Trump, a Republican, whose presidency has been overshadowed by allegations that Moscow helped him win last years election. Some legal experts said Comeys testimony could strengthen any impeachment case built on obstruction of justice, but U.S. markets shrugged off the news from the testimony for lack of any major disclosures. To build a criminal obstruction of justice case, federal law requires prosecutors to show that a person acted with corrupt intent. It does not matter whether the person succeeds in impeding an investigation. While a sitting president is very unlikely to face criminal prosecution, obstruction of justice could form the basis for impeachment. Comey said he had told Trump on three occasions he was not being investigated, confirming an earlier account from the president. Trump, who spent part of Wednesday in Ohio talking about the need to fix the nations crumbling infrastructure, ignored reporters shouted questions about Comey. On returning to the Oval Office, Trump went into a meeting with top advisers, including chief of staff Reince Priebus. Later, his outside counsel released a statement saying Trump felt completely and totally vindicated by Comeys account. The president is pleased that Mr. Comey has finally publicly confirmed his private reports that the president was not under investigation in any Russian probe, Marc Kasowitz, Trumps attorney, said in a statement. Several congressional committees, as well as the FBI and a special counsel, are investigating whether Russia tried to tilt last Novembers election in Trumps favor, using means such as hacking into the emails of senior Democrats. Trump and the Kremlin have separately denied any collusion. Trump abruptly fired Comey, who was leading the Federal Bureau of Investigations probe, on May 9. Comey painted a vivid picture for senators of awkward encounters with Trump in seven pages of testimony. Comey described a private dinner in the Green Room of the White House on Jan. 26, where Trump asked him whether he wanted to stay on as FBI director, telling him: I need loyalty, I expect loyalty. I didnt move, speak, or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed. We simply looked at each other in silence, Comey said in his testimony, explaining he became concerned that Trump was trying to create some sort of patronage relationship. On Feb. 14, after an Oval Office briefing on counterterrorism, Trump asked Comey to stay behind, dismissing Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who lingered, and waving off Priebus, who peeked through the door. When the door by the grandfather clock closed, and we were alone, the president began by saying, I want to talk about Mike Flynn, Comey said in his testimony. Trump had fired Flynn the previous day in a controversy over contacts between the retired general and the Russian ambassador to the United States. The FBI has been investigating Flynn as it looks into allegations of links between Russia and the Trump campaign. Comey quoted Trump as telling him: I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go. On March 30, Trump phoned Comey and asked what we could do to lift the cloud of the FBIs Russia investigation. He said he had nothing to do with Russia, had not been involved with hookers in Russia, and had always assumed he was being recorded when in Russia, said Comey, who had briefed Trump on salacious material that had arisen in a counter-intelligence investigation. Michael Cohen, a lawyer for Trump, said in a statement that the uncorroborated dossier of compromising material that Russian operatives allegedly collected on Trump has been debunked.  Comeys statement released today needs to be carefully scrutinized as his testimony claims the president was concerned about the dossier, said Cohen. Cohen, along with Flynn, has been subpoenaed by the House Intelligence Committee, which is also conducting a Russia probe. Some legal experts said Comeys written statement could be used to show that Trump engaged in obstruction of justice. It shows the president was doing everything he could to shut down the Flynn investigation, said Andrew Wright, a professor of criminal law at Savannah Law School.  Bruce Green, a professor of law at Fordham University School of Law, said it would be difficult, however, to show that Trump intended to obstruct justice. Trump could say he was merely vouching for Flynns character and voicing concerns about how the probe was interfering with his ability to function effectively as president, Green said. Democrats jumped on the testimony, expressing concern that Trump had inappropriately meddled with the probe. Its certainly very possible that this is evidence, in combination with other actions by the president, that could amount to obstruction. Its certainly an effort to interfere in the investigation, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Adam Schiff, told CNN. Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, asked about Trumps request for loyalty from Comey, said it was very, very critical that FBI directors remain independent. But Republican Senator Richard Burr, who heads the Senate intelligence panel, said he did not take issue with Trumps request. I dont think its wrong to ask for loyalty from anybody in an administration, Burr said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"
"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - Following is the full text of former FBI Director James Comeys testimony as prepared for delivery to the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee. Comey is scheduled to testify at 10 a.m. (1400 GMT) on Thursday as part of the committees investigation into U.S. intelligence agency allegations that Russia tried to interfere with the 2016 presidential election and potential collusion by President Donald Trumps campaign. Russia has denied the allegations and Trump denies any collusion.  The committee posted Comeys opening statement on its website on Wednesday: Chairman Burr, Ranking Member Warner, Members of the Committee. Thank you for inviting me to appear before you today. I was asked to testify today to describe for you my interactions with President-Elect and President Trump on subjects that I understand are of interest to you. I have not included every detail from my conversations with the President, but, to the best of my recollection, I have tried to include information that may be relevant to the Committee. January 6 Briefing I first met then-President-Elect Trump on Friday, January 6 in a conference room at Trump Tower in New York. I was there with other Intelligence Community (IC) leaders to brief him and his new national security team on the findings of an IC assessment concerning Russian efforts to interfere in the election. At the conclusion of that briefing, I remained alone with the President-Elect to brief him on some personally sensitive aspects of the information assembled during the assessment. The IC leadership thought it important, for a variety of reasons, to alert the incoming President to the existence of this material, even though it was salacious and unverified. Among those reasons were: (1) we knew the media was about to publicly report the material and we believed the IC should not keep knowledge of the material and its imminent release from the President-Elect; and (2) to the extent there was some effort to compromise an incoming President, we could blunt any such effort with a defensive briefing. The Director of National Intelligence asked that I personally do this portion of the briefing because I was staying in my position and because the material implicated the FBIs counter-intelligence responsibilities. We also agreed I would do it alone to minimize potential embarrassment to the President-Elect. Although we agreed it made sense for me to do the briefing, the FBIs leadership and I were concerned that the briefing might create a situation where a new President came into office uncertain about whether the FBI was conducting a counter-intelligence investigation of his personal conduct. It is important to understand that FBI counter-intelligence investigations are different than the more-commonly known criminal investigative work. The Bureaus goal in a counter-intelligence investigation is to understand the technical and human methods that hostile foreign powers are using to influence the United States or to steal our secrets. The FBI uses that understanding to disrupt those efforts. Sometimes disruption takes the form of alerting a person who is targeted for recruitment or influence by the foreign power. Sometimes it involves hardening a computer system that is being attacked. Sometimes it involves turning the recruited person into a double-agent, or publicly calling out the behavior with sanctions or expulsions of embassy-based intelligence officers. On occasion, criminal prosecution is used to disrupt intelligence activities. Because the nature of the hostile foreign nation is well known, counterintelligence investigations tend to be centered on individuals the FBI suspects to be witting or unwitting agents of that foreign power. When the FBI develops reason to believe an American has been targeted for recruitment by a foreign power or is covertly acting as an agent of the foreign power, the FBI will open an investigation on that American and use legal authorities to try to learn more about the nature of any relationship with the foreign power so it can be disrupted. In that context, prior to the January 6 meeting, I discussed with the FBIs leadership team whether I should be prepared to assure President-Elect Trump that we were not investigating him personally. That was true; we did not have an open counter-intelligence case on him. We agreed I should do so if circumstances warranted. During our one-on-one meeting at Trump Tower, based on President-Elect Trumps reaction to the briefing and without him directly asking the question, I offered that assurance. I felt compelled to document my first conversation with the President-Elect in a memo. To ensure accuracy, I began to type it on a laptop in an FBI vehicle outside Trump Tower the moment I walked out of the meeting. Creating written records immediately after one-on-one conversations with Mr. Trump was my practice from that point forward. This had not been my practice in the past. I spoke alone with President Obama twice in person (and never on the phone)  once in 2015 to discuss law enforcement policy issues and a second time, briefly, for him to say goodbye in late 2016. In neither of those circumstances did I memorialize the discussions. I can recall nine one-on-one conversations with President Trump in four months  three in person and six on the phone. January 27 Dinner The President and I had dinner on Friday, January 27 at 6:30 pm in the Green Room at the White House. He had called me at lunchtime that day and  invited me to dinner that night, saying he was going to invite my whole family, but decided to have just me this time, with the whole family coming the next time. It was unclear from the conversation who else would be at the dinner, although I assumed there would be others. It turned out to be just the two of us, seated at a small oval table in the center of the Green Room. Two Navy stewards waited on us, only entering the room to serve food and drinks. The President began by asking me whether I wanted to stay on as FBI Director, which I found strange because he had already told me twice in earlier conversations that he hoped I would stay, and I had assured him that I intended to.  He said that lots of people wanted my job and, given the abuse I had taken during the previous year, he would understand if I wanted to walk away. My instincts told me that the one-on-one setting, and the pretense that this was our first discussion about my position, meant the dinner was, at least in part, an effort to have me ask for my job and create some sort of patronage relationship. That concerned me greatly, given the FBIs traditionally independent status in the executive branch. I replied that I loved my work and intended to stay and serve out my ten-year term as Director. And then, because the set-up made me uneasy, I added that I was not reliable in the way politicians use that word, but he could always count on me to tell him the truth. I added that I was not on anybodys side politically and could not be counted on in the traditional political sense, a stance I said was in his best interest as the President. A few moments later, the President said, I need loyalty, I expect loyalty. I didnt move, speak, or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed. We simply looked at each other in silence. The conversation then moved on, but he returned to the subject near the end of our dinner. At one point, I explained why it was so important that the FBI and the Department of Justice be independent of the White House. I said it was a paradox: Throughout history, some Presidents have decided that because problems come from Justice, they should try to hold the Department close. But blurring those boundaries ultimately makes the problems worse by undermining public trust in the institutions and their work. Near the end of our dinner, the President returned to the subject of my job, saying he was very glad I wanted to stay, adding that he had heard great things about me from Jim Mattis, Jeff Sessions, and many others. He then said, I need loyalty. I replied, You will always get honesty from me. He paused and then said, Thats what I want, honest loyalty. I paused, and then said, You will get that from me. As I wrote in the memo I created immediately after the dinner, it is possible we understood the phrase honest loyalty differently, but I decided it wouldnt be productive to push it further. The term  honest loyalty  had helped end a very awkward conversation and my explanations had made clear what he should expect. During the dinner, the President returned to the salacious material I had briefed him about on January 6, and, as he had done previously, expressed his disgust for the allegations and strongly denied them. He said he was considering ordering me to investigate the alleged incident to prove it didnt happen. I replied that he should give that careful thought because it might create a narrative that we were investigating him personally, which we werent, and because it was very difficult to prove a negative. He said he would think about it and asked me to think about it. As was my practice for conversations with President Trump, I wrote a detailed memo about the dinner immediately afterwards and shared it with the senior leadership team of the FBI. February 14 Oval Office Meeting On February 14, I went to the Oval Office for a scheduled counterterrorism briefing of the President. He sat behind the desk and a group of us sat in a semi-circle of about six chairs facing him on the other side of the desk. The Vice President, Deputy Director of the CIA, Director of the National Counter-Terrorism Center, Secretary of Homeland Security, the Attorney General, and I were in the semi-circle of chairs. I was directly facing the President, sitting between the Deputy CIA Director and the Director of NCTC. There were quite a few others in the room, sitting behind us on couches and chairs. The President signaled the end of the briefing by thanking the group and telling them all that he wanted to speak to me alone. I stayed in my chair. As the participants started to leave the Oval Office, the Attorney General lingered by my chair, but the President thanked him and said he wanted to speak only with me. The last person to leave was Jared Kushner, who also stood by my chair and exchanged pleasantries with me. The President then excused him, saying he wanted to speak with me. When the door by the grandfather clock closed, and we were alone, the President began by saying, I want to talk about Mike Flynn. Flynn had resigned the previous day. The President began by saying Flynn hadnt done anything wrong in speaking with the Russians, but he had to let him go because he had misled the Vice President. He added that he had other concerns about Flynn, which he did not then specify. The President then made a long series of comments about the problem with leaks of classified information  a concern I shared and still share. After he had spoken for a few minutes about leaks, Reince Priebus leaned in through the door by the grandfather clock and I could see a group of people waiting behind him. The President waved at him to close the door, saying he would be done shortly. The door closed. The President then returned to the topic of Mike Flynn, saying, He is a good guy and has been through a lot. He repeated that Flynn hadnt done anything wrong on his calls with the Russians, but had misled the Vice President. He then said, I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go. I replied only that he is a good guy. (In fact, I had a positive experience dealing with Mike Flynn when he was a colleague as Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency at the beginning of my term at FBI.) I did not say I would let this go. The President returned briefly to the problem of leaks. I then got up and left out the door by the grandfather clock, making my way through the large group of people waiting there, including Mr. Priebus and the Vice President. I immediately prepared an unclassified memo of the conversation about Flynn and discussed the matter with FBI senior leadership. I had understood the President to be requesting that we drop any investigation of Flynn in connection with false statements about his conversations with the Russian ambassador in December. I did not understand the President to be talking about the broader investigation into Russia or possible links to his campaign. I could be wrong, but I took him to be focusing on what had just happened with Flynns departure and the controversy around his account of his phone calls. Regardless, it was very concerning, given the FBIs role as an independent investigative agency. The FBI leadership team agreed with me that it was important not to infect the investigative team with the Presidents request, which we did not intend to abide. We also concluded that, given that it was a one-on-one conversation, there was nothing available to corroborate my account. We concluded it made little sense to report it to Attorney General Sessions, who we expected would likely recuse himself from involvement in Russia-related investigations. (He did so two weeks later.) The Deputy Attorney Generals role was then filled in an acting capacity by a United States Attorney, who would also not be long in the role. After discussing the matter, we decided to keep it very closely held, resolving to figure out what to do with it down the road as our investigation progressed. The investigation moved ahead at full speed, with none of the investigative team members  or the Department of Justice lawyers supporting them  aware of the Presidents request. Shortly afterwards, I spoke with Attorney General Sessions in person to pass along the Presidents concerns about leaks. I took the opportunity to implore the Attorney General to prevent any future direct communication between the President and me. I told the AG that what had just happened  him being asked to leave while the FBI Director, who reports to the AG, remained behind  was inappropriate and should never happen. He did not reply. For the reasons discussed above, I did not mention that the President broached the FBIs potential investigation of General Flynn. March 30 Phone Call On the morning of March 30, the President called me at the FBI. He described the Russia investigation as a cloud that was impairing his ability to act on behalf of the country. He said he had nothing to do with Russia, had not been involved with hookers in Russia, and had always assumed he was being recorded when in Russia. He asked what we could do to lift the cloud. I responded that we were investigating the matter as quickly as we could, and that there would be great benefit, if we didnt find anything, to our having done the work well. He agreed, but then re-emphasized the problems this was causing him. Then the President asked why there had been a congressional hearing about Russia the previous week  at which I had, as the Department of Justice directed, confirmed the investigation into possible coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign. I explained the demands from the leadership of both parties in Congress for more information, and that Senator Grassley had even held up the confirmation of the Deputy Attorney General until we briefed him in detail on the investigation. I explained that we had briefed the leadership of Congress on exactly which individuals we were investigating and that we had told those Congressional leaders that we were not personally investigating President Trump. I reminded him I had previously told him that. He repeatedly told me, We need to get that fact out. (I did not tell the President that the FBI and the Department of Justice had been reluctant to make public statements that we did not have an open case on President Trump for a number of reasons, most importantly because it would create a duty to correct, should that change.) The President went on to say that if there were some satellite associates of his who did something wrong, it would be good to find that out, but that he hadnt done anything wrong and hoped I would find a way to get it out that we werent investigating him. In an abrupt shift, he turned the conversation to FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, saying he hadnt brought up the McCabe thing because I had said McCabe was honorable, although McAuliffe was close to the Clintons and had given him (I think he meant Deputy Director McCabes wife) campaign money. Although I didnt understand why the President was bringing this up, I repeated that Mr. McCabe was an honorable person. He finished by stressing the cloud that was interfering with his ability to make deals for the country and said he hoped I could find a way to get out that he wasnt being investigated. I told him I would see what we could do, and that we would do our investigative work well and as quickly as we could. Immediately after that conversation, I called Acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente (AG Sessions had by then recused himself on all Russia-related matters), to report the substance of the call from the President, and said I would await his guidance. I did not hear back from him before the President called me again two weeks later. April 11 Phone Call On the morning of April 11, the President called me and asked what I had done about his request that I get out that he is not personally under investigation. I replied that I had passed his request to the Acting Deputy Attorney General, but I had not heard back. He replied that the cloud was getting in the way of his ability to do his job. He said that perhaps he would have his people reach out to the Acting Deputy Attorney General. I said that was the way his request should be handled. I said the White House Counsel should contact the leadership of DOJ to make the request, which was the traditional channel. He said he would do that and added, Because I have been very loyal to you, very loyal; we had that thing you know. I did not reply or ask him what he meant by that thing. I said only that the way to handle it was to have the White House Counsel call the Acting Deputy Attorney General. He said that was what he would do and the call ended. That was the last time I spoke with President Trump.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"
"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former FBI Director James Comeys testimony that U.S. President Donald Trump expected loyalty and hoped Comey would drop an investigation of a former top aide could bolster obstruction of justice allegations against Trump, several legal experts said.  Such allegations might be used as the basis for impeachment proceedings, some of the analysts said. Any such step would face a steep hurdle, however, as it would require approval by the U.S. House of Representatives, which is controlled by Trumps fellow Republicans. According to written testimony posted on the Senate Intelligence Committees website on Wednesday, Comey said Trump told him during a one-on-one Feb. 14 conversation that former national security adviser Michael Flynn was a good guy and hoped that Comey could see his way clear to letting go a probe into ties between Flynn and Russia. Trump had fired Flynn the previous day in a controversy over contacts between the retired general and the Russian ambassador to the United States.  Comeys account, released ahead of his appearance before the committee on Thursday, could show that Trump intended to impede the Flynn investigation, said Michael Gerhardt, a professor of constitutional law at the University of North Carolina School of Law.  The express discussion of loyalty is disconcerting, and could heighten speculation that the president was trying to exert some pressure or at least exert some influence over the Russia investigation, Gerhardt said. Comey, who was fired by Trump on May 9, was leading an FBI investigation of Flynn as it looks into allegations of links between Russia and Trumps 2016 presidential campaign. Moscow and Trump have both denied any collusion. Trumps lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, did not immediately respond to a Reuters query about whether Comeys testimony would support an obstruction case. But he said in a statement that Trump felt vindicated by Comeys confirmation he was not under investigation in any Russia probe.

He said Trump could say he was merely vouching for Flynns character and voicing concerns about how the probe was interfering with his ability to function as president. Alan Dershowitz, a professor emeritus at Harvard Law School and well-known defense lawyer, added that Trumps comments to Comey were ambiguous statements and not even close to obstruction of justice.  Other legal experts said, however, that details surrounding the Feb. 14 conversation could indicate that Trump intended to interfere with the Flynn probe.   According to Comey, Trump told his close advisers, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Jared Kushner, to leave the room so he could speak to Comey privately. Asking others to leave the room could suggest the president was aware that there was something wrong with what he was doing, said Andrew Wright, a professor of constitutional law at Savannah Law School. Wright said there were other damaging details in Comeys testimony, including that Comey did not document his conversations with former President Barack Obama but felt compelled to do so after his first conversation with Trump. Comeys testimony does maximum damage to Trump, Wright said. Gerhardt agreed the testimony was a blow to Trump, saying: Some people who werent concerned before should be concerned now.

Media reports that Sessions offered to resign recently surfaced earlier this week. They added to pressure on Trump as former FBI Director James Comey, who was abruptly fired last month, prepared to testify in Congress on Thursday about his interactions with the president. Trump did not accept Sessions resignation offer and is now being advised to keep his attorney general in place, at least for the time being, two sources said.  Political and legal advisers inside the White House have told Trump over the past month that firing Sessions would create another political fire storm and make it more difficult to fill key jobs inside his administration, the sources said on the condition of anonymity. Thats the advice hes been given. But he might not listen to that advice, one of the sources said. A senior White House official confirmed aides have been urging Trump to keep Sessions but said it was because hes the best man for the job. A spokeswoman at the Justice Department declined to comment. Trump has repeatedly shrugged off advice from close aides. Earlier this week, he said the Justice Department led by Sessions was wrong to submit a watered down, politically correct version of his proposed travel ban on people from several Muslim-majority countries to the Supreme Court.  The outburst weakened government lawyers defense that the travel ban, which has been blocked by federal courts, was not intended as a ban on Muslims. Sessions offered to resign because of tensions with Trump over his decision to recuse himself from a federal investigation into ties between Trumps associates and Russian officials when Russia was allegedly meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, according to media reports. A former senator, Sessions was one of the first senior Republican lawmakers to endorse Trump as a presidential candidate and played an important role in the campaign.  He recused himself from the Russia investigation in March after he failed to disclose a meeting he had with Russias ambassador in Washington. Trump and Sessions were together at the White House on May 17, when Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein surprised them both by appointing former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel to head the Russia investigation.  After learning the news, Trump lashed out at Sessions, blaming him for recusing himself from the Russia probe and leaving the ability to appoint an outside investigator in Rosensteins hands, the sources said.  Trump also complained that Sessions had not warned him about Rosensteins decision. The Justice Department said Sessions played no part in the decision.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""CHICAGO (Reuters) - Illinois must increase payments to Medicaid providers despite an ongoing budget impasse, after a U.S. District Court judge on Wednesday ruled the minimal payments made by the state do not comply with federal consent decrees.  Judge Joan Lefkow ordered renewed negotiations between Illinois and health care advocates for the poor, setting a June 20 deadline to be in substantial compliance with the decrees.     Lawyers representing the states 3 million Medicaid recipients had asked the judge to give precedence to payments to managed care organizations participating in the state and federal health care program for the poor and disabled over the state fully funding other priorities, including debt service on bonds and pensions.  Lefkow said Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza, who pays the states bills, has not offered a lawful basis for not paying the Medicaid providers the $2 billion they are owed. Although the court means no disrespect to the comptroller, who faces an unenviable situation, it finds that minimally funding the obligations of the decrees while fully funding other obligations fails to comply not only with the consent decrees, but also with this courts previous orders, the judges latest order stated. Illinois is limping toward the June 30 end of a second-straight fiscal year without a complete spending plan due to a political stalemate between its Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature. Lawmakers ended their spring session on May 31 without a fiscal 2018 budget deal, triggering downgrades that pushed Illinois credit ratings from S&P and Moodys Investors Service to a step above junk. As a result of the stalemate, Illinois backlog of unpaid bills reached $14.9 billion this week.  Mendoza said the real solution is enacting a budget.  The lack of a budget for the last two years has created a situation in which we now have more court-ordered and state-mandated payments than we have revenues to cover them, she said in a statement. Tom Yates, executive director of the Legal Council for Health Justice, who is representing Medicaid recipients in court, said more money is being sought at this time to ensure access to medical care, not an immediate payment in full. I think the talks will have little different tenor now because the judge makes it pretty clear she expects more money to flow to Medicaid providers, he said.

The package of four bills, which cleared the Republican-controlled House with support from a handful of Democrats, now moves to the Senate, also dominated by Republicans.  It was not immediately clear whether Michigans Republican Governor Rick Snyder supports the bill. But the measure, if also approved in a Senate vote, could automatically become law 14 days after reaching the governors desk unless he vetoes it. The legislation would lift a requirement that handgun owners obtain a concealed pistol license with a $100 fee to legally carry the weapon in public.  Handgun owners also would be allowed carry a concealed pistol in public without the firearms training that is currently mandated.  Advocates framed the issue as upholding a U.S. constitutional right to bear arms. We all know criminals are not paying fees, taking classes and waiting for approval to come in the mail before they begin carrying guns, Michigan state Representative Michele Hoitenga, sponsor of the bill, said in a statement.  The legislation levels the playing field for honest people, she said. Opponents of the bill criticized it as dangerous. Twelve other U.S. states already allow gun owners to carry their weapons without a concealed-carry permit, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Most are conservative-leaning with Republican-majority legislatures but Vermont, where Democrats control the statehouse, is among the 12. The states that have eliminated the permit requirement are basically making it easier to carry a gun in public than drive a car, said Hannah Shearer, a staff attorney with the San Francisco-based Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Legislation introduced in the U.S. Congress this year would, if approved and signed by President Donald Trump, require all states to allow firearm owners to carry their guns under the regulations of their home state, even if visiting elsewhere. For instance, a person allowed to carry a concealed firearm without a permit in North Dakota could do so when visiting California or New York state, where permits are required, Shearer said.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Wednesday ended a fraught month-long search for an FBI chief after firing James Comey by selecting Christopher Wray, who has prosecuted and defended white-collar crime cases and represented New Jerseys governor in a political scandal. Wray, who must be confirmed to the post by the Senate, and Comey served together in the Justice Department under former President George Bush, and both worked on the governments case in the Enron Corp fraud scandal in the early to mid-2000s. Trumps announcement that he will nominate Wray as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation came a day before Comeys eagerly anticipated public testimony before a Senate committee. In written testimony released by the panel on Wednesday, Comey said Trump told him on Jan. 27 that I expect loyalty, and in a Feb. 14 meeting asked him to back off from a probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynns ties with Russia. The Republican presidents search for a replacement for Comey after firing him May 9 was difficult. Leading candidates including former Senator Joe Lieberman took their names out of consideration, and Trump interviewed a series of contenders. In a statement, Trump called Wray an impeccably qualified individual who will serve as a fierce guardian of the law and model of integrity. The White House has given shifting explanations on why Trump fired Comey during an FBI investigation into whether Trump campaign associates colluded with the Russians to help him with the 2016 presidential election. Trump has said he was thinking of this Russia thing in dismissing Comey. Wray served from 2003 to 2005 at the Justice Department under Republican former President George W. Bush as an assistant attorney general in charge of its criminal division and oversaw the departments Enron task force. Wray and Comey helped bring the case against Kenneth Lay, the former Enron chairman convicted in 2006. Also involved in the Enron matter was Robert Mueller, then FBI director and now special counsel named after Comey was fired to investigate the Russia affair, as well as Andrew Weissman, who is now working for Mueller. The web of Enron connections underscores the reliance in Washington, even under a president who vowed to drain the swamp, on an elite corps of corporate lawyers whose varied careers often intersect and who sometimes present conflict-of-interest issues. For instance, after he left the Justice Department and joined top international law firm King & Spalding, Wray represented Republican New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in the so-called Bridgegate scandal over massive traffic jams created as political punishment for a local mayor. That case and others taken on by Wray while in private practice could pose problems, said American Civil Liberties Union National Political Director Faiz Shakir in a statement. Christopher Wrays firms legal work for the Trump family, his history of partisan activity, as well as his history of defending Trumps transition director during a criminal scandal makes us question his ability to lead the FBI, Shakir said. Wray represented Christie in a scandal that resulted in two of the governors aides being convicted. Christie, who was a close adviser to Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign and whose name was floated as a possible Comey replacement, was never charged. Christie on Wednesday called Wray an outstanding choice, a non-political choice to head the FBI. Wray works as a King & Spalding litigation partner and represents companies and individuals in a white-collar criminal and regulatory enforcement matters. King & Spalding has represented Russian companies including state gas monopoly Gazprom, according to its website. According to the website, the firms energy practice also has represented businesses taking part in deals involving Russian entities including state-owned oil major Rosneft. The firm has previous ties to Trump. Bobby Burchfield, a partner in its Washington office, serves as ethics adviser for the trust set up in January to isolate Trump from the day-to-day operations of the Trump business organization. The agreement has been criticized by some ethics experts as inadequate. Apart from possible conflicts, another question about Wray is whether the longtime white-collar lawyer is equipped to take over an agency that is increasingly focused on detecting and combating terrorism, espionage and cybercrime. There are questions about whether he is experienced enough in intelligence, counter-terrorism, counter-narcotics, computer crimes, and issues like that, said one senior U.S. law enforcement official who asked not to be identified. The biggest test the bureau is likely to face is not another Enron, the official said. Trump announced his selection of Wray in a surprise, early-morning Twitter message. Some Democratic lawmakers said the presidents timing seemed intended to distract from Comeys scheduled testimony. It is imperative that the next FBI director be of unimpeachable integrity and independence, Nancy Pelosi, the top House of Representatives Democrat, said. In light of the presidents constant efforts to block the truth, the nomination of Christopher Wray should be subject to the utmost scrutiny. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Wrays impressive credentials make him more than ready to lead the FBI. Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said he did not know Wray but that his resume suggests he is the perfect kind of person for the job.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Donald Trumps pick for FBI chief, corporate lawyer Christopher Wray, would likely face conflicts of interest at the agency due to his defense work for many big companies and be forced to step aside from some investigations, legal ethics experts said on Wednesday. While he spent many years as a government attorney earlier in his career, Wray for the past 12 years has been a white- collar defense lawyer with the Atlanta-based firm of King & Spalding and is currently head of its government investigations practice. If there are investigations of a client hed need to recuse himself, Steven Lubet, a legal ethics professor at Northwestern University, said. At the firm, Wray, a graduate of Yale University and its  law school, defended Johnson & Johnsons Janssen Pharmaceutical unit in a Justice Department probe over off-label use of anti-psychotic drug Risperdal.  He also represented Credit Suisse [CSAG.UL] in a major tax prosecution by the Justice Department, which alleged the Swiss financial group helped clients hide offshore accounts from the Internal Revenue Service.  According to King & Spaldings website, clients of the practice led by Wray include AT&T, Deutsche Bank, CVS Caremark, General Motors, Wells Fargo and others. It was not clear if Wray personally represented all of the companies listed.     Kathleen Clark, a professor at Washington University School of law, said professional ethics rules would specifically bar Wray as Federal Bureau of Investigation director from participating in investigations of former clients who shared confidential information with him.  In addition, she said, federal regulations would prohibit him from participating in matters opposite King & Spalding for up to two years, though the government can waive those restrictions.     Wray would not be the first FBI director to come from the private sector. But he served longer in private practice and has a more extensive corporate client base than other FBI chiefs.  James Comey, the man whom Wray would replace, worked as an in-house lawyer for Lockheed Martin and hedge fund group Bridgewater Associates before he became FBI head in 2013. Robert Mueller briefly worked at two law firms between longer stints in government service before becoming FBI director in 2001.Muellers conflicts from his post-FBI law career emerged as an issue last month after he was named special counsel to investigate ties between Trumps campaign team and Russia. Although the FBI is better known for its role fighting violent crime and espionage, the agency is charged with investigating corporate and securities fraud. In recent years, the bureau has launched probes against corporations including GlaxoSmithKline and Takata Corp, which resulted in billions of dollars in criminal penalties. Neither Wray nor King & Spalding responded to requests for comment on potential conflicts. The FBI referred a call on the matter to the Justice Department, which did not respond. Wray served as a federal prosecutor in Atlanta from 1997 to 2001. He then moved to the U.S. Department of Justice, where he eventually became assistant attorney general and head of the criminal division, where he oversaw the fraud investigation of Enron. He joined King & Spalding in 2005. Wray represented New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who at one time led Trumps presidential transition, in the Bridgegate scandal. In addition, King & Spalding partner Bobby Burchfield is serving as the ethics adviser for the trust set up in January to isolate the president from the day-to-day operations of Trump businesses. Burchfield praised his partner as having the highest integrity and said he saw no conflict between his own work and Wray serving as FBI director. Lubet said he did not think Wrays conflicts would present an unsolvable problem if he becomes FBI director. He noted that investigations could proceed at the field level without the issue arising. Most decisions are not made at the director level, he said. In the event the director has to recuse himself, thats what deputy directors are for, said Lubet.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress may be headed for a reckoning with the federal debt limit within weeks, thanks to wealthy Americans and corporations deferring tax payments in the hope that they would benefit from the lower tax rates promised by President Trump. Trump promised tax cuts during his election campaign last year and has reiterated those promises in recent months leading some wealthy Americans and businesses to shift accounting for income into the future, betting that lower tax rates will arrive, perhaps in 2018, wealth managers told Reuters. Everyone wants to talk about deferring income, said Mark Copeland, senior partner at Signature Estate & Investment Advisors LLC in Newport Beach, California.  The U.S. stock market has also rallied since Trumps election victory in November, partly on hopes for lower corporate tax rates.  We are starting to prepare clients for potentially lower taxes in 2018, said Julia Carlson, chief executive and at Financial Freedom Wealth Management Group LLC in Oregon. Trump promised to cut taxes as far back as September 2015 in a four-page plan and reiterated those promises in a two-page Contract with the American Voter before last Novembers election and again in a one-page document in April, but Republicans in Congress remain divided on tax reform. The delay to tax payments could help to explain why tax receipts this fiscal year are coming in more slowly than projected, said tax experts and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), an arm of Congress. Taxpayers may have shifted more income than projected ... to later years, expecting legislation to reduce tax rates to be enacted this year, the CBO said in a monthly report on Wednesday. The weaker tax revenues this year have forced the U.S. Treasury to borrow more money than expected to cover the federal budget deficit and that is putting the government on track to hit its legal debt limit sooner than expected, experts said. The U.S. government has a legal limit on how much it can borrow, currently set at about $19.8 trillion and the limit can only be increased by a vote of Congress. The need to raise the debt limit usually creates partisan debate in Washington. Conservative Republicans like to use the debt limit issue as leverage to demand cuts in spending but Democrats and moderate Republicans usually oppose such ultimatums on the grounds that the borrowings are used to fund spending approved previously by Congress.   This year, with Trumps legislative agenda stalled and Congress preoccupied by Trumps firing of former FBI director James Comey, the House Republicans known as the House Freedom Caucus along with outside conservative groups are again demanding spending cuts for support to raise the debt limit. In 2011 the failure to raise the debt limit in a timely way and the possibility that the U.S. government might default on its obligations led to the U.S. losing its prized triple-A credit rating from Standard & Poors. Since mid-March the U.S. Treasury has been using emergency funding powers to postpone hitting the debt limit and those measures had been expected to last until about October, but lower tax receipts so far this year may mean the debt limit will be hit sooner-than-expected. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin urged Congress last month to raise the debt ceiling before lawmakers break for a long August summer recess, a call echoed last week by House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi.

Comey was leading a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe into alleged Russian meddling in last years U.S. presidential election when Trump fired him last month. Comey said he had a total of three face-to-face meetings with Trump and six phone calls with him. Following are details of what Comey said occurred in some of the conversations. Jan. 6 Briefing at Trump Tower in New York, when Trump was president-elect. At conclusion of a briefing given with other intelligence community officials, Comey remained alone with Trump to provide a private briefing on material that was salacious and unverified.  Comey said he was prepared to tell Trump the FBI was not investigating him personally, because the agency did not have an open counter-intelligence case on him.  I felt compelled to document my first conversation with the President-elect, Comey said, saying he began to type it on a laptop in an FBI vehicle outside Trump Tower the moment I walked out of the meeting. Creating written records immediately after one-on-one conversations with Mr. Trump was my practice from that point forward, Comey said. Jan. 27 Dinner at the White House  Comey had dinner with Trump in the Green Room at the White House. Trump called him earlier in the day to extend the invitation and Comey had assumed that other people would be present, but it was just him and the president. Trump asked Comey if he wanted to remain FBI director, which Comey said he found strange because he had already told me twice in earlier conversations that he hoped I would stay, and I had assured him I intended to. My instincts told me that the one-on-one setting, and the pretense that this was our first discussion about my position, meant the dinner was, at least in part, an effort to have me ask for my job and create some sort of patronage relationship. Comey said. Because the set-up made me uneasy, I added that I was not reliable in the way politicians use that word, but he could always count on me to tell him the truth, Comey said. A few moments later, the President said, I need loyalty, I expect loyalty. I didnt move, speak, or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed. Trump returned to the subject of Comeys job near the end of the dinner, and said: I need loyalty. Comey said he replied: You will always get honesty from me. Trump paused and said: Thats what I want, honest loyalty. Comey said he paused, and said: You will get that from me, although Comey said it was possible he and Trump understood the phrase honest loyalty differently. Feb. 14 Oval Office meeting Comey went to the Oval Office for a counterterrorism briefing with other officials, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions. At the end of the briefing, Trump indicated he wanted to speak to Comey alone, and when Sessions lingered, Trump said he wanted to speak only to Comey. Once alone, Trump began by saying: I want to talk about Mike Flynn, who had been fired as national security adviser the previous day. Trump said of Flynn: He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go. Comey said he replied only that he is a good guy, and said that I did not say I would let this go. Comey discussed the conversation with the FBI leadership team and it was agreed not to report the conversation to the attorney general. But shortly afterward, Comey said he spoke in person to Sessions to pass along Trumps concerns about leaks. I took the opportunity to implore the Attorney General to prevent any future direct communication between the President and me. I told the AG that what had just happened  him being asked to leave while the FBI Director, who reports to the AG, remained behind  was inappropriate and should never happen. He did not reply. March 30 Phone call Trump called Comey at the FBI. He described the Russia investigation as a cloud that was that was impairing his ability to act on behalf of the country, and asked what could be done to lift the cloud. Trump wanted to know why there had been a congressional hearing about Russia the prior week. Comey said the FBI had briefed congressional leaders on which individuals it was investigating and said Trump was not being personally investigated. Comey said he reminded Trump that he had previously told him that. Trump, he said, repeatedly told me, We need to get that fact out. April 11 Phone call Trump called Comey and asked what he had done about his request that I get out that he is not personally under investigation. I replied that I had passed his request to the Acting Deputy Attorney General, but I had not heard back. Trump again said the cloud was interfering with his ability to do his job. At the end of his conversation, Trump said: Because I have been very loyal to you, very loyal; we had that thing you know, Comey reported, adding: I did not reply or ask him what he meant by that thing. Comey said that was his last conversation with Trump.      ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Hawaii Governor David Ige signed a bill on Tuesday requiring state officials to plan a response to climate change that aligns the state with the standards and goals of the Paris pact, according to Scott Glenn, an environmental adviser to the governor. People come to Hawaii to enjoy its environment, Glenn said. When climate change is threatening our reefs and threatening our weather ... then its threatening our economy, too. Although Hawaii already has strong environmental rules, the new law is the first to directly refer to the standards of the Paris agreement, said Glen Andersen, who tracks energy and climate issues at the National Conference of State Legislatures. Along with setting climate change as a priority for the state, the bill creates a state commission dedicated to studying climate change and putting out detailed plans for responding both to sea-level rise and climate change as a whole, with the stipulation that the plans align with the Paris agreement. Trump said on Thursday that the landmark 2015 climate agreement threatened millions of jobs and productivity, and that he would start a multi-year process to withdraw from the deal, which has been signed by almost every other nation on Earth. The governors of Washington, California and New York on the same day announced the creation of a climate alliance of states that would remain committed to the Paris goals. Ige joined the alliance on Friday. An overwhelming majority of scientists say human activity - including the burning of oil, gas and coal - is the main driver of rising global temperatures. Scientists at the University of Hawaii said in April that sea-level rise driven by global warming will cause flooding of low-lying areas in the state dozens of times per year by 2050, and increase the risk of dangerous interactions between tropical storms and seasonal high tides.

Earlier this week, Dominion said it will begin a strategic reassessment of the 2,088-megawatt Millstone plant after another bill that would allow the state to buy power from the plant failed to get enough votes. That other bill was Senate Bill 106. Senate Bill 778, which the Senate passed this morning, authorizes the commissioner of the state Department of Energy & Environmental Protection to conduct an appraisal to determine whether the state will conduct a competitive procurement process for nuclear power. Before it becomes law, Bill 778 has to pass the state house before the session ends at midnight Wednesday and be signed by the governor. Connecticut is one of several states looking for ways to boost their nuclear plants revenues to keep them in service to preserve benefits they provide, including carbon-free energy, jobs, taxes and energy diversification. In 2016, New York and Illinois adopted rules to subsidize some reactors that were in danger of closing before their licenses expire as cheap and abundant shale gas has cut power prices over the past several years, making it uneconomic for nuclear operators to keep some units operating. While other generators with mostly gas-fired plants, like NRG Energy Inc, Dynegy Inc and Calpine Corp, challenge those New York and Illinois rules in federal court, other states - Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Jersey - have considered adopting similar rules to protect their reactors. We dont believe that fair and equitable power markets can be sustained when giving handouts or subsidies to nuclear operators. The suggestion that Dominion is somehow in a lesser position to participate in the power market is pure fiction, said NRG spokesman David Gaier. If the Connecticut commissioner decides to go forward with the nuclear power purchases, the state can either require electric utilities to buy nuclear power for a period of three to ten years, or issue a solicitation for baseload zero-carbon resources, including nuclear. Ken Holt, a spokesman at Millstone, said it was premature to speculate on what the company may do if Bill 778 does not pass. He said Dominion has already sold 85 percent of the power Millstone is expected to generate in 2017 to hedge funds and other purchasers. While the company usually sells some of the plants power three years in advance, Holt said Dominion has not sold Millstones power beyond this year because it was waiting to see where prices would go and the outcome of the legislation. Next-day power prices in New England averaged $35.40 per megawatt hour in 2016, the lowest on record, according to Reuters data going back to 2001. That compares with a 10-year average (2007-2016) of $59.02. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

America wants to build, Trump said. There is no limit to what we can achieve. All it takes is a bold and daring vision and the will to make it happen. Speaking in Cincinnati, Ohio, Trump reviewed a proposal announced earlier this year to leverage $200 billion in his budget proposal into a $1 trillion of projects to privatize the air traffic control system, strengthen rural infrastructure and repair bridges, roads and waterways. Trump said he would not allow the United States to become a museum of former glory. He spoke about backing large transformative projects but did not give specifics. We will construct incredible new monuments to American grit that inspire wonder for generations and generations, he said. Trump pointed to a government program that allows the private sector to tap into low-cost government loans called the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act as a way to leverage federal funds with state, local, and private sector funding. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said at a Senate hearing on Wednesday that administration plans to unveil a detailed legislative proposal by the end of September. Democrats want $1 trillion in new federal spending and proposed a plan that includes $200 billion in roads and bridges,$20 billion in expanding broadband Internet access, $110 billion for water systems and $75 billion for schools. Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer said the Trump budget unveiled in May cuts $206 billion in infrastructure spending across several departments, including $96 billion in planned highway trust fund spending. The Ohio visit was the second leg of a week-long White House focus on infrastructure. On Monday the president proposed spinning off air traffic control from the Federal Aviation Administration. The proposal to privatize air traffic control has run into skepticism and opposition from Democratic senators and some Republicans.  The infrastructure push comes as the White House seeks to refocus attention on core promises to boost jobs and the economy that Trump made last year during his presidential campaign.  Those pledges have been eclipsed by the furor over Russias alleged meddling in the election. That drama will come to a head on Thursday when former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey, who was leading the Russia probe until Trump fired him last month, testifies before a Senate panel.

The bipartisan group of lawmakers joined safety experts and parents with testimonials of personal tragedies to publicly press for a law they said would have averted many of the 800  deaths of children left in overheated cars since 1990. It should be bipartisan, non-partisan, it should be Americas legislation, Rep. Peter King, a New York Republican told a Washington press conference. The bill, known as the Helping Overcome Trauma for Children Alone in Rear Seats, or HOT CARS, Act, would instruct the U.S. Transportation Department to issue a rule requiring new cars to have systems that alert drivers check their back seats after they turn off their engines. Representative Tim Ryan, an Ohio Democrat and a chief sponsor of the bill, lauded General Motors Co for already installing rear-seat reminders in its 2018 model Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC vehicles. The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers said it would review the legislation and provide guidance, but added that under the bill it would take about 20 years before all cars were equipped with the new technology. Greater public awareness saves lives today, alliance spokesman Scott Hall said in a statement.

The U.S. restrictions imposed in March currently cover about 350 flights a week originating from 10 airports, primarily in the Middle East. Extending the ban to all European airports that directly serve U.S. airports would affect nearly 400 flights a day and cover 30 million travelers and pose major logistical challenges, airlines and security officials say. We are looking right now at an additional 71 airports, Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly told a House of Representatives panel. Were also looking at ways that we think we can mitigate the threat without expanding the ban. Kelly said his deputy will attend a conference in Malta next week to present what we think are the minimum increased security standards ... and present those to people to say if you meet these standards we will not ban large electronics. The restrictions on laptops announced in March, including on flights originating from airports in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey, came amid fears that a concealed bomb could be installed in electronic devices taken aboard aircraft. Britain quickly followed suit with restrictions on a slightly different set of routes. Kelly said many countries are working to not be added to the ban list by improving screening to detect this very sophisticated device. He called the danger real. This is a very serious constant threat to knock down an airplane, Kelly said. Homeland Security spokesman David Lapan declined to identify the 71 airports that are under consideration. Any move to restrict carrying larger electronics to the cargo hold of aircraft has potential safety implications related to past problems with laptop batteries. Kelly said he is reviewing those concerns. U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao at a Senate hearing on Wednesday said lithium ion batteries on airplanes can be a problem.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - Former FBI Director James Comey will testify to the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday about Russian involvement in the 2016 presidential election.  President Donald Trumps abrupt firing of Comey on May 9 renewed attention to allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the election to benefit Trump. It also raised questions about the motivations behind Comeys dismissal.  The following describes what is publicly known and not known about U.S. investigations into meddling and possible collusion between Russia and members of the Trump campaign:  How did the investigations begin? Former President Barack Obama ordered U.S. intelligence agencies to assess whether Russia tried to intervene in the election after a cyber attack on the Democratic National Committee in July 2016 and the publication of thousands of hacked personal emails from Hillary Clintons campaign manager in the month before the Nov. 8 election. Obama told intelligence officials to deliver a report on possible foreign interference before he left the White House in January 2017.  What did the intelligence agencies find? The Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency concluded in a report declassified in January that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a campaign not just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system but to affect the outcome.  The agencies said Putin and the Russian government had a clear preference for Trump to win the White House. Putins associates hacked information, paid social media trolls and backed efforts by Russian government agencies and state-funded media to sway public opinion, the agencies said.  The report stopped short of assessing whether Russia succeeded in swaying the election result.  Putin and other Russian officials have repeatedly denied interfering in the U.S. election.  How many U.S. probes are there into Russias election meddling? Comey told the House Intelligence Committee on March 20 that the FBI was investigating Moscows role in the election, including possible collusion with Trumps campaign.  The Justice Department announced on May 17 that it has appointed Robert Mueller, a former FBI director, as special counsel to lead an independent Russia probe. Mueller would, if the evidence merits, work in tandem with the FBI to handle any related criminal prosecutions.  In addition there are multiple committees in the Senate and House of Representatives investigating various aspects of Russian election meddling.  What has Trump said about Russias role in the election? Trump has not taken a clear public position.  I will tell you this, Russia: if youre listening, I hope youre able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing, Trump said at a July 2016 news conference, in reference to an FBI probe into Clintons use of a private email system when she was secretary of state and emails that had possibly been deleted.  Trump subsequently dismissed reports, including from U.S. intelligence officials, that Russia had attempted to intervene in the election on his behalf.  The first time Trump said he accepted the findings of the intelligence agencies was at a Jan. 11 news conference ahead of his inauguration. As far as hacking, I think it was Russia, Trump said, although he added: It could have been others also.  Trump said in May that China may have hacked the emails of Democratic officials to meddle with the election, offering no evidence and countering the view of intelligence officials.  Trump has made clear on multiple occasions he believes the Russia investigations have run their course and should be closed. The Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end? he wrote on Twitter on May 8.  On May 30, Trump wrote on Twitter: Russian officials must be laughing at the U.S. & how a lame excuse for why the Dems lost the election has taken over the Fake News.  Did the FBI probe continue after Comeys dismissal? There is no evidence that the FBI ended or paused its investigation after Comeys departure.  FBI acting Director Andrew McCabe, who is leading the agency, promised the Senate Intelligence Committee that Comeys firing would not affect the investigation and that he will notify the committee of any attempt to delay or derail it.  Trump on June 6 tapped former U.S. Justice Department official Christopher Wray, who represented New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in the so-called Bridgegate scandal, to be the next FBI director. Wray will need Senate confirmation.  Why was Comey fired? The White House cited a May 9 letter to Trump from Attorney General Sessions that attached a memo from Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, on Restoring Confidence in the FBI that recommended Comeys dismissal.  Rosensteins memo said Comey erred in July 2016 by announcing the FBI had been examining Clintons use of a private email server and that the case should be closed without prosecution. Rosensteins view was that Comeys decision to make a public statement broke with longstanding FBI precedent and should have been handled by the then-U.S. attorney general, Loretta Lynch.  Trump called Comey a showboat and grandstander in an interview with NBC News on May 11, saying that he would have fired Comey regardless of Rosensteins recommendation.  In an unorthodox move, Great America Alliance, an offshoot of a pro-Trump super PAC devoted to promoting the White House agenda, developed a television ad called Showboat to air as Comey testifies. The ad claims Comey was consumed with election meddling at the expense of fighting terrorism.  Was Comeys firing related to the FBIs Russia probe? Whether Comey believes his firing was linked to the FBIs Russia probe will likely be a main focus when he testifies on Thursday.  Trump asked Comey to end the agencys investigation of Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser, and also to make some sort of public statement that he was not personally under investigation in order to clear the cloud hanging over his presidency, according to Comeys prepared testimony.  Comey found it very concerning that Trump would ask him to drop the agencys probe of Flynn and declined to state publicly that Trump himself was not under investigation, in part because it would create a duty to correct if that changed, according to the testimony.  I need loyalty, I expect loyalty, Trump told Comey at a January 27 dinner, according to the testimony.  Less than a week before he was fired, Comey told a congressional panel that it made him mildly nauseous that he may have affected the outcome of the election by publicly re-opening, and then re-closing, the Clinton email probe days before the election.  Has there been any fallout for Trump associates over contacts with Russia before, during or after the election campaign? Flynn was fired in February. The White House said he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about the contacts he had with Russias ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kislyak, before Trump took office.  On May 9, federal prosecutors issued grand jury subpoenas seeking business records from people who worked with Flynn when he was a private citizen. On May 10, the Senate Intelligence Committee issued the first subpoena in its Russia investigation, demanding documents from Flynn. He provided the first batch on June 6.  Sessions had to recuse himself from involvement in Russia-related probes at the Justice Department because he had not told Congress of his own contacts with Kislyak in 2016. Rosenstein is handling matters related to Russia and it is he who appointed Mueller as special counsel.  Is Trump himself under investigation? In the short letter Trump sent to Comey dismissing him from the FBI, he thanked Comey for informing him on three separate occasions that he was not under investigation. Comey confirmed in his written testimony that he told Trump that he was not personally under investigation.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Republican Governor Greg Abbott signed what is known as Senate Bill 8 into law on Tuesday and it takes effect from Sept. 1. It also includes a ban on the most common method of second-trimester abortion. Texas is the most-populous Republican-controlled state. Its abortion restrictions have often been fiercely defended by the states lawyers and copied by other socially conservative states. Texas legislation on abortion is typically amplified because the state can be a beacon for restrictions nationwide, said Elizabeth Nash, senior state issues manager for the Guttmacher Institute, an abortion rights research group. The anti-abortion group, Texas Right to Life, praised Abbott and the legislation, calling it the most significant pro-life victory of the regular legislative session.     Texas crafted a regulation on fetal tissue disposal last year after it suffered a stinging defeat in the U.S. Supreme Court. The court struck down separate abortion restrictions, which were backed by the states Republican leaders, regarding doctors and facilities. The Texas fetal tissue regulations were more stringent than regulations in almost every other state, which typically allow aborted fetal tissue to be disposed of in a similar manner as other human tissue, according to the Guttmacher Institute. In January, U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks in Austin put a temporary halt on the fetal tissue disposal regulation, saying the Texas rule imposed undue burdens on a womans right to seek a previability abortion. After that, the Republican-dominated legislature passed a bill that included the regulation on fetal tissue disposal, with many party leaders saying the measure was necessary to preserve human dignity. Abortion rights providers have said the regulation would require the tissue to be treated differently than other human tissue, add another stigma to abortion and increase costs.

The department in a statement said it had withdrawn a 2016 interpretation of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) that expanded the circumstances under which a business could be held liable for wage-law violations by staffing agencies, contractors, and franchisees. Previously, companies were considered joint employers when they hired and fired workers and set wages. The Obama administration said a workers level of economic dependence on a company should also be considered. The expanded definition of joint employment had rankled the business community, which said it threatened the franchise business model and would draw companies into lawsuits when they were not responsible for setting working conditions.  Also on Wednesday, the department withdrew 2015 guidance that said that under the same law, many workers are improperly treated as independent contractors when they are actually employees, which would make them eligible for minimum wage, overtime, and other legal protections.  Guidance issued by federal agencies is not legally binding, but serves as a blueprint for how agencies will enforce federal laws. A shift in enforcement priorities at the Department of Labor had been widely expected since President Donald Trump, a Republican and wealthy businessman from New York, took office.  Business groups have said the departments guidance on employment and worker classification was misguided and affected nearly every U.S. industry, and they praised the agencys changes on Wednesday. Diligent employers work hard to be compliant with the FLSA and these (department) interpretations were merely enforcement traps waiting to spring, Randy Johnson, a vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement. Unions and workers rights groups said they were troubled by the labor departments decision. This was guidance that made it easier for employers, workers, unions and others to know about their rights and obligations under the law, Lynn Rhinehart, general counsel for the AFL-CIO, said in a statement. The withdrawal of the guidance does not affect a separate expansion of the definition of joint employment by the National Labor Relations Board, which is under review by a federal appeals court. The NLRBs standard has had more of an impact than the labor departments because it is legally binding and requires joint employers to bargain with unions.

The session, set to start on Monday, will seek stricter regulations on abortion clinics, including requiring annual inspections and that clinics adopt plans for potential medical complications, Governor Eric Greitens said in a statement. That came in response to a federal judges ruling in April that blocked requirements for clinics to meet standards for surgical centers and for doctors to have hospital privileges. Greitens said he also wants to target an ordinance approved by St. Louis aldermen in February banning employers and landlords from discriminating against women who have had an abortion, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch newspaper.

During budget and nomination hearings, senators have pressed current and prospective officials about a Justice Department legal opinion dated May 1. The opinion said information requests to executive agencies from senior Democrats on congressional committees, called ranking members, do not trigger any obligation to accommodate congressional needs and are not legally enforceable through a subpoena or contempt proceedings. The opinion, largely unprecedented, says agencies are required to give information to only committee chairs, positions held by members of the majority party in Congress. Currently, Republicans control both chambers of Congress and the White House. Most lawmakers first learned about the guidance in media reports last month. Now, they say agencies under President Donald Trump are becoming less responsive to them, making it harder to check whether the executive branch is correctly carrying out laws, as required by the constitution. Some Republicans also have questioned allowing agencies to ignore requests from Congress. Missouri Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat who is ranking member of the governmental affairs committee that looks into waste, fraud and abuse in the federal government, grew enraged on Wednesday when a nominee for the White Houses budget office would not commit to respond, without reservation, to her inquiries.  The nominee for Office of Management and Budget Deputy Director, Russell Vought, said that if he is confirmed for the post his responses to her would be subject to the discretion of the director and advice of legal counsel. He added that he was merely reflecting the administrations policy. Calling the legal guidance hogwash, McCaskill cast withholding information from her as the administrations attempt to hide problems and wrongdoing. Welcome to the Big Leagues, administration. This is what happens, you get oversight, she said, adding she has had a few problems with receiving information but not to the extent of other Democrats. A Republican on the committee, Ohios Rob Portman, said that when he headed the budget office under former President George W. Bush, he found dealing with Congress was often frustrating.

Trump named Clark on Wednesday to be Assistant Attorney General for environment at the Department of Justice, representing the U.S. government on environmental regulation and enforcement issues. Clark, a partner at Kirkland & Ellis, represented BP after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion and Macondo oil well rupture that killed 11 workers and caused the largest offshore environmental disaster in U.S. history. The accident polluted large parts of the Gulf, killing marine wildlife and harming businesses. Along the U.S. Gulf coast, local communities are still grappling with cleanup and restoration, and had relied on the federal government and EPA to protect them against climate change and oil and gas company accidents, said Cynthia Sarthou, director of the Gulf Restoration Network in Louisiana. I think the enforcement of any pollution laws is going to be at risk right now, Sarthou said. Bossert (Clark) is unlikely to hold the oil and gas industry accountable for pollution. Sarthou added that most of the oil and gas infrastructure along the U.S. Gulf coast is aging, putting local environmental groups on alert for future accidents. While this administration continues to choose profits over people, South Louisiana residents continue to struggle to recover from the economic, health and environmental impacts of the BP oil drilling disaster, said Colette Pichon Battle, of the Human Rights Network, a lawyer who represented local communities affected by the BP accident.

In addition to practicing law in private practice, he also served worked as deputy assistant attorney general for environment at the Justice department from 2001 to 2005. As an attorney, Clark also represented industry groups in several challenges against the previous administrations Environmental Protection Agency.

U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement that settlement payments must be directed to victims impacted by the defendants actions and then to the federal government.  The change could impact banks and other corporations, and marks the latest action by the Republican Trump administration to end policies from the previous Democratic Obama administration. Such agreements were a feature of several U.S. settlements with banks following the 2008 financial crisis. Under former President Barack Obama, the Justice Department aimed to hold banks accountable for shoddy securities that contributed to the U.S. housing market collapse. From 2013 to 2016, the department reached $46 billion in settlements with U.S. banks that in part directed funds to approved housing aid and other related groups. In Obamas final weeks in office, the department sued Barclays PLC (BARC.L) over similar claims. In recent years the Department of Justice has sometimes required or encouraged defendants to make these payments to third parties as a condition of settlement, Sessions said a statement. We are ending this practice and ensuring that settlement funds are only used to compensate victims, redress harm, and punish and deter unlawful conduct. The change could impact banks still under federal investigation over mortgage issues such as Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN.S), Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC (RBS.L), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), UBS Group AG (UBSG.S) and HSBC (HSBA.L). Representatives for the banks could not be immediately reached.     Sessions, in a one-page memo dated Monday, told the nations 94 U.S. attorneys they could not make any agreements in civil or criminal cases that directs or provides for a payment or loan to any non-governmental person or entity that is not a party to the dispute. Sessions new policy is ill-advised and ignores the tens of thousands of families who were helped by housing service providers across the country in the wake of the financial crisis, said Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. Schneiderman was co-chair of a working group that investigated misconduct in the pooling and sale of mortgage securities in the run-up to the financial crisis. Sessions cited three exceptions to the new policy: payments or loans that directly aim to address harm such as to the environment or official corruption; legal or other professional services from the case; and restitution, forfeiture and other payments required by law. While the policy affects future deals, it would have impacted cases like the Environmental Protection Agencys diesel emissions settlement with Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) that required the German automaker to invest $2 billion in zero-emission vehicle efforts over 10 years. Eric Schaeffer, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project and a former EPA civil enforcement director, said the new ban could prevent a similar settlement after the Justice Department sued Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) last month over excess diesel emissions. The memo could ensure violators wont be required to support development of low emission vehicles to compensate for illegal pollution from the dirty engines they designed, he said. The change could still affect a proposed $12 million Justice Department settlement with Harley-Davidson Inc (HOG.N) that was announced in August but not finalized that includes $3 million to reduce air pollution through a project to replace conventional woodstoves.

The law, enshrined in Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, is due to expire on December 31 unless Congress votes to reauthorize it, but is considered vital by U.S. intelligence agencies. Privacy advocates have criticized the law though for allowing the incidental collection of data belonging to millions of Americans without a search warrant. The push to make the law permanent may lead to a contentious debate over renewal of Section 702 in Congress, where lawmakers in both parties are deeply divided over whether to adopt transparency and oversight reforms. We cannot allow adversaries abroad to cloak themselves in the legal protections we extend to Americans, White House Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert wrote in an editorial  published in the New York Times newspaper on Wednesday. U.S. Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, speaking on behalf of other intelligence agency leaders, also told the Senate Intelligence Committee panel on Wednesday that the statute should be made permanent, saying it was necessary to keep the United States safe from national security threats.  NSA Director Rogers added that the law had been vital to preventing terrorism in allied countries as well. Fourteen Republican senators, including every Republican member of the Senate intelligence panel, introduced a bill on Tuesday that would make part of Section 702 permanent. The statute, which grants the National Security Agency a considerable freedom in the collection of foreigners digital communications, normally comes with a sunset clause, meaning that roughly every five years lawmakers need to reconsider its impact on privacy and civil liberties. Intelligence Director Coats said it was not feasible for the NSA to provide an estimate of the number of Americans whose communications are ensnared incidentally under Section 702.  Coats and other officials had previously told Congress they would attempt to share an estimate publicly before the statute expires. A frustrated Democratic Senator Ron Wyden, who has asked for such an estimate for several years, said Coats went back on a pledge. Privacy advocates criticized the push to make Section 702 permanent, arguing that regular reviews of the law were necessary to conduct appropriate oversight and prevent potential abuses. After months of criticizing the government for allegedly spying on his presidential campaign, President Trump is now hypocritically endorsing a bill that would make permanent the NSA authority that is used to spy on Americans without a warrant, said Neema Singh Guliani, legislative counsel with the American Civil Liberties Union. Disclosures by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden in 2013 revealed the sweeping nature of 702 surveillance, prompting outrage internationally and embarrassing some U.S. technology firms shown to be involved in a program known as Prism. Last week, Facebook (FB.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Alphabet Incs Google (GOOGL.O) sent a letter to Congress urging lawmakers to adopt several reforms to the law, including codifying the recent termination of a type of NSA surveillance that collected Americans communications with someone living overseas that merely mentioned a foreign intelligence target.  Making the law permanent without changes would preclude codifying that change. Reuters reported in March that the Trump administration supported renewal of Section 702 without any changes, citing an unnamed White House official, but it was not clear at the time whether it wanted the law made permanent.

Our air traffic organization must be more nimble, U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao told the Senate Commerce Committee. A bulky federal government procurement apparatus does not move fast enough to keep pace with new technologies and new demands. President Donald Trump on Monday unveiled the plan to modernize air traffic control and lower flying costs. Under the proposal, air traffic control would be spun off from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and put under the aegis of a nonprofit entity. Critics say the plan would hand control of a key asset to special interests and big airlines. Senator Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, said on Wednesday that small airports in his state oppose the plan. He said that after air traffic privatization in the United Kingdom airline passenger fees rose 30 percent. This is a tough sell, Wicker said. Senator Jerry Moran, a Kansas Republican, said he remains skeptical of the idea of removing Congress from air traffic control oversight and handing it to a 13-member board. The administration says it would not charge the private entity for the governments air traffic control assets and would bar Congress from reviewing fees charged by the board. Senator Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat, opposes the proposal. Why give away billions of dollars in government assets to an entity that will be governed in large part by the airlines? he asked. Nelson argued a fundamental breakup of the FAA cannot advance when there are such strong divisions among aviation stakeholders and in Congress. It just wont happen.     Chao denied that the major airlines would control the board and said they would have just two seats on the board. She also pledged to address rural concerns. One big issue is whether general aviation could face higher costs and access to airspace if a private board takes over. Executives from United Airlines (UAL.N), Hawaiian Airlines Inc [HAII.UL], American Airlines Inc (AAL.O) and Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N), all represented by the Airlines for America lobbying group, praised the Trump plan on Monday. The FAA spends nearly $10 billion a year on air traffic control funded largely through passenger user fees, and has spent more than $7.5 billion on next-generation air traffic control reforms in recent years. It is unclear whether privatization would speed the rollout of new systems such as satellite-based aircraft tracking that replaces ground radar dating back to World War Two.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Russian hacking of the 2016 U.S. election included sophisticated targeting of state officials responsible for voter rolls and voting procedures, according to a top secret U.S. intelligence document that was leaked and published this week, revealing another potential method of attempted interference in the vote. The month-old National Security Agency document outlined activities including impersonating an election software vendor to send trick emails to more than 100 state election officials. Analysts at the NSA believed the hackers were working for the Russian militarys General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate, or GRU, according to the document. The documents publication on Monday by The Intercept, a news outlet that focuses on security issues, received particular attention because an intelligence contractor, Reality Leigh Winner, was charged the same day with leaking it. U.S. intelligence agencies have previously said the Kremlin tried to influence the election outcome in favor of Republican candidate Donald Trump through leaks during the campaign of hacked emails from Democratic Party officials, aimed at discrediting Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. The new revelations suggest that U.S. investigators are also still probing a more direct attempt to attack the election itself, and a federal official confirmed that is the case. However, there is no evidence that hackers were able to manipulate votes, or the vote tally. The document says at least one employee of the software vendor had an account compromised but does not cover whether any of the elections officials were also successfully compromised. If they did compromise the officials, hackers could have planted malicious software, then captured proof of the infection to suggest that there had been fraud on Clintons behalf, had she won the Nov. 8 election, experts said. If your goal is to disrupt an election, you dont need to pick the winner or actually tamper with tally result, said Matt Blaze, a University of Pennsylvania computer science professor who has written on the security of voting machines. Simply casting doubt on the legitimacy of the results could achieve the goals of a government-sponsored hacking campaign, he said.  U.S. intelligence officials had previously stated that Russian intelligence had won access to multiple election officials but had said that compromised machines were not involved with vote tallies. But they had not said how sophisticated and extensive the effort was or how it worked. Russian President Vladimir Putin has strongly denied Russian government involvement in election hacking, though he said last week that patriotic Russians could have been involved. Trump has denied any collusion. SPEAR-PHISHING ON ELECTIONS OFFICIALS The newly leaked NSA report said the hackers used so-called spear-phishing techniques on election officials, trying to convince targets to click on links in emails that seemed to come from legitimate correspondents. The report describes just one phishing campaign, which hit state officials a week before the election, but does not give any locations or say if it was successful. Although there may have been many others, security experts said one coming so late in the game would be more likely to be about sowing chaos than  trying to alter vote counts.  The report did not say what the hackers were trying to accomplish, and any investigation of the computers of people who were targeted would be the jurisdiction of the FBI. An FBI spokeswoman declined to comment Tuesday, as did the office of the special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and the Russian government. The bait used in the spear-phishing campaign involved software for managing voter registration rolls. The hackers might have been considering deleting some records and forcing officials to turn legitimate voters away, said elections technology security expert Alex Halderman, of the University of Michigan. There were no wide reports of mass rejections of voters, so perhaps that plan was abandoned or proved too hard to execute, he said. It is also possible that the idea was to get onto the machines of officials who oversaw both registration and voting software. Elections are run by counties in the United States.  Depending on the countys configuration and security practices and what is separated from what, they could have access to potentially every aspect, from lists of registered voters, to voting  machines, to firmware on those machines, to the ballots that are presented, to the software that controls the final tally, Blaze said. This is the holy grail of what an attacker would want to compromise.  Members of Congress said they hoped to learn more about the hacking attempts. Its important that the American people understand that the Russian attempts to break into a number of our state voting processes - we talked about this in the fall - was broad-based, Democrat Mark Warner, vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence committee, told reporters. Its my hope in the coming days that we can get more information out about that. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The House Freedom Caucus, known for bucking Republican leadership on legislation including healthcare, has taken an official position on the traditional five-week break Congress takes from Washington: They dont want it. The Freedom Caucus supports the House staying in session through the August recess to continue working to accomplish the priorities of the American people, according to a brief statement the group issued late Tuesday. A spokeswoman for Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan, AshLee Strong, dismissed the idea of skipping the summer break. She said Republicans intend to stick to their agenda.

Republican President Donald Trump urged legislative leaders on Tuesday to finish an overhaul of the healthcare system this summer. The White House also wants faster action on another Trump priority: tax cuts. But there are just seven weeks left until the August break - and one of them, the first week of July, Congress will be out to mark the July 4 Independence Day holiday. An attempt to repeal and replace former President Barack Obamas Affordable Care Act passed the House in May but has not advanced in the Senate.

Hatch, whose panel oversees tax policy in the Senate, told a Washington tax policy forum he could also accept a tax reform plan that expands the federal deficit, despite opposition from deficit hawks. Trump and other Republicans have promised the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax system since the Reagan era. But the White House says a detailed proposal is not expected until September, allowing little time in 2017 for Congress to act on such a major piece of legislation. The White House wants to cut the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent, while Republicans in the House of Representatives have proposed 20 percent. But Hatch said he is not committed to any rate targets, because discussions have yet to focus on specific policy changes, including the elimination of tax breaks, needed to help pay for rate reductions. Until we perform the surgery and start eliminating preferences and credits in order to bring down rates ... we cannot speak definitively on the rate targets, the Utah Republican said. All of that is going to take some time, he added, a day after joining Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, White House economic adviser Gary Cohn and Republican congressional leaders for a weekly tax reform meeting on Capitol Hill.  The Trump administration and congressional Republicans are trying to forge agreement on a tax reform package that can clear the House and Senate this year. The main challenge is the 100-member Senate, where Republicans cannot afford to lose more than two votes from their 52-seat majority. A top issue for debate is whether tax reform should avoid expanding the deficit by including policy changes that pay for tax cuts. I dont see a problem with a tax reform proposal that loses revenue in the short term, if we can show that it will help put our economy on a better growth path, Hatch said.   However, we do have some budget hawks in our conference who will have a difficult time supporting a package that adds to the deficit, and well have to take that into account, because once again we cant afford to lose too many votes.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump pressed Republican congressional leaders on Tuesday to complete their overhaul of the U.S. healthcare system as lawmakers said they were making progress on a contentious effort that threatens to overwhelm their legislative agenda.  In a White House meeting, Trump welcomed indications by senior Republicans that the Senate might vote on a healthcare bill in July, before it breaks for the summer, after the House of Representatives passed its own version in May. Now the Senate Im sure will follow suit and get a bill across the finish line this summer that will be great healthcare and Im looking forward to seeing it, Trump said. The gathering included Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and his No. 2, Senator John Cornyn, along with House Speaker Paul Ryan and his deputies, Representatives Kevin McCarthy and Steve Scalise. Buffeted by criticism on many fronts, Trump wants faster action from his fellow Republicans who control Congress, pressing lawmakers to finish the job of dismantling the Obamacare healthcare law and move on quickly to another of his priorities: tax cuts. McConnell said Senate Republicans are getting close to a healthcare plan after he presented an outline at a lunchtime meeting but he declined to say when he might bring it up for a vote. Other senior Republicans say they hope to vote by early July. The leader would like to do this soon, Senator Orrin Hatch told reporters. The Senate requires a 60-vote supermajority to advance most legislation but Republican Mike Enzi, head of the Senate Budget Committee, said the health bill that passed the House qualifies for an expedited process that would require only 51 votes. Still, Republicans have little margin for error because they only control 52 seats in the 100-seat chamber and remain divided over key questions such as how quickly to scale back the Medicaid health plan for the poor. You have to get 50 people - that means they have to get me and a lot of people who are concerned about Medicaid, said Senator Shelly Moore Capito of West Virginia, a state that depends heavily on the program. Medicaid was expanded under Obamacare but the House bill would phase that expansion out in 2020. The Senate bill might keep the expansion in place beyond that date, said Republican Senator John Barrasso. Whatever the White Houses efforts to push ahead with policy plans, there will be a spotlight on testimony by James Comey, the FBI director fired by Trump last month, to the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday. Senators will question Comey on whether Trump tried to get him to back off an FBI investigation into ties between the presidents 2016 campaign and Russia, an attempt that critics have said could constitute obstruction of justice. Trump denies any collusion with Russia and has called the investigation a witch hunt. The Justice Department has appointed a special counsel to oversee its probe into the Russia issue and several congressional panels also are investigating the matter.   Elected on pledges to overhaul the healthcare system and slash taxes, Trump has yet to achieve a major legislative win, and time is running out before lawmakers leave Washington for the August break. There has been little progress on healthcare since the House passed its bill. McConnell told Reuters late last month he did not yet know how to amass the votes needed to pass a bill on  healthcare. He appeared to make some progress on Tuesday. Some Republican lawmakers praised an outline that McConnell presented at a lunchtime meeting, although they cautioned that much work remained to be done.  Senator Bill Cassidy said the plan offered more protections than the House bill for people who already have pre-existing illnesses when they apply for insurance coverage - a major point of contention. I think personally they are moving in the right direction, he said. The House healthcare bill could result in 23 million people losing insurance, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The bill also would reduce federal deficits by $119 billion between 2017 and 2026, according to the analysis.  Congress might then turn its focus to overhauling the tax code in September. While the administration would prefer that such changes not add to the national debt, Marc Short, Trumps top aide on Capitol Hill, told reporters on Monday that the top priority would be cutting taxes. The Trump administration has outlined a broad plan that would cut tax rates for businesses and streamline the tax system for individuals. The proposal has been short on details, including how much the tax cuts would cost and what loopholes would be closed. Others are eager to move past healthcare as well. We need to bring this to an end and move to taxes, said Republican Senator Lindsey Graham. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The front-runner in the Democratic primary, former Goldman Sachs Group Inc executive and one-time diplomat Phil Murphy, declared victory about 90 minutes after polls closed. Unofficial results posted on NJSpotlight.com showed him with more than twice as many votes as his nearest rival, former U.S. Treasury Department official Jim Johnson, in a six-way race. I humbly accept your nomination to be the Democratic candidate for governor of the great state of New Jersey, Murphy said on Twitter.  Lieutenant Governor Kim Guadagno, the Republican favorite to succeed Christie, also held a strong lead over four rivals in her partys primary, earning nearly half of the votes cast. Election results showed Guadagno with 47 percent of the Republican vote, followed by state Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli in second place with 31 percent. The two primary victors will face off in the general election in November to succeed Christie, a once-rising Republican star whose popularity has plunged in recent years. New Jersey and Virginia are the only two states holding gubernatorial elections this year. Earlier indications were that voter interest in the New Jersey gubernatorial primaries was low.  Murphy, who served as U.S. ambassador to Germany under former President Barack Obama, significantly out-spent his opponents, loaning $15 million to his own campaign. He was also endorsed by former Vice President Joe Biden and the states Democratic Party. With Christie frequently out on the stump for Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign, Guadagno has spent months as acting governor. But she has also had to distance herself from the unpopular Republican incumbent and has sparred with Ciattarelli over her plan to raise taxes on millionaires. While Christie was re-elected with 60 percent of the vote in 2013, his recent approval rating dropped to 20 percent following his frequent absences, the states 11 credit-rating downgrades and transportation problems.

Last week, Alaska warned thousands of state workers about potential layoffs unless legislators can agree on a fix to the fiscal crisis. The legislature has been convening through a special session, but Walker described the negotiations as in a stalemate. On Monday, Walker proposed a compromise package that would reduce the states deficit from at least $3.7 billion last year to a $300 million shortfall. Im not wild about the compromise, said Walker, an independent, during a news conference on Tuesday. But were running out of time. Pete Kelly, a Republican representing Fairbanks and the Republican-led Senate president, told reporters on Tuesday evening that the governors message was well received but that doesnt mean well agree to everything. The Senate was evaluating the package, but a reduced budget was still the priority, Kelly said.  Leaders of the Democratic-controlled House declined to comment. Since 2013, Alaska has struggled with substantial consecutive budget deficits, in part caused by the states large reliance on oil revenues and the continued low prices of oil. The state has balanced its budget over the last few years by drawing $10 billion from its savings without adding new revenues. The states budget has been slashed from $7.8 billion in 2013 to $4.3 billion proposed for 2018.  I know some people say, We need to do some cuts. Weve been doing that, Walker said on Tuesday. We have done that significantly.

Comeys highly anticipated appearance before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday could be a turning point in a controversy that has rocked Trumps young administration. In his first public remarks since Trump fired him last month, Comey is expected to tell the Senate Intelligence committee that Trump asked him during a meeting in the Oval Office to end the Federal Bureau of Investigations probe into ties between former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn and Russia. Comey may also detail other conversations with Trump.  Two legal experts said Comey would seek to avoid compromising a new inquiry led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller or separate congressional investigations. I would expect him to hew pretty closely to facts and events, said Jack Sharman, a partner at Lightfoot, Franklin and White and former special counsel to a congressional committee that investigated President Bill Clinton in the 1990s. Another source, who asked not to be named, said Comey does not see it as his role to charge the president or anyone else with obstruction of justice or any other crime. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in a report declassified in January that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a campaign not just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system, but to affect the elections outcome. Comey told the House of Representatives intelligence committee on March 20 that the FBI was probing Moscows role in the election, including possible Trump campaign collusion. Trump fired Comey on May 9, a step that stunned Washington and intensified scrutiny of the matter. Michael Flynn, Trumps national security adviser, was fired in February. The White House said he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about contacts Flynn had with Russias ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kislyak, before Trump took office. Federal prosecutors last month issued grand jury subpoenas seeking business records from people who worked with Flynn when he was a private citizen.

DeVos, a Republican who narrowly won Senate approval for her post in February after strident opposition from Democrats and a few fellow party members, testified before the Senate appropriations subcommittee on education about the proposed budget Trump submitted to Congress last month. Trumps plan to cut $9 billion from the Education Departments budget would improve educational opportunities and shift the federal role in education, DeVos told the panel. I understand those figures are alarming for many, she said. However, this budget refocuses the department on supporting states and school districts in their efforts to provide high-quality education to all our students. Democrats took turns asking DeVos about the bigger budget line-items and talking about students who they say could be hurt by large spending cuts. The most pointed exchanges were on whether private schools that receive federal funds would have to agree not to discriminate against students. DeVos would only repeat that schools taking federal money must abide by U.S. law. But Senator Jeff Merkley and his fellow Democrats said she was refusing to answer the question because federal law is unclear in many areas of possible discrimination, such as the rights of transgendered people. Lawmakers are expected to alter Trumps proposed budget before voting on it.  The subcommittees chair, conservative Republican Roy Blunt, said he believed Congress would not approve the budget as proposed. Such a significant cut to the departments budget is likely untenable, Blunt said, pressing specifically to preserve funds for technical programs, work-study financial aid and the Special Olympics. Civil rights groups and Democrats say the budget would send public dollars to private companies, disband after-school care, hurt schools in poor neighborhoods, shrink the ranks of teachers, and make it harder for many to afford college.  DeVos is currently working on major transformations in student loans. The budget suggests changing income-based repayment plans and ending loan forgiveness for workers in the public sector, which DeVos said would clear up confusion around the loans. With the stated aim of giving parents more choices for their childrens education, DeVos and Republicans support charter schools, which are publicly funded but operate independently, frequently by corporations, as well as subsidies to help pay private-school tuition. Many Republicans on the panel applauded the budgets proposal to boost such school choice programs. But the subcommittees senior Democrat, Patty Murray, said the cuts highlight the ways that the policies and priorities you and President Trump are pushing would hurt students, hurt communities, and represent a clear broken promise to workers and the middle class.

In the final months that President Barack Obama, a Democrat, was in office the department finalized a regulation easing the way for students from struggling for-profit colleges such as Corinthian and ITT Tech to quickly receive debt relief that they were entitled to by law.  In a letter sent on Monday to U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, the state attorneys general said they were concerned about growing backlogs of applications for the relief and of loans approved for discharge that simply need a sign-off. The letter, signed by the top lawyers of Illinois, California, Massachusetts and other states, was released on Tuesday. They said they were particularly troubled that some borrowers had been notified their loans were eligible for fast discharge under the regulation but that the cancellation has not yet happened. According to the letter, the Department stated in January it had notified 23,000 borrowers that their loan forgiveness should be complete within the 60 to 120 days, but in many cases loans have not been canceled.  That means some of Corinthians students could still be on the hook for monthly payments or possibly face debt collection. Work on discharging loans that have been approved is underway, according to Education Department Press Secretary Liz Hill. We are working with servicers to get these loans discharged as expeditiously as possible, Hill said in a statement. Some borrowers should expect to obtain discharges within the next few weeks. Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring said about 5,000 past Corinthian students in the state received letters last December directing to apply on-line for relief. Since then, his office has received queries about delays in the process.    Delay in canceling this debt, especially for students who have already been approved, could put even greater financial strain on students in Virginia and around the country, he said in a statement. Amid federal and state investigations in 2015 into its post-graduation rates, for-profit Corinthian filed for bankruptcy and abruptly closed its 28 schools.

The chairman of the influential House Energy and Commerce Committee said he planned to unveil a package of legislation to overhaul federal rules governing self-driving vehicles. Were getting very close. I think its a good package. Weve put a lot of work into it, Representative Greg Walden of Oregon said in an interview, adding that there was good bipartisan agreeement and he hoped to unveil and take up the package in the next month or two. Senator John Thune, a Republican who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, is also working on a legislative self-driving proposal with Senator Gary Peters, a Michigan Democrat. Were not there yet but we are getting closer, Thune said.  Thune and Walden spoke to Reuters on Tuesday after getting a ride in a self-driving Audi, a unit of Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE). Companies such as Alphabet Inc and Ford Motor Co are aggressively pursuing automated technologies and want unified federal regulations to replace outdated rules and make it simpler to develop and eventually sell the technology across the country. This spring, Republican staff drafted a summary of 16 potential legislative proposals on federal reforms and regulations that they circulated to automakers and which was seen by Reuters.  Among proposals under consideration is one to allow the U.S. Transportation Department to exempt up to 100,000 autonomous vehicles from current safety standards, which were written on the assumption responsibility for a cars operation rested with the human driver. The existing motor vehicle safety standards bar the sale of vehicles without steering wheels and gas pedals, for example. Alphabet Incs Waymo unit has called for those rules  be changed. Another proposal would prohibit a state from restricting testing by a manufacturer of up to 250 vehicles and comes as automakers have sparred with California over revisions to its self-driving car testing rules.  Thune said he planned to hold a hearing on June 14 about self-driving car issues but did not put a specific timetable on introducing legislation. He said he wanted to avoid a patchwork of regulations from 50 different states on self-driving cars and look at cybersecurity and other issues. The key thing is to make sure we stay in the lead on the innovation that there arent unnecessary roadblocks in the way, balancing that with safety, Walden said. On Monday, the U.S. Transportation Department said it would unveil revised self-driving guidelines within the next few months, responding to automakers calls for regulations to sanction costly efforts to put autonomous vehicles on the road. The voluntary guidelines would provide direction to states on self-driving cars as Congress works to set more permanent rules to oversee autonomous vehicles. But legislation might not be approved this year and states and automakers are eager for guidance from regulators in the interim. Vehicle crashes annually kill more than 35,000 people on U.S. roads and injure 2.4 million. Walden said the goal was to get self-driving cars on the roads in big numbers so in a generation people would say: What a bunch of barbarians - they drove themselves? Are you kidding me? And look at how many died every year and they thought that was acceptable? ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Trumps @realDonaldTrump account recently blocked a number of accounts that replied to his tweets with commentary that criticized, mocked or disagreed with his actions. Twitter users are unable to see or respond to tweets from accounts that block them.  The Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University in New York said in its letter that the blocking suppressed speech in a public forum protected by the Constitution. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Twitter Inc said it had no comment. Alex Abdo, the institutes senior staff attorney, likened Twitter to a modern form of town hall meeting or public comment periods for government agency proposals, both venues where U.S. law requires even-handed treatment of speech. Eric Goldman, a Santa Clara University law professor who focuses on internet law, said that previous cases involving politicians blocking users on Facebook (FB.O) supported the Knight Institutes position. If the institute should sue, Trump could claim his @realDonaldTrump account is for personal use and separate from his official duties as president, Goldman said. But he called that defense laughable. Trump also has a presidential @POTUS Twitter account. The Knight Institute said its arguments would apply with equal force to both accounts.  Trumps Twitter use has drawn intense media attention for his unvarnished commentary about his agenda and attacks on critics. His tweets are often retweeted tens of thousands of times, and can shape the news cycle.  Legal experts have said his tweets may directly affect policy. A chain of postings about his travel ban may hamper his administrations defense in courts. The letter said Trump or his aides blocked the accounts @AynRandPaulRyan and @joepabike, belonging to songwriter Holly OReilly and professional cyclist and author Joseph M. Papp, respectively. OReilly was blocked on May 28 after posting a brief animated clip of Pope Francis appearing uncomfortable during a meeting with Trump with a caption, this is pretty much how the whole world sees you, the letter said. Papp learned he was blocked on June 4 after responding to a Trump tweet with a tweet labeling the president a #fake leader.

Governor Greg Abbott, who sets the agenda for special sessions, told a news conference the session would begin in July and the first item of business would be approving a bill that keeps some state agencies open.  If approved by the Senate, he then would allow for consideration of nearly 20 other items, including a bathroom bill. At a minimum we need a law that protects the privacy of our children in our public schools, Abbott said. Political and business analysts said passage of such a bill would put Texas, the most powerful Republican-controlled state, in the spotlight on an issue that has been a flashpoint in U.S. culture wars.   The issue has opened divisions in the Republican party, which dominates Texas politics, pitting the pro-business establishment wing against the powerful socially conservative wing, which says a bathroom law is a common-sense measure needed to protect privacy. A similar law in North Carolina, partially repealed in March, prompted the relocation of sporting events and economic boycotts that were estimated to have cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars.  The stakes are far higher in Texas, which has an economy larger than Russias. The Texas Legislature meets every other year. In March, the Senate passed a bill backed by social conservative Republican Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick that would require people to use restrooms in public schools and buildings that correspond with the gender on their birth certificate, not the gender with which they identify. The Texas Association of Business, the states largest employer group, called the legislation, known as Senate Bill 6, discriminatory, and said it would hurt businesses trying to attract talent. It said the state could lose about $5.6 billion through 2026 if enacted.  SB 6 died in the House when the regular session ended in late May. Republican Speaker Joe Straus, seen as representing the partys business wing, has said the legislation was unnecessary and could cause economic damage. If a tough bathroom bill is enacted, Straus San Antonio constituency could lose its rights to host the mens NCAA Final Four basketball championship next year, an event expected to bring in more than $200 million in revenue.

Prime Minister Theresa May called Trumps comments wrong. Trump has lambasted Khan on Twitter, accusing him of making a pathetic excuse, for saying Londoners should not be alarmed by the sight of additional police on the streets of the British capital after Saturdays attack that killed seven people. The invitation has been issued and accepted and I see no reason to change that, but as far as what Sadiq Khan has said about the reassurances hes offered the people of London, I think he was entirely right to speak in the way he did, Johnson said in a BBC radio interview when asked whether Trumps state visit should be canceled. No date has been set for the visit, which was agreed during Mays visit to Washington in January and seen as a sign of her desire to maintain good ties with Britains traditional close ally as Trump began his presidency. The Conservative prime minister has said Khan is doing a good job, echoing public sentiment across London. On Tuesday, May told a political rally in response to a question about Trumps tweets, I think Donald Trump was wrong in the things that he has said about Sadiq Khan.  Trump and Khan, the son of Pakistani immigrants and the first Muslim elected as Londons mayor, have been at odds since Khan denounced as ignorant Trumps campaign pledge to impose a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. Since taking office on Jan. 20, Trump has ordered temporary travel restrictions on people from several Muslim-majority countries, although the ban is currently held up by federal courts. Asked on Tuesday about the London visit, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said only that Trump intended to go and that he appreciates her majestys gracious invitation. Asked on Monday evening if he would like Trumps visit to be called off, Khan, a member of Britains opposition Labour party, said his position remained the same. I dont think we should roll out the red carpet to the president of the USA in the circumstances where his policies go against everything we stand for, Khan told Channel 4 News. Tim Farron, leader of the opposition Liberal Democrats, also has urged May to cancel the visit, saying Trump was insulting Britains values at a time of introspection and mourning. Former Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, defeated by Trump last November, praised Khans performance in dealing with the attacks.  Speaking at a fundraising event on Monday, she did not name Trump but said it was not the time to lash out, to incite fear and use trash talk and terror for political gain, the Washington Examiner reported. Deputy White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters on Monday that she did not think it was correct to characterize Trumps tweets as picking a fight with Khan.  Asked if Trump was attacking the mayor because he is Muslim, Sanders replied: Not at all. And I think to suggest something like that is utterly ridiculous. Trumps oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., defended his father. Every time he puts something out there he gets criticized by the media. All day, every day, Trump Jr. said in an interview with ABCs Good Morning America broadcast on Tuesday.   And guess what, hes been proven right about it, every time. We keep saying, Its going to be great and Hold fast, Were going to keep calm and carry on. Maybe we have to keep calm and actually do something, he said. He was referring to a World War Two-era slogan of resilience, to keep calm and carry on, that Britons have echoed following the London attack. British author J.K. Rowling said on Tuesday that if a state visit did go ahead, Trumps tweets related to the attack should be enlarged and shown wherever he goes. Id rather he didnt come, but if he does, Id like his vile Tweets juxtaposed against whatever hes been coaxed to read off an autocue, Rowling, celebrated for her Harry Potter books and a frequent critic of Trump, wrote on Twitter.

Judge Joan Lefkow said she will rule on a motion by healthcare advocates concerned that Illinois ongoing budget impasse and its resulting backlog of nearly $14.7 billion in unpaid bills is harming Medicaid recipients access to medical care. David Chizewer, a lawyer representing the recipients, told Lefkow earlier on Tuesday that a court determination giving precedence to Medicaid payments could lead to a compromise with the state over the next few days. Otherwise, the plaintiffs are asking the court to begin contempt proceedings against the nations fifth-largest state. Illinois officials have warned that an increase in priority payments could push the cash-strapped state to the point where court-mandated spending could exceed available revenue. [nL1N1IY2GV] Each month, priority payments of $1.85 billion are allocated to schools, local governments, payroll, bonds and consent decrees, consuming 90 percent of Illinois monthly revenue, according to a court document filed by the state. Both sides told Lefkow on Tuesday that they failed to reach a compromise on speeding money to managed-care organizations participating in the Medicaid program, which provides health services to 3 million poor and disabled Illinois residents. The plaintiffs are from cases dating back to 1992 and that resulted in federal consent decrees requiring the state to continue to make Medicaid payments despite its budget problems. Illinois is limping toward the June 30 end of a second-straight fiscal year without a complete spending plan due to a political stalemate between its Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature.  Lawmakers ended their spring session last week without a fiscal 2018 budget deal, triggering downgrades that pushed Illinois credit ratings from S&P and Moodys Investors Service to a step above junk. [nL1N1IY1R2] Brent Stratton, an assistant Illinois attorney general, said the issue is not that the state is unwilling to pay Medicaid providers, but that it is unable to pay them promptly. He told the judge that missing high priority payments on Illinois roughly $30 billion of general obligation bonds would result in a default, while skipping payments to public school districts could force some to shut down. S&P has warned that Illinois budget crisis could lead to bond payments being squeezed out by other spending priorities. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""McAllen, Texas (Reuters) - Standing on the bluffs of Roma, Texas on a May afternoon two border patrol agents look out over the meandering Rio Grande River that separates Mexico from the United States and recall a time when the scene was far less tranquil.  Last fall, during the waning months of the Obama administration, hundreds of immigrants crossed the river on rafts at this point each day, many willingly handing themselves over to immigration authorities in hopes of being released into the United States to await court proceedings that would decide their fate.  Now, the agents look out on an empty landscape. Foot paths up from the water have started to disappear under growing brush, with only the stray baby shoe or toothbrush serving as reminders of that migrant flood.  The reason for the change, the agents say, is a perception in Mexico and Central America that President Donald Trump has ended the practice known as catch-and-release, in which immigrants caught in the United States without proper documents were released to live free, often for years, as their cases ran through the court system. Now, would-be border violators know theyll be detained and then turned right back around, said one of the two agents, Marlene Castro. Its not worth it anymore, she said.  Castro was simply echoing her boss, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, who said on a visit to El Paso, Texas in April, We have ended dangerous catch-and-release enforcement policies. But immigration attorneys, government statistics and even some officials from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which falls under Kelly, suggest that despite the DHS chiefs statement, there has been no clear change to the catch-and-release policy. Thats in large part because there are legal constraints on who can be detained and for how long, due to a shortage of beds and a court ruling limiting the stay of women and children in custody to 21 days.  A separate court ruling limits detention time for immigrants whose countries refuse to repatriate them. And Kelly noted in a February memorandum that asylum seekers that have proven they have a credible fear of returning home could be candidates for release if they present neither a security risk nor a risk of absconding. Daniel Bible, ICE field office director for Southern Texas, told Reuters he and his colleagues have not been issued new directions, and so continue to release illegal immigrants deemed to be low security risks, usually with notices to appear in court. We look at each case the same way we always have, Bible said.  DHS spokeswoman Jenny Burke confirmed to Reuters that the agency has not issued new guidance for releasing migrants caught at the border.  Asked to explain why there had been no new guidance, given Kellys statement in April, Burke said, ICE officers make custody determinations on a case-by-case basis, prioritizing detention resources. In a memo made public in February, Kelly defined catch and release as any policy that allows immigrants to be released from detention while they await their court hearings, making it easy to abscond. Ending catch and release was one of Trumps central promises during the 2016 presidential campaign. Some advocates who work with migrants say they have seen little change since Trump came into office. Sure, people are still being released, said Kevin Appleby, senior director of international migration policy at the Center for Migration Studies. Not because they believe in releasing them, but because there are not enough beds at the moment.  ICE declined to provide data on the number of migrants being released into the United States. But other ICE data not previously published and reviewed by Reuters shows the pool of people not in custody and awaiting court appearances is growing.  Since Trump took office in late January, the number of immigrants awaiting court proceedings while living freely in the United States has grown by nearly 30,000, rising by an average of about 7,500 per month, according to the ICE data. During the last seven months of President Barack Obamas presidency, the rolls of those awaiting legal proceedings outside of custody grew more rapidly, at an average of about 20,600 people per month. Part of the slower rate under Trump can be traced to a 58 percent drop in apprehensions of people crossing the border. Still, the numbers suggest the Trump administration is a long way from ending catch-and-release.  NumbersUSA, a Washington-based organization that supports limited immigration, praised the Trump administrations tough talk and its chilling effect on illegal immigration. That impact will be temporary, though, unless the administration follows through by ending catch and release for good, it said. The Trump administration though has come up against the reality that there simply is not enough space in detention centers.  Congress has funded about 34,000 beds to detain immigration violators, and the average daily population of detainees has been near or above capacity since before Trump took office.       One way the administration hopes to free up detention space is to decrease the time it takes to resolve cases.  The Justice Department has requested funding to hire an additional 125 immigration judges over the next two years, an increase of 50 percent.  In the meantime, some border officials hope would-be migrants remain nervous. When told that ICE detention centers are still releasing many immigrants to live in the United States, Castro and her border agent colleague, who declined to be named, exchanged a look and then shrugged. Dont tell them that, her colleague said. -See a related photo essay here reut.rs/2qZcutn ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The officials filed a legal brief with the Supreme Court as it mulls whether to take up the Trump administrations appeal of lower court rulings blocking the travel ban signed by the Republican president on March 6 and let it go into effect. In the states brief, filed on Monday, Texas Solicitor General Scott Keller wrote that the executive order does not mention religion at all and distinguishes people based only on nationality. The executive order therefore is emphatically not a Muslim ban, Keller wrote. Keller added that courts should be careful when second-guessing a presidents national security determinations, an argument that echoes the administrations view that the judiciary should defer to the president on such matters. The brief said the order did not violation the Constitutions ban on the government favoring or disfavoring any particular religion or its guarantee of due process. The filing came after the administration asked the high court last Thursday to allow the order to take effect. [nL1N1IZ03Q] Aside from Texas, the officials were Republican state attorneys general from Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Kansas, Louisiana, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee and West Virginia, as well as Mississippis Republican governor. Three Republican attorneys general came from states with Democratic governors: Louisiana, Montana and West Virginia. Most of the states had also backed Trump earlier in the litigation. Many Democratic state officials have opposed the ban in lower courts. The high court is due to review legal papers filed by the bans challengers, backed by the American Civil Liberties Union, before acting. The briefs are due on Monday. A key issue before the justices in whether Trumps comments during the 2016 president campaign, including calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States, can be used as evidence that his order was intended to discriminate against Muslims.  The administration filed emergency applications with the justices seeking to block lower court rulings that went against Trumps order barring entry for people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days while the U.S. government implements stricter visa screening. Trumps order also called for suspending all refugee admissions for 120 days. The move comes after the Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on May 25 upheld a Maryland judges ruling blocking the order. [nL1N1IR1FY]  Potentially making it harder for his lawyers to win at the Supreme Court, Trump again commented on the case on Monday, tweeting complaints that his own administration had issued a watered down, politically correct version of an earlier order he signed on Jan. 27 that also was blocked by courts.

The measure would impose a tax on imports while favoring domestic production.  The meetings, which will begin on Tuesday and conclude on Thursday, will include lawmakers and staff from several states including Arizona, Indiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania, focusing on districts represented by members who have not taken a position on the tax or sit on the Ways and  Means Committee. They hope to convince them to oppose the tax. The meetings are the latest effort by retailers to lobby lawmakers to not support a tax they say would increase consumer prices for imported goods. U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan has remained a driving force behind the border tax proposal, arguing that economic forces will keep the tax from raising consumer prices. The future of the tax remains shaky. President Donald Trump has refused to endorse it and many Republicans in the House and Senate are opposed. Furthermore, the effort to pass tax reform has stalled. Marc Short, the White House director of legislative affairs, said on Monday in a briefing with reporters that tax rate cuts remained a priority, a signal that sweeping tax reform could be dropped in favor of just reducing tax levels.

At home, Trumps administration has been plagued by questions over links to the Russian government. Tillerson said Trump told him to try to improve ties with Russia regardless of the U.S. political backdrop.

U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in January that Moscow tried to tilt the election campaign in Trumps favor, including by hacking into the emails of senior Democrats, a charge the Kremlin denies. Trump has denied any collusion but the FBI and congressional probes into the Russia matter have dogged the early months of his presidency. Tillerson said the Asia-Pacific region remained extremely important for the United States both in terms of national security and economic interests.

Obviously, (it is) a little bit more expensive, but its not the end of the world, he added. He said that the Chinese content of cars traded between North American countries was very low, about 3 percent, largely using parts that are no longer produced in the region, such as flat panel display screens and other electronic items. This idea that Mexico is being used as a back door for Chinese imports into the U.S. is not the right one, he said. Under the current NAFTA agreement, motor vehicles must have 62.5 percent North American content, a figure that U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has said is too low and allows for too much content from other regions to benefit from NAFTA tariff-free status. Guajardo warned that raising the bar too high on North American content could make the region less competitive. We can make an effort to strengthen that, no question about it. But if you go too far, you may be shooting yourself in the foot, because youre losing competitiveness, he said. Negotiations to modernize the 23-year-old NAFTA trade deal are expected to start after Aug. 16, at the conclusion of a U.S. government consultation period with lawmakers, industries and the public. Guajardo also said that he and Ross were close to announcing an agreement on sugar trade between the two countries.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

(Reuters) - Legislative candidate Jennifer Carroll Foys first bid for office puts her on the front lines of a Virginia statewide election being watched for early hints on how voters feel about President Donald Trump. Citing Trumps victory as a tipping point that pushed her to run, the 35-year-old public defender is one of 49 Democrats vying for Republican-held seats in the states House of Delegates, up from 29 two years ago. The races will test whether Democrats can convert Virginians unfavorable opinion of the Republican president in polls into votes and start clawing back some of the almost 1,000 legislative seats lost nationwide under Democratic President Barack Obama. Foy, long frustrated by her state legislatures attitude toward womens rights, is seeking a suburban Washington seat in one of the 17 Republican-controlled districts that voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton last year. Trump was just confirmation that were regressing and not progressing, Foy told Reuters. Enough is enough. If its not me (to run), then who? If its not now, then when? Republicans hold a 66-34 advantage in the lower house of the Virginia legislature. Stephen Farnsworth, a political analyst at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, expects Democrats will make significant gains, especially by focusing on suburban districts. But a takeover of the chamber would require a collapse of Trump supporters, he told Reuters. A Democratic majority in the House of Delegates is going to require a tidal wave, Farnsworth said. The national mood has made Virginia Democrats hopeful. Opposition to Trump has galvanized hundreds of thousands of Americans and fueled huge turnouts at street protests since the  New York real estate developers January inauguration.  A poll by the Washington Post and George Mason Universitys Schar School out May 22 showed 59 percent of Virginia voters disapproved of Trumps performance, compared with 36 percent who approved. Weve got two things going for us in this upcoming election, and thats going to keep energy high, said David Toscano,Democratic leader in the Virginia House. Voting for somebody, and also voting against somebody. Mark Walter, president of the national Republican State Leadership Committee, said his party was watching Virginia but that it was difficult to tell how voter feelings about Trump would affect the races.  In New Jersey, the only other state holding statewide elections this fall, Democrats already control both chambers. The Virginia Republican Party is unfazed by the surge of challengers. Republicans had $6.5 million for House races by the end of March, compared with the Democrats $2.8 million, according to the most recent numbers from the state elections department.  Were doing what weve always done, Chairman John Whitbeck said in an interview with Reuters. Raise a lot of money, knock on a lot of doors and win a lot of seats.  Toscano, the House Democratic leader, said his partys candidates would use congressional Republicans efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Obamas signature domestic legacy, as a campaign issue, as well as Trumps brief hiring freeze for most federal workers. The party also will cite Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffes legacy of adding thousands of new jobs and billions in capital investment as a selling point, Toscano said.  McAuliffe cannot run again due to term limits, but the edge fellow Democrats have in the race to replace him is expected to give the partys House hopefuls a boost. Democrats consider the 2nd District, home to sprawling housing subdivisions, strip malls and the Quantico Marine base, one of the partys best bets to pick up a seat.  Clinton won the district by 21 points in November, helping her win a state that was once reliably Republican in presidential elections. Foy and fellow Democrat Josh King will compete in the June 13 primary. The winner will face Republican Laquan Austion in November for the seat being vacated by the Republican incumbent, who is not seeking re-election. All three candidates say voters are more concerned about local issues, such as traffic jams, education and pollution from power plant coal ash, than Trump. Obviously, the Trump effect is in the air, but were focusing the energy into what we can do locally, said King, 36, a deputy sheriff who narrowly lost the 2015 election for the seat.

A State Department spokeswoman confirmed Ranks departure, but said she was unable to verify Twitter posts that said he resigned as he felt unable to deliver a formal notification to China of the U.S. decision last week to quit the agreement. He has retired from the foreign service, said Anna Richey-Allen, a spokeswoman for the departments East Asia Bureau. Mr. Rank has made a personal decision. We appreciate his years of dedicated service to the State Department. Iowa Governor Terry Branstad, President Donald Trumps pick as the next U.S. ambassador to Beijing, is expected to take up the post later this month. A tweet from China expert John Pomfret quoted unnamed sources as saying that Rank had resigned as he could not support Trumps decision last week to withdraw from the Paris agreement. Another tweet from Pomfret said Rank called a town hall meeting to announce his decision to embassy staff and explained that he could not deliver a diplomatic note informing the Chinese government of the U.S. decision. A senior U.S. official confirmed the account given in the tweets but added that after Rank announced his intention to retire on Monday in Beijing, he was told by the State Department to leave his post immediately. The official spoke on condition of anonymity. On June 1, the U.S. State Department accepted the resignation of its top personnel officer, who had been among its  few remaining senior Obama administration political appointees, another U.S. official said. Arnold Chacon had served as the director general of the foreign service and director of human resources. The official said Chacon had tendered his resignation when Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20, along with all presidential appointees, who serve at the pleasure of the president and secretary of state. The acceptance of Chacons resignation was first reported by the DiploPundit website. It was not immediately clear whether he would be offered another post at the department.  Other than Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, his deputy John Sullivan and Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Tom Shannon, the third-ranking U.S. diplomat, most of the State Departments senior posts are currently vacant or filled by acting officials. Chacon could not immediately be reached for comment.  Contacted by Reuters for comment, Rank, a career foreign service officer who took over the post of deputy chief of mission in Beijing in January 2016, referred all questions to the U.S. embassy. Jonathan Fritz, the embassys economics councilor, would serve as charg in his place, Richey-Allen said. Rank had been with the department for 27 years and served as the political councilor at the U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan from 2011 to 2012. Trumps announcement on Thursday that he would withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord, saying it would undermine the U.S. economy and cost jobs, drew anger and condemnation from world leaders and heads of industry.

Senate Republicans will vote on their version of healthcare reform legislation before lawmakers August recess, White House Director of Legislative Affairs Marc Short said. The House of Representatives passed a bill in May. Theres been a lot of discussions with staff, Short told reporters at a briefing. I think the text is pretty far along. Congress will then turn its focus to overhauling the tax code in September. While the administration would prefer that the effort not add to the national debt, Short stressed that the top priority would be cutting taxes. We want it to be revenue neutral, and we are still supportive of tax reform, but I am also saying to you that what we believe is most important to get the economy going is the tax cuts, he said.  President Donald Trump will meet with the Republican leaders of the House and the Senate, Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell, on Tuesday to discuss the path forward for his agenda, said White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters. Trump has pressed for quicker action in Congress, but his administration has also been hampered by investigations into alleged ties between Trumps election campaign and Russia. The Trump administration has outlined a broad plan that would cut tax rates for businesses and streamline the tax system for individuals. But, the proposal has been short on details  including the cost of the tax cuts and what loopholes would be closed.      The healthcare bill passed by the House could result in 23 million people losing insurance, the Congressional Budget Office estimated, a conclusion that Republicans were quick to challenge. The bill would also reduce federal deficits by $119 billion between 2017 and 2026, according to the analysis. Short said he believed that the Senate healthcare bill would be similar to the House package.  Senator John Cornyn, the No.2 Republican in the Senate, said Monday evening he thought there would be a vote on a healthcare bill in the Senate in July. Short also said the White House expects for Congress to raise the governments borrowing authority, also known as the debt limit, before the August recess.

Trump accused Khan of making a pathetic excuse over his statement urging Londoners not to be alarmed by the presence of additional police on the streets in response to the attack. But British Prime Minister Theresa May said Khan was doing a good job, echoing public sentiment across London. Three jihadis drove a van into pedestrians on London Bridge  on Saturday night before running into the bustling Borough Market area where they slit peoples throats and stabbed them indiscriminately. Police shot dead all three attackers. Khan had said on Sunday morning that people would see an increased police presence on the streets of the capital and should not be alarmed by that. Trump mocked Khans comment on Sunday, suggesting in a tweet that the mayor was downplaying the attacks. A spokesman for Khan responded that the mayor has more important things to do than respond to Donald Trumps ill-informed tweet that deliberately takes out of context his remarks. Trumps comments drew widespread scorn in Britain but the U.S. leader went on the attack again on Monday, saying in a tweet: Pathetic excuse by London Mayor Sadiq Khan who had to think fast on his no reason to be alarmed statement. MSM is working hard to sell it! Trump wrote. MSM referred to mainstream media. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said she did not think it was fair to characterize Trumps tweets as picking a fight with Khan, who is the first Muslim elected as London mayor. The point is, there is a reason to be alarmed. We have constant attacks going on, not just there but across the globe, and we have to start putting national security and global security at an all time high, she told a White House briefing. Khan said he had been too busy dealing with the fallout from the attack to respond directly to the tweet. Khan, who belongs to the opposition Labour Party, is popular in London and his response to Saturdays killings has been widely praised as dignified. Prime Minister May, the Conservative Party leader, was asked earlier on Monday about Trumps criticism of Khan. I think Sadiq Khan is doing a good job and it is wrong to say anything else, she said. Khans statement on Sunday morning condemned the attack and gave a number of details about what had happened and what measures were being taken in response. Londoners will see an increased police presence today and over the course of the next few days. No reason to be alarmed. One of the things the police, all of us need to do is make sure were as safe as we possibly can be, Khan said. In his Sunday tweet, Trump commented: At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is no reason to be alarmed! It was met with a barrage of criticism in both Britain and the United States, with former Vice President Al Gore among many public figures who accused Trump of misrepresenting what Khan had said. A YouGov poll of 1,000 Londoners published on Monday found that Khan was more trusted than both May and national Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to make the right decisions about keeping Britain safe from terrorism. My focus from Saturday night has been working with the police the emergency services and the government to deal with the horrific attack on Saturday, Khan told Sky News, when asked about Trumps latest tweet. I just havent got time to respond to tweets from Donald Trump. Ive got better and more important things to focus on.     The two men have history. During the U.S. presidential election campaign, Khan was among many people who spoke out against Trumps proposed ban on Muslims entering the United States, an idea he said would play into the hands of extremists. During a visit to Chicago in September last year, Khan endorsed Trumps opponent Hillary Clinton. In March, after an attack by an Islamic militant that left five people dead in Westminster, central London, Trumps son Donald Trump Jr. issued a tweet that criticized Khan. Trump Jr. wrote You have got to be kidding me?! above a link to an article reporting comments Khan had made months earlier.

He assailed the Justice Department for a revised version of the measure that he called watered down and politically correct.   The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about George Conways tweets.  The travel ban, which Trump says is aimed at preventing attacks in the United States, seeks to halt entry to the United States for 90 days for people from several predominantly Muslim countries and bar refugees for four months.

Trumps proposal to spin off air traffic control from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was part of a weeklong White House focus on infrastructure. The administration is looking to shift the spotlight back onto Trumps agenda and away from a growing probe into alleged ties between his campaign and Russia. Were proposing reduced wait times, increased route efficiency and far fewer delays, Trump said. Our plan will get you where you need to go quickly, more reliably, more affordably, and yes, for the first time in a long time, on time. Executives from United Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines [HAII.UL], American Airlines and Southwest Airlines, all represented by the Airlines for America lobbying group, attended the Trump speech. The group praised the Trump plan, which most airlines back.  The proposal, which would require congressional approval, is opposed by many Democrats and some Republicans. The FAA spends nearly $10 billion a year on air traffic control funded largely through passenger user fees, and has spent more than $7.5 billion on next-generation air traffic control reforms in recent years. Trump said current air traffic reform efforts have failed and were a total waste of money. It is unclear if privatization would speed the rollout of new  systems such as satellite-based aircraft tracking that replaces ground radar dating back to World War Two. Proponents say a private entity could sign contracts with vendors more quickly than if deals are put through the FAAs procurement process, which also is subject to budget instability.  Opponents, including Delta Air Lines, say the U.S. system is so large that privatization would not save money, and would drive up ticket costs and could create a national security risk. Opponents also say technology upgrades would be sidetracked while the private entity was set up, potentially adding years to awarding contracts.  There also are concerns that airlines would dominate the private-company board and limit access to airports by business jets.  The new systems would represent major wins for U.S. companies that have been positioning for the shift. Technology company Harris Corp is a leading candidate to supply the FAA with real-time aircraft tracking data in partnership with satellite operator Iridium Communications Inc. Harris already provides a similar data feed using 640 ground-based antenna towers, and the FAA is its largest customer, Chief Executive Bill Brown said in an interview. Iridium has a joint venture that has partnered with air traffic control authorities in Canada, Italy, Ireland and Denmark to provide air traffic surveillance, in cooperation with Harris.  Under Trumps proposal, a board made up of airline, union and airport officials would oversee the nonprofit entity that would assume oversight after a three-year transition. House of Representatives Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement that Trump was recycling a tired Republican plan that both sides of the aisle have rejected and would hand control of one of our nations most important public assets to special interests and the big airlines. The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association said it will not support a plan that imposes fees on small plane owners. The U.S. has a very safe air traffic system today and we dont hear complaints from our nearly 350,000 members about it, said Mark Baker, the groups president. The infrastructure push comes as the White House seeks to refocus attention on core promises to boost jobs and the economy Trump made last year during his presidential campaign. Those pledges have been eclipsed by the furor over Russias alleged meddling in the election. That drama will come to a head on Thursday when former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey, who was leading the Russia probe until Trump fired him last month, testifies before a Senate panel. Trump has denied any collusion between Russia and his campaign. He has struggled to keep the spotlight on plans that could give him a political boost.

Comey was leading a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe into alleged Russian meddling in last years U.S. presidential election and possible collusion by Trumps campaign when the president fired him last month. Presidents can assert executive privilege to prevent government employees from sharing information.  If Trump had asserted executive privilege over Comey, it would have likely created the perception that the administration was seeking to hide information about the FBIs Russia investigation. It has been reported that Comey plans to talk about conversations in which Trump pressured him to drop his investigation into former national security advisor Mike Flynn, who was fired for failing to disclose conversations with Russian officials.  Both Trumps fellow Republicans and Democrats from the intelligence panel said they intended to grill Comey about whether Trump tried to get him to back off the investigation. Comeys appearance before the Senate Intelligence Committee as part of its Russia-related investigation will be his first public testimony since his firing on May 9. It is overshadowing other events in Washington, threatening to dampen already flagging momentum for Trumps legislative agenda of rolling back President Barack Obamas healthcare reforms and overhauling the tax code. U.S. intelligence officials have said Russia tried to interfere in the election to sway the vote in Trumps favor, a charge the Kremlin has repeatedly denied. Trump has denied any collusion between his campaign and Russia. Comeys appearance will be carried on live television. News stations, including Fox News Channel, will carry the hearing. Variety reported on Monday that at least two U.S. networks, ABC and CBS, had made the unusual decision to break into their daytime programming to carry it. Senator Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the Senate, said he expected Comeys testimony would not be his last before Congress.

The pressure is mounting for the federal government to do something about autonomous vehicles, U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said on Monday in Detroit. However, Chao told reporters the federal government should be careful before setting binding rules to govern autonomous vehicles. We dont want rules that impede future technological advances, Chao said. Chao was not specific about what her departments proposals would include, or how they would differ from policy guidance proposed by the Obama administration. Companies including Alphabet Incs self-driving car Waymo unit, General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co, Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL], Tesla Inc and other are aggressively pursuing automated vehicle technologies. We need a more concrete regulatory framework, Ken Washington, chief technology officer of Ford, said in Detroit. Automakers could use a clear set of rules to certify on their own that an autonomous vehicle is safe, as they can now with conventional vehicles, Washington said.   Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr said at a forum in Washington he feels quite confident that the hardware and software will be ready by 2021 for self-driving cars. But other big issues loom. Things like ethics, Ford said, saying does the vehicle opt to save 10 pedestrians or the driver. Individual automakers cannot program separate ethics software for self-driving cars but must work together as an industry, Ford said.  Ron Medford, Waymos director of safety, said in Detroit he expected autonomous cars would appear first in managed fleet operations, not as vehicles sold to individuals.  Chao, in remarks prepared for delivery in Detroit, said the new rules would support industry innovation and aim to encourage new entrants and ideas that deliver safer vehicles. Automakers have met with Chao on several occasions in recent months and urged her to make changes to Obama-era automated vehicle rules.  Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee have also been working on a package of legislation to make it easier to get self-driving cars on the road. A U.S. Senate committee is also planning a new hearing this month on self-driving cars. The Obama guidelines called on automakers to voluntarily submit details of self-driving vehicle systems to regulators in a 15-point safety assessment and urge states to defer to the federal government on most vehicle regulations. Automakers have raised numerous concerns about the guidance, including that it requires them to turn over significant data, could delay testing by months and lead to states making the voluntary guidelines mandatory.

In a series of early morning Twitter messages, Trump returned to the issue of the travel ban that he raised immediately after an attack in London on Saturday night that killed 7 people and wounded 48.  Legal experts said Trumps tweets could complicate his legal teams defense of the ban, since they contradict some of the arguments the governments lawyers are making in court. Trump has presented the measure, which seeks to halt entry to the United States for 90 days for people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen and bar refugees for four months, as essential to prevent attacks in the United States.  Critics suing the government, including states and civil rights groups, say there is little national security justification for the move and the ban is discriminatory against Muslims. Federal courts have stopped it from being enforced. The Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original travel ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C., Trump tweeted, referring to the countrys highest court.  The Justice Dept. should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down travel ban before the Supreme Court - & seek much tougher version!  Federal courts struck down Trumps first temporary travel ban, an executive order he issued a week after taking office on Jan 20. To overcome the legal hurdles, he replaced it with a new order in March. The second ban was also put on hold by courts. The Justice Department says the courts should look only at the text of the order, not at the presidents comments during the 2016 election campaign about imposing a ban on Muslims. His tweets invite the question: if the second ban is politically correct, what is un-P.C. about the original? And the answer is obvious: Trump told us its about banning Muslims, said Micah Schwartzman, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law.  Trump, whose populist brand of politics includes criticizing political correctness as an evasion of uncomfortable truths, called in a statement on his campaign website for a complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. The Presidents tweets may help encourage his base, but they cant help him in court, said Jonathan Adler, a professor at the Case Western Reserve University School of Law.  Trumps legal team asked the Supreme Court last week to reverse rulings by lower courts and allow the revised travel ban to go into effect immediately. At issue before the court is whether the travel curbs violate the U.S. Constitutions ban on favoring one religion over another.  The revised order removed language barring legal permanent residents and a clause that protected religious minorities. It also removed Iraq from the list of targeted countries. Trump said in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network shortly after signing the first ban that it would help Syrian Christians fleeing the countrys civil war, a comment lawyers challenging the ban have pointed to as a sign it meant to favor Christians over Muslims. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Trump agreed to modify the language of the first order in an effort to satisfy the concerns of a federal appeals court that halted it, but he preferred the stronger action. He wants to go as far and as strong as possible under the Constitution to protect the people in this country, Sanders told a news briefing on Monday. Neal Katyal, an attorney for the state of Hawaii, which  challenged the revised ban, said the presidents comments only bolstered its case. Its kinda odd to have the defendant in Hawaii v Trump acting as our co-counsel. We dont need the help but will take it! Katyal said in a tweeted response to Trumps posts on Monday.           Trump also tweeted on Monday that his administration was implementing tougher vetting of would-be visitors to the United States, adding: The courts are slow and political! Legal experts said that comment could also undermine the governments case that the travel ban is urgently needed, given the government has said the temporary travel restrictions would free up resources to put in place tougher screening protocols. Last week, the administration rolled out new policies on visa applications for some people who are deemed subject to greater scrutiny.    U.S. Senator Ben Cardin, who is the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and opposes the ban, said on CNN the tweets showed the Republican presidents disdain for the judicial branch. Trump needs five votes from the nine-judge Supreme Court in his favor to put the ban into effect. With the confirmation of Trumps Supreme Court pick earlier this year, the court retains a 5-4 conservative majority, while the lower courts that have ruled thus far have been more liberal-leaning.  Peter Margulies, an immigration expert at Roger Williams University School of Law in Rhode Island, said of Trumps tweets, To the extent that Trump is sort of a bull in a china shop, that might make the Supreme Court nervous.  On Friday, the Supreme Court asked the challengers of the travel ban to file responses to the emergency request by June 12. Trumps administration would then likely to file its own response before the courts nine justices make their decision. White House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway defended Trumps tweets following the London attack. In an NBC interview on Monday, she cited a media obsession with covering everything he says on Twitter and very little of what he does as president.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday faulted North Carolina again in a racially tinged voting rights case, upholding a lower courts ruling that Republican lawmakers mapped state legislative districts in a way that diluted the clout of black voters. But the justices also threw out another ruling by the same panel of three federal judges ordering special elections by November to fill the state legislature seats at issue in the dispute. The high court, with no recorded dissents, sent the case back to the lower court to reconsider whether special elections are necessary. The Supreme Court in January put the matter of special elections on hold while it decided whether to hear the states appeal of the ruling. The justices upheld an August 2016 ruling by the three-judge panel that the districts were racial gerrymanders, with boundaries drawn to diminish the voting power of minorities, and violated the U.S. Constitutions guarantee of equal protection under the law. The lower court found that the Republican-led state legislature had crammed black voters into a limited number of districts in order to lessen their statewide electoral power. At issue were nine state Senate districts and 19 state House districts, as carved out in a plan adopted by the legislature in 2011. The Supreme Court has dealt with North Carolina voting rights cases three times in the past three weeks. On May 22, it ruled that North Carolina Republicans unlawfully took race into consideration when drawing two majority-black U.S. House of Representatives districts, concentrating black voters in an improper bid to diminish their statewide influence. On May 15, the justices rebuffed a Republican bid to revive a strict North Carolina voter-identification law that a lower court found deliberately discriminated against black voters. On Monday, the justices, in an opinion with no recorded dissents throwing out the decision requiring special elections, said the lower court gave only a cursory analysis of whether such elections were a proper remedy for a racial gerrymander when it ordered them last November. They added that said obvious considerations include the severity and nature of the particular constitutional violation, the extent of the likely disruption to the ordinary processes of governance if early elections are imposed, and the need to act with proper judicial restraint when intruding on state sovereignty. Packing minorities into a limited number of legislative districts would reduce their influence in electing a larger number of lawmakers, increasing the sway of white voters. Whether the election is November 2018 or earlier, redrawing the districts is good for our democracy by leveling the playing field for free and fair elections, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, a Democrat, said in a statement. The people should be able to choose their representatives in competitive districts instead of the representatives being able to choose the people in lopsided, partisan districts, Cooper added. Republican lawmakers praised the high courts action to throw out the order requiring special elections. We are encouraged the Supreme Court unanimously rejected the lower courts politically motivated attempt to force a special legislative election in 2017 and its efforts to suspend provisions of the North Carolina Constitution, ignore voters constitutional right to elect representatives to two-year terms, and effectively nullify their votes from 2016, state Senator Ralph Hise and Representative David Lewis said in a statement. Democrats have accused Republicans of taking a variety of steps at the state level to disenfranchise black and other minority voters who tend to back Democratic candidates. Republicans have defended their actions, saying some are meant to prevent voter fraud.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Bloomberg, who is the U.N. Secretary-Generals special envoy for Cities and Climate Change, submitted the We Are Still In declaration to U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa. He also launched a process to work with local governments and non-state entities to formally quantify the combined - and overlapping - emissions reduction pledges, which will be known as Americas Pledge, and submit the report to the United Nations. Today, on behalf of an unprecedented collection of U.S. cities, states, businesses and other organizations, I am communicating to the United Nations and the global community that American society remains committed to achieving the emission reductions we pledged to make in Paris in 2015,  Bloomberg said in a statement. Signatories to the new initiative include 13 Democratic and Republican governors, 19 state attorneys general, over 200 mayors, and CEOs of Fortune 500 companies and small businesses. Trump on Thursday pulled the United States from the landmark 2015 agreement designed to fight climate change, fulfilling a major campaign pledge despite entreaties from U.S. allies and corporate leaders. Although the formal process to withdraw from the Paris agreement takes four years, Trump said the United States will not honor the pledge the Obama administration submitted, known as the nationally determined contribution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 26-28 percent below 2005 levels by the year 2025.   To fill the void, Americas Pledge will be submitted to the UNFCCC as a Societal NDC. The UNFCCC welcomes the determination and commitment from such a wealth and array of cities, states, businesses and other groups in the United States to fast forward climate action and emissions reductions in support of the Paris Climate Change Agreement, said Espinosa. The coalition will align a number of different efforts to show U.S. support for the Paris agreement, including a commitment of over 260 corporations including Kellogg , Pepsi Co. and Walmart  to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in line with the latest science. Thirteen governors have also pledged to continue to honor the Paris pledges. It will be up to the American people to step forward-and in Virginia we are doing just that, said Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"
"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday ruled that church-affiliated hospital systems do not have to comply with a federal law governing employee pensions, overturning lower court decisions that could have cost the hospitals billions of dollars.  The court ruled 8-0 that church-affiliated organizations are exempt from the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, a 1974 law that forces private employers to follow rules aimed at protecting pension plan participants.  The ruling was a victory for New Jersey-based Saint Peters Healthcare System, Illinois-based Advocate Health Care Network and California-based Dignity Health, which had faced separate employee lawsuits accusing them of wrongly claiming a religious exemption under ERISA. Federal agencies had long interpreted the law as exempting not just church plans but also those of church-affiliated organizations.  The employees challenged that view, in effect accusing the hospital systems of being big businesses posing as church organizations in order to avoid minimum funding and reporting requirements under ERISA. The three hospital systems maintained that their religious affiliation made them exempt from ERISA. St. Peters is affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church. Dignity operates both Catholic and non-Catholic hospitals. Advocate is affiliated with the United Church of Christ and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. Writing for the court, Justice Elena Kagan said the laws religious exemption applies to plans whether they were established by churches themselves or organizations affiliated with the churches.  Justice Sonia Sotomayor agreed with the ruling based on the text of the law. But, in a separate opinion, she wrote that she was troubled with the outcome, noting that some church-affiliated organizations operate for-profit subsidiaries, earn billions of dollars in revenues and compete with companies that must comply with ERISA.  Sotomayor suggested that the U.S. Congress take action, adding that scores of employees - who work for organizations that look and operate much like secular businesses - potentially might be denied ERISAs protections. The ruling is the latest in which the justices endorsed the idea that certain businesses deserve wider latitude because of religious considerations. In 2014, the justices sided with Hobby Lobby, a retailer owned by conservative Christians, that objected to a federal requirement that it pay for insurance coverage for womens birth control, saying that violated a U.S. law protecting religious freedom.  Three separate regional federal appeals courts had ruled against Saint Peters, Advocate and Dignity in separate cases, refusing to dismiss employees lawsuits against them.  Hundreds of hospitals and hospital systems have claimed the exemption since 1980, when Congress amended ERISA to extend what is known as the church plan exemption, originally only for churches, more broadly to certain religiously affiliated entities.  The plaintiffs were seeking retroactive penalties for past violations of ERISA, which the hospitals said could add up to hundreds of millions or billions of dollars. Justice Neil Gorsuch, who joined the court after the arguments were presented in the case, did not participate in Mondays decision. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The person spoke on condition of anonymity and declined to specify how much more time the banks counsel needed.  Several Democrats on the U.S. House Financial Services Committee sent a letter last month to John Cryan, chief executive officer of Deutsche Bank, seeking details that might show if Trumps loans for his real estate business were backed by the Russian government. The letter asked for details of internal reviews of Trumps transactions and gave the German bank until Friday to respond.  Deutsche Bank has declined to comment about any business dealings with Trump. The Republican president is mired in controversy over FBI and congressional probes into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and potential collusion between Moscow and the Trump campaign. Moscow has denied the allegations, and Trump has denied any collusion. Maxine Waters, Democrat representative for California and a member of the committee, was one of the original letters five signatories. She confirmed through a staff member on Monday that Deutsche did not provide substantive responses to our requests.

The Democrats cannot compel Deutsche Bank to hand over the information. The House committee has the power to subpoena the documents, but Republican committee members - who make up the majority of the panel - would have to cooperate. No Republicans have signed the document request. The congressional inquiry is also seeking information about a Russian mirror trading scheme that allowed $10 billion to flow out of Russia. In January, Deutsche Bank agreed to pay $630 million in fines for organizing the scheme that could have been used to launder money out of Russia. The trades involved, for example, buying Russian stocks in roubles for a client and selling the identical value of a security for U.S. dollars for a related customer.

(Reuters) - New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is barred by state law from running for a third consecutive four-year term this year, but the unpopular former Republican presidential candidate remains a central figure in the campaign to replace him. Voters head to the polls on Tuesday to choose Republican and Democratic nominees to succeed Christie, whose approval ratings have hit historic lows. He has been accused of spending too much time out of state during the 2016 presidential campaign and tarnished by the so-called Bridgegate lane closure scandal. The lieutenant governor, Kim Guadagno, is the front-runner in the primary election on the Republican side, while Phil Murphy, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc executive who served as U.S. ambassador to Germany under former President Barack Obama, holds a solid lead in polling among the Democrats. Guadagno, who won election as the states first lieutenant governor alongside Christie in 2009, was Monmouth Countys first elected female sheriff and, like Christie, served as a federal prosecutor. With Christie absent frequently during the presidential campaign, Guadagno has already spent months as acting governor. But she has also faced criticism from her opponents based on her association with the unpopular Republican incumbent. As a result, Guadagno, 58, has tried to execute a balancing act, distancing herself from Christie on some issues like his $300 million proposal to renovate the aging statehouse in Trenton while taking credit for the states low unemployment figures. In most situations where you have a second-in-command, that person will enjoy some incumbency advantage, said Brigid Callahan Harrison, a political science professor at Montclair University in New Jersey. In fact, what we see is the exact opposite. His enormous unpopularity is an albatross around her candidacy. At a recent debate, Guadagno sparred with her main Republican rival, Assemblyman Jack Ciatterelli, over the latters plan to hike taxes on millionaires. Guadagno has vowed not to raise any taxes. Ciatterelli, 55, has criticized Christie, and by extension Guadagno, for the states repeated credit rating downgrades in the face of budget problems. The latest Stockton University poll, released last week, gave Guadagno 37 percent support among primary voters, with Ciatterelli trailing at 18 percent. About a third of those polled, however, said they remained undecided. On the Democratic side, Murphy, 59, appears likely to capture the nomination after significantly outspending his opponents. He has loaned $15 million to his own campaign, and the money has given him an advantage in advertising. His strategy of spending early and often helped him eliminate some potentially strong rivals, including state Senate President Stephen Sweeney and Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop. Murphy also enjoys support from both New Jersey and national Democratic leaders. Former Vice President Joe Biden campaigned with him this week, and all 21 New Jersey county Democratic organizations have endorsed him. His opponents have criticized his Wall Street background and  campaign spending, but he had 34 percent support in the latest Stockton University poll, as much as all other candidates combined. Jim Johnson, 56, a lawyer and former U.S. Treasury Department official under former President Bill Clinton, had 10 percent in that poll, after running as an outsider candidate.  Assemblyman John Wisniewski, who helped lead the legislatures investigation into the Bridgegate scandal, was at 9 percent. Christie has denied any involvement in the Bridgegate plot, but the scandal continued to dog him. Two former associates were convicted in November of scheming to close down lanes at the George Washington Bridge in 2013 to punish a mayor for failing to endorse Christies re-election campaign. Wisniewski, who chaired the state campaign for former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, appeared poised to challenge Murphy, a Hillary Clinton supporter, from the left. But in a state where Clinton easily defeated Sanders in 2016, he has failed to garner a groundswell of support. All the Democratic candidates have endorsed a fairly liberal agenda, including a $15 minimum wage and marijuana legalization. The Democractic primary winner will seek to tie the Republican nominee to Christie and by extension to U.S. President Donald Trump. Christie was among the first prominent Republicans to back Trumps candidacy last year. Murphys final TV ad of the primary season, airing in the days before Tuesdays election, appealed to voters to stop Donald Trumps assault on our values. The primary winners will compete in a Nov. 7 election. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

With the Senate convening on Monday and the House of Representatives on Tuesday for a legislative sprint leading up to an August recess, the spotlight is on James Comey, the FBI director fired by Trump on May 9. Comey, who will appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday, will be grilled on whether Trump tried to get him to back off an investigation into alleged ties between the presidents 2016 campaign and Russia. Trump, a Republican, has called the Russia probe a witch hunt designed to undermine the legitimacy of his electoral win. The Russia matter presents a double-barreled threat to congressional Republicans: It could impede healthcare and tax initiatives that already were languishing and it could hurt efforts to hold onto their majorities in the House and Senate in 2018 midterm elections. Its an enormous distraction and it creates uncertainty, said veteran Republican Representative Tom Cole in a telephone interview. It casts a pall over the political system and slows things down. You dont want to slow things down when you have all three levers of power, Cole said, referring to the White House, Senate and House. The day before Comeys scheduled testimony, top U.S. intelligence officials are set to appear before the same panel to discuss renewal of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, which allows the government to collect communications of foreigners thought to be living overseas whose communications pass through American phone or internet providers. But senators are likely to also wade into the Russia affair. [nL1N1IZ0VV] Lawmakers must also come up with a plan to raise the countrys debt limit. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is clamoring for Congress to quickly approve more borrowing authority as the incoming stream of tax revenues slows. Republican fiscal conservatives routinely demand budget cuts and other concessions as a price for raising the debt limit, setting up a likely fight. [nL1N1IZ13F] Amid all this, Trump and his fellow Republicans in Congress hope the new work session, following a week-long Memorial Day break, will be a chance to reset the conversation in Washington that has centered on Russia and their failures so far on healthcare and tax legislation. House Republicans hope this week to pass a repeal of portions of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law. But that bill will face resistance in the Senate, where Democrats are expected to use procedural tactics to kill it. Even so, House Republicans hope passage of low-hanging fruit bills like this will allow them to argue that they have racked up accomplishments when they go home to their districts in August. Meanwhile, the Senate is struggling to craft legislation repealing and replacing Obamacare, former President Barack Obamas landmark law that expanded health insurance coverage to millions and placed new controls on insurers. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, in a May 24 interview with Reuters said, I dont know how we get to 50 (votes) at the moment but pledged to forge ahead. Senators this week are expected to be presented with  options for a new healthcare program they hope will be more acceptable to voters than one passed by the House. [nBER4WKzcM] Failure to agree on a formula by early July could doom the push to kill Obamacare, which has been a Republican vow since it became law in 2010. Congress is already months behind in writing a budget blueprint that would guide federal spending in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. Republicans are deeply divided over the level of defense spending and potential structural reforms to social welfare programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. If that is not enough, House Republicans are promising to streamline the antiquated tax code and reduce rates. Democrats and some experts outside of Congress argue their approach would largely help the wealthy while ballooning the nations debt. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Comey, who was leading the Federal Bureau of Investigations probe into alleged Russian meddling in last years U.S. presidential election, was fired by Trump last month, four years into his 10-year term. The move sparked accusations that Trump dismissed Comey to hinder that investigation and stifle questions about possible collusion between his campaign and Russia. I want to know what kind of pressure - appropriate, inappropriate - how many conversations he had with the president about this topic? Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told CBSs Face the Nation program on Sunday. The former FBI chief is due to testify on Thursday before the intelligence committee as part of its own Russia-related investigation. After Comeys dismissal, news reports emerged that Trump asked Comey to end the probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn during a February meeting in the Oval Office, the day after Flynn was fired for misrepresenting his contacts with the Russian ambassador. The account, first reported by the New York Times, was based on a memo Comey wrote after the meeting. The Comey memo caused alarm on Capitol Hill and raised questions about whether Trump tried to interfere with a federal investigation. It would be unthinkable if the president actually did what was reported, asked FBI Director Comey to, in effect, back off of at least the investigation into General Flynn, Warner said. The potential for explosive testimony from Comey that could impact a sitting president makes Thursdays hearing a highly anticipated event, akin to the hearings in the 1970s examining the Watergate scandal, said Linda Peek-Schacht, a political adviser who worked in President Jimmy Carters White House. There are only a few times when Americans come together to watch one thing, said Peek-Schacht, founder of a civics institute at Lipscomb University in Tennessee. Americans will be watching this. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in January that Moscow tried to sway the November vote in Trumps favor. Russia has denied involvement, and Trump has denied any collusion between his campaign and Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin said in an interview that  he does not have any relationship with Flynn and only spoke briefly with Flynn when he sat next to him at a 2015 dinner for Russian TV network RT. I made my speech. Then we talked about some other stuff. And I got up and left, Putin told NBC News Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly program. Thats it. I didnt even really talk to him. Thats the extent of my acquaintance with Mr. Flynn.  Republican Senator Susan Collins, who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said she is eager to question Comey to find out more about Trumps allegation that Comey told him on three separate occasions that he was not under investigation. We need to hear directly from Mr. Comey on these important issues, Collins told Face the Nation.  The tone, the exact words that were spoken and the context are so important and thats what we lack right now and we can only get that by talking to those directly involved, she said. Trump has called the investigation into alleged ties between his campaign and Russia a witch hunt designed to undermine the legitimacy of his electoral win.

At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is no reason to be alarmed! Trump tweeted. We must stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people. If we dont get smart it will only get worse, Trump said. In response, a spokesperson for the London mayor said Khan is busy working with the police, emergency services and the government to coordinate the response to this horrific and cowardly terrorist attack. He has more important things to do than respond to Donald Trumps ill-informed tweet that deliberately takes out of context his remarks urging Londoners not to be alarmed when they saw more police - including armed officers - on the streets, the spokesperson said. Former Vice President Al Gore, speaking on CNNs State of the Union program, said he thought Trumps tweet misrepresented what the mayor had said. I dont think that a major terrorist attack like this is the time to be divisive and to criticize a mayor whos trying to organize his citys response to this attack, Gore, a Democrat, said.

Trump also spoke with British Prime Minister Theresa May to  offer condolences and offered Washingtons full support, the White House said in a statement. Earlier in the day, Trump cited the London attacks to push his March 6 executive order that would temporarily ban entry into the United States of people from six predominantly Muslim countries. The ban has been blocked in the courts and Trumps legal team has asked the Supreme Court to reinstate it. Trump has said the travel ban is needed to protect Americans from terrorist attacks. Critics say his reasoning is flawed and assail the ban as discriminatory.

The U.S. State Department said it was monitoring the security situation and advised Americans in Britain to heed the advice of local authorities and maintain their security awareness. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued a statement late on Saturday saying: At this time, we have no information to indicate a specific, credible terror threat in the United States.

The December 2015 dinner was in honor of the Russian television network Russia Today (RT), a Russian government-funded global network that U.S. officials consider a state-run propaganda outlet and purveyor of disinformation about the U.S. French President Emmanuel Macron, standing next to Putin in Paris last week, publicly denounced Russia Today and the state-funded Sputnik news agency as agents of influence ... and of lying propaganda that had spread fake news against him during his campaign for Pariss top post in May. A preview of NBCs interview with Putin was released to the media on Sunday. In it, the Kremlin chief was asked about the nature of his relationship with the retired U.S. Army general who is the subject of several investigations at home. U.S. President Donald Trump fired Flynn in February for failing to disclose the content of his talks with Sergei Kislyak, Russias ambassador to the United States, and misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations.  U.S. intelligence agencies reported in January that Putin oversaw a campaign of computer hacking, fake news and propaganda intended to swing the election to the Republican candidate Trump over his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. Putin has denied conducting such a campaign. Trump has denied any collusion between Russia and his campaign and has questioned the veracity of the U.S. intelligence finding.

Speaking days before lawmakers return to Washington amid doubts about their ability to agree on legislation, Pence sought to add urgency to the debate by warning that consumers face dwindling access to Obamacare health coverage in some states. Trump-backed legislation to dismantle former President Barack Obamas healthcare overhaul narrowly passed the House of Representatives last month. But Senate Republicans have had difficulty agreeing on their own bill, leading Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to fret about the future of healthcare legislation.  First and foremost, this summer, this Congress must come together and heed the presidents leadership, and we must repeal and replace Obamacare, Pence told a political rally in Iowa, one of several states where major insurers have exited government-subsidized insurance markets. Its high time we take action, the vice president added, saying Congress must relieve Iowa and relieve America.   Insurers say they cannot plan amid the uncertainty  surrounding healthcare legislation. They also face a worse-than-expected balance of sick and healthy customers that has helped drive insurance premiums higher in Obamacare marketplaces. Once we repeal and replace Obamacare, were going to roll our sleeves up, and working with these great leaders in Congress, were going to pass one of the largest tax cuts in American history, Pence said. A former Indiana congressman, Pence plays a key role in Trumps relationship with lawmakers as the main White House liaison to Congress. As vice president, he also casts the tie-breaking vote on legislation in the 100-member Senate, where Republicans have a slim 52-seat majority.   Senate Republican staff are expected to present legislative options on healthcare when lawmakers return to Capitol Hill on Monday after a one-week recess, according to aides. But some Republicans are skeptical that healthcare legislation can pass the Senate this summer, if at all. Pence projected confidence that Congress will succeed: I know we will.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The United States is encouraged by Chinas efforts to restrain North Korea but Washington will not accept Beijings militarization of islands in the South China Sea, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Saturday. The comments by Mattis, during the annual Shangri-La Dialogue, show how U.S. President Donald Trumps administration is looking to balance working with China to restrain North Koreas advancing missile and nuclear programs while dealing with Beijings activities in the South China Sea. U.S. allies have been worried by Trumps actively courting Chinese President Xi Jinping to restrain North Korea, fearing Washington might allow China a more free rein elsewhere in the region. Some allies have also expressed concern that Washingtons withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific trade partnership and the Paris global climate accord signals the United States is diluting its global leadership role. Speaking at the dialogue, Asias premier security forum, Mattis said the United States remained fully engaged with its partners.  Like it or not, we are a part of the world...What a crummy world if we all retreat inside our borders, he said.  Once we have exhausted all possible alternatives, the Americans will do the right thing, Mattis added, paraphrasing a quotation by British wartime leader Winston Churchill. So we will still be there and we will be there with you. Nevertheless, reversing or slowing North Koreas nuclear and missile programs has become a security priority for Washington, given Pyongyangs vow to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland. The Trump administration has been pressing China aggressively to rein in its reclusive neighbor, warning all options are on the table if North Korea persists with its weapons programs. The Trump administration is encouraged by Chinas renewed commitment to work with the international community toward denuclearization, Mattis said.  Ultimately, we believe China will come to recognize North Korea as a strategic liability, not an asset. However, Mattis said seeking Chinas cooperation on North Korea did not mean Washington would not challenge Beijings activities in the South China Sea. The U.N. Security Council on Friday expanded targeted sanctions against North Korea after its repeated missile tests, adopting the first such resolution agreed by the United States and China since Trump took office. In another sign of increased pressure on North Korea, Japans navy and air force began a three-day military exercise with two U.S. aircraft carriers in the Sea of Japan on Thursday. Japanese Defense Minister Tomomi Inada, speaking at the Singapore forum, said Tokyo backed the United States using any option to deal with North Korea, including military strikes, and was seeking a deeper alliance with Washington. But she also said she was concerned about the situation in the South China Sea and in the East China Sea.    Chinas claims in the South China Sea, through which about $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes each year, are contested by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. China and Japan both claim islands in the East China Sea. LOW-KEY China, which sent only a low-key delegation to the forum,  said its ties with the United States were vital for the region. I believe that if China and the United States can ensure no conflict, as well as maintain mutual respect, cooperation and trust, it will contribute greatly to security in the Asia Pacific and the world, Lt Gen He Lei, the head of Beijings delegation, told reporters.     Allies around the world have been concerned about the commitment of the United States since Trump took office on Jan. 20 because of his America First rhetoric and expectations that he would concentrate on a domestic agenda. We are still trying to figure out his (Trumps) policy in our region, said Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein. I would like to know very clearly what are the true intentions of the new administration.    Mattis sought to ease concerns for allies in the Asia-Pacific, saying the region was a priority and the primary effort was alliance building. He added, however, that countries must contribute sufficiently to their own security. In a sign of the U.S. commitment to the region, Mattis said that soon about 60 percent of overseas tactical aviation assets would be assigned to the region and he would work with the U.S. Congress on an Asia-Pacific stability initiative. Mattis said the United States welcomed Chinas economic development, but he anticipated friction between the two countries. While competition between the U.S. and China, the worlds two largest economies, is bound to occur, conflict is not inevitable, Mattis said.  While eager to work with China in dealing with North Korea, Mattis said the United States did not accept China placing weapons and other military assets on man-made islands in the South China Sea.  We oppose countries militarizing artificial islands and enforcing excessive maritime claims, Mattis said. We cannot and will not accept unilateral, coercive changes to the status quo.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""CRANFORD, New Jersey (Reuters) - Appearing at a town hall in upscale Cranford, New Jersey this week, five-term Republican congressman Leonard Lance got a barrage of complaints from constituents about President Donald Trump. This administration is the most foul administration I have ever seen in my life. The stench that comes from Washington can be smelled in my hometown, said Martin Carroll of Watchung, New Jersey, who drew a standing ovation. Another man, who identified himself as Alan, lambasted what he called the criminality of the Trump administration. When will you call them out? he asked Lance. Lance, a mild-mannered 64-year-old, is one of many centrist Republicans who are feeling voter heat over Trump and are vulnerable to a backlash in next years congressional elections. Democrats hope to make the 2018 mid-term elections a referendum on Trump. Any path they have for capturing the Republican-led House of Representatives runs through areas such as Lances, one of 23 Republican districts that voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. In Lances district, anger has risen over proposed cuts to domestic programs, Republican efforts to roll back Obamacare, President Barack Obamas healthcare overhaul, and allegations of collusion between Trumps campaign team and Russia, despite the presidents denial of any such contacts. At the Cranford town hall, the congressman made clear he has differences with Trump on issues such as the budget and a special counsel investigation into any links between Trumps campaign and Russian officials. While Trump has called the Russia probe a witch hunt, Lance said he believes it is necessary and that he will let the chips fall where they may when the findings come in. Lance also questioned the economic assumptions underpinning Trumps budget and said he opposed its proposed cuts for the arts and environmental programs. Of the 23 Republicans in districts that voted for Clinton, Lance has been among the more vocal in distancing himself from Trump. But there are others. Republican Representative Barbara Comstock of Virginia has said she could not defend Trumps decision to fire FBI Director James Comey. Comstock and Lance were among 20 Republicans who voted against the Trump-backed Republican healthcare bill in May. Nine of those dissenters hailed from the 23 Republican districts where Clinton beat Trump in November. In California, Republican Representative Darrell Issa has faced weekly protests in his district since Trumps inauguration in January. Issa says he backs Robert Mueller, the special counsel in charge of the Russia investigation, and like Lance, he opposes Trumps proposed cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency. But Issa infuriated Trump opponents with his backing of the healthcare bill. We saw your vote! some chanted outside Issas office, while others displayed the message Repeal & Replace Issa on a California bridge. Still, the 23 districts, which have a majority of white voters and tend to be moderately well-educated and well-off, do not make easy targets for Democratic congressional candidates. Republicans have triumphed repeatedly in these districts during the past 20 years, winning 198 races to Democrats 36.  And Republicans have won every U.S. House election in 11 of those districts since 1996.(For graphic on the districts:  tmsnrt.rs/2rN3xb9)  In Lances district, a collection of well-heeled bedroom communities outside New York City, registered Republican voters outnumber Democrats, but unaffiliated voters outnumber both categories. Lance is rated a slight favorite to keep his seat by the Cook Political Report, a non-partisan election tracker. Speaking after the Cranford town hall, Lance said he thought the crowd had been less contentious than those that had confronted him at recent constituent meetings. He thought his rejection of the healthcare bill was one reason. I guess I had to prove my bona fides, Lance said. I vote with the president when I think hes right and I dont vote with him when I dont agree with him. But Democrats note Lance had earlier backed Trumps  healthcare bill in a House committee. Lance should have tried to convince his colleagues to do the right thing, and he didnt do that, said Linda Weber, a 53-year-old bank executive who is one of four people already seeking the Democratic nomination to take on Lance next year. Ed Harris, a retired attorney who attended the Cranford town hall, said Lances rejection of the healthcare bill was a step in the right direction. Harris, an unaffiliated voter, said he voted for Clinton in 2016, though not enthusiastically. I thought the bubonic plague was better than Trump, Harris said. I will support anybody who is opposed to Trump. Voters like Harris pose a conundrum for Lance and other Republican moderates as they prepare for the mid-term elections. Differing with the president may help them win over centrists or independents, but then they run the risk of alienating Trump supporters. Trump backer Wells Pikaart, a sales manager from Westfield, New Jersey, said he understands Lances predicament but was nonetheless disappointed that the congressman did not vote in favor of the Republican healthcare bill. I think that he needs to use his time now to advance the presidents agenda, Pikaart said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The Trump administrations move means it could be more difficult for the full, 6,700-page report to be made public, because documents held by Congress are exempt from laws requiring government records to eventually be made public. The White House made the move in response to requests by Sen. Richard Burr, the Senate Intelligence Committees current Republican chairman, officials said. In a statement emailed to Reuters, Burr said: I have directed my staff to retrieve copies of the Congressional study that remain with the Executive Branch agencies and, as the Committee does with all classified and compartmented information, will enact the necessary measures to protect the sensitive sources and methods contained within the report. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the Democrat who chaired the committee when the report was produced, had asked that it be distributed to multiple executive branch agencies, a move designed to make it eventually releasable to the public under the Freedom of Information Act law. Feinstein said in a statement that she was concerned and disappointed that Burr requested that the document be returned, calling it a departure from the committees normal bipartisan nature. No senator, chairman or not, has the authority to erase history. I believe that is the intent of the chairman in this case, she said.  Sen Mark Warner, who succeeded Feinstein as the committees top Democrat, said in a Twitter post he was disappointed with Burrs decision, and that the report must be preserved so we can learn from past mistakes & ensure that abuses are never repeated. A declassified executive summary of the report was made public in December 2014. It concluded that the CIAs interrogation programs, using techniques such as waterboarding that most observers consider torture, were more brutal and less effective than the CIA had told policymakers. The report said that not a single terrorist attack was foiled as a result of the use of harsh interrogation techniques. The American Civil Liberties Union had filed litigation to have the full report released. But U.S. courts ruled that because the document was created by Congress, it was exempt from the Freedom of Information Act. At least one copy of the report, however, will not be returned to the committee. Thats because a copy has been preserved in former President Barack Obamas presidential archive, according to a Dec. 9, 2016 letter written to Feinstein by Obamas top White House lawyer at the time, W. Neil Eggleston. The CIA declined to comment. Burrs move was first reported by the New York Times. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

(Reuters) - President Donald Trumps U.S. Supreme Court appointee Neil Gorsuch said on Friday that he does not share what he acknowledged was currently a lot of cynicism about government and the rule of law. Gorsuch, the newest member to the nations top court, spoke about the value of an independent judiciary during an evening event at Harvard University that also featured fellow Justice Stephen Breyer. Gorsuch reflected on how the government can lose in its own courts and accept the judgement of those courts without an army to back it up. He said 95 percent of all U.S. cases are resolved at the trial court level, with few reaching the appellate level or Supreme Court, a fact that he said indicated that litigants were satisfied that justice had been done. I know a lot of cynicism about government and the rule of law, but I dont share it, he said. Gorsuch, whose confirmation to the lifetime job restored the courts conservative majority following Justice Antonin Scalias death in February 2016, formally joined the Supreme Court on April 10. Gorsuch served on the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals before Trump nominated him in January. Trump was able to fill the vacancy after Senate Republicans last year refused to consider President Barack Obamas nominee Merrick Garland. Breyer, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton in 1994, and is a member of the liberal wing of the nine-member court, stressed during his comments the value of international values.

The United States is making clear through both words and deeds that all options are on the table. I strongly support the U.S. position, Japanese Minister of Defense Tomomi Inada said during a speech at a regional security conference in Singapore. Pyongyangs accelerating nuclear and missile programs are stoking fear in nearby Japan and prompting a harder line on North Korea from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. A Japanese helicopter carrier and destroyer are concluding three days of drills with two U.S. aircraft carriers in the Sea of Japan that also included simulated combat sorties between U.S. Navy F-18s and Japanese air force F-15s. The exercise followed three ballistic missile tests by Pyongyang in as many weeks. The latest on Monday reached an altitude of 120 km (75 miles) before falling into international waters in the Sea of Japan, but inside an exclusive economic zone where Japan has jurisdiction over the exploration and exploitation of maritime resources. Apart from using the U.S. alliance to tackle its belligerent neighbor, Japan also wants the military partnership to exert influence on other parts of Asia, including the highly contested South China Sea, Inada said. China claims almost all the disputed waters, which is one of the worlds busiest shipping lanes, and its growing military presence has fueled concern in Japan and the West.  The robust, long-standing Japan-U.S. alliance now functions as a public good that contributes to the peace and stability of the region, she said. Beijing often rails against the United States, Japan and other countries for what it sees as interference in the South China Sea, insisting it is for claimant countries involved in disputes to work them out. Inada also called on European navies to provide a regular and visible presence in the region. A French amphibious assault carrier visited Japan in April after sailing through the South China Sea.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - Former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey will testify on June 8 before a congressional committee investigating Russias alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Comey is expected to tell the Senate Intelligence Committee that President Donald Trump asked him to drop an investigation into former White House national security adviser Michael Flynns ties to Russia. Trump fired Comey on May 9.  Legal experts say that Trump could invoke a doctrine called executive privilege to try to stop Comey from testifying. But such a maneuver would draw a backlash and could be challenged in court, they said. The following describes how executive privilege works and why it could backfire on Trump if he invokes it. What is executive privilege? Executive privilege is a legal doctrine that allows the president to withhold information from other government branches. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1974 in U.S. v Nixon that executive privilege can only be used in limited circumstances, such as protecting national security or preserving the confidentiality of sensitive communications within the executive branch. How would Trump invoke the privilege to block Comeys testimony? Before invoking executive privilege, the president typically obtains a written memorandum justifying the decision from the Office of Legal Counsel, a division of the Department of Justice. The White House counsel is often informally involved in the decision. After invoking the privilege, the president can direct current and former government officials to not divulge information.  Have presidents invoked executive privilege in the past? The term was not coined until the 1950s, but most presidents have invoked some version of it, said Mark Rozell, a professor of government at George Mason University. President Barack Obama asserted the privilege in 2012 to block Congress from seeing documents relating to an investigation into Fast and Furious, a botched gunrunning operation conducted by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. What are the odds that Trump would legally succeed in blocking Comeys testimony? Legal experts said Trump would face an uphill climb if he asserted executive privilege to stop Comey from testifying before the congressional committee. Trump likely would argue that Comeys testimony involves confidential conversations or matters of national security. But that claim would be undercut by the fact that the president has publicly discussed and tweeted about his conversations with Comey, said Rozell. Trump faces another hurdle if he tries to block Comeys testimony. If Trump pressured Comey to drop the Flynn investigation, as Comey is expected to testify, then Trump may have engaged in obstruction of justice, according to some lawyers. Executive privilege cannot be used to cover up government misconduct, said Andrew Wright, a professor at Savannah Law School.  If Trump invoked the privilege, could Comey disregard it? Typically a president uses executive privilege to prevent government employees from releasing information. Comey is now a private citizen who does not have to worry about losing his job if he does not comply. Rozell said he knows of no legal sanction for ignoring an assertion of executive privilege, but that it would be unprecedented for an assertion of the privilege to be ignored.  Could Trump be challenged in court if he asserts executive privilege? The president and Congress typically hammer out a compromise when they disagree about whether privilege can be asserted, said Rozell.  But there are instances of executive privilege being challenged in court. When Obama cited the privilege to block the release of documents relating to Fast and Furious, Congress sued and asked a judge to direct then-Attorney General Eric Holder to comply with its subpoena. A judge ruled last year that the Justice Departments public disclosures about the controversy undercut the presidents executive privilege claim, saying that the Justice Department had already publicly revealed much of the information it said should be kept private. It would be procedurally complicated to challenge a decision by Trump to block Comeys testimony. First, Congress would have to issue a subpoena requiring Comey to testify. Then Congress would have to find Comey in contempt if he refused. Congress could then ask a federal judge to force Comey to comply with its subpoena. That litigation would lead to a ruling on whether Trump lawfully invoked executive privilege. There is a path to judicial review, but a lot of things would have to take place, Wright said. What are the political risks if Trump tries to assert privilege? Trump would surely face public criticism if he tries to stop Comeys testimony, Rozell said. Critics could claim Trump is using privilege to thwart questions about potential ties between Russia and Flynn and Russias alleged influence on the election. Thats the rub with executive privilege: It makes it look like you have something to hide, Rozell said.""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The new measure was designed to remedy flaws the courts found in the original law by providing Texans an alternative to the type of government-issued photo ID they had been required to present in order to vote at polling stations. Voters will now be permitted to cast their ballots by furnishing some other documentation bearing their name and address, such as a bank statement or utility bill, if they also sign an affidavit attesting to having a reasonable impediment to obtaining a valid photo ID. Critics contend that the measure, passed by the Republican-controlled legislature last month and signed on Thursday by Abbott, a first-term Republican, is still aimed at discouraging racial and ethnic minorities, who tend to favor Democrats. They particularly object to provisions carrying a prison sentence of up to 10 years for lying on a voter-ID affidavit. The list of valid photo-IDs accepted under both the previous law and the revised measure includes a drivers license, U.S. military identification, U.S. passport and concealed handgun permit, but not a student ID card. Texas ranks as the most populous Republican-dominated state, with the Republican Party winning every statewide race for elective office for more than 20 years. But shifting demographics have given hope to Democrats that they can eventually turn the state to their column. The original voter ID requirements were signed into law in 2011 by then-Texas Governor Rick Perry, a Republican. Considered one of the nations strictest such measures, it has been subject to years of court challenges, with the laws opponents saying it could exclude up to 600,000 voters. Supporters of such laws have countered they are necessary to protect the integrity of the election system, despite little evidence of actual voter fraud.

Trump will nominate Carnegie Mellon University professor Marvin Goodfriend and former Treasury Department staffer Randal Quarles to fill two of the three open seats on the Federal Reserves Board of Governors, the New York Times said on Friday, citing unnamed people with direct knowledge of the decision.   The conservative picks come as Fed Chair Janet Yellen continues to slowly raise interest rates and lay out plans to shed some of the trillions of dollars of bonds bought in the wake of the financial crisis.  Goodfriend in particular has been skeptical of the Feds bond-buying programs, saying that it is too close to fiscal policy. Goodfriend and Quarles did not immediately respond on Friday to requests for comment. A White House spokeswoman said officials were not ready to make an announcement yet.     Goodfriend, 66, a former Richmond Fed policy advisor, also has urged the central bank to adopt simpler rules governing policy decisions.  That view has support among many congressional Republicans, though Yellen has strongly opposed their proposed legislation on grounds that it would tie the Fed to make mechanical decisions that would harm the economy. The rule at the center of that legislation suggests the Fed should be raising rates more aggressively than the three annual rate hikes policymakers currently expect for both 2017 and 2018. That could make for an interesting dynamic with bond investors increasingly skeptical of faster rate hikes amid uncertainty over the outlook for tax cuts under Trumps young administration.  After Fridays report that employers added fewer than expected jobs in May, short-term interest-rate futures traders were still pricing in a June rate hike, but Treasury yields fell as investors reduced bets on subsequent hikes. \t One area Goodfriend may agree with Yellen is on the Feds plan to start shrinking its $4.5-trillion balance sheet before the end of the year. Though the Fed has not published its plan in detail, policymakers have said the portfolio would shrink as if on autopilot. In an interview with Reuters last November, Goodfriend appeared to also support such a preset plan. The Fed should choose a rule for shrinking the balance sheet so that, as it sold off its assets, it was pre-committed and markets could anticipate sales and prepare for them, he said. Despite differences of opinion with Yellen, he said then, If there is interest in my point of view and my 30-something years of thinking, writing, and teaching about the Fed and central banking, then I would have to consider serving.  A lawyer by profession, Quarles, 59, worked on financial regulation at the U.S. Treasury for years, including during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Reuters had earlier reported he was a leading candidate to be Trumps pick for the Feds vice chair in charge of banking supervision.  Many market participants have been barking up the wrong tree, arguing that Trump is an easy money guy because he borrowed a lot when he was a real-estate tycoon, said Stephen Stanley, Amherst Pierponts chief economist, who worked for Goodfriend when he was at the Richmond Fed. If these two nominees are eventually confirmed, the tone of the Fed Board will instantly swing to a far more hawkish tenor. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump faces an uphill fight convincing the Supreme Court it should grant his emergency request to reinstate his travel ban on people entering the United States from six predominantly Muslim countries. His legal team on Thursday night asked the nine justices to allow his controversial March 6 executive order to take effect immediately despite being blocked by lower courts. The Supreme Court rarely grants emergency requests. At issue is a ban Trump has said is necessary to protect Americans from terrorist attacks. Critics say his reasoning is flawed and assail the ban as discriminatory. Trumps proposed ban was a centerpiece of his 2016 presidential campaign. The fight over the emergency application is likely to determine whether the ban ever takes effect. That is because if the court grants the request, the bans 90-day term will have expired by the time the court decides the legal fate of the proposal. The 5-4 conservative majority on the high court means Trump, a Republican who took office on Jan. 20, likely has a better chance than he has had to date in more liberal-leaning lower courts. Even though its a heavy lift getting a stay, it seems to me that the Supreme Court is the most favorable court theyve had access to so far, said John Elwood, a Washington lawyer. The administration needs five votes on the nine-justice court to put the ban into effect. In this instance, the merits  of whether it violates the U.S. Constitutions ban on religious discrimination by targeting Muslims matter less. The court weighs several factors when considering emergency applications. One such application met with success when in February 2016 the court granted on a 5-4 vote a request by states and industry groups to block President Barack Obamas climate regulations. Under Supreme Court precedent, several criteria need to be met for an emergency application to be granted, including that there would be irreparable harm if denied and that there is a reasonable probability the court would agree to hear the case on the merits. In the governments request, Acting Solicitor General Jeff Wall wrote that the nationwide injunctions blocking the travel ban have caused irreparable harm by preventing the executive from effectuating his national-security judgment. The challengers contest the administration claim that urgent action is needed to protect Americans from terrorist attacks. They stress that the government did not previously ask the Supreme Court to intervene, even when lower courts denied earlier emergency applications seeking to lift the injunctions. This is different from the kind of case you would expect the Supreme Court to grant the extraordinary relief of a stay, because of the lack of any demonstrable urgency or harm and because the law and the facts are on our side, said American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Omar Jadwat. On Friday, the court asked the challengers, including the ACLU and Hawaii, to file responses to the Trump requests by June 12. The administration is then likely to file its own response to the challengers legal arguments before the justices issue an order granting or denying the administrations applications. One thorny issue the Supreme Court may have to resolve if it grants the stay is whether the 90-day ban Trump sought to impose would begin from the day of the courts action or whether the clock has been ticking throughout the litigation, meaning it would expire in mid-June. Challengers will argue for the latter, which would mean it is almost set to expire. That would limit the practical impact if the application were granted. The courts conservative majority includes Justice Anthony Kennedy. He sometimes sides with the courts four liberals and could be the pivotal vote. The travel bans challengers have relied in part on a concurring opinion Kennedy wrote in a 2015 Supreme Court immigration case. Kennedy wrote that in the immigration context, the governments actions can be questioned if there is evidence of bad faith. Another conservative justice is the man Trump appointed to the high court, Neil Gorsuch. During his U.S. Senate confirmation hearing, Gorsuch vowed not to be a rubber stamp for any president when asked about Trumps statements criticizing judges who ruled against the travel ban.  If the court agrees with Trump, the 90-day ban on people entering the United States from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen will be immediately revived. The court could also put a 120-day ban on all refugees into effect and allow the administration to consider new vetting procedures. Even if the court allows the travel ban to take effect, the bigger constitutional questions of religious discrimination and presidential powers raised by the order would not be considered by the nine justices until long after the ban periods have ended. The court begins its summer recess at the end of June and would not give the case a full hearing until its return in the autumn, by which time the ban would have lapsed. The emergency applications filed on Thursday night seek to block injunctions issued by judges in Maryland and Hawaii. The Maryland order was upheld on May 25 by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia. The governments appeal of the Hawaii injunction is being considered by the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. That court could issue its decision before the Supreme Court acts on the emergency application. Separate from the emergency application, the court also has to decide whether to hear the governments full appeal of the Virginia-based appeals court ruling.  The justices are not required to hear any case, but this one meets important criteria cited by experts, including that it is the federal government filing the appeal and that it involves a nationwide injunction.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating possible ties between the Trump election campaign and Russia, is expanding his probe to assume control of a grand jury investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn, three sources told Reuters. The move means Muellers politically charged inquiry will now look into Flynns paid work as a lobbyist for a Turkish businessman in 2016, in addition to contacts between Russian officials and Flynn and other Trump associates during and after the Nov. 8 presidential election.    Federal prosecutors in Virginia are investigating a deal between Flynn and Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin as part of a grand jury criminal probe, according to a subpoena seen by Reuters.  Alptekins company, Netherlands-based Inovo BV, paid Flynns consultancy $530,000 between September and November to produce a documentary and research on Fethullah Gulen, an exiled Turkish cleric living in the United States. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan blames Gulen for a failed coup last July.  Alptekin, an ally of Erdogan, told Reuters he hired Flynn to provide research on how Gulen is poisoning the atmosphere between Turkey and the United States. Gulen has denied any role in the coup and dismisses Turkeys allegations that he heads a terrorist organization. The grand jury in Virginia has issued subpoenas to some of Flynns business associates involved in the work for Inovo, two people familiar with the probe say. The subpoena seen by Reuters seeks bank records, documents and communications related to Flynn, his company, Flynn Intel Group, Alptekin and Inovo. Flynns lawyer, Robert Kelner, did not respond to questions about Flynns work for Inovo or Muellers investigation. A spokesman for Mueller declined to comment. Alptekin declined to comment when asked about the investigation into Flynn and whether he or anyone he knows has been subpoenaed.  Muellers move to take over the Virginia grand jurys criminal investigation highlights his broad powers as special counsel. Reuters could not determine when the grand jury was first convened, but its existence has been previously reported. Until now the investigation has been led by Brandon van Grack, an espionage prosecutor in the Justice Department, and federal prosecutors from the Eastern District of Virginia. It is not clear whether Van Grack and others who have been working on the case will continue to do so. Deputy U.S. Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller, a former FBI director, on May 17 to oversee an investigation into any links or collusion between Russia and individuals associated with the Trump campaign. Rosenstein also gave him authority to pursue any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation. Some members of Congress have asked the Justice Department to define the scope of Muellers inquiry. Muellers appointment followed an uproar over Trumps firing of FBI Director James Comey, who had been investigating alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Democrats and some of the presidents fellow Republicans had demanded an independent probe of whether Russia tried to sway the outcome of Novembers election in favor of Trump and against Democrat Hillary Clinton. Trump, who has said there was no coordination between his campaign and Russia, has decried the investigation as a witch hunt. One of Trumps most trusted aides during the election campaign, Flynn had a long career in the military. He set up the Flynn Intel Group, an Alexandria, Virginia-based intelligence consultancy, after President Barack Obama dismissed him as head of the militarys Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014. Mueller, who takes over leadership of an FBI investigation that began last July, can present evidence to grand juries and hear testimony from witnesses. Trump fired Flynn in February after it became clear that he had falsely characterized the nature of phone conversations he had with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak in December, just after the Obama administration imposed new sanctions on Russia for what U.S. intelligence agencies had concluded was a Kremlin-led effort through computer hacking, fake news and propaganda to boost Trumps chances of winning the White House. Flynns work for Inovo came under scrutiny after he published a commentary on a political news website on Election Day calling Gulen a radical Islamist who should be extradited to Turkey. Along with the editorial, the Flynn Intel Group also produced a 75-page report on Gulen based mainly on news reports and some video footage for a documentary that was never made, according to three people familiar with the project. Alptekin, who is chairman of the Turkey-U.S. Business Council, told Reuters he was satisfied with Flynns research because it had helped him understand how Gulens network operates in the United States. He said the $530,000 payment to Flynns firm came mostly from his personal funds. The rest came from Inovos corporate revenues, Alptekin said.  On Nov. 18,the day after Flynn was appointed Trumps national security adviser, Trump transition team lawyer William McGinley raised concerns on a call with the Flynn Intel Group and others involved in the Inovo project over who had paid for  Flynns commentary, according to two people with knowledge of the conversation. Flynn did not participate in that call, they said.  At the time of the call, Flynn had not disclosed that his work for Alptekin meant he was being paid to represent Turkish interests during the election campaign. Flynn Intel Group had said in a September 2016 filing that it was lobbying for Inovo but did not disclose its Turkish links. In March, Flynn retroactively registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. In a letter accompanying the March filing, Flynns lawyer, Kelner, said the disclosure was being made because Flynns work for Inovo could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey, which he noted was seeking to extradite Gulen.   The House of Representatives intelligence committee, which is also investigating  Russian interference in the election, subpoenaed records from Flynn on Wednesday. The Senates intelligence committee, which has a separate probe under way, has also served subpoenas on Flynn and two of his businesses, and earlier this week Flynn indicated that he would start turning over relevant materials.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trumps administration on Thursday asked the U.S. Supreme Court to revive his executive order that temporarily bans travelers from six Muslim-majority nations: Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The travel ban was blocked by lower courts that found it was discriminatory. [nL1N1IZ03Q]  Here are answers to some questions about how the case is likely to proceed.  What is the administration formally asking the Supreme Court to do?  The administration filed two emergency applications to lift or stay the injunctions placed on Trumps travel ban by federal district courts in Maryland and Hawaii. The Maryland order was upheld on May 25 by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. An appeal of the Hawaii order is pending before the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The part of the governments request will probably be acted on quickly by the court. The administration also filed a petition requesting the justices to review the overall legality of the travel ban. Even if the justices agree to take on a complete review, it likely would not happen until the fall, since the court will recess for the summer later this month.  What are the next steps for the Supreme Court?  The court may ask quickly for responses to the applications to stay the injunctions from individuals and groups that challenged the ban in lower courts. Five justices must then agree in order to grant a stay. If that happens, the travel ban is immediately restored. If five votes cannot be reached, the application will be denied. The decision could come within the next two weeks.  The court will likely simultaneously decide whether to review the broader merits of the case. Given the importance of the case, and its high profile, it is likely the justices will review it.  What are the governments main arguments?  Lower courts have found that the travel ban violates the U.S. Constitutions First Amendment, which bars the government from favoring one religion over another. The courts used statements by Trump and his top officials, both before and after the election, as evidence of hostility toward Muslims that motivated the ban.  As it has argued in lower courts, the Trump administration maintains that the president has broad discretion to suspend or ban the entry of foreigners into the United States.  Trumps executive order is based on national security and terrorism-related concerns, and its text is neutral toward religion, the government said. Supreme Court precedent therefore requires lower courts to defer to the government, it added.  But the administration will have to contend with a 2015 opinion by Justice Anthony Kennedy, a frequent swing vote on the bench, who wrote that in the immigration context, the governments actions can be scrutinized for evidence of bad faith.  The administration said that campaign statements are irrelevant because they were made before Trump took the oath of office, and the presidents national security judgment is enough to bar second-guessing by the courts.  The executive order is not a so-called Muslim ban, and campaign comments cannot change that basic fact, the administration said.  How might Neil Gorsuch, Trumps appointee to the Supreme Court, vote in the case?  Gorsuch did not indicate during his confirmation hearings in March how he would vote if a travel ban case came before him. However, in response to senators questions about Trumps criticism of judges who had blocked his first immigration-related executive orders, Gorsuch said it was disheartening and demoralizing. He promised that he would not be a rubber stamp for the president.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

However, he said, he had concluded that it is not the right time for me to leave the private sector. Conway had notified the White House of his decision on Wednesday in a letter, according to a person familiar with the matter. A White House spokeswoman referred a request for comment to the Justice Department.  A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment on the withdrawal. We dont comment on personnel matters, the spokesman, Ian Prior, said in a statement. Conway joins a number of potential hires who have withdrawn from consideration for posts in the Trump administration in recent weeks, including candidates for director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation after President Donald Trump fired James Comey. It has been increasingly difficult to attract people to work in the administration, Reuters reported last month, citing sources.  Conway, a Harvard University and Yale Law School graduate, is a partner at the prestigious New York law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. He has worked on major securities and takeover matters, including a 2010 case in which the U.S. Supreme Court said  federal securities laws typically do not apply to conduct in foreign countries. That decision has likely saved companies billions of dollars in potential liability. Conway also has been involved in politically charged cases, including a behind-the-scenes role in the sexual harassment lawsuit that former Arkansas state employee Paula Jones brought against then-President Bill Clinton.  That case led to the eventual impeachment of Clinton on charges stemming from his relationship with a White House intern, Monica Lewinsky. Kellyanne Conway was Trumps campaign manager before taking her White House post. The Republican pollster and political strategist has been one of the administrations most visible faces.

Griffin has lost sponsorships and jobs, including her role as co-host of CNNs New Years Eve coverage with journalist Anderson Cooper, since a photograph and video from the shoot appeared on social media on Tuesday. President Trump said the image of Griffin with the gory mask resembling him was sick and that it had traumatized his family, especially his youngest son, 11-year-old Barron. Trumps oldest son, Donald Jr., called for employers to drop the comedian. I dont think I will have a career after this.

Griffin reiterated the apology she posted on social media late on Tuesday, but remained defiant, saying, Im not afraid of Donald Trump, hes a bully, adding that she intended to continue making jokes about the president.  She also described herself as a provocative woman who has often had to deal with older white men in positions of power. Whats happening to me has never happened ever, in the history of this great country, which is that a sitting president of the United States and his grown children and the first lady are personally, I feel, trying to ruin my life - forever, she said. Griffin said the photo was intended to mock Trumps comments during the presidential campaign, when he told CNN that Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly had blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her - wherever when she moderated a 2015 presidential debate. Trumps remark was widely interpreted as referring to menstrual blood, implying that Kelly was in an unfriendly mood because she was menstruating.

The warning from House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi echoed earlier remarks from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has urged Congress to raise Washingtons borrowing limit before lawmakers leave for a long August recess. It should probably be done before we leave (at) the end of July, Pelosi told reporters in the Capitol. Many entities in our country are thinking theyre going to get a big tax break from President Trump for next year, and so the revenues are not coming in as fast this year as they should. President Donald Trump and fellow Republicans in Congress  have promised to overhaul the tax code, including slashing tax rates. Trumps chief economic advisor, Gary Cohn, told Fox Business News on Friday the administration will deliver a tax plan to Congress after the August recess. In view of promises like this that the administration has been making for months, some analysts have speculated that companies and wealthy Americans may be shifting income into 2018 in expectation of a coming tax cut. A May 5 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said government tax receipts for early 2017 were 3 percent lower than expected, due to smaller-than-anticipated payments from individuals and corporations. The CBO said this could be due in part to shifting of income to later years in hopes of taking advantage of a future tax cut. The U.S. government periodically raises the legal limit of how much money it can borrow to cover its budget deficit. Washington spends more money than it takes in from taxes. The hike must be approved by Congress, a decision that in recent years has been fraught with political drama.  In early March, the Treasury Department began implementing cash management measures to stave off hitting the existing debt limit. Those efforts were expected to be exhausted by October or November, but the latest data suggest that could happen sooner.  In 2011, the United States came close to what would have been a historic default as Republicans withheld their support for a debt limit increase in order to win deep budget cuts.

Three close associates of three contenders for the job, all of whom have been interviewed by Trump, said the candidates were summoned to the White House for 10- to 20-minute conversations with Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Those conversations, which followed initial interviews at the Justice Department, have been light on questions about substantive issues facing the agency, the three associates said. While the department has compiled a long list of candidates for the White House, there has been no clear framework or logic for who was interviewed and why, said one of the sources.  Another of the three sources described the process as chaotic and said that in one interview, Trump spoke mostly about himself and seemed distracted. The White House declined to comment on the nature of the interview process. Spokesman Sean Spicer said on Friday that Trump continues to meet with candidates but would not give a timeline for choosing a nominee.  On May 18, Trump told reporters he was very close to sending a nomination for a new director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to the Senate. At the time, former Senator Joe Lieberman was a front-runner for the post. He withdrew his name from consideration on May 25. At least a dozen other people have been under consideration, according to a White House spokeswoman, but not all have been interviewed by Trump. Republican Representative Trey Gowdy was under consideration but he said on May 15 he was not interested.  The next day, Republican Senator John Cornyn, also a contender, said he would stay in the Senate.  Spicer said on Tuesday that Trump planned to meet that afternoon with John Pistole, a former deputy director of the FBI and head of the Transportation Security Administration, and Chris Wray, former head of the Justice Departments criminal division.  The White House has said Trump also interviewed Lieberman, former Oklahoma Governor Frank Keating, acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe and former FBI official Richard McFeely.    Trump reportedly told Russian officials during a visit to the White House on May 10 that firing Comey the previous day relieved great pressure the president was feeling from an investigation of possible ties between his election campaign team and Russian officials.  The New York Times first reported that, in his remarks to the Russians, Trump called Comey crazy, a real nut job. Trump has denied any collusion between Russia and his presidential campaign. He has repeatedly questioned the U.S. intelligence finding that Russian President Vladimir Putin directed an operation intended to swing the election in Trumps favor against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. Russia has repeatedly denied any effort to interfere in the U.S. election, but Putin said on Thursday some Russians might have acted on their own without their governments involvement.

U.S. intelligence officials have said Russia tried to interfere in the U.S. election by hacking Trumps opponents, a charge that has deepened a political scandal which has focused on whether Trump had improper ties with Moscow, something he flatly denies.  Putin, addressing the St Petersburg International Economic Forum, said on Friday that the hacking accusations were nothing more than harmful gossip which he complained was damaging international relations and the global economy.  He said he had personally reviewed the U.S. intelligence reports which made the hacking allegations against Russia, and that they contained no meaningful evidence. I have read these reports, said Putin. Even in these reports there is nothing specific but only assumptions and conclusions based on assumptions. The idea that the hacking had reportedly been carried out from Russian IP addresses which constituted meaningful evidence of anything was absurd, he said.  Where are the finger prints? IP addresses can be faked. Do you know how many specialists there are who can make it look as if your children sent something from your home IP address? They can fake anything and then accuse anyone. Its not evidence. Putin, who is keen to repair battered U.S.-Russia relations and is expected to meet Trump for the first time at the G20 in Hamburg in July, said Trump had simply run a better campaign and better connected with voters than Clinton. He said her supporters were now trying to blame Russia for their failure. But the problem is not with us, the problem is inside American politics, said Putin. The other (Clinton) team miscalculated. They dont want to admit their mistake. Its easier for them to say that they are not guilty, that the Russians are the guilty ones for interfering in our election. It reminds me of anti-Semitism. Visibly irritated by having to discuss the matter, Putin was equally forthright about denying separate accusations that there had been some kind of secret deal between Moscow and the Trump team before his inauguration.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former FBI Director James Comey will testify next Thursday before a U.S. Senate panel investigating Russias alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, in a hearing that could add to difficulties facing President Donald Trump. In his first public appearance since Trump fired him on May 9, Comey will address the Senate Intelligence Committee in both an open session and behind closed doors, which would allow him to discuss classified information, the committee said on Thursday. Comey was leading the FBIs probe into the allegations, and his firing sparked a political uproar. Facing rising pressure, the Justice Department last month named Robert Mueller, another former FBI chief, as a special counsel to investigate the matter. The Justice Department and multiple U.S. congressional committees are investigating Russias actions in the 2016 presidential election and questions about possible collusion between Russian officials and Trump campaign associates. At next weeks hearing, Comey is expected to be asked about conversations in which Trump is reported to have pressured him to drop an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn, whose ties to Russia are under scrutiny. Controversy erupted again this week after the Republican head of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, Devin Nunes, approved subpoenas to the CIA, FBI and National Security Agency for information relating to the unmasking of the names of Trump campaign advisers inadvertently picked up in top-secret foreign communications intercepts. The White House and Nunes have alleged that former Democratic President Barack Obamas administration eavesdropped on Trumps campaign, an assertion that Comey has disputed and current U.S. officials dismiss as absurd. Four current and former U.S. officials who have reviewed the materials told Reuters there was no evidence that political motives drove Obamas aides to request the names be unredacted. There is no substance to this, so the only way to look at it is as an attempt to distract the headlines and the public from Comeys public testimony and Muellers investigation, both of which are serious, said one of the U.S. officials familiar with the information Nunes subpoenaed. Committee aides complained Nunes had acted unilaterally, and the top Democrat on the panel, Representative Adam Schiff, said Nunes actions violated his earlier decision to recuse himself from the Russia probe. Democratic Representative Jackie Speier said it appeared that Nunes was more concerned with pushing the White House narrative than seeking the truth.  Trump on Thursday renewed his allegation, without citing evidence, that his campaign communications were monitored, saying in a tweet: The big story is the unmasking and surveillance of people that took place during the Obama administration. Nunes followed suit hours later, tweeting: Seeing a lot of fake news from media elites and others who have no interest in violations of Americans civil liberties via unmaskings. The names of U.S. citizens mentioned in foreign communications intercepted by U.S. intelligence agencies are normally redacted, or masked, in intelligence reports. The requests to unmask the names of Trump associates underwent the same stringent evaluations that U.S. privacy laws and intelligence regulations require for all such applications, and they produced nothing out of the ordinary, said the four officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. At most, only one of the requests related to Russia in any way, and the rest pertained to other countries, two of them said. The requests involved between 30 and 40 top-secret reports on intercepted communications in which foreign officials outside the United States mentioned the Trump campaign and people involved in it, the officials said. The reports contained no evidence that any Americans were targets of U.S. eavesdropping operations, they said. Russia has repeatedly denied any effort to interfere in the U.S. election, but Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday some Russians might have acted on their own without their governments involvement. Trump has denied any collusion between Russia and his campaign. He has repeatedly questioned the U.S. intelligence finding that Putin directed an operation that included computer hacking, fake news and propaganda intended to swing the election in Trumps favor against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.

Trump, tapping into the America First message he used when he was elected president last year, said the Paris accord would undermine the U.S. economy, cost U.S. jobs, weaken American national sovereignty and put the country at a permanent disadvantage to the other countries of the world. Were getting out, Trump said at a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden under sunny skies on a warm June day, fulfilling a major election campaign pledge. We dont want other leaders and other countries laughing at us any more. And they wont be, Trump said. The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement are the countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars through tough trade practices and in many cases lax contributions to our critical military alliance, Trump added. Republican U.S. congressional leaders backed Trump. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell applauded Trump for dealing yet another significant blow to the Obama administrations assault on domestic energy production and jobs. Supporters of the accord, including some leading U.S. business figures, called Trumps move a blow to international efforts to tackle dangers for the planet posed by global warming. Former Democratic President Barack Obama expressed regret over the pullout from a deal he was instrumental in brokering. But even in the absence of American leadership; even as this administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; Im confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet weve got, Obama added. Trump, who has called climate change a hoax, said his administration would begin negotiations either to re-enter the Paris accord or to have a new agreement on terms that are fair to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers. He complained in particular about Chinas terms under the agreement. International leaders reacted with disappointment, even anger.  The decision made by U.S. President Trump amounts to turning their backs on the wisdom of humanity. Im very disappointed... I am angry, Japanese Environment Minister Koichi Yamamoto told a news conference on Friday in an unusually frank tone. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni said in a rare joint statement the agreement could not be renegotiated and urged their allies to hasten efforts to combat climate change and adapt. While the U.S. decision is disheartening, we remain inspired by the growing momentum around the world to combat climate change and transition to clean growth economies, said Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. A summit between Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and top European Union officials in Brussels on Friday will end with a joint statement - the first ever issued by China and the EU -  committing both sides to full implementation of the Paris accord. Speaking in Berlin a day earlier, Premier Li said China, the worlds biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, would stick to its commitment to fight climate change. Russia also voiced abiding support for the Paris accord, regardless of the U.S. withdrawal. We made the decision to join, and I dont think we will (change) it, Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich was quoted as saying by RIA news agency. In India, one of the worlds fastest growing major economies and a growing contributor to pollution, a top advisor to    Prime Minister Narendra Modi vouched for intentions to switch to renewable power generation independent of the Paris accord. The prime minister is very keen on this, Arvind Panagariya said. With Trumps action, the United States will walk away from nearly every other nation in the world on one of the pressing global issues of the 21st century. Syria and Nicaragua are the only other non-participants in the accord, signed by 195 nations in Paris in 2015. Fijis Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama, who is the incoming head of the U.N. Climate Change Conferences, which formalized the 2015 pact, said Trumps decision was deeply disappointing. Fiji, like many other small island nations, is seen as particularly vulnerable to global warming and a possible rise in ocean levels as a result of melting polar ice. U.S. business leaders voiced exasperation with the Trump administration. Todays decision is a setback for the environment and for the U.S.s leadership position in the world, Goldman Sachs Group Inc Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein wrote on Twitter. Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk and Walt Disney CEO Robert Iger said they would leave White House advisory councils after Trumps move. Under the Paris accord, which took years to reach, rich and poor countries committed to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases generated by burning fossil fuels that are blamed by scientists for warming the planet. (GRAPHIC - The 2015 Paris Agreement to limit climate change: tmsnrt.rs/2f3oKDV)     I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris, Trump said. Pittsburghs mayor, Democrat Bill Peduto, shot back on Twitter that his city, long the heart of the U.S. steel industry, actually embraced the Paris accord. The spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the action a major disappointment. The U.N. body that handles climate negotiations said the accord could not be renegotiated based on the request of a single nation. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, speaking in Singapore on Friday, also called the U.S. decision disappointing... but not at all surprising, adding that Australia remained committed to our Paris commitments. South Koreas foreign ministry said in a statement it is regrettable that the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate accord will undermine international responsibility and efforts to respond to climate change. Trump said the United States would stop payments to the U.N. Green Climate Fund, in which rich countries committed billions of dollars to help developing nations deal with floods, droughts and other impacts from climate change. The White House said it would stick to U.N. rules for withdrawing from the pact. Those rules require a nation to wait three years from the date the pact gained legal force, Nov. 4, 2016, before formally seeking to leave. That country must then wait another year.  Apple CEO Tim Cook expressed disappointment and said in an email to employees that he had spoken with Trump on Tuesday to try to persuade him to stay in the Paris accord. It wasnt enough, he said. Other business leaders warned that the U.S. economy would give away technological leadership. General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt said he was disappointed, adding: Climate change is real. Industry must now lead and not depend on government. Democrats also blasted Trump. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called the decision one of the worst policy moves made in the 21st century because of the huge damage to our economy, our environment and our geopolitical standing. The United States had committed to reduce emissions by 26 to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025. The United States accounts for more than 15 percent of total worldwide greenhouse gas emissions, second only to China. Leading climate scientists say greenhouse gas emissions trap heat in the atmosphere and have caused a warming planet, sea level rise, droughts and more frequent violent storms. A Global Trends report prepared by the U.S. Director of National Intelligences office, released on Jan. 9, warned that climate change posed security risks because of extreme weather, stress on water and food, and global tensions over how to manage the changes.  Last year was the warmest since records began in the 19th Century, as global average temperatures continued a rise dating back decades that scientists attribute to greenhouse gases. Frank Rijsberman, Director-General of Seoul based Global Green Growth Institute expected international funding for investment needed to fight climate change would suffer, noting a $1 billion reduction in U.S. funding the Green Climate Fund in South Korea. Economists said the U.S. withdrawal would potentially cost U.S. jobs. China and the EU both already employ more workers in the renewable energy sector than the United States, according to the data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena). Winding back the climate agenda means that the U.S. will be left behind in the clean energy transition as other global players, such as in Europe and China, demonstrate greater commitment to deploying low carbon and job-creating solutions to climate change, said Peter Kiernan, of the Economist Intelligence Unit.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": "" NEW YORK (Reuters) - Massachusetts Institute of Technology officials said U.S. President Donald Trump badly misunderstood their research when he cited it on Thursday to justify withdrawing the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement.  Trump announced during a speech at the White House Rose Garden that he had decided to pull out of the landmark climate deal, in part because it would not reduce global temperatures fast enough to have a significant impact.  Even if the Paris Agreement were implemented in full, with total compliance from all nations, it is estimated it would only produce a two-tenths of one degree Celsius reduction in global temperature by the year 2100, Trump said.  Tiny, tiny amount.  That claim was attributed to research conducted by MIT, according to White House documents seen by Reuters. The Cambridge, Massaschusetts-based research university published a study in April 2016 titled How much of a difference will the Paris Agreement make? showing that if countries abided by their pledges in the deal, global warming would slow by between 0.6 degree and 1.1 degrees Celsius by 2100.  MORE FROM REUTERS* World pledges to save environment despite Trump*Musk, Iger to quit Trump advisory councils*Trump administration asks Supreme Court to revive travel ban We certainly do not support the withdrawal of the U.S. from the Parisagreement, said Erwan Monier, a lead researcher at the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change, and one of the studys authors.  If we dont do anything, we might shoot over 5 degrees or more and that would be catastrophic, said John Reilly, the co-director of the program, adding that MITs scientists had had no contact with the White House and were not offered a chance to explain their work.  The Paris accord, reached by nearly 200 countries in 2015, was meant to limit global warming to 2 degrees or less by 2100, mainly through country pledges to cut carbon dioxide and other emissions from the burning of fossil fuels.  Under the pact, the United States - the worlds second biggest carbon emitter behind China - had committed to reduce its emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025.  A senior administration official defended Trumps use of the findings. Its not just MIT. I think there is a consensus, not only in the environmental community, but elsewhere that the Paris agreement in and of itself will have a negligible impact on climate, the official told reporters at a briefing.  The dispute is the latest round of a years-long battle between scientists and politicians over how to interpret facts about the effects of burning fossil fuels on the global climate, and translate them into policy.  Trump has repeatedly cast doubt on the science of climate change and once called it a hoax perpetrated by China to weaken U.S. business.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Separately, Kremlin aide Andrei Belousov told reporters at the same event that the U.S. withdrawal punched a gaping hole in the pact, rendering it unworkable. Belousov said Russia was analyzing the U.S. move, but said Russias own plans did not depend on the decision of others, including the United States.  I think its a great shame because decisions that have been taken should not be changed, he said of the U.S. withdrawal. Its obvious that without the participation of the United States the Paris agreement will be unworkable because the United States is one of the biggest generators of emissions.

Iger wrote on Twitter that as a matter of principle, Ive resigned from the Presidents Council over the #ParisAgreement withdrawal. He is leaving the business advisory group. Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] CEO Travis Kalanick quit the business advisory council in February amid pressure from activists and employees who opposed the administrations immigration policies. Trump created the business advisory group in December before taking office to assist him in making policy decisions. The group is led by Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of Blackstone Group LP and includes Indra Nooyi, the chief executive of PepsiCo Inc and Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase & Co . Late on Thursday, BlackRock Inc Chief Executive Larry Fink said he would continue to serve on Trumps CEO Forum,  despite reservations about the White House decision to withdraw from the Paris accord.

In a commentary published on Friday, Xinhua suggested that no one country was now likely take up leadership of global efforts to fight climate change. China overtook the United States as the worlds biggest emitter of greenhouse gases in 2007 but analysts see the U.S. withdrawal as an opportunity for China to burnish its image as a global leader. Trumps decision to ditch the Paris deal will leave a fairly big shoe for a single country to fill, Xinhua said, adding that major players such as China, the European Union and India had reiterated their willingness to step up efforts. Leaving the 2015 Paris accord would hardly translate into a substantial increase in new jobs as the fossil fuel industries were highly automated, Xinhua said. Noting that Trump said he had had extensive discussions with people on both sides of the climate debate, it said: One can only assume that Trump has very good reasons to leave the Paris agreement, and that he knows the implications of U.S. retreat from the landmark deal. Trump, tapping into the America First message he used when he was elected president last year, said the Paris accord would undermine the U.S. economy, cost U.S. jobs, weaken American national sovereignty and put the country at a permanent disadvantage to other countries such as China. The Global Times, an influential state-run tabloid, said in an editorial published on Thursday before Trumps announcement that China was not interested in discussions about the leadership of fighting climate change and would focus on its own promises to reduce emissions. It called the withdrawal reckless and would waste  increasingly finite U.S. diplomatic resources. There are indeed some underprivileged people in the U.S, but their troubles are mainly caused by bad internal governance. Seeking external reasons for domestic woes is by no means what the worlds largest economy should do, it said.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Criticism of his decision rolled in from blue-chip companies like Facebook Inc, Apple Inc , Ford Motor Co  and Microsoft Corp , while the response from fossil fuel groups with the most to gain from a relaxation of U.S. carbon emissions standards was muted.  Tesla Inc Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co CEO Robert Iger said they would leave White House advisory councils over Trumps decision. In an interview on Thursday, the president of the World Coal Association, Benjamin Sporton, told Reuters that he had mixed feelings about Trumps announcement, adding he was eager to see a U.S. policy that actively promotes a place for coal in the global energy mix. What we really need to see, if the president wants to re-enter the deal, is that he can change the agreement to recognize the role of all sources of energy, including coal, Sporton said, adding his group had described to administration officials the benefits of remaining in the agreement. The American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industrys biggest trade group, meanwhile, issued a statement saying it had never taken an official position on the Paris accord.  A number of its members, including Exxon Mobil Corp and ConocoPhillips, had publicly supported the deal. For us, our position on the Paris agreement... we need a framework like that to address the risks of climate change, Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods told reporters on the sidelines of the companys annual general meeting on Wednesday. Some other groups expressed measured support for Trumps decision, saying it provided an opportunity to fix problems with the deal. Manufacturers support the spirit of the Paris Agreement and the effort to address climate change through a fair international agreement. But as the president has acknowledged, certain elements of this deal were not equitable for U.S. manufacturers, said Ross Eisenberg, vice president for energy and resources policy at the National Association of Manufacturers, in a statement to Reuters.  A spokesman for Peabody Energy Corp, Americas largest publicly traded coal miner, had said on Wednesday that the company would support a decision by Trump to withdraw from the Paris deal because the accord is flawed on a number of levels. Trump vowed during his campaign to pull the United States out of the Paris deal, arguing the pact would cost the United States trillions of dollars, kill jobs, and stymie economic growth without providing tangible benefit. His critics have argued, however, that the risks of climate change require action, and that a shift to a low-carbon energy economy can create more jobs than it eliminates. Spokespeople for other extractive oil and mining groups, like the National Mining Association and the American Fuel & Petrochemicals Manufacturers, declined to comment on Trumps decision to withdraw from the Paris accord.

The memo sent by acting Deputy Administrator Mike Flynn on Thursday said the agency wants to complete the buyout program by September. It did not give a dollar figure for the buyouts or say how many employees it hoped would take the offer. The memo was sent to all employees at the same time EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt joined Trump at the White House to announce that the United States would withdraw from the Paris climate agreement.

The EPA employs about 15,000 people.  In the memo, Flynn said the White House Office of Management and Budget must still approve the buyout plan. The EPA and other federal agencies have offered buyouts to employees from time to time in the past.

Career staff at the EPA have been on edge since Trump took office, as the president vowed to undo major EPA air and water regulations in his first 100 days. Pruitt, who was an instrumental voice in convincing Trump to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord, doubts that human beings drive climate change and believes the agency should pare back regulations on the energy industry.

Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of President Donald Trump and one of his top advisers, early this year stepped down as chief executive officer of his familys real estate company. Senator Patrick Leahy and Representatives John Conyers and Zoe Lofgren, in the nine-page letter dated Thursday and sent to Kushner Companies President Laurent Morali, asked for details about the companys controversial May road show in China, where the developer offered investors a chance to get U.S. visas under the EB-5 program if they put money in a project in New Jersey, One Journal Square. The letter, which was released publicly, also asked Kushner Companies what steps it has taken to ensure its affiliates do not exploit Jared Kushners White House role when wooing investors in the future. The lawmakers cited a May 12 Reuters report that a Chinese immigration agency promoting the Kushner Companies project had touted Kushners White House connections to assure potential investors that the One Journal Square project would succeed and investors would receive green cards.   Such guarantees are prohibited by the rules of the EB-5 program, which grants foreigners a U.S. green card in exchange for investing $500,000 or more in development projects in low-employment areas of the United States. Kushner Companies did not immediately return calls for comment. Kushner Companies had apologized for Nicole Kushner Meyers reference to her brother, Jared Kushner, when pitching One Journal Square in China in May.  The letter by the three Democrats follows a call by the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley, last week for a probe into potentially fraudulent statements and misrepresentations made by companies promoting investment in the One Journal Square project. Leahy, Conyers, and Lofgren - all members of the House or Senate Judiciary Committees - noted in their letter that they have worked with Republican committee members since 2015 to improve the EB-5 program by enacting tougher anti-fraud measures. Jared Kushner used to be closely involved with groups that lobbied against those reform efforts, according to the letter, including one firm that is marketing the One Journal Square project.

In the end, Trump stuck to a promise that he had made on the campaign trail last year aimed at helping blue-collar workers who he feels are under siege in a changing U.S. economy. I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Pars, he said on Thursday in making his announcement. But Trumps intentions concerning the Paris accord were unclear even to some of his aides until the last day or so, since he has shown flexibility on some campaign promises and had gotten an earful about the need to stay in the agreement from key allies at a Group of Seven summit last week in Sicily. At the White House, the behind-the-scenes debate about whether to stay in Paris or bolt was an intense one that dragged on for weeks. Ivanka Trump, whose husband, Jared Kushner, is a senior White House adviser, had been quietly urging her father to keep the United States in the Paris agreement, and had sought to ensure her father heard all sides in the debate, an official said. Cohn last week suggested Trump might be softening on his outright hostility toward the accord, telling reporters the presidents position was evolving based on input from world leaders who wanted the United States to remain in the agreement. Kushner, on the other hand, came around to the view that the standards set out in the agreement did not work for the U.S. economy, a senior administration official said. The official said the question for Kushner was whether to try to change those standards within the agreement or pull out. Consistently in favor of pulling out were Bannon and Trump speechwriter Stephen Miller, who was involved in writing Trumps Paris remarks, and Scott Pruitt, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Both Bannon and Miller are seen as key architects of Trumps America First agenda, which is aimed at ensuring U.S. interests are taken into account over a globalist view. Although there had been some discussion of keeping the United States in the Paris accord, while changing its carbon emissions commitments, as a way of maintaining global unity, in the end, Trump decided to cut the cord entirely. I think the presidents legal team felt very strongly that it was best, that the cleanest way to address it was to just get out, a senior administration official told reporters.

The officials said they collectively could show the international community that the United States remained committed to cutting the emissions that scientists blame for global warming. Governors and analysts cited moves including Californias effort to get 100 percent of its electricity from renewable sources, northeast states potentially tightening maximum allowances for carbon and Oregon working on measures to put a price on carbon. There is a pathway here where the rest of America in reaction to, really, what is an insane decision by president Trump, takes the kind of steps needed, California Governor Jerry Brown told Reuters.  More states could follow California and neighboring Oregons lead on low-carbon fuel standards, expand zero emission vehicle requirements and potentially merge carbon measures such as taxes, caps and trading, the governors and analysts said. There is a possibility over time that states could increase their cap-and-trade markets and merge them, including across national boundaries, as has happened with Quebec and California, Washington state Governor Jay Inslee said in an interview with Reuters, referring to regional carbon trading systems already in place in the Northeast and West. Inslee, Brown and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Thursday announced the creation of a climate alliance for states committed to the Paris goals.     Trump announced his decision to withdraw from the Paris accord, saying the its requirement to cut U.S. emission of carbon dioxide threatened millions of jobs and productivity. He said he would start a process that could last four years to withdraw from the deal, which has been signed by almost every other nation on Earth. [L1N1IY0MV] The president used declining coal industry jobs as an example of his concern that the climate pledge was hurting U.S. workers. But critics of his move pointed out that renewable energy industries, particularly solar, are creating hundreds of thousands of jobs - far more than currently exist in coal. This decision wont bring back coal jobs in the United States. That train has left the station, California state senate leader Kevin de Leon, a Democrat, said of Trumps withdrawal. Clean energy is the future. De Leon introduced a bill that would require California get 100 percent of its retail electricity from renewables by 2045, and it passed the state senate on Wednesday. California Governor Brown is heading to China on Friday to lead a conference of states and other subnational actors making voluntary commitments to cut greenhouse grasses.  The group, the Under2 coalition, which takes its name from the Paris accords effort to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius, has grown to 170 jurisdictions representing more than a third of the global economy over the past two years - including 10 states in the United States. Brown said he was exploring the possibility of integrating California and Chinese provincial carbon trading systems. That would be a heavy lift he said, but I am going to discuss that with the highest officials in China this week. Smaller states also aim to lead by example. Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection chief Rob Klee said he was working on a program to build electric vehicle infrastructure. What we believe we can do in Connecticut is show the policies that can work, he said. The U.S. commitment under Paris of cutting emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 is ambitious, though. John Larsen of Rhodium Group estimated the United States under Trump policies was on track for a 15 percent to 19 percent reduction. At this stage in the game, new experimentation at the state level with new policy options could be really, really important to not just meeting Paris but driving emissions down in the long run, he said. Several cities said that they would work toward reaching the goal. We are increasing investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency. We will buy and create more demand for electric cars and trucks, a group of more than 50 mayors from cities ranging from Houston, Texas to New Orleans, Louisiana said in a statement on Thursday. The various coalitions of states and cities said that they had the heft to command international attention. Clearly California is sort of the big dog in this pack, but our ability to work with California and Washington and British Columbia has a huge impact, Oregon Governor Kate Brown told Reuters.

The three leaders tried to convince Trump last week at a Group of Seven summit to stay in the pact and honor U.S. commitments undertaken by the previous administration. In a speech at the White House, Trump said the U.S. would look to renegotiate the agreement and condemned what he called draconian financial and economic burdens imposed by the deal. The unusual French-Italian-German statement, released barely an hour after Trump announced his decision, underscored the disappointment of the eurozones three largest economies and their resolve to plow ahead without Washingtons support. We are convinced that the implementation of the Paris Agreement offers substantial economic opportunities for prosperity and growth in our countries and on a global scale, the three leaders said. We therefore reaffirm our strongest commitment to swiftly implement the Paris Agreement, including its climate finance goals and we encourage all our partners to speed up their action to combat climate change. In his speech, Trump complained that the Paris Accord required wealthy nations to help developing countries build renewable energy sources. France, Italy and German indicated they were ready to do more to help in the absence of U.S. funds.

Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney called absurd a recent finding by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) that a Republican healthcare bill would cause 23 million people to lose health insurance coverage. In an interview on Wednesday with the Washington Examiner, a conservative newspaper, Mulvaney said, At some point, youve got to ask yourself, has the day of the CBO come and gone? Steny Hoyer, a Democratic House of Representatives leader, in a statement called Mulvaneys comments irresponsible and unacceptable and an indication of a bully mentality. The CBO is one of a handful of analysis units of Congress whose employees strive for political impartiality, providing  dependable and neutral information that lawmakers can use when making often complex budget, tax and other decisions. President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans, including Mulvaney, have been frustrated with the CBOs findings about their proposals to roll back Obamacare, the healthcare system put in place by then-Democratic President Barack Obama formally known as the Affordable Care Act. When Trump administration officials either disagree with or do not understand the impacts of their own policies, they prefer to attack the nonpartisan analysts who are doing their jobs with integrity and expertise, Hoyer said in a statement. Representative John Yarmuth, also a Democrat, said that Mulvaney had impugned the integrity of a CBO analyst in charge of the healthcare assessment and urged Mulvaney to apologize. The CBO was created in 1974 during a spending dispute between the Democratic-controlled Congress and Republican President Richard Nixon after he withheld funds for government programs that did not support his political positions. A CBO spokeswoman declined to comment on Thursday. Former CBO Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a Republican who headed the office under President George W. Bush, said it was not unusual for the office to become a political football. Whats unusual here is to have the sitting OMB director attack the integrity, the core of the institution, he said.

The market reaction reflects concerns, raised by some coal companies in recent months, that a U.S. exit from the Paris Climate Agreement could unleash a global backlash against coal interests outside the United States. Peabody Energy, the largest publicly traded U.S. coal company dropped 2.2 percent to $24.29 a share, while Arch Coal fell 0.4 percent to $70.77. A spokesman for Peabody said the company would support a decision by Trump to withdraw from the Paris deal because the accord is flawed on a number of levels. Cloud Peak Energy Inc had also urged the Trump administration to stay in the Paris deal to prevent other nations from an aggressive turn against the global coal industry. Its shares were down 0.6 percent to $3.39. A spokesman for Cloud Peak declined to comment. A source briefed on the matter told Reuters that Trump is planning to follow through on his campaign pledge to pull the United States out of the Paris accord, a move designed to help boost domestic energy production and speed economic growth, after weeks of deliberations on the issue.  Trump did not confirm the decision, but said he would make an announcement over the coming days. A U.S. withdrawal would come over the objections of scores of big U.S. corporations - from Wal-Mart to Exxon Mobil - worried the move will complicate the business landscape instead of bolstering the economy. For us, our position on the Paris agreement... we need a framework like that to address the risks of climate change, Exxon Mobil Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods told reporters on the sidelines of the companys annual general meeting on Wednesday. Exxon had made that case in a recent letter to the White House, he said. Exxon dipped 0.7 percent, ConocoPhillips declined 0.2 percent, and Chevron Corp fell 0.6 percent. Crude oil prices fell to a three-week low on news that recovering Libyan output boosted OPEC crude output in May. Solar energy shares also got hit on Wednesday, with First Solar Inc down 2.5 percent, and SunPower Corp each down 3.4 percent.  Regardless of what the President decides on the accord, we expect Americas solar industry to continue to thrive and create jobs, boost the economy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the Solar Energy Industries Association said in a statement. Shares of Tesla Inc, which recently acquired SolarCity, were up 1.8 percent at $341.01. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in a Twitter post on Wednesday that he had done all I can to convince Trump to stay in the Paris accord, and threatened to leave White House advisory councils if Trump announces a U.S. exit.  Trump campaigned on a promise to unravel Obama-era climate regulations to help boost domestic oil, gas and coal production. Company executives, economists, and analysts have expressed skepticism, however, that his deregulatory agenda can alter existing trends away from coal. U.S. carbon emissions have declined to near 30-year lows, a trend driven by increased natural gas use replacing coal. The VanEck Vectors Coal exchange-traded fund fell 1.2 percent to $12.71, not far from a five-month low hit earlier in May. The ETF is on track to fall 7.2 percent this month after rising in the first three months of the year as part of the so-called Trump trade. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

In March, the FCC granted an emergency temporary waiver to Jewish community centers and telecommunications carriers that serve them to help track down callers who have made threats by unmasking phone numbers used to call in threats. FCC rules generally require phone companies to respect a calling partys request to have caller-ID information blocked from the party receiving the call. Jewish community centers and schools in at least 13 U.S. states reported receiving bomb threats this year, stoking fears of a resurgence of anti-Semitism. The episode raised the question of whether we need to make permanent changes to our rules, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said in a blog post Thursday. The FCC will consider a proposal to change the rules to ensure that all threatened parties and associated law enforcement personnel have quick access to the information they need to identify and thwart threatening callers, he added. In April, prosecutors identified an Israeli-American teenager accused of making dozens of bomb threats to Jewish community centers in separate criminal complaints filed in U.S. federal courts in Florida and Georgia that linked him to hundreds of threatening calls in 2015 and 2017. Michael Ron David Kadar, 18, a dual U.S.-Israeli citizen who is Jewish and lives in Israel, made at least 245 threatening telephone calls between Jan. 4 and March 7 this year, many targeting Jewish community centers in the United States, according to the Florida complaint. The FCC has only rarely granted waivers to access caller information. In 2015, the Middletown School District in New York state was inundated by phone calls making terrorism threats from anonymous numbers. Following the calls, then-FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler approved a special waiver in 2016 to access the caller information of the individuals making the threats.

After months of fierce debate within his administration, Trump chose to continue his predecessors policy of signing a six-month waiver overriding a 1995 law requiring that the embassy be transferred to Jerusalem, an action that would have complicated his efforts to restart Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. The White House insisted, however, that the decision, which is sure to disappoint Israels U.S. supporters, did not mean Trump was abandoning the goal of eventually shifting the embassy to Jerusalem. But a U.S. official said no timetable has been set. The question is not if that move happens, but only when, the White House said in a statement. With a deadline looming, Trump made the decision to defer action on the embassy to maximize the chances of successfully negotiating a deal between Israel and the Palestinians, fulfilling his solemn obligation to defend Americas national security interests, the White House said. Palestinian leaders, Arab governments and Western allies had urged Trump not to proceed with the embassy relocation, which would have upended decades of U.S. policy by granting what would have been seen as de facto U.S. recognition of Israels claim to all of Jerusalem as its capital. Though Israel is disappointed that the embassy will not move at this time, we appreciate todays expression of President Trumps friendship to Israel and his commitment to moving the embassy in the future, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus office said in a statement. Taking a harder stance, Israeli Education Minister Naftali Bennett, a far-right member of Netanyahus coalition, said delaying the move would damage the prospect of a lasting peace by nurturing false expectations among the Palestinians regarding the division of Jerusalem, which will never happen. Nabil Abu Rdainah, a close aide to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, said Trumps decision reaffirms the seriousness of the United States in its efforts to achieve peace. Trump avoided any public mention of a potential embassy move during his visit to Israel and the West Bank in May. Despite that, most experts are skeptical of Trumps chances for achieving a peace deal that had eluded other U.S. presidents. The status of Jerusalem is one of the major stumbling blocks. Israel captured Arab East Jerusalem during the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed it, a move not recognized internationally. Israel considers all of the city its indivisible capital. The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state. Jerusalem is home to sites considered holy by the Jewish, Muslim and Christian religions. Successive U.S. administrations have insisted that Jerusalems status must be decided in negotiations. On the campaign trail, Trumps pro-Israel rhetoric raised expectations that he would act quickly to move the embassy. But after he took office in January, the issue lost momentum as he met Arab leaders who warned it would be hard to rejuvenate long-stalled peace efforts unless he acted as a fair mediator. Some of Trumps top aides pushed for him to keep his campaign promise to satisfy the pro-Israel, right-wing base that helped him win the presidency. The State Department, however recommended against an embassy move, one U.S. official said. No one should consider this step to be in any way a retreat from the presidents strong support for Israel, according to the White House statement on the signing of the waiver.

The London-based newspaper said Farage had not been accused of wrongdoing and was not a suspect or target of the U.S. investigation. But it said he was right in the middle of the relationships being looked at.  The newspaper said the former leader of the UK Independence Party had raised the interest of FBI investigators due to his connections with Trump and Julian Assanges Wikileaks, which published leaked emails from the Democratic National Committee during the campaign. An FBI spokeswoman declined to comment on the Guardian story, and other U.S. officials said they were unaware of any serious FBI interest in Farage.  Farage said on Twitter it had taken him a long time to read the Guardian article because he was laughing so much at this fake news. This hysterical attempt to associate me with the (Vladimir) Putin regime is a result of the liberal elite being unable to accept Brexit and Trump, he said. I consider it extremely doubtful that I could be a person of interest to the FBI as I have no connections to Russia. Accusations that Russia interfered in the U.S. 2016 presidential election have dogged Trump since he entered office and a former FBI chief, Robert Mueller, has been named as special counsel to investigate any collusion. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russia used computer hacking, propaganda and misleading news reports designed to sway political opinion in an attempt to boost Trumps chances of winning the White House. Trump has dismissed the notion that Russia played any role in his November election victory. Kremlin chief Vladimir Putin, a former KGB spy, has denied meddling in the U.S. election.  CIA Director Mike Pompeo called Assanges Wikileaks a hostile intelligence service in April after it distributed material hacked from Democratic National Committee computers during the 2016 campaign.  Pompeo said Russias GRU military intelligence service had used Wikileaks to distribute the material and concluded that Russia stole the emails and took other actions to tilt the election in favor of Trump, a Republican, over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. One of the things the intelligence investigators have been looking at is points of contact and persons involved, the Guardian quoted one source as saying. If you triangulate Russia, WikiLeaks, Assange and Trump associates the person who comes up with the most hits is Nigel Farage. Hes right in the middle of these relationships. He turns up over and over again. Theres a lot of attention being paid to him. Farage, who campaigned for decades for Britain to leave the European Union, was a vocal backer of Trump, appearing on the campaign trail and meeting him in New York just days after the election victory.  Farage, who also attended Trumps inauguration in Washington, met Assange in March this year at the Ecuadorean embassy in London where the Wikileaks founder has been holed up for five years.

The liberal Democrats keep-Kennedy campaign, being pursued publicly and privately, reflects how powerless they have become against the Republican president when it comes to high court vacancies since the Senate in April reduced the vote tally needed to confirm a Supreme Court nomination to 51 from 60. It also shows how big the stakes are for both sides in any decision that Kennedy, who turns 81 in July, makes about his future on the court. If he were to retire, Trump would have a historic opportunity to recast the court in a more conservative posture, possibly for decades to come.  Some former Kennedy clerks have said he is thinking about retirement. He has declined to comment on his plans, despite requests from many media outlets including Reuters. Right now, Kennedy is the most important man in America. He is the vote that swings the court on the most important cases that reach it, said Elizabeth Wydra, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center, a left-leaning think tank. Nominated by Republican President Ronald Reagan in 1987 to a lifetime court seat, Kennedy has been a crucial swing vote on the nine-member court for more than a decade. On most issues, such as campaign finance and religious rights, he has voted with fellow conservatives. He also voted with the minority to strike down the 2010 Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. But on gay rights and abortion, he has sided with the courts four liberals. If he stays in his post, the courts long-standing ideological balance will be preserved. If he quits, Trump could replace him with someone who tilts further right, giving conservatives a solid five-vote majority. Wydra and other liberals are lionizing Kennedy and his legacy in the media. Some are reaching out to former Kennedy clerks and others who know him, asking them to urge him not to retire, said Michele Jawando, a legal advocate at the Center for American Progress think tank in Washington. One former Kennedy clerk confirmed being asked to urge him to stay on and said other clerks had asked him to do so. Other clerks said they had not been approached by liberal activists. Since he took office in January, Trumps only significant domestic policy achievement has been winning Senate confirmation of his nominee to the high court, Neil Gorsuch, a former Kennedy clerk. Gorsuch replaced a fellow conservative, Antonin Scalia, who died in February 2016. The Gorsuch confirmation did not shift the courts ideological balance, but it did trigger a change in the Senate rules for considering Supreme Court nominees. To get Gorsuch confirmed, Republicans exercised the nuclear option, ending Democrats ability to use a procedural maneuver called a filibuster to block a final vote on a Supreme Court nominee. As a result, Republicans, with a 52-48 Senate majority, can now confirm any future nominee without Democratic support.  In another handicap, liberal groups said they lacked the money to sway public opinion via TV and online ads, unlike  conservative groups that had $10 million to back Gorsuch. In view of those disadvantages, People for the American Way, another liberal group, issued a report earlier this month outlining the impact of a Kennedy retirement, describing it as a disaster for the rights of all Americans. Liberals want in part to protect the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion. As a candidate, Trump said he would appoint court justices who would vote to overturn the decision. Perhaps seeking to reassure Kennedy that his legacy is in safe hands, Trump has consistently praised the justice. At Gorsuchs swearing-in in April, Trump called Kennedy a great man of outstanding accomplishment. Trump and other Republicans have said they have heard rumors that Kennedy might retire, but have not publicly urged him to. The president has vowed to pick his next nominee the same way he chose Gorsuch, from a list of contenders he made public before the election. Among contenders viewed as possible Kennedy replacements are federal appeals court judges Raymond Kethledge and Thomas Hardiman, conservative lawyer and former Solicitor General Paul Clement and Brett Kavanaugh, a judge on the federal appeals court in Washington, according to a person with knowledge of the nomination process.

Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin urged Trump in a separate meeting not to quit the Paris accord.

Trump was due to announce his decision later on Thursday. A source briefed on the decision has told Reuters in Washington that he will follow through on his campaign pledge to pull the United States out of the global agreement. The accord, agreed on by nearly 200 countries in 2015, aims to cut emissions blamed for global warming. The United States committed to reducing its own by 26 to 28 percent, compared with 2005 levels, by 2025. Sanchez Sorondo said he believed the U.S. oil lobby was behind the decision and that the industry had maneuvered Trump.  A withdrawal would not only be a disaster but completely unscientific, he said. Saying that we need to rely on coal and oil is like saying that the earth is not round. It is an absurdity dictated by the need to make money.  Trump has called the idea of global warming a hoax. In  March, Cardinal Peter Turkson, the popes point man for the environment, immigration and development, urged Trump to listen to dissenting voices and reconsider his position on climate change.

UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Raad Al Hussein also criticized the law, saying it effectively hands administration of NGOs to the government.     The law, issued on Monday after being ratified by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, restricts NGO activity to developmental and social work and introduces jail terms of up to five years for non-compliance. Egyptian lawmakers said the law was necessary to protect national security. The government has long accused human rights groups of taking foreign funds to sow chaos and several are facing investigation over their funding. Cairos foreign ministry denied the law aimed to restrict NGOs and said some of them have gotten used to working outside the law ... to defame the image of civil society in Egypt. In Washington on Wednesday, Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham said in a joint statement: President al-Sisis decision to ratify the draconian legislation ... that regulates the work of non-governmental organizations is the latest sign of a growing crackdown on human rights and peaceful dissent in Egypt.  McCain, who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Graham said the U.S. Congress should in response strengthen democratic benchmarks and human rights conditions on U.S. assistance for Egypt. That sentiment was echoed by Senator Marco Rubio, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who said the law would have a terrible impact on Egypts ability to make reforms and would have implications for U.S.-Egypt relations. This law is a direct attack on independent civil society in Egypt, Rubio said in a statement. The UN human rights chief Zeid said on Thursday that the new law makes rights defenders even more vulnerable than before. The crucial function of these NGOs  to hold the state accountable for its human rights obligations  has been severely hampered already through asset freezes, travel bans, smear campaigns and prosecutions. This new law further tightens the noose, he said in a statement. In Egypts response, foreign ministry spokesman Ahmed Abu Zeid said: It is important to be vigilant about the intention of some civil society entities that have gotten used to working outside the law, and that were harmed by the issuing of the new law, to defame the image of civil society in Egypt.  Egypt is one of Washingtons closest allies in the Middle East, receiving $1.3 billion in U.S. military aid annually. U.S. President Donald Trump praised Sisi after a meeting in Saudi Arabia last week, saying the Egyptian leader had done a tremendous job under trying circumstance.

Democrats and Republicans blamed at each other for an impasse that gives Illinois the dubious distinction of being the only state to go nearly two straight fiscal years without a complete budget. A third budget-less year risks potential downgrades of Illinois already low credit ratings. Citing Republican Governor Bruce Rauners unwillingness to meet, House Speaker Michael Madigan, a Chicago Democrat, said budget talks will move to a June overtime session in which a tougher vote of a three-fifths majority will be needed for approval. The governors reckless strategy of holding the budget hostage to create leverage for his corporate agenda that pads the profits of large corporations and insurance companies has for the third year left Illinois without a budget at the end of the May legislative session, Madigan said in a statement.  Rauner returned fire at a state capitol news conference. Today weve seen a complete dereliction of duty by the (Democratic) majority in the General Assembly, once again, a tragic failure to serve the people of Illinois, a tragic failure to pass a balanced budget along with critical structural changes to protect taxpayers and grow more jobs, the governor said.  Democratic Senate President John Cullerton blamed Rauner for blocking a budget by trying to kill a bipartisan spending and reform package in the Senate and later being murky in his preferences for property-tax freeze legislation that he had demanded in exchange for supporting new revenue.  (Rauner) came in the middle of the process, told Republicans to vote no, didnt give support and the same thing happened in the House. The Republicans didnt vote for anything, and as a result, we dont have a budget, Cullerton told reporters. The Senate last week passed a $37.3 billion fiscal 2018 budget plan that includes income tax hikes, a sales tax on services and spending cuts without Republican votes. That budget legislation was not taken up by the House. Illinois, the nations fifth-largest state, has been limping toward the June 30 end of its second-consecutive fiscal year operating under court-ordered spending, stopgap spending, and ongoing appropriations mandated by law.  As a result, the states pile of unpaid bills has topped $14 billion. Rating agencies, which have pushed Illinois down the credit scale six times to a level two steps above junk since  January 2015, have signaled more downgrades are possible.  The states cash crunch has delayed $1.1 billion in payments to public school districts, led to big spending cuts at state universities, and put social services providers on life support. Before adjourning, the House and Senate approved a school-funding overhaul, legislation authorizing the sale of the states main office building in Chicago, and a minimum wage hike. Republicans opposed each measure, and none passed by large enough margins to fend off potential Rauner vetoes. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The new questions, part of an effort to tighten vetting of would-be visitors to the United States, was approved on May 23 by the Office of Management and Budget despite criticism from a range of education officials and academic groups during a public comment period.  Critics argued that the new questions would be overly burdensome, lead to long delays in processing and discourage international students and scientists from coming to the United States. Under the new procedures, consular officials can request all prior passport numbers, five years' worth of social media handles, email addresses and phone numbers and 15 years of biographical information including addresses, employment and travel history. (bit.ly/2qBSrpv) Officials will request the additional information when they determine that such information is required to confirm identity or conduct more rigorous national security vetting, a State Department official said on Wednesday. The State Department said earlier the tighter vetting would apply to visa applicants who have been determined to warrant additional scrutiny in connection with terrorism or other national security-related visa ineligibilities. President Donald Trump has vowed to increase national security and border protections, proposing to give more money to the military and make Mexico pay to build a wall along the southern U.S. border. He has tried to implement a temporary travel ban on people from six Muslim-majority nations that a U.S. appeals court refused to reinstate, calling it discriminatory and setting the stage for a showdown in the Supreme Court. The Office of Management and Budget granted emergency approval for the new questions for six months, rather than the usual three years.  While the new questions are voluntary, the form says failure to provide the information may delay or prevent the processing of an individual visa application. Immigration lawyers and advocates say the request for 15 years of detailed biographical information, as well as the expectation that applicants remember all their social media handles, is likely to catch applicants who make innocent mistakes or do not remember all the information requested.  The new questions grant arbitrary power to consular officials to determine who gets a visa with no effective check on their decisions, said Babak Yousefzadeh, a San Francisco-based attorney and president of the Iranian American Bar Association. The United States has one of the most stringent visa application processes in the world, Yousefzadeh said. The need for tightening the application process further is really unknown and unclear.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who has pledged to shrink U.S. trade deficits, said the transactions would include $3.4 billion in U.S. produced content that would support 23,000 jobs. But the Trump administration still wants more work from Vietnam to bring down a rapidly growing $32 billion trade surplus with the United States, said Murray Hiebert, a Southeast Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. I heard from U.S. officials ahead of the trip that just signing deals with U.S. companies was nice but not enough, Hiebert said. GE said on Wednesday it had signed deals in Vietnam worth about $5.58 billion for power generation, aircraft engines and services, its largest single combined sale with the country in GEs history. GEs agreement with Vietjet Aviation JSC VJC.HM includes 20 jet engines made by CFM International, a joint venture of GE and Safran SA (SAF.PA) of France.

GEs power unit signed a memorandum of understanding to build two 750-megawatt gas fired turbine power plants in conjunction with state energy group PetroVietnam, using the Blue Whale gas field. GE also signed a joint development agreement to erect an 800-megawatt wind power facility. Partners in the agreement are Phu Cuong Group and International Mainstream Renewable Power, GE said.

The U.S. Commerce Department announced 13 new transactions with Vietnam worth $8 billion, including $3 billion worth of U.S.-produced content that would support more than 23,000 American jobs. These include deals for General Electric Co (GE.N) worth $5.58 billion for power generation, aircraft engines and services, its largest-ever combined sale in Vietnam. Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) and its dealer in Vietnam also agreed to provide generator management technology for more than 100 generators in Vietnam, the company said.  They (Vietnam) just made a very large order in the United States - and we appreciate that - for many billions of dollars, which means jobs for the United States and great, great equipment for Vietnam, Trump told reporters at the White House. The Commerce Department estimate of the deals was considerably less than the $15 billion figure given by Phuc during a speech at the Heritage Foundation, adding that most of the total involved the import of U.S. equipment. Communist Vietnam has gone from being a Cold War enemy to an important partner for the United States in the Asia-Pacific, where both countries share concerns about Chinas rising power. Phuc told Trump the relationship had undergone significant upheavals in history but that the two countries were now comprehensive partners. Phucs meeting with Trump makes him the first Southeast Asian leader to visit the White House under the new administration. However, while Hanoi and Washington have stepped up security cooperation in recent years, trade has become a potential irritant, with a deficit widening steadily in Vietnams favor, reaching $32 billion last year, compared with $7 billion a decade earlier. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said it was important to shrink the U.S. trade deficit with Vietnam but noted that the southeast Asian country of 80 million people was the fastest-growing market for U.S. exports, rising 77 percent since 2014 to $4.4 billion. The growth of the middle class and the increasing purchasing power in Vietnam are further incentives to strengthening our long-term trade and investment relationship, Ross said. Trump, who has had strong words for countries with large trade surpluses with the United States, said he would be discussing trade with Phuc, as well as North Korea.  Washington has been seeking support to pressure North Korea to drop its nuclear and missile programs, which have become an increasing threat to the United States. Hanoi has said it shares concerns about North Korea. In his Heritage speech, Phuc welcomed Trumps plans to attend the November APEC summit in Hanoi. He called it a sign of U.S. commitment to the region and an important occasion for the United States to assert its positive role. In a reference to somewhat warmer ties between Washington and Beijing under Trump, who has been courting Chinas support on North Korea, Phuc said Vietnam welcomed good relations between the two powers, but hoped these would serve the interest of other nations in the region too. He urged Washington and Beijing to act with full transparency and in a responsible manner so as not to impact negatively the region and relations among other nations. Vietnams government said on its website Trump and Phuc had agreed to promote defense ties and discussed the possibility of U.S. vessels, including aircraft carriers, visiting Vietnamese ports. It said they had expressed concern about the South China Sea, where Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei are involved in maritime disputes with China, which claims nearly all the strategic waterway. Taiwan also stakes a claim. They emphasized that parties must not take actions accelerating tension such as the militarization of disputed structures, it said, an apparent reference to Chinas construction work. Murray Hiebert, a Southeast Asia expert at Washingtons  Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that while the Trump administration welcomed new business deals with Vietnam, its view was they were nice, but not enough. They want Vietnam to bring some ideas about how to tackle the surplus on an ongoing basis, he said.   On Tuesday, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer expressed concern about the rapid growth of the deficit with Vietnam. He said it was a new challenge for the two countries and he was looking to Phuc to help address it. The deficit is Washingtons sixth largest and reflects growing imports of Vietnamese semiconductors and other electronics products in addition to more traditional sectors such as footwear, apparel and furniture. On Tuesday Vietnams trade minister, Tran Tuan Anh, presented Lighthizer with suggestions to address some U.S. concerns, such as advertising on U.S. social media, electronic payment services and imports of information security and farm products, Vietnams trade ministry said. Vietnam was disappointed when Trump ditched the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact, of which Hanoi was expected to be one of the main beneficiaries, and focused U.S. trade policy on reducing deficits.

(bit.ly/1LPKWx8) Conway is permitted to participate in communications and meetings involving former clients which are political, advocacy, trade or non-profit organizations, while Priebus, a former Republican National Committee chairman, is allowed to have communications and meetings with the RNC, the document says. Shortly after taking office in January, Trump signed an executive order barring lobbyists who joined the administration from working on issues related to their prior work. But the administration has the power to grant waivers to particular hires, exempting them from that restriction. Also on the list is Michael Catanzaro, a special assistant to the president and a former oil and gas lobbyist, who is cleared to weigh in on energy policy. Daniel Epstein, associate counsel to the president, may provide legal advice to the White House Office or any agency of the executive branch and to take positions adverse to Cause of Action Institute. Shahira Knight, a special assistant to the president who formerly worked for Fidelity, a financial services company,  may participate in broad policy matters and particular matters of general applicability relating to tax, retirement and financial services issues. Andrew Olmem, a special assistant to Trump who worked as an attorney to the Senate Banking Committee during the financial crisis, is cleared to join meetings with former clients involving Puerto Ricos fiscal issues, along with a wide range of activities involving financial regulation.

Mulvaney said in the letter that the administration was not seeking to impede efforts by OGE to obtain that information, despite earlier protests from Walter Shaub, the agencys director. Shaub, an appointee under President Barack Obama in the final year of a five-year term, had requested in April copies of waivers the Trump administration granted to former lobbyists now appointed to positions in the government. Those requests were sent to agencies across the administration, seeking waivers that would allow former lobbyists to work on issues they had been involved with as paid advocates.  But OMB requested a stay of that request, prompting a fierce response from Shaub. He called the request highly unusual and said his agency has the authority to take corrective action proceedings against agencies that refuse its requests. In his Friday response, Mulvaney said the requested stay was not an attempt to stifle OGE efforts but rather to provide more time to ensure sufficient consideration was given to legal questions. OMB has never sought to impede OGE, he wrote. Mulvaney closed the letter by saying the OMB did not grant any lobbyist waivers itself. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The network announced the termination after earlier criticizing the photos as disgusting and offensive. Griffin posted a videotaped apology on Tuesday night amid a public outcry from Republicans and Democrats alike over the images, including condemnation from Trump. Kathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself, Trump wrote.     My children, especially my 11-year-old son, Barron, are having a hard time with this. Sick! The U.S. Secret Service, responsible for presidential security, has opened an inquiry into the posting of Griffin posing with the severed-head replica, a spokesman in Los Angeles said when asked whether the agency was looking into the incident as a potential threat on the presidents life. Were aware of it and were investigating it, the spokesman, George Fernandez, told Reuters. He declined to elaborate. Griffin, 56, a two-time Emmy-winning performer known for her deliberately provocative brand of humor, has appeared since 2007 as co-host of CNNs New Years Eve broadcast from Times Square in New York with anchor Anderson Cooper.  CNN did not make clear whether it was cutting its New Years Eve deal with Griffin for just the upcoming 2017 broadcast or for good. The furor also cost Griffin a show at the Route 66 Casino Hotel outside Albuquerque, New Mexico. Management of the Laguna Pueblo tribe-operated establishment decided to cancel a one-night appearance by Griffin scheduled for July 22, a spokesman said. Griffin apologized profusely in a video message posted to her official Twitter account late on Tuesday, saying that as a comic she routinely seeks to cross the line but realized in this case, I went too far. The image is too disturbing. I understand how it offends people. It wasnt funny. I get it, she said, adding that she was seeking to have the images taken down from social media. I beg for your forgiveness, she concluded. I made a mistake and I was wrong. Celebrity news website TMZ published a behind-the-scenes video on Tuesday of Griffin posing with the model head for a photo shoot. She was seen reviewing the images with photographer Tyler Shields and jokingly saying, We have to move to Mexico today because were going to go to prison, federal prison. TMZ posted an image from the shoot on Twitter. This is vile and wrong, Chelsea Clinton, daughter of  former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, wrote on Twitter. It is never funny to joke about killing a president. Trumps oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., called on sponsors of Griffin to condemn the comedian. At his daily briefing with reporters in Washington, presidential spokesman Sean Spicer declined to answer directly when asked whether it was appropriate for Trump to have hosted a White House visit by rocker Ted Nugent last month despite violent remarks the musician made in 2012 about then-President Barack Obama. Secret Service agents met with Nugent after the performer told a National Rifle Association convention in St. Louis that he would be dead or in jail if Obama were re-elected. He also declared, We need to ride into that battlefield and chop their heads off in November. The Secret Service later said the matter had been resolved with no further action. To be honest with you, Id have to look back and see what those statements were and what the reaction was at the time, Spicer said when pressed for a comment on Wednesday. Griffins firing by CNN drew widely divergent reactions, with one Twitter follower, Anand Elgie, calling her termination over reaction, adding: she had a bad moment of judgment...

Committee aides complained that the chairman, Representative Devin Nunes, who publicly recused himself from leading the Russia probe in April following a secret visit he paid to White House officials, failed to consult Democrats on the subpoenas. The subpoenas asked the agencies to provide details of any requests made by two top Obama administration aides and the former CIA director to unmask names of Trump campaign advisers inadvertently picked up in top-secret foreign communications intercepts, congressional sources said. The former officials named in the subpoenas were Obama national security adviser Susan Rice, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power and former CIA Director John Brennan. Subpoenas related to the unmasking issue would have been sent by Chairman Nunes acting separately from the committees Russia investigation. This action would have been taken without the minoritys (Democrats) agreement, said a senior committee aide, speaking on condition of anonymity. Another congressional source, who also requested anonymity, said Democrats were informed and consulted before the subpoenas were issued. The CIA declined to comment on the subpoenas and the Federal Bureau of Investigation and NSA did not immediate respond to requests for comment. U.S. privacy laws and intelligence regulations require that Americans names picked up in foreign communications intercepts be concealed unless senior officials request them to be disclosed for intelligence or law enforcement purposes. Any such requests undergo rigorous legal reviews. Several U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters that all such requests by Obama administration officials were properly scrutinized and appropriate. SUBPOENAS FOR TRUMP LAWYER, EX-AIDE The spy agency subpoenas were not mentioned in a bipartisan announcement on Wednesday that the panel approved subpoenas for President Donald Trumps former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and Trumps personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, in connection with the Russia probe. The committee also approved subpoenas to the two mens firms, Flynn Intel Llc, and Michael D. Cohen and Associates PC, the committee statement said. As part of our ongoing investigation into Russian active measures during the 2016 campaign, today we approved subpoenas for several individuals for testimony, personal documents and business records, Republican Representative Mike Conaway and Democratic Representative Adam Schiff, who are leading the committee probe, said in a joint statement. Conaway assumed Republican leadership of the probe after Nunes recused himself. Nunes retained his power to issue subpoenas. U.S. intelligence agencies reported in January that Russian President Vladimir Putin oversaw a campaign of computer hacking, fake news and propaganda intended to swing the election to Republican Trump over his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. Putin has denied conducting such a campaign. Trump denies any collusion between Russia and his campaign and has questioned the veracity of the U.S. intelligence finding. Trump fired Flynn in February for failing to disclose the content of his talks with Sergei Kislyak, Russias ambassador to the United States, and misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations. The retired Army general is the subject of congressional, Justice Department and Defense Department investigations into his apparent failure to disclose payments he received from Russian and Turkish entities. Cohen is one of several Trump associates under scrutiny in an FBI examination of possible contacts between Trumps campaign and Russia, according to the New York Times. It reported that Cohen was involved in a back-channel plan, which never came to fruition, that would have involved a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine, and the lifting of U.S. sanctions against Moscow. CNN reported on Wednesday night that congressional investigators were looking into whether Attorney General Jeff Sessions had an undisclosed private meeting with Kislyak during the campaign, citing Republican and Democratic sources in Congress and intelligence officials briefed on the probe. The focus of the probe is on whether such a meeting took place on April 27, 2016, at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington,  where Trump delivered his first major foreign policy address, CNN reported.  During his confirmation hearing in January, Sessions testified that he did not have any communications with the Russians during the campaign and said in a written statement given to the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was not in contact with anyone linked to the Russian government during the campaign. It was reported in March that he met with Kislyak twice during the campaign, once at the Republican National Convention in July and once in his Senate office in September. Sessions later admitted having the meetings but said they were part of his Senate duties and were unrelated to the campaign. He later recused himself from the Russia probe.

The former Democratic presidential candidate, appearing at a tech conference near Los Angeles, said propaganda spread on sites such as Facebook helped cost her the election, and she urged Silicon Valley firms to move faster to stop false stories. Trump has said there was no collusion between his campaign and Russia. Echoing assessments of U.S. intelligence agencies, Clinton said the Russian government wanted to spread disinformation about her. But she added they could not have known how best to weaponize that information unless they had been guided. Guided by Americans? asked Walt Mossberg, a technology journalist interviewing Clinton on stage. Guided by Americans and guided by people who have polling and data, she responded.  Clinton was pressed by another journalist on stage, Kara Swisher, who asked: But youre leaning Trump? Yes, I think its pretty hard not to, Clinton said. She said there had been a marriage of people who spread false stories with Republicans who had detailed voter data.  It appeared to be the first time Clinton had accused Trump of collusion with Russians. Earlier this month, she blamed Russian hackers and then-FBI Director James Comey for costing her the election.  In a Twitter post on Wednesday night, Trump responded: Crooked Hillary Clinton now blames everybody but herself, refuses to say she was a terrible candidate. Hits Facebook & even Dems & DNC. In her appearance on Wednesday, Clinton slammed Trumps ability to create distractions using Twitter. Its the circus, right? Its what a classic authoritarian does, she said. Trumps administration has been dogged in its first months by allegations his associates had inappropriate contacts with Russian government officials. A special counsel, former FBI Director Robert Mueller, was appointed to lead an investigation after Trump fired Comey. Moscow has denied meddling in the U.S. election. Clinton mentioned Facebook by name, saying the social media network was flooded with false information about her and that people were understandably misled. She said she would like to see Facebook curate its network more aggressively.  I have a lot of sympathy at this point ... for people trying to make these decisions. I would just urge them to hurry up, she said.  Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said in November it was crazy to think that fake news on the site had influenced the election. Beginning in December, Facebook began introducing tools to try to prevent fake news stories from spreading. Clinton said that in targeting voters online, she was at a disadvantage because the Republican Party provided Trump with an extensive database, through an organization called the Data Trust, that Democrats did not have. I inherited nothing from the Democratic Party, she said. I mean, it was bankrupt. It was on the verge of insolvency. Its data was mediocre to poor, nonexistent, wrong.

Trump has been dismissive of probes by the FBI and several congressional panels into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and potential collusion with his  campaign. In a series of early morning tweets, the president quoted a letter from Page, in which he asked to address the House Intelligence Committee promptly and referred to what he characterized as faulty testimony from U.S. intelligence officials. Trump accused Democrats of blocking Pages testimony, without citing evidence but referring to an unidentified report.  So now it is reported that the Democrats, who have excoriated Carter Page about Russia, dont want him to testify. He blows away their case against him & now wants to clear his name by showing the false or misleading testimony by James Comey, John Brennan... Witch Hunt! Trump wrote on Twitter, referring to the former directors of the FBI and CIA.         Trumps tweets came as his advisers are planning to establish a war room to combat mounting questions about communication between Russia and his campaign. The White House said on Wednesday it would not answer any more questions about the investigations, referring reporters instead to Trumps outside attorney, Marc Kasowitz. The presidents penchant for tweeting could complicate White House efforts to tamp down the scandal if the messages appear to address the investigations. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House committee, swatted back at Trump on Twitter with a reference to the presidents acknowledgment to NBC that he was thinking of this Russia thing when he fired Comey on May 9.  @POTUS, appreciate suggestion on witnesses but feel you may not have probes interests at heart. Ex: Firing FBI Dir because of Russia probe, Schiff wrote. Democrats say Comeys dismissal was aimed at hindering the Federal Bureau of Investigations Russia investigation. CNN reported on Wednesday that Comey would confirm reports that Trump had asked him to let up in an investigation of former White House national security adviser Michael Flynns contacts with Russia in upcoming public testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee.  Trumps fellow Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have urged him to tweet less and more wisely. U.S. Representative Sean Duffy said on Wednesday the Russia investigations were becoming too much of a distraction in Trumps 4-month-old presidency. I think the president should step aside from any comments, any tweets on the investigation and focus on the agenda that he ran on, Duffy said on CNN. Stop tweeting about it, stop talking about it and get about the business of your agenda. Page, who provided a copy of his letter to Reuters, said the House committee postponed an appearance scheduled for next week without giving a specific reason. Schiff said in a statement that he and the Republican overseeing the panels probe, Representative Mike Conaway, want to review documents before interviewing witnesses.  Russia has denied U.S. intelligence agencies conclusion that Moscow interfered in the election campaign to try to tilt the vote in Trumps favor, and the president has denied any collusion. Congressional committees have contacted a parade of Trump associates and advisers to request information in their probes. In addition to Page, they include Flynn, former campaign manager Paul Manafort, former White House press officer Boris Epshteyn, personal lawyer Michael Cohen and informal adviser Roger Stone. On Wednesday, the House committee approved subpoenas for Flynn and Cohen. It also approved subpoenas to intelligence agencies seeking records showing which former Obama administration officials requested the unmasking of the names of Trump associates who were inadvertently picked up in top-secret communications intercepts. Flynn has also been subpoenaed by the Senate Intelligence Committee. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"
"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is expected this week to delay relocating the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, U.S. officials and a diplomatic source said on Wednesday, despite his campaign pledge to go ahead with the controversial move. With a deadline for a decision looming, Trump is likely to  continue his predecessors policy of signing a six-month waiver overriding a 1995 law requiring that the embassy be transferred to Jerusalem, an action that would have complicated his efforts to restart Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, the sources said. Trump has yet to make his decision official but is required by law to act by Friday, according to one U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity.  Barring a last-minute surprise, Trump is expected to renew the waiver. His administration intends to make clear, however, that Trump remains committed to the promise he made during the 2016 presidential campaign, though it will not set a specific timetable for doing so, officials said. Asked whether Trump would sign the waiver, White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters on Wednesday: Once we have a decision, well put it out, adding there would be something very soon on that. While there have been divisions among Trumps aides on the issue, the view that appears to have prevailed is that the United States should keep the embassy in Tel Aviv for now to avoid angering the Palestinians, Arab governments and Western allies while the president seeks to nurture peace efforts. Trump avoided any public mention of a potential embassy move during his visit to Israel and the West Bank in May. Despite that, most experts are skeptical of Trumps chances for achieving a peace deal that eluded other U.S. presidents. The status of Jerusalem is one of the major stumbling blocks. Israel captured Arab East Jerusalem during the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed it, a move not recognized internationally. Israel considers all of the city its indivisible capital. PRO-ISRAEL RHETORIC The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state. Jerusalem is home to holy sites of the Jewish, Muslim and Christian religions. Shifting the U.S. Embassy would be widely seen as Washingtons recognition of the Israeli position on Jerusalems status, which successive U.S. administrations have said must be decided in negotiations between the two sides. Former President Barack Obama renewed the waiver in December, setting off a six-month clock for Trump. CNN was first to report that Trump was expected to sign the waiver. On the campaign trail, Trumps pro-Israel rhetoric raised expectations that he would act quickly to move the embassy. But after he took office in January, the issue lost momentum as he met Arab leaders who warned it would be hard to rejuvenate long-stalled peace efforts unless he acted as a fair mediator. Some of Trumps top aides have pushed for him to keep his campaign promise, not only because it would be welcomed by most Israelis but to satisfy the pro-Israel, right-wing base that helped him win the presidency. The State Department, however recommended against an embassy move, one U.S. official said. The president is still committed to moving the embassy, one U.S. official said. Its not a question of whether but when it will be done. The Jerusalem Embassy Act passed by Congress in 1995 mandating relocation of embassy to Jerusalem allows the president to waive the requirement in accordance with U.S. national security interests.

The new law will increase retirement ages, hike worker and city contributions, limit cost-of-living (COLA) increases for retirees, and restructure governance.  In a tweet on Wednesday, Abbott wrote that he was proud of the Texas legislature leading on pension reform that ensures fiscal soundness. The Dallas police and fire pension system was projected to become insolvent within 10 years if the city or the state did not act.  The new law cuts the Dallas systems nearly $3.7 billion unfunded liability to $2.18 billion and boosts the funded ratio to nearly 50 percent from the current 36.8 percent, according to a bill analysis.  The Houston bill would help reduce the $8.1 billion unfunded liability in the citys municipal, police, and firefighter funds by reducing benefits. The law also lowers the funds assumed rate of investment return from as high as 8.5 percent, one of the most ambitious rates in the country, to 7.25 percent, closer to nations average.  The city of Houston estimated that without any type of reform, the city would contribute $3.7 billion to the pension systems over five years. With reforms, the city will contribute $2.0 billion. The city estimates a savings of $1.4 billion, and an estimated debt service cost of $0.2 billion.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""OSLO (Reuters) - The United States could influence or even disrupt work by other nations to combat climate change until late 2020 even if President Donald Trump quits a global agreement, legal scholars said on Wednesday. Trump will honor a campaign pledge to pull out of the 195-nation Paris Agreement, a source briefed on the decision told Reuters on Tuesday. Trump tweeted he would announce his formal decision over the next few days. U.N. rules for the 2015 pact, which seeks to shift the world economy from fossil fuels this century, say Washington would formally have to wait until November 2020 to withdraw. Trump could shorten the formalities to just one year by exiting Paris 1992 parent treaty. Quitting the Paris Agreement would leave Trump in a legal grey zone until the next U.S. presidential election in 2020, retaining a vote as other nations work on detailed rules on issues such as how to monitor greenhouse gas emissions. In the worst case the U.S. could make it more difficult to adopt the Paris rules, said Daniel Bodansky, a law professor at Arizona State University. To the extent that (withdrawal from Paris) is already going to harm relations with our allies, staying in and being obstructionist would be even more harmful, he said. Trump has promised to promote the coal industry over renewables. Bodansky noted, however, that Washington did not try to obstruct other nations work on the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which obliged rich nations to cut emissions, after President George W. Bush angered U.S. allies by deciding in 2001 not to take part. Megan Bowman, a law lecturer at Kings College, London, said the four-year waiting period was partly intended to insulate the agreement from a shift to a Republican presidency after Democratic President Barack Obama. The downside ... is that if they (the United States) are recalcitrant they are sitting at the table, able to obstruct or stall the process, she said. Paris imposes few legal obligations before 2020 and has no sanctions for non-compliance. The Paris Agreements Article 28 says any nation wanting to pull out has to wait three years from the date the agreement gained legal force, which was Nov. 4, 2016, before seeking to leave. It then has to wait another year. In Berlin, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker stressed that withdrawal would take years. The Americans cant just leave the climate protection agreement. Mr. Trump believes that because he doesnt know the details. Trump would be taking a riskier step by withdrawing from Paris parent treaty, the 1992 Climate Convention, even though it would require only a years notice and void U.S. commitments under Paris. That Convention, seeking voluntary actions to rein in greenhouse gas emissions and a landmark in cooperation between rich and poor nations, has had bipartisan U.S. support. It was signed by Republican President George Bush. Paris goes one step further by obliging all nations to set domestic targets to curb emissions to limit a creeping rise in temperatures blamed for more heat waves, downpours and rising sea levels. Leaving the Convention would make the United States an international pariah on global climate change, said Robert Stavins, director of Harvard Universitys environmental economics program. Johan Rockstrom, director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre, said a U.S. presence in the Paris negotiations until 2020 would be the most negative thing ... they would still be allowed to vote in the room. But he said a quick, clean break by the United States from the 1992 Convention might be best for other nations which could then work without risks of obstruction.

Jealous, an ally of U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders during his 2016 bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, said incumbent Larry Hogan had failed to oppose Trump policies that would weaken healthcare and education as well as environmental protection of the Chesapeake Bay. Jealous, making his first bid for elected office, is the latest Democrat to try to link an opponent to the Republican president. Approval ratings have sagged for Trump, who has been embroiled in controversy since his May 9 firing of FBI Director James Comey who was overseeing an investigation into possible collusion between Trumps presidential campaign and Russia. It seems like every week our governor becomes a little more like the lion in The Wizard of Oz, all strength and no political courage, Jealous, 44, said as he declared his candidacy outside a cousins flower shop in Baltimore. Hogan, who did not endorse Trump in the 2016 election, has not said if he will seek re-election. A spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton won Maryland by 26 percentage points in last Novembers election. Jealous led the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the biggest U.S. civil rights group, from 2008 to 2013. He is the second Democrat to announce his candidacy ahead of Marylands June 2018 primary, joining entrepreneur and author Alec Ross. Jealous, if elected, would be Marylands first black governor. Jealous, who spearheaded the NAACPs successful campaign to overturn Marylands death penalty in 2012, said he backed raising the minimum wage to $15 a hour from the current $8.75, improving teacher quality, expanding mass transit and improving training for police officers. Hogan has followed a moderate agenda focused on economic growth and cutting regulations and fees. He also has banned fracking, which involves injecting water, sand and chemicals into shale to release natural gas and oil, thus aligning himself with Marylands heavily Democratic voter base. He held a 65 percent approval rating among registered voters in a Washington Post-University of Maryland poll in March, but only 41 percent backed him for a second term.

Shulkin, in a briefing on the state of the department, said that veterans access to medical care had improved significantly since a scandal over wait times three years ago prompted the resignation of a VA secretary and forced major reforms.   But Shulkin, who served as undersecretary of Veterans Affairs for Health in the Obama administration, said a review of 137 studies and assessments identified 13 areas of significant risk, including rules that keep the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs from moving quickly to fire employees for misconduct. We currently have 1,500 disciplinary actions that are pending, meaning people that either need to be fired, demoted (or) suspended without pay for violating our core values, Shulkin told reporters. Our accountability processes are clearly broken. We have to wait more than a month to fire a psychiatrist who was caught on camera watching pornography using his iPad while seeing a veteran, Shulkin said. A VA news release on March 31 said an internal review recommended that the person be dismissed, but the law requires a  30-day waiting period before a final decision can be carried out. It said the psychiatrist was removed from patient care and placed on administrative duties. We need new accountability legislation, and we need that now, Shulkin said. In a case in Puerto Rico, he said, the department was forced to take back an employee who had been convicted of driving under the influence several times and had served a 60-day jail term. Shulkin also warned that Veterans Affairs buildings were falling into disrepair and needed more than $18 billion worth of repairs. VA buildings on average are 60 years old and include 449 from the Revolutionary War and the Civil War. He said 591 others are from the First World War era. The VA spends $25 million a year maintaining 400 vacant buildings and 735 underutilized facilities, Shulkin said. Shulkin said the departments computer systems also needed modernization.

Trump will follow through on his campaign pledge to pull the United States out of the global agreement, a source briefed on the decision told Reuters. On Twitter the president said: I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. The accord, agreed on by nearly 200 countries in 2015, aims to cut emissions blamed for global warming. The United States committed to reducing its own by 26 to 28 percent, compared with 2005 levels, by 2025. The agreement has been criticized as far too cautious to hold back the rise in temperatures by more than a fraction of what is needed - but its defenders say its enrolment of almost all the worlds governments makes it crucial. Steffen Kallbekken, Research Director at the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research in Oslo, called Trumps move monumentally irresponsible. It is difficult to imagine a decision that would be a more devastating blow to the positive momentum behind the Paris Agreement, and to the prospects of raising climate ambition over time, he said. Niklas Hoehne of Germanys New Climate Institute said a U.S. pullout could corrode the resolve of other nations, perhaps including hydrocarbon powers Saudi Arabia and Russia. The big achievement of the Paris Agreement is that it was supported by all countries, he said. If the U.S. is out that doesnt work any more. Former President Barack Obama helped broker the Paris accord and praised it during a trip to Europe this month. Trump has called the idea of global warming a hoax.     Canada, the European Union and China have said they will honor their commitments to the pact if the United States withdraws.  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Spains Mariano Rajoy in Madrid on Wednesday, and both countries reaffirmed their Paris commitments, without mentioning the United States. French President Emmanuel Macron said at a weekend summit in Italy he was sure Trump would back the deal after listening to his G7 counterparts. That hope appears to have been quickly dashed. At a Wednesday news conference, a government spokesman said Macron had told a cabinet meeting France would be very pro-active in working to ensure the Paris accord was implemented.  Depending on the stance some people or others are taking, well have to be very pro-active for France to be the homeland of the (fight against) climate change, the spokesman said. Macron had asked his ministers to take a number of initiatives, with our European partners or directly in France.  European Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic said of a U.S. pullout: It would be disappointing but I really do not think this would change the course of mankind.  There is a much stronger expectation from our partners across the world from Africa, Asia and China that Europe should assume leadership in this effort and we are ready to do that, Sefcovic said.  Guy Verhofstadt, leader of the liberal group in the European Parliament, sent a tweet in the literary style of the U.S. president: Trump puts his ego ahead of the future of our planet - sad! Lets double down on our efforts to make the #ParisAgreement a success. Johan Rockstrom, director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre, called Trumps decision irresponsible and egoistic. Its now up to the European Union, India and China to take the lead on climate change, he said.  The U.S. is going from being a global leader to putting itself in a very destructive minority position. But he predicted the deal would survive without Washington. Denmarks energy and climate minister Lars Christian Lilleholt told Reuters: It will be necessary for the EU to show leadership if the U.S. should pull out of the deal.  Judy Wakhungu, Kenyas cabinet secretary for environment and natural resources, said her government would be very disappointed by a U.S. withdrawal and hoped it could be reversed. We all live on the same Earth and face the same challenges, she added.     Friends of the Earths U.S. president Erich Pica said: By pulling out of the Paris Agreement, Trump will make the United States the worlds foremost climate villain. Some observers saw chances that Washington would not, in the end, pull out.  I hope that the president will be swayed instead by the rather sensible advice he is receiving from his Secretary of State, his Secretary of Defense and his Chief Economic Adviser, who have all recommended against withdrawal, said Bob Ward of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services declined to comment and spokeswoman Alleigh Marre said it does not comment on alleged drafts of documents. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare, employers are required to provide health insurance that covers birth control, except for religious houses of worship, which are exempt. Some owners of private businesses also obtained exemptions after the Supreme Court ruled in 2014 that they could object to the rule on religious grounds. Republicans do not have enough seats in the U.S. Senate to fully repeal Obamacare and as a result, the Republican strategy for rolling back the law includes stopping implementation of new health regulations and creating new administrative rules that undermine parts of the existing law. Planned Parenthood, the American Civil Liberties Union and other healthcare groups criticized the proposed rule and said it would make it harder for millions of Americans to access the healthcare they need. The ACLU threatened to challenge the administration in court if the rule becomes finalized.

Trump plans to bring in new aides to the White House, adding experienced political professionals including a former campaign manager, according to administration officials and people close to the president. Dubke, who was joined the White House in March to head the office that runs press and other public relations issues, oversees the White Houses message strategy while spokesman Sean Spicer, a more high-profile figure, handles daily media briefings.  The Republican president came home to face more questions on Russia after media reports about communications during and after the campaign between his son-in-law and close adviser, Jared Kushner, and Russias ambassador to Washington. Spicer was asked on Tuesday whether Trump knew about reported efforts by Kushner in December to set up a back channel for communications with Russia. What your question assumes is a lot of facts that are not substantiated by anything but anonymous sources that are so far being leaked out, he told a news briefing. Asked about a possible staff shake-up, Spicer said: I think the president is very pleased with his team and he has a robust agenda.  Dubke resigned just before Trump left on his foreign trip but will stay on until a transition is concluded, Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, said.        Other potential staff changes could be in the works, according to Axios News, which first reported Dubkes departure, including fewer on-camera news briefings by Spicer, the White House press secretary.  Trump also will take more questions directly from the media, Axios reported.  Ultimately the best messenger is the president himself, Spicer said on Tuesday. Senior adviser Kellyanne Conway told Fox News the White House will continue to bring in Cabinet secretaries and other top officials to handle news briefings on topics in their patch. Conway also dismissed persistent speculation that Spicer, who has been pilloried on TV comedy shows since Trump took office on Jan. 20, was on his way out.  Controversy over the Russia issue deepened after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey earlier this month, leading to allegations by critics that the president sought to hamper the agencys investigation of the matter. Moscow has denied U.S. intelligence agencies conclusion that it meddled in the campaign to try to tilt the election in Trumps favor. The president has denied any collusion, repeatedly denouncing the probes by a special counsel at the Justice Department, the FBI and several congressional panels as a Democrat-backed effort to explain Hillary Clintons upset defeat in the White House race. Congressional investigations into the Russia issue have expanded to include Trumps personal attorney, Michael Cohen, ABC News reported on Tuesday. Cohen confirmed he had been asked to provide information and testimony to investigators in the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate but said he declined because the request was poorly phrased, overly broad and not capable of being answered, ABC reported.  Cohen did not respond to Reuters request to comment. The White House declined to comment, saying Cohen is not an employee of the administration. However, former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn, who resigned after failing to properly disclose his own contacts with Russian officials, told the Senate Intelligence Committee he will begin turning over some documents subpoenaed by the panel, a government source familiar with the matter told Reuters.

As the war of words threatened to spin out of control, Merkel and other senior German politicians stressed the importance of Germanys Atlantic ties, with Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel suggesting the spat was just a rough patch. Trump took to Twitter early in the day in the United States to attack Germany, a day after Chancellor Angela Merkel ramped up her doubts about the reliability of Washington as an ally. We have a MASSIVE trade deficit with Germany, plus they pay FAR LESS than they should on NATO & military. Very bad for U.S. This will change, Trump tweeted. The tit-for-tat dispute escalated rapidly after Trump, at back-to-back summits last week, criticized major NATO allies over their military spending and refused to endorse a global climate change accord. On Sunday, Merkel showed the gravity of her concern about Washingtons dependability under Trump when she warned, at an election campaign event in a packed Bavarian beer tent - that the times when Europe could fully rely on others were over to a certain extent. Those comments, which caused shock in Washington, vented Europes frustration with Trump on climate policy in particular. And while German politicians sided with Merkel, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel signaled that it was time for cooler heads to prevail. TIT-FOR-TAT, FROM TENT TO TWITTER The United States are older and bigger than the current conflict, he said, adding that relations would improve. It is inappropriate that we are now communicating with each other between a beer tent and Twitter, he said in Berlin. Merkel had already begun finessing her message on Monday, stressing that she was a convinced trans-Atlanticist, a message she repeated after a meeting with visiting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Berlin. But Martin Schulz, leader of Gabriels center-left Social Democrats, was less emollient earlier in the day when he told reporters Trump was the destroyer of all Western values. He added that the U.S. president was undermining the peaceful cooperation of nations based on mutual respect and tolerance. In Rome, Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni said he agreed with Merkel that Europe needed to forge its own path. This takes nothing away from the importance of our trans-Atlantic ties and our alliance with the United States.

The notification is one of the last steps in the arms sale process and triggers a formal 30-day review to allow members of Congress to attempt to pass legislation to stop any sale. U.S. lawmakers introduced legislation last week seeking to block about $500 million of a $110 billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia, including the portion on precision-guided missiles and other offensive weapons. An announcement of the sale had been expected in March but objections from mostly Democratic lawmakers and human rights groups led to Washington to ask Riyadh for commitments to improve targeting procedures that would minimize civilian casualties. Asked on Tuesday whether the Saudis had taken specific measures to improve targeting capabilities, the senior U.S. diplomat, acting Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Stuart Jones, did not answer directly. Thats a continuing source of conversation between us, Jones told reporters. Were constantly trying to improve that process. The Yemen civil war pits Iran-allied Houthi rebels against the government backed by a Saudi-led Arab coalition. Nearly 4,800 civilians have been killed since March 2015, the United Nations said in March. Jones said Tillersons authorization, which was expected, occurred just before President Donald Trumps May 20-21 visit to Saudi Arabia. Trumps predecessor, Barack Obama, in December limited military support to Saudi Arabias campaign in Yemen because of concerns over civilian casualties, and halted the sale of the precision-guided munitions. On his trip to Saudi Arabia, Trump received a warm welcome from Gulf Arab leaders, who want to crack down on Irans influence in the region, a commitment they found lacking in Obama. Trump also did not make overt mentions of human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia in his speech there, a move criticized by Democrats and Republicans in Congress. The fact that it wasnt featured in the speech doesnt mean that its not part of the bilateral dialogue, Jones said. By taking it out of the public debate and having those conversations directly and quietly, well be more effective.

The request marks the first significant public effort by Silicon Valley to wade into what is expected to be a contentious debate later the year over the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, parts of which will expire on Dec. 31 unless Congress reauthorizes them.  Of particular concern to the technology industry and privacy advocates is Section 702, which allows U.S. intelligence agencies to vacuum up vast amounts of communications from foreigners but also incidentally collects some data belonging to Americans that can be searched by analysts without a warrant.  We are writing to express our support for reforms to Section 702 that would maintain its utility to the U.S. intelligence community while increasing the programs privacy protections and transparency, the companies wrote in a letter to Representative Bob Goodlatte, the Republican chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee. Section 702 is considered a vital tool by U.S. intelligence officials, estimated to be responsible for as much as a quarter of surveillance conducted by the U.S. National Security Agency.  But it has long been targeted by civil liberties advocates as too expansive and lacking in sufficient safeguards.  Disclosures by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden in 2013 revealed the sweeping nature of 702 surveillance, causing embarrassment for some U.S. technology firms. In their letter, the companies asked lawmakers to codify the recent termination of a type of NSA surveillance that collected American communications sent to or received from someone living overseas that mentioned a foreign intelligence target. Lawmakers should also require judicial oversight of government queries of data collected under Section 702 that involved American communications and narrow the definition of foreign intelligence information to reduce the collection of data that belongs to foreigners not suspected of wrongdoing, the companies said. The letter asks for more leeway in how companies are allowed to disclose the number of surveillance requests and more declassification of orders approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. Legislation currently being drafted by a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the House Judiciary Committee is expected to address all of the concerns raised in the technology companies letter.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to hear Ohios appeal of a lower court ruling that blocked the Republican-led states policy of purging people from voter-registration lists if they do not regularly cast ballots because it violated federal law. Civil liberties advocates who challenged Ohios policy said it illegally erased voters from registration rolls and unlawfully disenfranchised minorities and poor people who tend to back Democratic candidates. The justices will review a U.S. appeals court ruling that Ohios policy ran afoul of a 1993 law called the National Voter Registration Act, which Congress passed to make it easier for Americans to register to vote. A Reuters analysis last year found that in Ohios three largest counties, which include Cleveland, Cincinnati and Columbus, voters were struck from the rolls in Democratic-leaning neighborhoods at roughly twice the rate as in Republican neighborhoods under the policy. Ohio officials argued that canceling registrations for voters deemed inactive for six years helped keep voting rolls current and accurate, clearing out those who have moved away or died. In September 2016, ahead of the U.S. presidential election, the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati ruled that the policy was unlawful. Democrats have accused Republicans of taking steps at the state level, including laws imposing new requirements on voters such as presenting certain types of government-issued identification, intended to suppress the vote of minorities, the poor and others who generally favor Democratic candidates. The American Civil Liberties Union last year sued Ohio Republican Secretary of State Jon Husted, arguing that the state was violating the National Voter Registration Act, which prohibits states from striking registered voters by reason of the persons failure to vote. The 6th Circuit agreed. Under Ohios policy, if registered voters miss voting for two years, they are sent registration confirmation notices. If they do not respond and do not vote over the following four years, they are removed from the rolls. Husted has said Ohios policy has been in place since the 1990s under both Republican and Democratic secretaries of state. The suit said the policy led to the removal of tens of thousands of people from the voter rolls in 2015, including one of the lead plaintiffs, Larry Harmon, a software engineer and U.S. Navy veteran who was blocked from voting in a state marijuana initiative in 2015.  Republican Donald Trump won Ohio in last Novembers presidential election. The National Voter Registration Act, dubbed the Motor-Voter law when it was enacted, required states to permit registration by mail or when eligible people apply for or renew a drivers license, or visiting certain government agencies or military recruiting offices.

Citing a May 12 report by Reuters, Chuck Grassley, a Republican senator from Iowa, requested a review of claims made by Chinese migration agency Qiaowai and the U.S. Immigration Fund (USIF) in the marketing of the One Journal Square project in Jersey City, New Jersey to potential investors in China.  Grassley flagged his concerns to the Department of Homeland Security and the Securities and Exchange Commission in a May 24 letter that was later posted on his website.  Jupiter, Florida-based USIF contracted with Beijing-based Qiaowai to market projects including One Journal Square to potential investors through the controversial EB-5 scheme. The program offers qualified foreign investors the chance at a green card in exchange for a $500,000 investment in a U.S. business.  Kushner Companies is also working with KABR Group, a private equity fund, on the One Journal Square project, according to marketing materials on Qiaowais website. The developers are seeking to raise $150 million, or 15.4 percent of the funding, from EB-5 investors. Because the SEC considers some EB-5 investments securities, companies and individuals that market these investments must comply with U.S. securities laws.  EB-5 schemes must also comply with immigration rules. Under United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) guidelines, EB-5 investors must put their capital at risk and the green card is not guaranteed. USCIS is part of the Department of Homeland Security. In an emailed response to a request for comment on Grassleys letter, Stu Loeser, a spokesman for USIF, said: Qiaowai and U.S. Immigration Fund are fully in compliance with all laws relating to the sale of securities to immigrant investors.These allegations are gross distortions and unsupported by the facts.  Reuters previously revealed that Qiaowais promotional materials online and on social media, including for the One Journal Square project, sometimes referred to a green card guarantee or safeguard and the safety of capital invested in EB-5 projects. After Reuters contacted Qiaowai for comment, these phrases were deleted. Qiaowai has also dropped the phrase government-supported from its online promotion of the One Journal Square project. It is a fundamental rule of the EB-5 program that an applicants investment must remain at risk up to the end of the aliens conditional permanent resident status, and a guaranteed investment fails this basic EB-5 test; if Qiaowai is in fact guaranteeing the safety of the investment principal, all related EB-5 petitions should be rejected by USCIS, wrote Grassley, who has long advocated for reform of the EB-5 program. Qiaowais assurances to investors that their green cards were guaranteed and their funds were safe appeared to violate U.S. securities laws, Grassleys letter said. It also cited a report on the projects promotion by the New York Times. Kushner Companies and the SEC declined to comment. Qiaowai, KABR Group and the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment over the weekend.  Chinese investors account for around 80 percent of the nearly 10,000 EB-5 visas issued annually.  Criticism of the program has centered on instances of fraud and the fact that most of the funds in a program originally intended to help impoverished areas have instead gone to wealthy urban districts. Despite these concerns, earlier this month, Congress extended the EB-5 program until September 30.     The Chinese road show for One Journal Square earlier this month also attracted criticism. Kushner Companies apologized for Nicole Kushner Meyers reference to her brother, President Donald Trumps son-in-law Jared Kushner, during the road show.  The company stressed that he was only mentioned in order to make clear that he was not involved with the project. Kushner Companies representatives skipped some later road show events. Jared Kushner, whose White House portfolio includes relations with China, sold his stake in Kushner Companies to a family trust early this year.

President Donald Trumps advisers are crafting recommendations that could call for tightening some of the trade and travel rules that Obama eased in his rapprochement with Havana but which are expected to stop short of breaking diplomatic relations restored in 2015 after more than five decades of hostility, the sources said. The policy review, coordinated by the National Security Council, is expected pick up steam now that Trump has returned from his first foreign trip, one administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Trump threatened in a tweet shortly after his election in November to terminate Obamas approach unless Cuba made significant concessions, something its Communist leadership is unlikely to do. The White House said in February that Cuba policy was under comprehensive review and that human rights on the island would be a major part of any revised strategy. Obama implemented his Cuba normalization measures through executive actions that bypassed Congress, and Trump is believed to have the power to undo much of it with the stroke of a pen. But there are divisions within his administration over to what extent he should go, especially given that Obamas opening to Washingtons former Cold War foe has created opportunities for American companies ranging from telecommunications to airlines. Some aides have argued that Trump, a former real estate magnate who won the presidency promising to unleash U.S. businesses and create jobs, would have a hard time defending any moves that close off the Cuban market. A group of 54 U.S. senators reintroduced legislation last Thursday to repeal all remaining restrictions on travel to Cuba, signaling support for U.S.-Cuba detente on Capitol Hill. But the Republican administration has been under heavy pressure from Cuban-American lawmakers such as U.S. Senator Marco Rubio and U.S. Representative Mario Diaz-Balart to take a much harder line than Trumps Democratic predecessor. There is little support in the administration, however, for a full-scale reversal of Obamas steps that began with a  breakthrough with Cuban President Raul Castro in 2014. Among the options under consideration are tightening restrictions on U.S. firms doing business with Cuban state or military enterprises and re-imposing stricter rules on  Americans traveling there, according to people familiar with the discussions. It remains unclear, however, which recommendation will make their way to Trump,though the sources said a list was likely to be ready for his consideration in coming days or weeks. Were getting closer, an administration official said. An announcement of changes could come as soon as June, according to the official and people familiar with the matter. The Daily Caller newspaper reported on Sunday that Trump would announce policy changes in a June speech in Miami, citing sources from a group opposed to the broader U.S. economic embargo that remains in place against Cuba. But the timing could also depend on factors such as whether Trump fills key Latin America posts at the State Department and elsewhere that remain vacant, sources told Reuters. The White House considered making a Cuba announcement on May 20 to mark the 115th anniversary of Cubas independence, but that coincided with Trumps overseas trip and the review also was not yet finished, the sources said.

Afterward, one of the legislators at the center of the confrontation said in a statement on Facebook that he was physically assaulted by a Democratic colleague while a second Democrat threatened his life. Republican Matt Rinaldis statement said this occurred after he told Democratic lawmakers that he had tipped off federal agents about defiant protesters who were holding signs declaring their illegal immigration status. Rinaldi did not immediately return calls or emails seeking further comment. The incident highlights the raw emotions stirred by Republican efforts to put Texas in line with the priority that President Donald Trump has given to combating illegal immigration. Democrats, mostly representing urban centers that have defied federal policy, have condemned the crackdown.   Texas, which has an estimated 1.5 million illegal immigrants and the longest border with Mexico of any U.S. state, has been at the forefront of the immigration debate. A bill, which both chambers of the Republican-dominated legislature approved on party-line votes and Governor Greg Abbott signed into law on May 7, aims to punish local authorities who fail to honor requests to turn over suspected illegal immigrants to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. It also allows police to ask people about their immigration status during a lawful detention, even for minor infractions like jay-walking.

Tillerson turned down a request from the State Departments Office of Religion and Global Affairs to host an Eid al-Fitr reception as part of Ramadan celebrations, said two U.S. officials who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly.  According to an April 6 memo seen by Reuters, the office - which typically initiates such events - recommended that Tillerson hold an Eid al-Fitr reception.  His rejection of the request suggests there are no plans this year for any high-profile Ramadan function at the State Department. The month of fasting and prayer for Muslims gets under way in many countries on Saturday. When asked by Reuters to comment on Tillerson declining a request to host an Eid al-Fitr event in July for Ramadan, a State Department spokesperson said: We are still exploring possible options for observance of Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of the month of Ramadan. U.S. ambassadors are encouraged to celebrate Ramadan through a variety of activities, which are held annually at missions around the world.  Muslim activists have accused President Donald Trumps administration of having an unfriendly attitude toward Islam,    encapsulated by its attempts to ban citizens of several Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States.         The administration says that while it strongly opposes Islamist militants, it has no quarrel with Islam. Aides point to Trumps visit this month to Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam where he addressed the leaders of more than 50 Muslim countries, as evidence of that. Members of Congress, Muslim civil society and community leaders, diplomats from Muslim countries and senior U.S. officials usually attend the State Department Ramadan event, a symbol of the U.S. governments diplomatic efforts with Muslim countries and people. If Tillerson avoids hosting one this year, that could send a message that it is not as important to this administration to engage with Muslims, said former U.S. diplomat Farah Pandith, who served in the Bush and Obama administrations and helped plan Ramadan events at the White House and State Department.     Tillerson issued a statement on Friday to mark the start of Ramadan, which he called a month of reverence, generosity, and self-reflection. Most importantly, it is a cherished time for family and friends to gather and give charity to those who are less fortunate,he said.           Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright started the tradition 18 years ago of Americas top diplomat hosting a public event for Ramadan, a lunar month. The secretary of state of the time usually gives remarks there on the meaning of Ramadan. In April, the State Departments Office of Religion and Global Affairs made a request to Tillersons office that he deliver remarks at an Eid al-Fitr reception this year, and suggested a two-week range of dates in July. The event would serve to highlight State Department initiatives and the importance of Muslim engagement, the memo said. It noted that by hosting a reception just after Ramadan, rather than an iftar - an often sumptuous dinner at sunset - a State Department event could be held any time of the day, thus preventing a very late evening for the Secretary.  Several weeks later, that office and other offices at the State Department were alerted that Tillerson declined the request, the officials said.  Reuters was told of the request being declined but did not see Tillersons reply. An official with the Office of Religion and Global Affairs did not respond to a request for comment.        Several prominent Muslim-American groups in the Washington area who are normally invited to the Ramadan event told Reuters this week that they had yet to receive an invitation from the State Department, which they said was unusual. If theyre having one, we havent been invited, said Rabiah Ahmed, spokeswoman for the Muslim Public Affairs Council in Washington. A representative for her group has been invited to the State Department event in the past, she said. Trumps administration has had a fraught relationship with Muslims. As a presidential candidate, the Republican urged a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States, called for more surveillance of mosques and warned that radical Muslims were trying to take over our children. Trump has since toned down his rhetoric and courts have halted his temporary travel ban on people from six mostly Muslim countries. White House officials did not respond to a request for comment on whether they would continue the tradition this year of hosting a Ramadan-related event at the White House.     The State Department celebrates other religious traditions though some of those commemorations are not as well-established as the State Departments Ramadan event. In 2014, then-secretary of state John Kerry hosted the first ever celebration at the State Department marking Diwali, the Hindu festival. The White House also traditionally hosts annual Christmas and Easter events as well as a Seder dinner to mark the Jewish Passover. The top U.S. diplomat has personally hosted a Ramadan event every year since 1999, often in the State Departments grand Benjamin Franklin room, apart from three years. In 2006 and 2015, deputies of the secretary of state at the time hosted either an iftar dinner or an Eid al-Fitr reception.    In 2014, Kerry hosted a reception for Eid al-Adha, another important Muslim holiday. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump attacked the news media and dismissed leaks from the White House as fake news on Sunday, following reports his son-in-law tried to set up a secret channel of communications with Moscow before Trump took office. Shortly after Trumps remarks on Twitter, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly made the rounds of Sunday television news shows to praise any so-called back channel communications, especially with Russia, as a good thing. The Republican president returned to the White House after a nine-day trip to the Middle East and Europe that ended on Saturday to face more questions about alleged communications between Jared Kushner and Russias ambassador to Washington. It is my opinion that many of the leaks coming out of the White House are fabricated lies made up by the #FakeNews media, Trump wrote in a series of Twitter posts on Sunday. In a statement later on Sunday night, carried by the New York Times, Trump praised Kushner and the work he has done in the White House. Jared is doing a great job for the country, he said. I have total confidence in him. He is respected by virtually everyone and is working on programs that will save our country billions of dollars. In addition to that, and perhaps more importantly, he is a very good person. The White House faces mounting questions about potential ties between Russia and Trumps presidential campaign, which are also the subject of criminal and congressional investigations. Trump officials were preparing to establish a war room to address an issue that has begun to dominate his young presidency. Aides said Trump was expected to meet with lawyers as early as Sunday, the New York Times reported. Two Republican U.S. senators played down the Kushner reports on Sunday, while the former director of national intelligence, James Clapper, took a darker view of such contacts with representatives of Russian President Vladimir Putin. My dashboard warning light was clearly on and I think that was the case with all of us in the intelligence community - very concerned about the nature of these approaches to the Russians, Clapper told NBCs Meet The Press. Kushner, who is married to Trumps daughter Ivanka, had contacts with Moscow in December about opening a secret back channel of communications, according to news reports published while Trump was away on his trip. The 36-year-old Kushner, a real estate developer with no previous government experience, had at least three previously undisclosed contacts with the Russian ambassador to the United States during and after the 2016 presidential campaign, seven current and former U.S. officials told Reuters. Whenever you see the words sources say in the fake news media, and they dont mention names, Trump wrote, it is very possible that those sources dont exist but are made up by fake news writers. #FakeNews is the enemy! Contacts between Trump associates and Russian officials during the campaign coincided with what U.S. intelligence agencies concluded was a Kremlin effort through computer hacking, fake news and propaganda to boost Trumps chances of winning the White House. White House officials defended the concept of secret communications channels without commenting specifically on the Kushner case. National security adviser H.R. McMaster told reporters on Saturday that so-called back-channeling was not unusual. Kelly, the homeland security secretary, carried the same message on Sunday. Its both normal, in my opinion, and acceptable, he said on ABCs This Week program. Any way that you can communicate with people, particularly organizations that are maybe not particularly friendly to us, is a good thing.  Kelly told Fox News Sunday there was nothing wrong with the Trump transition team trying to build relationships with the Russians as they prepared to take over the White House. U.S. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said such secret channels may be used in situations including peace talks with the Taliban in Afghanistan or for the release of American hostages. But for people associated with the campaign after that campaign has ended and where the Russians during that campaign were helping you, to try to establish a back channel and hide it from your own government, thats a serious allegation, he said. Schiff was particularly concerned about a Washington Post  report that the back channel would have been conducted at a Russian diplomatic facility to avoid monitoring in U.S. communications systems. You have to ask, well, who are they hiding the conversation from? he said on ABC. Schiff said he expected Kushner, who serves as an unpaid adviser to Trump, to appear before his committee and suggested his security clearance be reviewed. Kushner initially had come to the attention of FBI investigators last year as they began scrutinizingformer national security adviser Michael Flynns connections with Russian officials, the two sources told Reuters.   Republican U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham told CNN he doubted the Kushner reports were accurate. Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, noted that Kushner has been willing to answer questions. They reached out to us yesterday to make sure that we knew that was the case and Im sure hes willing to do so, Corker said on NBCs Meet the Press.  Though he had not seen evidence of collusion when he stepped down on Jan. 20, Clapper said all the signs made an FBI investigation not only appropriate but necessary. Russia, at least for my money, is our primary adversary, he told NBC. They are not our friends. They are in to do us in. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

In an interview on Fox News Sunday, Kelly said the United States planned to raise the bar on airline security, including tightening screening of carry-on items.  Thats the thing that they are obsessed with, the terrorists, the idea of knocking down an airplane in flight, particularly if its a U.S. carrier, particularly if its full of U.S. people. In March, the government imposed restrictions on large electronic devices in aircraft cabins on flights from 10 airports, including the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Turkey. Kelly said the move would be part of a broader airline security effort to combat what he called a real sophisticated threat. He said no decision had been made as to the timing of any ban. We are still following the intelligence, he said, and are in the process of defining this, but were going to raise the bar generally speaking for aviation much higher than it is now. Airlines are concerned that a broad ban on laptops may erode customer demand. But none wants an incident aboard one of its airplanes. Whatever comes out, well have to comply with, Oscar Munoz, chief executive officer of United Airlines (UAL.N), told  the companys annual meeting last week. Airlines were blindsided in January when President Donald Trump issued an executive order banning entry for 90 days to citizens from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, sending airlines scrambling to determine who could board and who could not. The order was later blocked in the courts.  In the case of laptops, the administration is keeping the industry in the loop. Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) said in a statement it continues to be in close contact with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, while Munoz applauded the administration for giving the company a heads up.  Weve had constant updates on the subject, he said. We know more than most. And again, if theres a credible threat out there, we need to make sure we take the appropriate measures.  MORE SCRUTINY OF CARRY-ONS Among the enhanced security measures will likely be tighter screening of carry-on items to allow Transport Security Administration agents to discern problematic items in tightly stuffed bags. Kelly said that in order to avoid paying fees for checking bags, people were stuffing them to the point where it was difficult to see through the clutter.  The more stuff is in there, the less the TSA professionals that are looking at whats in those bags through the monitors can tell whats in them. The TSA has begun testing certain new procedures at a limited number of airports, requiring people to remove additional items from carry-on bags for separate screenings. Asked whether the government would expand such measures nationwide, Kelly said: We might, and likely will. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Those contacts included two phone calls between April and November last year, two of the sources said. By early this year, Kushner had become a focus of the FBI investigation into whether there was any collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin, said two other sources - one current and one former law enforcement official.  Kushner initially had come to the attention of FBI investigators last year as they began scrutinizingformer national security adviser Michael Flynns connections with Russian officials, the two sources said. While the FBI is investigating Kushners contacts with Russia, he is not currently a target of that investigation, the current law enforcement official said. The new information about the two calls as well as other details uncovered by Reuters shed light on when and why Kushner first attracted FBI attention and show that his contacts with Russian envoy Sergei Kislyak were more extensive than the White House has acknowledged. NBC News reported on Thursday that Kushner was under scrutiny by the FBI, in the first sign that the investigation, which began last July, has reached the presidents inner circle.  The FBI declined to comment, while the Russian embassy said it was policy not to comment on individual diplomatic contacts. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.  Kushners attorney, Jamie Gorelick, said Kushner did not remember any calls with Kislyak between April and November.  Mr Kushner participated in thousands of calls in this time period. He has no recollection of the calls as described. We have asked (Reuters) for the dates of such alleged calls so we may look into it and respond, but we have not received such information, she said. In March, the White House said that Kushner and Flynn had met Kislyak at Trump Tower in December to establish a line of communication. Kislyak also attended a Trump campaign speech in Washington in April 2016 that Kushner attended. The White House did not acknowledgeany other contacts between Kushner and Russian officials. Before the election, Kislyaks undisclosed discussions with Kushner and Flynnfocused on fighting terrorism and improving U.S.-Russian economic relations, six of the sources said. Former President Barack Obama imposed sanctions on Russia after it seized Crimea and started supporting separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014. After the Nov. 8 election, Kushner and Flynn also discussed with Kislyak the idea of creating a back channel between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin that could have bypassed diplomats and intelligence agencies, two of the sources said.Reuters was unable to determine how those discussions were conducted or exactly when they took place. Reuters was first to report last week that a proposal for a back channel was discussed between Flynn and Kislyak as Trump prepared to take office. The Washington Post was first to report on Friday that Kushner participated in that conversation. Separately, there were at least 18 undisclosed calls and emails between Trump associates and Kremlin-linked people in the seven months before the Nov. 8 presidential election, including six calls with Kislyak, sources told Reuters earlier this month. . Two people familiar with those 18 contacts said Flynn and Kushner were amongthe Trump associates who spoke to the ambassador by telephone. Reuters previously reported only Flynns involvement in those discussions. Six of the sources said there were multiple contacts between Kushner and Kislyak but declined to give details beyond the two phone calls between April and November and the post-election conversation about setting up a back channel. It is also not clear whether Kushner engaged with Kislyak on his own or with other Trump aides.  FBI scrutiny of Kushner began when intelligence reports of Flynns contacts with Russians included mentions of U.S. citizens, whose names were redacted because of U.S. privacy laws. This prompted investigators to ask U.S. intelligence agencies to reveal the names of the Americans, the current U.S. law enforcement official said. Kushners was one of the names that was revealed, the official said, prompting a closer look at the presidents son-in-laws dealings with Kislyak and other Russians. FBI investigators are examining whether Russians suggested to Kushner or other Trump aides that relaxing economic sanctions would allow Russian banks to offer financing to people with ties to Trump, said the current U.S. law enforcement official.  The head of Russian state-owned Vnesheconombank, Sergei Nikolaevich Gorkov, a trained intelligence officer whom Putin appointed, met Kushner at Trump Tower in December. The bank is under U.S. sanctions and was implicated in a 2015 espionage case in which one of its New York executives pleaded guilty to spying and was jailed.  The bank said in a statement in March that it had met with Kushner along with other representatives of U.S. banks and business as part of preparing a new corporate strategy. Officials familiar with intelligence on contacts between the Russians and Trump advisers said that so far they have not seen evidence of any wrongdoing or collusion between the Trump camp and the Kremlin. Moreover, they said, nothing found so far indicates that Trump authorized, or was even aware of, the contacts. There may not have been anything improper about the contacts, the current law enforcement official stressed. Kushner offered in March to be interviewed by the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is also investigating Russias attempts to interfere in last years election. The contacts between Trump campaign associates and Russian officials during the presidential campaign coincided with what U.S. intelligence agencies concluded was a Kremlin effort through computer hacking, fake news and propaganda to boost Trumps chances of winning the White House and damage his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.

Trump flipped traditional U.S. foreign policy upside down on his tour through the Middle East and Europe, coddling Middle Eastern leaders with questionable human rights records while demanding traditional European allies pay more for their defense. At a Group of Seven summit in the resort town of Taormina on the island of Sicily, Trump refused to entreaties from the other six allies to maintain U.S. support for the Paris climate agreement, insisting he needed more time to make up his mind. In a hangar at Naval Air Station Sigonella, which is also on Sicily, Trump was introduced by his wife Melania, who has raised eyebrows during the trip by twice flicking away her husbands hand when he tried to hold hers. My husband worked very hard on this trip and I am very proud of him, she said. Trump, whose Marine One helicopter landed from Taormina to the soaring soundtrack of the Air Force One movie, emerged from two days of closed door summitry to declare his trip a success. Trump said he had helped forge more international cooperation in the fight against Islamist militants, a threat he said was underscored by a suicide bomber in Manchester, England, and the killing of Coptic Christians in Egypt. It was a tremendously productive meeting where I strengthen American bonds, said Trump. We have great bonds with other countries and, with some of our closest allies, we concluded a truly historic week. Trump skipped the traditional end-of-trip news conference to avoid facing questions about a host of problems he faces upon his return to Washington later on Saturday. His May 9 firing of former FBI Director James Comey has raised concerns about whether he was trying to squelch a federal probe into his campaigns ties with Russia last year. The questions have been intensified in the wake of disclosures on Friday that a senior adviser, Jared Kushner, the husband of Trumps daughter Ivanka, had contacts with the Russians in December about opening a secret back channel of communications with Moscow. Trump used his trip to promote America First policies,  promoting $110 billion worth of arms sales to Saudi Arabia and telling G-7 allies that the United States needs a more level playing field on trade. His body language on the trip demonstrated his typically brash behavior, dramatized by his demands that NATO allies pay more for their defense and his refusal to explicitly declare that the United States backs Article 5 of the alliances charter, which requires each member to come to the defense of each other. His pushing aside of the prime minister of Montenegro to get in place for a family photo generated headlines across Europe. At Sigonella, Trump said his appeals to NATO allies to pay more was working. Money is starting to flow in, he said. Its only fair to the United States. Were behind NATO all the way.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - Zbigniew Brzezinski, who served as U.S. President Jimmy Carters national security adviser during the Iran hostage crisis and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and drove a normalization of relations with China, has died. He was 89. Brzezinskis daughter Mika, a host on MSNBCs Morning Joe show, said her father died peacefully on Friday. She did not give the cause of death. He was known to his friends as Zbig, to his grandchildren as Chief and to his wife as the enduring love of her life. I just knew him as the most inspiring, loving and devoted father any girl could ever have, she said on Instagram.   Brzezinski, the hawkish son of a Polish diplomat, was national security adviser for all four years of the 1977-81 Carter presidency. The period saw tumultuous international events, including the Iranian revolution, the taking of 52 Americans as hostages in Tehran and a failed rescue mission, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Brzezinski was plucked by Carter from the academic world and saw many of the Soviet Unions foreign policy moves as evidence it could not be trusted. That placed him at odds with two of Carters closest  advisers: Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, who pushed for a Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT-2) with Moscow, and Defense Secretary Harold Brown, who urged a U.S.-Soviet accord to curb conventional forces in Europe. When Soviet troops invaded Afghanistan, Brzezinski strongly backed arming Afghan rebels. His hardline stance led Pravda, the Soviet Communist Party newspaper, to denounce him as a foe of detente. Carter said Brzezinski was brilliant, dedicated and loyal.  Rosalynn (Carters wife) and I are saddened, he said in a statement. He was an important part of our lives for more than four decades and was a superb public servant. Former President Barack Obama called Brzezinski an accomplished public servant, a powerful intellect, and a passionate advocate for American leadership. His influence spanned several decades, and I was one of several Presidents who benefited from his wisdom and counsel. You always knew where Zbig stood, and his ideas and advocacy helped shape decades of American national security policy.  In a joint statement, former President George H. W. Bush and his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, hailed Brzezinski as a great American ... a good man and a good friend. While he was skeptical of Soviet motives and objectives, Brzezinski nurtured a diplomatic friendship between the United States and China, which culminated in a trip to Beijing in June 1978 that led to re-establishment of diplomatic ties. Brzezinskis view of the Soviet Union may have been colored by his childhood experiences. Born in Warsaw, Poland, on March 28, 1928, he was taken as a youngster to Canada where his father served as a diplomat. When the communists took over Poland at the end of World War Two, the family remained in the West. Brzezinski received a doctorate from Harvard University in 1953 and became an American citizen in 1958. He voiced support for U.S. policy in Vietnam in the mid-1960s, and served on the policy planning staff of President Lyndon Johnsons State Department. Along with David Rockefeller, chairman of the Chase Manhattan Bank, Brzezinski helped to found the Trilateral Commission, a private group that promoted closer ties between  North America, Western Europe and Japan. Carter had known Brzezinski before his election and asked him to leave Columbia University, where the effects of Soviet communism had been the focus of much of his work. Having regular access to Carter gave Brzezinski vast influence, leading to reports that he and Vance were rivals for the presidents ear. The rivalry lasted until Vance resigned after the aborted mission to rescue American hostages in Iran in April 1980. Before the seizure of the U.S. embassy in Tehran in 1979, Vance had resisted Brzezinskis proposal that Washington back a military crackdown against Irans radical Islamic forces. Once the embassy was taken by followers of Islamic leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Vance sought Carters backing for an attempt to come to terms with Khomeini. Brzezinski characteristically favored military action to free the 52 American hostages and punish Iran. Carter eventually accepted Brzezinskis proposal for the ill-fated mission, in which eight servicemen died. Brzezinski also took part in negotiations toward the Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty in 1979, which was seen by many as the major achievement of Carters presidency. Despite his lifelong antipathy to Soviet communism, he joined Defense Secretary Brown in spearheading an unsuccessful drive to win Senate approval for the 1979 SALT-2 arms control accord. Although it never cleared the Senate as a result of the December 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, SALT-2 remained in unofficially effect beyond its original five-year lifespan. After the Carter years, Brzezinski became a consultant on international affairs and a senior adviser at Washingtons Center for Strategic and International Studies. He also taught  foreign policy at Johns Hopkins University. He wrote frequent opinion articles for newspapers and published several books. These included Strategic Vision: America and the Crisis of Global Power in 2012. Then Vice President George H.W. Bush, trying to build an image as a tough foreign policy realist, considered it a coup to secure Brzezinskis support in his 1988 presidential campaign. Brzezinski was at times critical of both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. He was sharply critical of Bushs war on terror and the 2003 invasion of Iraq. After Donald Trumps election in November, he observed that the world was watching U.S. political developments with some stupefaction. Brzezinski had endorsed Barack Obama in 2007, saying the Democratic presidential candidate recognized the challenge of bringing a new face, a new sense of direction, a new definition of Americas role in the world. Brzezinski had three children with his wife Emilie. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The fate of President Donald Trumps order to ban travelers from six predominantly Muslim nations, blocked by federal courts, may soon be in the hands of the conservative-majority Supreme Court, where his appointee Neil Gorsuch could help settle the matter. After the Richmond-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declined on Thursday to lift a Maryland federal judges injunction halting the temporary ban ordered by Trump on March 6, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the administration would appeal to the Supreme Court. A second regional federal appeals court heard arguments on May 15 in Seattle in the administrations appeal of a decision by a federal judge in Hawaii also to block the ban. A ruling by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is pending. The Justice Department has not made clear when the administration would make its formal appeal or whether it would wait for the 9th Circuit ruling before appealing.  If they take it up, the justices would be called upon to decide whether courts should always defer to the president over allowing certain people to enter the country, especially when national security is the stated reason for an action as in this case. They also would have to decide if Trumps order violated the U.S. Constitutions bar against the government favoring one religion over another, as the bans challengers assert. Gorsuchs April confirmation by the Republican-led Senate over Democratic opposition restored the courts 5-4 majority, which means that if all the conservative justices side with the administration the ban would be restored regardless of how the four liberal justices vote. During his Senate confirmation hearing, Gorsuch was questioned about Trumps criticism of judges who ruled against the ban. Gorsuch avoided commenting on the legal issue, saying only that he would not be rubber stamp for any president. While the justices could decide in the coming weeks whether to hear the case, they likely would not hold oral arguments until late in the year, with a ruling sometime after that. A final resolution may not come until perhaps a year after Trump issued the executive order. The justices are not required to hear any case, but this one meets important criteria cited by experts, including that it would be the federal government filing the appeal and that it involves a nationwide injunction.  The administration could file an emergency application seeking to put the order into effect while the litigation on its legality continues. At least five justices must agree for any such request to be granted. While the court could split 5-4 along ideological lines, it also is possible some conservative justices could join the liberals in overturning the travel ban, libertarian law professor Ilya Somin of George Mason University said. Conservatives in other contexts often take a hard line against any kind of government discrimination (based) on race or religion or the like, even if the motivation may be benign. Also conservatives have concerns about government infringements on religion, Somin said. The 4th Circuit said the bans challengers, including refugee groups, in the case argued by the American Civil Liberties Union were likely to succeed on their claim that the order violated the Constitutions prohibition on the government favoring or disfavoring any religion. In the 10-3 ruling, three Republican-appointed judges dissented. The Republican presidents March 6 order, replacing an earlier Jan. 27 one also blocked by the courts, called for barring people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days while the government implements stricter visa screening. It also called for suspending all refugee admissions for 120 days. The travel bans challengers may take some comfort from the appeals court rulings reliance on a concurring opinion in a 2015 Supreme Court immigration case by Justice Anthony Kennedy, a conservative who sometimes sides with the courts liberals in big cases. In the 2015 case, Kennedy wrote that in the immigration context, the governments actions can be questioned if there is evidence of bad faith. As with any opinion by Justice Kennedy, I think the million-dollar question is just what he meant in his concurrence, and this may be a perfect case to find out, University of Texas School of Law professor Stephen Vladeck said. In Thursdays ruling, 4th Circuit Chief Judge Roger Gregory wrote that the plaintiffs had shown there was ample evidence of bad faith, which gave the green light to probe whether there were reasons for the order other than the administrations stated national security rationale. The administration has argued the temporary travel ban was needed to guard against terrorist attacks. Gregory wrote that the order uses vague words of national security, but in context drips with religious intolerance, animus, and discrimination. Trump during the presidential campaign called for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

During his election campaign, Trump appeared to called Article 5 into question by suggesting that NATO members who did not pay their fair share for the alliance may not deserve to benefit from it. I think its extraordinary that there would be an expectation that the president would have to say explicitly that he supports Article 5. Of course he does, McMaster told reporters at the end of a Group of Seven summit in Sicily. He did not make a decision not to say it, McMaster continued. It was implicit in the speech.

Abbott signed the bill at an indoor gun range in Austin, the state capital, then demonstrated his own shooting skills at an upstairs firing gallery before holding up his bullet-pocked target and quipping, Im gonna carry this around in case I see any reporters. A photo of the moment, published by the Texas Tribune, showed the grinning first-term Republican governor pointing to the center of the paper target, where three rounds had pierced the bulls eye circle.  His comment drew sharp rebukes from Reporters Without Borders, headquartered in Paris, and the Washington-based Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. Both said the incident was especially troubling as it came amid increasingly hostile rhetoric directed against the news media by Republican President Donald Trump and his supporters. This joke was dangerous and out of line. Because its never just a joke to some, Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence said in a statement. Words matter. In a state and country where dangerous people can still so easily buy guns without a background check, leaders of every political stripe should be careful not to green light violence on their behalf. The two groups also cited the misdemeanor assault charge filed on Wednesday against Republican Congressman-elect Greg Gianforte of Montana, accused of body-slamming a reporter who asked him about healthcare on the eve of his election. Politicians must condemn this dangerous rhetoric against reporters as it can quickly escalate to physical violence like we saw in Montana, Reporters Without Borders said in a Tweet.

Were really seeing just how much America deserves that ranking right now, said Margaux Ewen, the organizations U.S. advocacy director. Abbotts office did not respond to requests by Reuters for comment. The bill he signed will cut fees for a first-time license to carry a handgun from $140 to $40, and lower the renewal fee from $70 to $40, starting in September. It also waives the fees for peace officers and members of the military.

Manafort and Deripaska did business in the mid-2000s, when Manafort, a Republican operative, was providing campaign advice to Ukrainian politicians backed by Moscow, but their relationship later deteriorated, resulting in a lawsuit, the Times said.  Representatives for Deripaska in the United States did not respond to the Times requests for comment. Manafort has denied any impropriety with his ties to Russia and has turned over documents a Senate intelligence panel had requested.

Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), said in a letter that the administration was not seeking to impede efforts by the Office of Government Ethics to obtain that information, despite earlier protests from Walter Shaub, the director of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE). OMB shares the belief that the executive branch must uphold the highest ethical standards in accordance with the law, Mulvaney wrote. Our concern was, and is, protecting the process related to the data call. Shaub, an appointee under President Barack Obama in the final year of five-year term, had requested in April copies of waivers the administration of President Donald Trump granted to former lobbyists now appointed to positions in the government. Those requests were sent to agencies across the administration, seeking waivers that would allow former lobbyists to work on issues they had been involved with as paid advocates.  But OMB requested a stay of that request, prompting a fierce response from Shaub. He called the request highly unusual and said his agency has the authority to take corrective action proceedings against agencies that refuse its requests. In his Friday response, Mulvaney said the requested stay was not an attempt to stifle OGE efforts but rather to provide more time to ensure sufficient consideration was given to legal questions. OMB has never sought to impede OGE, he wrote. Mulvaney closed the letter by saying the OMB did not grant any lobbyist waivers itself. Shortly after taking office in January, Trump signed an executive order barring lobbyists who joined the administration from working on issues related to their prior work.

President Donald Trump last month ordered the Interior Department to review some 27 national monuments created since 1996, with an eye to rescinding or shrinking the size of some of them to increase development opportunities. It would be a travesty to leave this landscape vulnerable to uranium and fossil-fuel mining, and excessive off-road vehicle use, the Navajo-led Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition wrote in one public comment. The five-tribe group oversees the Bears Ears monument and lobbied hard to secure its monument designation by former President Barack Obama in December. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke gave the public until May 26 to comment on Bears Ears, the countrys newest monument, and until July 10 to comment on the rest. As of Friday, groups and individuals had posted more than 107,000 comments on a government website created to receive them as part of the review process, a high number given the short time frame.  A Commerce Department call for public comments on regulatory hurdles completed last month drew under 200 comments. One public comment, made anonymously, urged Zinke not to bow to industry and political pressure to alter the Bears Ears monument. Do the hard thing, speak for the many and not the few, it said. Many industry groups and politicians, including Utahs governor, two senators and congressman, want Zinke to reverse monument designations and turn over control of the protected lands to states.  Zinke is due to give his recommendation to Trump on Bears Ears on June 10 and publish a report on the other monuments later. Conservation groups said support of national monuments is wider than the online comments suggest. This issue just strikes a nerve with people, said Randi Spivak of the Center for Biological Diversity. But many opponents of the monument designations have posted comments, with some arguing that barring large swaths of land from any development keeps the public from fully enjoying these areas.

Trumps advisers are planning to establish a war room to combat mounting questions about communication between Russia and his presidential campaign before and after Novembers presidential election, while bringing new aides into the White House, administration officials and persons close to Trump told Reuters. The strategic shake-up comes as Republicans in Washington increasingly have fretted that the probe, continued chaos in the West Wing and Trumps steady slide in opinion polls will derail the presidents drive to reform healthcare, cut taxes and rebuild the nations infrastructure. Upon Trumps return, the administration will add experienced political professionals, including Trumps former campaign manager, and possibly more lawyers to handle the Russia probe, which has gained new urgency since the Justice Department appointed a special counsel to head the investigation, the sources said. Beyond pushing back at suggestions that Moscow is unduly influencing Trumps administration, the messaging effort will also focus on advancing Trumps stalled policy agenda and likely involve more trips out of Washington that will feature the kind of raucous rallies that were the hallmark of Trumps campaign. A person in regular touch with the White House said it needed a different structure to focus on the new reality that there would be continued leaks to the media from the law enforcement and intelligence communities, leaks that have increased in frequency since Trump fired former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey on May 9. Since the firing of Comey, that really exposed the fact that the White House in its current structure ... is not prepared for really a one-front war, let alone a two-front war, the person said. They need to have a structure in place that allows them to stay focused while also truly fighting back on these attacks and these leaks. The White House declined to comment on plans for a war room but said Trump will be looking to expand on momentum it believes it has built up during the presidents trip to Saudi Arabia, Israel, and Europe.A White House official confirmed plans to hold more rallies. Trump returns to Washington on Saturday from his first trip abroad as president. The president has had an incredibly successful trip overseas and the White House looks forward to continuing an aggressive messaging strategy to highlight his agenda when we return to D.C., said White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders. Jared Kushner, a senior adviser to Trump, will be involved in the new strategic messaging operation, as will Steve Bannon, another top adviser who specializes in managing Trumps populist appeal and shaping his political image, the sources said. Bannon and Trumps chief of staff, Reince Priebus, have been laying the groundwork for the plan this week, they added. On Thursday, NBC News and the Washington Post reported that Kushner, who held several meetings with Russian officials following the election, is a focus of the probe, making him the first current White House official to be caught up in it, although Kushner, who is Trumps son-in-law, has not been accused of any wrongdoing. Corey Lewandowski, Trumps former campaign manager, is also expected to be part of the effort. Lewandowski, who has been seen in the White House recently, could join the administration as early as next week, a source close to him said. Lewandowski was fired by Trump in June 2016 over concerns that he was not experienced enough to oversee the general election fight against Democrat Hillary Clinton, but has remained a trusted adviser to Trump and a steadfast defender of the president on news programs. This month, the Justice Department named Robert Mueller, a former FBI director, as an independent special counsel in the probe. Trump has been frustrated of late that his communications team hasnt done a more effective job at making the case that he isnt implicated in the Russia probe and highlighting his administrations successes, sources close to the president said. The White House declined to comment on the presidents frustrations. Another Republican close to the White House said the new team is taking a page out of former President Bill Clintons playbook. When Clinton faced impeachment in the late 1990s, he assembled a crisis-management operation that dealt with fallout from his affair with Monica Lewinsky while allowing the rest of the White House to deal with day-to-day policy matters.  The goal of the White House is to try and contain the crisis and media coverage of the special counsel, the Republican said. Christopher Ruddy, chief executive of Newsmax Media and a Trump friend, said he expects the president will travel more when he returns from overseas and encouraged the White House to focus on issues that pump up his base voters. From my perspective, I think the president should be doing the stuff that he does best, which is talking about his agenda: jobs, trade and security, Ruddy said.  Trump has scheduled a political rally for next week in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. The White House said other similar events are in the planning stages. Republicans in Congress are aching for Trump to leave the distraction of the Russia probe aside and focus on legislation and nominating officials to fill the hundreds of vacant slots across the administration.  What we really want to be able to do is tend to our business, Mike Rounds, a Republican Senator from South Dakota, told Reuters. Weve got a healthcare bill were working on. Weve got tax reform that we think is important. Some of Trumps donors, too, say they are concerned. Stanley Hubbard, a billionaire radio mogul from Minnesota, said he worries that the White House continues to be distracted by the Russia scandal, but laid some of the blame on Trump himself.  He talks when he shouldnt, he said. Former U.S. House Speaker John Boehner said this week that Trumps time in office has been a complete disaster aside from foreign affairs.

He said Republicans should never have tried to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, even after the House narrowly passed an overhaul measure. The Senate is considering its own version of the package. And he dismissed tax reform efforts, which form a cornerstone of the Republican policy agenda, as just a bunch of happy talk. While Boehners successor, Speaker Paul Ryan, tries to include a border adjustment tax, a tax on imports, as a key piece of any tax code overhaul, Boehner declared it deader than a doornail amid opposition from fellow Republicans and the White House.

Kennedy was a troublesome teen whose hijinks nearly got him kicked out of his prestigious boarding school. The scion of a wealthy Boston family, Kennedy spent his mid-teens at Connecticuts elite Choate Rosemary Hall, where he excelled at history and literature - but infuriated the schools headmaster by organizing pranks as a member of an unofficial school club known as The Muckers. Those details of the early life of the 35th president, whose term was cut short by an assassins bullet in Dallas in 1963, emerge in a new exhibit at Bostons John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, timed to commemorate the 100th anniversary of his birth on May 29, 1917. Pages from a high school scrapbook, diligently filled out by the man who would go on to become the first Roman Catholic president, show he loved ancient history, music and football, as well as beefing, slang for complaining or arguing. Despite his later fame as an orator, he never got higher than the middling grade of C+ in public speaking, according to the school. Got shot at today for calling an old farmer a bad name, reads an entry written by a 17-year-old Kennedy on Oct. 19, 1934. Almost got hit. The scrapbook pages are among 40 Kennedy relics never before publicly exhibited, with notes extending to his years at Harvard University and the London School of Economics, before his World War Two service aboard torpedo boats and well before his first successful run for Congress in 1947. Kennedy went on the serve in the Senate before being elected president in 1960, at the start of one of the most tumultuous decades in U.S. history. Thats why I so love this scrapbook, because it is so revealing about who he was at the time, said Stacey Bredhoff, the museums curator. Kennedy and his prankster friends went head-to-head with Choates headmaster, George St. John, in his years at the school. The Muckers club took its name from a speech in which St. John excoriated pranksters, using the label applied to Irish immigrants whose only work was shoveling up horse manure. The group took the idea and ran with it, commissioning gold shovel pins and hatching a plot to pile horse manure in the school gymnasium. George St. John got wind of it and even though the prank never was actualized, it was enough that they would even consider such a thing, so he threatened to expel them all, but eventually relented, said Judy Donald, the schools archivist. The details of the groups successful pranks may be lost to time. But Donald said an oft-told tale that a young Kennedy blew up a school toilet with a powerful firecracker known as a cherry bomb is not true - while that incident did occur, it was the work of another student a decade later. St. John was understandably angry, Donald said. But JFK was not responsible for that one. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

(Reuters) - Hillary Clinton assailed the man who beat her to the White House, slamming as unimaginable cruelty President Donald Trumps proposal to cut $3.6 trillion in government spending over the next decade in a speech on Friday. The defeated Democratic candidate did not name the Republican president in her remarks to the graduating class at her alma mater, Wellesley College. But she took several veiled swipes at the businessman-turned-politician, whose budget proposal earlier this week proposed sharp cuts in programs for healthcare and food assistance. Look at the budget that was just proposed in Washington. It is an attack of unimaginable cruelty on the most vulnerable among us, Clinton told a crowd at the all-womens college, located in Bostons suburbs. It grossly underfunds public education, mental health and even efforts to combat the opioid epidemic. White House officials have described the proposed budget as providing tax cuts that they say would stimulate economic growth and create more private-sector jobs. As with all presidential budget proposals, the proposal was more of a wishlist that is unlikely to be approved in its current form by Congress. Clinton, a former secretary of state, warned against an erosion of accepted standards of truth in U.S. public discourse, and also appeared to be attacking Trump on this issue. You are graduating a time when there is a full-fledged assault on truth and reason. Just log on to social media for 10 seconds, it will hit you right in the face, she said, citing hoax online reports that her campaign was tied to a Washington pizzeria that operated a child sex ring.     When people in power invent their own facts and attack those who question them, it can mark the beginning of the end of a free society, Clinton said. This is not hyperbole, it is what authoritarian regimes throughout history have done. She also urged graduates of the liberal-leaning school, which is located in one of the most Democratic states in the country, not to retreat into their own partisan echo chambers, saying, your learning, listening and serving should include people who dont agree with you politically. Clinton has had a long public career since graduating in 1969 from Wellesley. She was first lady during her husband Bill Clintons two terms in the White House and was later elected to the U.S. Senate representing New York state. She made an unsuccessful presidential run in 2008 before serving as the countrys top diplomat during President Barack Obamas first term.

(Reuters) - Republican Greg Gianforte defeated a political novice to win Montanas seat in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday, barely 24 hours after he was charged with assaulting a reporter who asked him about the Republican healthcare bill. A race that was expected to be a test of President Donald Trumps political influence ahead of next years U.S. congressional elections was jolted by the charge against Gianforte, a wealthy technology executive who had urged voters to send him to Congress to help Trump. Speaking to cheering supporters in Bozeman after his win, Gianforte apologized for the incident and said he was not proud of his actions. I should not have responded the way I did, and for that Im sorry, Gianforte said. I should not have treated that reporter that way. Gianforte beat Democrat Rob Quist, a banjo player and first-time candidate who had focused his campaign on criticism of the Republican effort to repeal and replace former President Barack Obamas healthcare law. CNN projected Gianforte would win. With 96 percent of the vote counted, he led Quist by 51 percent to 43 percent. Gianforte prevailed despite being charged on Wednesday night with misdemeanor assault on Ben Jacobs, a political correspondent for the U.S. edition of the Guardian newspaper, who said the candidate body-slammed him during a campaign event in Bozeman. Gianfortes victory is a boost for Republicans, who are worried Trumps political stumbles and the unpopularity of the healthcare bill passed by the House will hurt their chances of holding on to a 24-seat House majority in next years elections. But the relatively close margin of the race in Republican-leaning Montana was encouraging to Democrats, who are already focused on next months hotly contested special House election in the suburbs of Atlanta, Georgia. Gianforte had been favored to win in Montana, where Republicans have held the lone House seat for two decades and where Trump won by more than 20 percentage points in the 2016 presidential election. The race had grown closer in the last week, however, as Quist focused on criticism of the House healthcare bill.  Quist, wearing his signature cowboy hat, told supporters in Missoula, Montana, that the grassroots energy of his campaign would continue. I know that Montanans will hold Mr Gianforte accountable, Quist said. It was unclear if Gianfortes assault had an impact on the vote. More than a third of the states registered voters had already submitted ballots before it happened, state election officials said, and some Gianforte supporters shrugged off the charges or said they did not believe published accounts. I feel like, its all just propaganda, you know what I mean, its hard for me to believe anything the media tells me, said Nathaniel Trumper, who cast a vote for Gianforte at a polling station in Helena. The assault occurred as Jacobs tried to ask Gianforte about healthcare, according to an audio tape. Fox News Channel reporter Alicia Acuna, who was preparing to interview Gianforte, said the candidate grabbed Jacobs by the neck with both hands and slammed him to the ground. Afterward, three state newspapers rescinded their endorsements of Gianforte. Some Republican lawmakers, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, suggested he apologize. Gianforte specifically addressed his apology to Jacobs. Last night I made a mistake, he said, adding: Im sorry, Mr Ben Jacobs. Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel called Gianfortes apology a good first step toward redemption and said she hoped he continues to work toward righting his wrong. Gianforte will take the House seat vacated when Trump named Ryan Zinke as secretary of the interior. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence recorded robocalls to voters on Gianfortes behalf, and Republican groups poured millions into ads criticizing Quist for property tax liens and unpaid debts, which Quist said stemmed from a botched gallbladder surgery. Quist, who raised more than $6 million for his upstart bid, said the experience gave him insight into the economic struggles some people face. He campaigned last weekend with U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who won the states 2016 Democratic presidential primary against Hillary Clinton. Gianforte could face additional, more serious charges once prosecutors review the evidence, Gallatin County Attorney Marty Lambert told Reuters. Gianforte has two weeks to enter a plea to the misdemeanor citation issued by the Gallatin County Sheriffs Office, according to Lambert, who said he would likely review the case before then to decide whether it should be treated as a felony offense, which would supersede the current charge. Theres always the possibility that when we get the case and the details, that we might look differently at the charging decision, Lambert said.

These clearly are very dangerous times and we need every available tool at our disposal to prevent terrorists from entering the United States and committing acts of bloodshed and violence, said Michael Short, a White House spokesman.

In its 10-3 ruling, the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals said those challenging the ban, including refugee groups and individuals, were likely to succeed on their claim that the order violates the U.S. Constitutions bar against favoring one religion over another.  Gregory cited statements by Trump during the 2016 presidential election calling for a Muslim ban. During the race, Trump called for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States in a statement on his website.  The judge wrote that a reasonable observer would likely conclude the orders primary purpose is to exclude persons from the United States on the basis of their religious beliefs.  The government had argued that the court should not take into account Trumps comments on the campaign trail since they occurred before he took office on Jan. 20. But the appeals court rejected that view, saying they provide a window into the motivations for Trumps action in government.  The appeals court questioned a government argument that the president has wide authority to halt the entry of people to the United States.  Congress granted the President broad power to deny entry to aliens, but that power is not absolute. It cannot go unchecked when, as here, the President wields it through an executive edict that stands to cause irreparable harm to individuals across this nation, the majority opinion said.  The Virginia-based appeals court was reviewing a March ruling by Maryland-based federal judge Theodore Chuang that blocked part of Trumps March 6 executive order barring people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days while the government put in place stricter visa screening.  A similar ruling against Trumps policy from a Hawaii-based federal judge is still in place. That ruling went farther than Chuangs order, blocking a section of the travel ban that also suspended refugee admissions for four months. The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is still reviewing that decision.  Trump has lashed out at the judges and courts that have ruled against him, saying the 9th Circuit has a terrible record and calling its rulings on his policies ridiculous.  The March ban was Trumps second effort to implement travel restrictions through an executive order. The first, issued on Jan. 27, led to chaos and protests at airports before it was blocked by courts.  The second order was intended to overcome the legal issues posed by the original ban, but it was blocked by judges before it could go into effect on March 16.  In an opinion that concurred with the majority on Thursday, Judge Stephanie Thacker wrote that the administration did nothing to distance itself from the first order, describing the revised ban as the proverbial wolf in sheeps clothing.  Chief Judge Gregory, who wrote the majority opinion, was first installed in a recess appointment by Democratic President Bill Clinton and then nominated to the same post by Republican former president George W. Bush.  Nine other judges appointed by Democrats agreed to block the travel ban, while three Republican-appointed judges dissented.  This to us is a complete win and overwhelming in terms of the votes, said Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union Immigrants Rights Project, who argued the case in the 4th Circuit.  The dissenting judges said the executive order was constitutional and a valid exercise of presidential authority, and that Trumps campaign statements should not have come into play. The order itself contains no reference to religion whatsoever, Judge Paul Niemeyer wrote.  The White House also pointed to a dissent by Judge Dennis Shedd that said the real losers in this case are the millions of individual Americans whose security is threatened on a daily basis by those who seek to do us harm.  Two other 4th Circuit judges, both appointed by Republicans, were recused from the case.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The total number of U.S. non-immigrant visas issued to people from all countries was about 15 percent lower in April compared with the 2016 monthly average. The April data shows the continuation of a trend identified in data for the month of March, which the State Department released last month. That data showed that citizens of the seven Muslim-majority countries under the bans - Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen - received about 40 percent fewer visitor visas in March than in an average month last year.  [nL1N1HZ2PJ] Trumps travel bans have been blocked by the courts. Citizens of the seven countries received about 2,800 non-immigrant visas in April 2017, compared with about 5,700 on average per month during the 2016 fiscal year and more than 6,000 on average per month in 2015 and 2014. Data from previous years is only available in aggregate by fiscal year, rather than month-by-month. (tmsnrt.rs/2p8EFbm) The State Department released the data to comply with a directive from Trump asking it to publish monthly breakdowns of the number of visas issued around the world. The agency did not release data on the number of visa applications, so it is unclear whether the lower number of visas is because of a higher rate of rejections or other factors, such as fewer applicants or slower processing times. Visa demand is cyclical, not uniform throughout the year, and affected by various factors at the local and international level, said William Cocks, a spokesman for the State Departments Bureau of Consular Affairs. Trump, who has said the travel bans were intended to make Americans safer from attacks, signed an executive order on Jan. 27 barring people from the seven countries from entering the United States for 90 days. After the order was blocked by federal courts, the Trump administration replaced it with a revised, narrower ban which dropped Iraq from the list. Courts have also halted parts of the second order. On Thursday, a U.S. appeals court refused to reinstate the travel ban, calling it discriminatory and setting the stage for a showdown in the Supreme Court. [nL1N1IR1FY] Although visitor visas were down across the board for the seven targeted countries compared with last years averages, Iraqis in April received 349 immigrant visas, which are typically given to those with jobs or family members in the United States, compared with 305 in an average month in 2016. Syrians also received more immigrant visas in April - 268 versus an average of 219 per month last year. All other countries targeted by one of Trumps bans received fewer immigrant visas in April than in an average month last year. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

In unexpectedly abrupt remarks as NATO leaders stood alongside him, Trump said certain member countries owed massive amounts of money to the United States and NATO  even though allied contributions are voluntary, with multiple budgets. His scripted comments contrasted with NATOs choreographed efforts to play up the Wests unity by inviting Trump to unveil a memorial to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States at the new NATO headquarters building in Brussels. Terrorism must be stopped in its tracks, or the horror you saw in Manchester and so many other places will continue forever, Trump said, referring to Mondays suicide bombing in the English city that killed 22 people, including children. These grave security concerns are the same reason that I have been very, very direct ... in saying that NATO members must finally contribute their fair share, Trump said. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg defended Trump, saying that although he was blunt he had a very plain and clear message on the expectations of allies.  But one senior diplomat said Trump, who left the leaders dinner before it ended to fly to Italy for Fridays Group of Seven summit, said the remarks did not go down well at all. This was not the right place or time, the diplomat said of the very public harangue. We are left with nothing else but trying to put a brave face on it.  In another unexpected twist, Trump called on NATO, an organization founded on collective defense against the Soviet threat, to include limiting immigration in its tasks. And Trump did say that the United States will never forsake the friends who stood by our side but NATO leaders had hoped he would more explicitly support the mutual defense rules of a  military alliances he called obsolete during his campaign.  Instead, he returned to a grievance about Europes drop in defense spending since the end of the Cold War and failed to publicly commit to NATOs founding Article V rule which stipulates that an attack on one ally is an attack against all. Twenty-three of the 28 member nations are still not paying what they should be paying for their defense, Trump said, standing by a piece of the wreckage of the Twin Towers. This is not fair to the people and taxpayers of the United States, and many of these nations owe massive amounts of money from past years, Trump said as the other leaders watched. Nicholas Burns, a former long-time diplomat and ambassador to NATO from 2001-2005, now a professor at Harvards Kennedy School of Government, said every U.S. president since Harry Truman had pledged support for Article V and that the United States would defend Europe. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Trump was 100 percent committed to collective defense.We are not playing cutesie with this. He is fully committed, Spicer said. Praise was always going to be in short supply after Trumps sharp election campaign criticism of the alliance, which he blamed for not doing more to combat terrorism. Last year, Trump threatened to abandon U.S. allies in Europe if they did not spend enough on defense, comments that were particularly unnerving for the ex-Soviet Baltic states on Russias border which fear Moscow might try a repeat of its 2014 annexation of Ukraines Crimea. Although he has since softened his tone in phone calls and meetings with Western leaders, Trumps sharp words on Thursday recalled his awkward meeting with Angela Merkel in March, when he pressed the German chancellor for Germany to meet NATOs military spending target. NATO diplomats planned to placate Trump with a pledge on Thursday to agree to national plans by the end of this year showing how NATO allies will meet a promise to spend 2 percent of economic output every year on defense by 2024. But Trump increased the pressure, calling that agreement made at a summit in Wales in 2014 the bare minimum. Even 2 percent of GDP is insufficient ... 2 percent is the bare minimum for confronting todays very real and very vicious threats, Trump said. He also made his presence felt at his first NATO summit, literally, pushing his way past Montenegros prime minister, Dusko Markovic, whose country joins the organization next month, in footage that went viral. Spicer said he had not seen the video but assumed the U.S. president was moving to his designated spot. NATO nonetheless strived to impress Trump with allied jets flying overhead and a walk through the new glass headquarters, which replaces a 1960s prefab structure. Trump, a real estate magnate, called the building beautiful and joked that he did not dare ask how much it cost. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The Freedom to Travel to Cuba Act was introduced in 2015 by eight Republican and Democratic co-sponsors but never made it to the floor. The latest measure attracted 55 co-sponsors. While efforts to ease the decades-old U.S. embargo against Cuba have been gathering strength and 55 votes would be a majority in the 100-member Senate, that number falls short of the 60 needed to advance the legislation. There was no indication the chambers Republican leaders would allow the measure to come up for a vote. Republican President Donald Trump threatened during his 2016 election campaign to reverse a normalization of ties with the Communist-run, Caribbean island initiated in 2014 by Democratic President Barack Obama. Trumps administration is reviewing U.S. policy toward the countrys former Cold War foe. Obama eased trade and travel restrictions, fueling a boom in American visits to Cuba, although tourism was still not officially allowed. On Wednesday, more than 40 U.S. travel companies and organizations urged Trump not to roll back expanded U.S. travel to Cuba.  It is Americans who are penalized by our travel ban, not the Cuban government,said U.S. Republican Senator Jeff Flake, who with Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy led the group that co-sponsored the bill. Flake added that lifting the ban would give Americans more freedom but also benefit the Cuban people. This is certain to have positive benefits for the islands burgeoning entrepreneurial and private sector. The number of U.S. visitors rose 74 percent last year, boosting business for Cuban hotels, BnBs, restaurants and taxis but also U.S. cruise operators and airlines that entered the market over the past year. We applaud Senators Flake and Leahy for their leadership in supporting the American and Cuban people by eliminating archaic, outdated policy, said James Williams, president of the Washington-based Engage Cuba group.

The Green Book, named for the color of its cover in recent years, is not that big a deal as a document, but its absence this year shows that the Trump White House lacks a clear vision for what to do about overhauling the tax code, experts said. I think its as simple as no tax plan equals no Green Book, said Donald Marron, director of economic policy initiatives at the Urban Institute, a liberal think tank. Democratic lawmakers on Thursday in two Senate hearings criticized the presidents fiscal 2018 budget proposal, released on Tuesday, and some of its core tax components. Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen called the budget proposal and its tax assumptions fantasy flim-flam. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, appearing at one of the hearings, said the budget proposal did not consider how new tax laws would impact government revenues and the deficit because the Trump administration did not have a detailed tax proposal. When the presidents budget was done, we were not ready to have a full-blown tax reform plan, Mnuchin said, adding that tax details would be worked out with Congress, then made public. A Treasury Department official said separately it would not help to publish details while talks with Congress were underway. Releasing a Green Book of tax policy proposals as we work towards comprehensive tax reform would contradict that effort, the Treasury official said in an email. The last Green Book was issued by the Obama administration in February 2016 and ran 283 pages. Past Green Books going back to 1990 are available on the Treasury Department website. As a candidate, Trump, in his 125th day in power, promised voters that he would work with Congress and seek passage in his first 100 days of massive tax reduction and simplification. He has not yet offered any tax legislation. On April 26, the administration released a one-page list of tax proposals summarized in 12 bullet points. Tuesdays budget repeated the one-page summary, including a proposal to end the estate tax on inheritances paid by a few wealthy Americans. Despite this policy position, the Trump budget included a projection of $328 billion in estate tax revenues for 2018-2027. Ive seen lots of tricky budgets before, but this may take the cake, said Democratic Senator Mark Warner. You assume abolishment of the so-called death tax, estate tax, but ... you still count the revenues from the estate and gift tax, which is kind of a tricky thing. I would call that double-counting.

The ACLU said in its filing that in recent weeks there have been a new series of hunger strikes at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention centers in Georgia, Oregon and Washington, adding hunger strikes have previously hit detention centers in Arizona, Florida, Louisiana and Texas. The suit comes as U.S. Republican President Donald Trump has promised a crackdown on illegal immigration and the Republican-dominated U.S. Congress this month agreed to fund an additional 5,300 detention beds for those suspected of illegally entering the country. The Trump administrations plans to expand detention and strip away existing structures for oversight of detention are likely to produce more protests both inside and outside the walls of detention facilities, the lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia said. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Jennifer Elzea said in an email: ICE is unable to comment on pending litigation. The lawsuit said detention center inmates have launched the hunger strikes over the past few years as a non-violent way to bring attention to what they see as a lack of access to bond hearings and inhumane conditions of confinement. The suit also said that some inmates who have previously launched hunger strikes were met with extraordinarily punitive responses. From April 1-22, an average of 36,235 immigrants were in detention per day, according to the most recent statistics provided by ICE. The White House in March requested bringing the total number of beds up to 45,700, saying the additional capacity was necessary to achieve the presidents goal of enhancing interior enforcement efforts and ending catch and release for those apprehended at the border. The agreement reached in Congress would increase the number of immigration detention beds to 39,324 from 34,000 currently, according to a summary provided by the House Appropriations Committee. In April, hundreds of detainees at an immigration detention center in Washington state began refusing meals in a hunger strike to protest conditions at the facility and delayed immigration hearings, activists said. The Geo Group Inc, the company that operates the Washington state facility and other detention centers around the United States, declined to comment on the lawsuit.

Republican Rand Paul and Democrats Chris Murphy and Al Franken introduced a resolution of disapproval in the Senate to force a vote on whether to block part of the sale. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee received formal notice of the pending sale on May 19. The Arms Export Control Act of 1976 allows a senator to force a vote on an arms sale, once Congress is formally notified of plans to go ahead. The same three senators introduced a similar resolution last year seeking to block the sale of $1.15 billion of tanks and other equipment to Saudi Arabia. That measure was defeated overwhelmingly. Saudi Arabia was the first stop on Trumps first international trip this week, and he marked the visit by announcing the arms deal in Riyadh on May 20. Saudi Arabia agreed to by $110 billion of U.S. arms, with options running as high as $350 billion over 10 years. The lawmakers aim to block about $500 million of the sale, the portion including precision-guided munitions and other offensive weapons. Given Saudi Arabias past support of terror, poor human rights record, and questionable tactics in its war in Yemen, Congress must carefully consider and thoroughly debate if selling them billions of dollars of arms is in our best national security interest at this time, Paul said in a statement. Members of the U.S. House of Representatives also took action on the planned sale on Thursday. Republican Representative Ted Yoho and Democrat Ted Lieu wrote to the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee asking for a hearing to review the sale of precision-guided munitions to Riyadh. Democratic President Barack Obamas administration suspended the planned sale of precision-guided munitions in December because of concerns over the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen and civilian casualties.

Democrat Adam Schiff and Republican Joe Wilson said their proposed North Korea Travel Control Act followed the detention of at least 17 Americans in North Korea in the past decade. North Korea has a record of using detained Americans to extract high-profile visits from the United States, with which it has no formal diplomatic relations. With increased tensions in North Korea, the danger that Americans will be detained for political reasons is greater than ever, the congressmen said in a statement. Given North Koreas demonstrated willingness to use American visitors as bargaining chips to extract high level meetings or concessions, it is appropriate for the United States to take steps to control travel to a nation that poses a real and present danger to American interests, they said. Four Americans are being held in North Korea as diplomatic tensions with Washington have heightened. Two of them, detained in the past month, are affiliated with a private university in the North Korean capital. A congressional source said the bill would ban tourist travel by Americans outright, while any other visits would require a special license from the Treasury Department, which is enforcing a wide range of sanctions on North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs.      North Korea this month asserted its sovereign right to ruthlessly punish U.S. citizens it has detained for crimes against the government. It said calling such arrests bargaining ploys was pure ignorance.

The financial industry insisted it was not done fighting to remove limits on the fees. Retailers were already looking to carry the fight to credit card fees. We are glad this fight is over, and are happy with our victory, said Austen Jensen with the Retail Industry Leaders Association. The banks should clearly know that this is over with. This debate is not over, said Rob Nichols, president and CEO of the American Bankers Association. The House had been considering a broad financial reform bill that included a repeal of the Durbin amendment, which established the limits on debit card fees. The limits were backed by Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois when the Dodd-Frank financial reform law was enacted in 2010. The effort to remove the card fee limits had drawn strong opposition in the House. Representative Jeb Hensarling, the bills author, announced Wednesday he would end the effort to eliminate the Durbin amendment because he did not want to see his entire finance bill upended. Ive said before that repeal of the Durbin amendment was the most contentious part of the bill among Republicans, he said in a statement. We wont let this one provision hinder passage of an important priority bill. The full House is expected to vote on Hensarlings bill in the coming weeks, but there is enough opposition in the Senate that it will probably not become law. The feud over government caps on the fees retailers pay when accepting debit cards has run red hot ever since the limits were imposed. With billions of dollars in revenue at stake, banks and retailers have battled nearly constantly in Washington. Retailers have argued the cap is critical to control sky-high costs imposed by a handful of card servicers, while banks insist the limit represents government meddling in private industry. Nichols said limiting debit card fees was wrong and Congress should fix it. Under Dodd-Frank, the Federal Reserve was ordered to set limits on how much Visa and Mastercard could charge for processing debit card transactions. The end result nearly halved fees received by banks, dropping the cost of a debit card transaction from an average of 45 cents to an average of 24 cents.

The leaders discussed ... shared challenges in fighting global terrorism, the White House said in a statement.  They agreed on the need to work together to deepen our security cooperation in fighting ISIS (Islamic State), combating radicalisation and responding to other common threats. In talks before a summit of NATO leaders at the Atlantic military alliances headquarters across town, an EU source said Trump had also voiced fears that Brexit could cost U.S. jobs  a possible sign of second thoughts on support for the British vote to leave which stunned the bloc.  And Trump also agreed to setting up a joint EU-U.S. action plan on trade, in an indication the new occupant of the White House is not as set on shunning free trade deals and promoting protectionism as some in Europe had feared he might. The White House said the United States and the European Union should deepen our strong economic relationship and spoke of a need to protect U.S. and EU industries from unfair competition  a shared concern coming, notably, from China. Nonetheless, European Council President Donald Tusk indicated, there was less than a meeting of minds on trade and other issues, despite the cordiality of Trumps welcome. We agreed on many areas, first and foremost on counter-terrorism, Tusk said after he and EU chief executive Jean-Claude Juncker met Trump for over an hour.  But some issues remain open, like climate and trade. European leaders have been urging Trump not to abandon the U.S. commitment to cutting greenhouse gas emissions made when his predecessor Barack Obama signed up to the U.N. Paris accord. Tusk also said he did not feel he and Trump were on exactly the same page in terms of dealing with Russian President Vladimir Putin, although they agreed on efforts to end conflict in Ukraine which the West blames on Moscow and which has resulted in both EU and U.S. economic sanctions on Russia. A spokeswoman for Juncker, the president of the European Commission which had been negotiating an ambitious free trade deal with Washington known as TTIP before Trumps upset election victory, said the two sides would work to increase trade. Intensifying trade cooperation ... is a win-win situation for both sides, the EU spokeswoman said. It was agreed to start work on a joint action plan on trade. Juncker declined comment on whether talks in the coming weeks might revive TTIP. Trump has made clear his dislike of multilateral trade agreements, pulling out of the TPP agreement with Asian states. However, European leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, have suggested he is warming to trade talks with the EU, which unifies trade rules for all 28 states. Trump irritated EU leaders during his election campaign last year by hailing Brexit and suggesting other countries might follow Britain out of the 28-nation bloc. Eurosceptic leaders said he would offer Britain a free trade deal once it left. However, EU officials believe Trump has come to appreciate more since taking office the value of European integration to U.S. interests. U.S. businesses have taken advantage of its single market to reduce the costs of exporting to Europe. An EU source said Trump had told Tusk and Juncker he was now worried that Americans may lose jobs as a result of Britain leaving the EU in 2019: He expressed concern that jobs in the U.S. would be lost because of Brexit, the source said. EU officials said the meeting had been constructive and friendly. Tusk and Juncker joked with Trump about the EU having two presidents and being too complicated. The U.S. leader appeared to mix the two of them up during remarks in January, deepening concerns in Brussels that the reality TV star in the White House failed to take the European Union seriously. Trump waxed lyrical about his first foreign trip, which has offered distraction to ethics questions at home, notably over alleged campaign ties to Russia. Pope Francis is terrific, Trump told Tusk and Juncker, and his welcome in Saudi Arabia was beyond anything anyones ever seen. Tusk, a Communist-era dissident who once listed Trump among risks to the world order alongside Russia, China and Islamist violence, said he had tried to impress on the billionaire U.S. president a need for Transatlantic cooperation to promote values like human rights and not just selfish interests. The White House said the meeting had reaffirmed the strong bond between the United States and Europe, anchored in shared values and longstanding friendship.

The first lady, a Slovenian-born former model, toured a museum dedicated to Belgian surrealist painter Rene Magritte in the company of wives of other national leaders who were attending a summit of the NATO military alliance across town. Famed for works like the 1964 self-portrait of a bowler-hatted man whose face is hidden by an apple or the image of a pipe subtitled Ceci nest pas une pipe (This is not a pipe), Magritte has much to teach the world about questioning outward appearances, and about self-effacement, Belgian organisers said. You never know, museum director Michel Draguet said ahead of the first ladys visit. Maybe Donald Trump will move from one kind of surrealism to another, thanks to Magrittes ideas. The outspoken 70-year-old wealthy businessman and TV celebrity stunned many U.S. allies by entering the White House in January. He has broken a mould among world leaders with a style that offers little evidence of self-doubt and ideas that run counter to received wisdom among Western diplomats.     His 47-year-old third wife was joined by other NATO spouses including the devoutly Muslim wife of Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan; Brigitte Trogneux, who met Emmanuel Macron when she taught the new French president in school; and Gauthier Destenay, who is married to Luxembourgs gay prime minister. Speaking later, curator Draguet said Melania Trump showed great interest in surrealisms free spirit and invention. Trumps first foreign tour, which has so far taken him to Riyadh, Jerusalem and Rome and will end this weekend at a G7 summit in Sicily, has been presented by aides as reassuring allies that Washington remains a reliable partner under a head of state who faces a series of ethics questions back home. For Charles Michel, the 41-year-old premier whose partner showed the group around Brussels, an itinerary that also took in tea with Belgiums queen was also a chance to show those close to power a host country keen to punch above its weight.

Senator Bob Corker said the panel could move forward on sanctions after hearing from U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Some members of the committee, particularly Democrats, had wanted to act more quickly on sanctions over Russian activities that U.S. intelligence agencies concluded were intended to help get Republican Donald Trump elected. Corker said he expects Tillerson to report to the committee within weeks about the Trump administrations policy toward Russia and the situation in Syria. Corker said he would be willing to consider a sanctions bill soon after that if, as he expected, Tillerson does not demonstrate to the panel that there has been significant change by Russia in Syria, where Moscow has been supporting President Bashar al-Assad in that countrys six-year-old civil war. Ive committed to mark up Russia sanctions legislation in the event, the probable event, that the secretary of state cannot show us that theres a change of trajectory, Corker said at a committee business meeting. A mark up is a session in which a committee debates legislation and possible amendments. Later in the meeting, the panel overwhelmingly passed legislation to condemn Russian activities including its effort to influence other countries elections, aggression in Ukraine and support for Assad. That measure did not include sanctions. Corker and other senators had suggested it would be prudent to wait on sanctions at a delicate time in dealings with Moscow, especially over Syria. Democrats were not pleased at the delay, but said they were willing to wait to hear from the Trump administration. I do look forward to Mr. Tillerson explaining to us the administrations Russian policy and what he has seen its impact to be, said Senator Ben Cardin, the committees senior Democrat. If the panel eventually approves sanctions legislation, it would require passage in the full Senate and the House of Representatives before it could go to Trump to sign into law. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in January that Moscow tried to tilt the 2016 election in Trumps favor, including by hacking into the emails of senior Democrats. Russia has denied the allegation. Trump has denied any collusion between his campaign and Moscow, but Federal Bureau of Investigation and congressional probes into the matter have dogged the early months of his presidency. Democratic Senator Chris Murphy said it gives many committee members great pause that the Trump administration has not acted against Russia for its efforts to influence the election.

The umbrella Trump Organization sent a pamphlet to the general managers at each hotel, golf course, social club, and winery owned or operated by Trump, saying it would only donate profits from guests who declare they represent foreign governments. The pamphlet was sent to the House of Representatives Oversight and Reform Committee in response to a request for information on how the Trump Organization was fulfilling the pledge Trump made in January.  Putting forth a policy that requires all guests to identify themselves would impede upon personal privacy and diminish the guest experience of our brand, said the pamphlet. The Trump Organization, Trumps lawyer, Sheri Dillon, and the White House did not respond to requests for comment.  Dillon announced at a January press conference that Trump would voluntarily donate all profits from foreign government payments made to his properties to the Treasury. Payments from foreign governments to businesses that profit Trump have drawn criticism from constitutional and ethics experts who say they put Trump in violation of the U.S. Constitutions ban on the president receiving emoluments from foreign governments.  Emoluments are typically defined in this context as funds or gifts of value. Seven Democratic lawmakers on the House Judiciary Committee sent the Republican president a letter on Wednesday asking for a detailed account of any benefits or rewards, financial or otherwise he received from foreign governments since he took office on Jan. 20.  The Kuwaiti and Azerbaijani governments have already hosted events at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. In March, the Government Accountability Office said it would check whether Trump has made any payments to the U.S. Treasury from profits at his hotels.  The Trump Organization pamphlet identified other entities through which foreign governments may operate, such as state-owned aerospace, defense, banking, finance, healthcare, and energy business entities. Those entities may not be reasonably identifiable as foreign government entities, and therefore may not be included in our calculation of profit to be donated, the pamphlet read. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the congressional committee that received the pamphlet, said in a response to the Trump Organization that its method for identifying foreign government payments was deficient. Cummings said foreign powers would still be able to provide unconstitutional emoluments to Trump through entities that are funded and controlled but not openly affiliated with foreign governments. Those payments would not be tracked in any way and would be hidden from the American public, Cummings wrote.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The Gallatin County sheriffs office issued the citation for misdemeanor assault hours after Ben Jacobs, a political correspondent for the U.S. edition of the Guardian newspaper, said in a Twitter post and in a television interview that Gianforte body slammed him, breaking his eyeglasses. The incident, which caps a campaign seen as a possible bellwether for next years mid-term congressional races, took place at an event in Bozeman, where Jacobs sought to question Gianforte about healthcare, according to an audio tape captured by Jacobs and played on cable television networks MSNBC and CNN. Fox News Channel reporter Alicia Acuna, who said she and her crew were in the room preparing to interview Gianforte, wrote that she saw Gianforte as he grabbed Jacobs by the neck with both hands and slammed him to the ground. Acuna, her field producer and photographer then watched in disbelief as Gianforte began punching (Jacobs) as he moved to top of the reporter. Gianfortes campaign did not deny Jacobs allegation but countered in its own statement that Jacobs instigated an altercation by barging into the candidates office, shoved a recording device in his face and began asking badgering questions. After asking Jacobs to lower the recorder, Jacobs declined, campaign spokesman Shane Scanlon wrote. Greg then attempted to grab the phone that was pushed in his face. Jacobs grabbed Gregs wrist and spun away from Greg, pushing them both to the ground. Its unfortunate that this aggressive behavior from a liberal journalist created this scene at our campaign volunteer BBQ, the statement said. Acuna disputed that Jacobs was the aggressor. At no point did any of us who witnessed this assault see Jacobs show any form of physical aggression toward Gianforte, Acuna wrote in her account on the Fox News website.  Interviewed later on MSNBC, Jacobs said he retreated to a parking lot after the confrontation to call his editor and the police. He said he was speaking to MSNBC from a hospital where he was getting his elbow X-rayed. The citation was issued after authorities conducted several interviews and investigated the incident, Sheriff Brian Gootkin said in a statement.  Gianforte has until June 7 to appear in a county court. He faces a $500 fine and six months in jail if convicted, according to Gootkin.  The nature of the injuries did not meet the statutory elements of felony assault, Gootkin said.   In Jacobs audio tape of the incident, Gianforte is heard shouting: Im sick and tired of you guys. The last guy who came here, you did the same thing.  After loud scuffling noises are heard, Gianforte repeatedly yells: Get the hell out of here. Jacobs is heard saying: You just body-slammed me and broke my glasses.  According to the tape, the confrontation began as Jacobs tried to ask Gianforte if he supported a Republican healthcare overhaul bill after the Congressional Budget Office found the measure would cost 23 million Americans their medical insurance coverage by 2026.  Another reporter, Alexis Levinson of BuzzFeed News, who was just outside the office, said on Twitter she saw Jacobs feet fly in the air as he hit the floor amid yelling and commotion. Gianforte later huddled behind closed doors with an aide before leaving the event by car, she said. Tech executive Gianforte is running against Democrat Rob Quist, a banjo-playing political novice who hopes to pull off a surprise victory in the Republican-leaning state.  A victory for Quist could signal trouble ahead for President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans as they defend their 24-seat House majority in the 2018 mid-term elections. Quist and Gianforte are vying for the seat vacated when Trump, who carried Montana by more than 20 percentage points, named Ryan Zinke as U.S. interior secretary. Republicans have held the seat for two decades and Gianforte was still the favorite. However, both sides say the race was tightening as Quist focused on criticism of Republican efforts to repeal and replace former Democratic President Barack Obamas signature healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare.

U.S. congressional committees and a special counsel named by the Justice Department this month are investigating whether there was Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and the possibility of collusion between Trumps campaign and Russia. The controversy has engulfed Trumps young administration since he fired FBI Director James Comey two weeks ago amid the agencys investigation of possible Russia ties. Moscow has repeatedly denied the allegations and Trump denies any collusion. The New York Times report was the latest indication of the depth of concerns within the U.S. intelligence community about Russian efforts to tip Novembers election toward Trump as he battled Democrat Hillary Clinton. On May 18, Reuters reported that Flynn and other advisers to Trumps campaign were in contact with Russian officials and others with Kremlin ties in at least 18 calls and emails during the last seven months of the 2016 presidential race, citing current and former U.S. officials.     On Tuesday, former CIA Director John Brennan told lawmakers he had noticed contacts between associates of Trumps campaign and Russia during the campaign and grew concerned Moscow had sought to lure Americans down a treasonous path.

Others discussed leveraging their ties to Viktor Yanukovych, the deposed president of Ukraine living in exile in Russia, who at one time had worked closely with Manafort, who was dismissed from Trumps campaign, the newspaper reported. Separately, Carter Page, a former foreign policy adviser to Trumps presidential campaign, told Reuters via text message that he would testify before the House Intelligence Committee but was still working out details. Nothing (is) fully confirmed at this stage, Page wrote, adding that if invited, he would also testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee, but had yet to receive such a request. ABC News, which first reported on Pages planned testimony, said he would testify before the House panel on June 6. A spokesman for the committee declined comment on whether Page would testify. In a letter to the panel seen by Reuters, Page accused Brennan of offering a biased viewpoint in Tuesdays testimony. On Wednesday morning, the top Democrat on the committee said it would subpoena Flynn in its probe into alleged Russian meddling in the presidential election after he declined to appear before the panel. We will be following up with subpoenas, and those subpoenas will be designed to maximize our chance of getting the information that we need, Representative Adam Schiff told journalists at a breakfast sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor. The leaders of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee said on Tuesday they would subpoena two of Flynns businesses after he declined to hand over documents in its separate Russia probe. Flynn, a retired general, is a key witness in the Russia investigations because of his ties to Moscow.  He was fired from his position at the White House in February, after less than a month on the job, for failing to disclose the content of talks with Sergei Kislyak, Russias ambassador to the United States, and misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bill passed by U.S. House Republicans would cause 23 million people to lose healthcare coverage by 2026 while de-stabilizing health insurance markets in some states and making it hard for sick people to buy insurance, a budget watchdog agency said on Wednesday. The Congressional Budget Office, a non-partisan group of experts who analyze U.S. legislation, said the bill would reduce federal deficits by $119 billion between 2017 and 2026. The report could give added ammunition to Democrats who have accused President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans of putting sick and low-income people at risk with their effort to roll back former President Barack Obamas signature 2010 healthcare law, formally known as the Affordable Care Act but often called Obamacare. The report also complicates the job of Senate Republicans - some of whom already have doubts about the House bill - as they craft their own healthcare legislation. Republicans have sought to unravel Obamacare since its passage and Trump promised on the campaign trail to repeal it, saying it is too costly and an overreach by government in the healthcare market. As Trump and Republican leaders sought to bring wavering lawmakers on board with the House bill, they added a controversial last-minute amendment that would give states leeway to drop an Obamacare requirement that forces insurers to charge sick and healthy people the same insurance rates. Another change would allow states to decide whether to require insurers to cover health benefits such as maternity care and prescription drugs that are mandatory under current law. But the CBO report said the amendment would make it difficult or impossible for people in poor health to purchase comprehensive coverage in some states. People who are less healthy (including those with preexisting or newly acquired medical conditions) would ultimately be unable to purchase comprehensive non-group health insurance at premiums comparable to those under current law, if they could purchase it at all, the CBO report said. The CBO said markets for people to buy individual insurance plans could then become unstable in states that choose to waive the Obamacare requirements for coverage of pre-existing medical conditions and essential health benefits. Even before the report, many Republican senators were wary of the House version of the healthcare bill, saying it unraveled Obamacare too much and too quickly. About 20 million people gained insurance under Obamacare. The House bill would eliminate most Obamacare taxes that help subsidize private health coverage for individuals, roll back the governments Medicaid health plan for the poor and disabled and replace the laws income-based tax credits for buying medical coverage with credits based on age. A group of 13 Republican senators led by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is expected to draft its own version of the healthcare bill in the coming months. McConnell, however, told Reuters on Wednesday he does not yet know how Republicans will get the necessary votes. This is a very challenging undertaking, McConnell said.    After the release of the CBO report, several Republican senators said they could not support the House bill. While I am in favor of repealing Obamacare, I am opposed to the American Health Care Act in its current form, Republican Senator Dean Heller said in a statement. Republican Senator Susan Collins said too many people would lose insurance and that older and low-income Americans would be hurt. House Republicans, who argue their healthcare bill would allow insurance markets to function more efficiently, focused on the projected budget savings from it and a finding in the CBO report that said insurance premiums for some people would decline. Groups representing hospitals, insurers and doctors who opposed the House bill said the CBO report showed the Senate should start fresh with an eye to maintaining coverage and benefits. Democrats also blasted the bill and said the CBO report proved it would be catastrophic for millions of people who would lose health insurance. The report makes clear Trumpcare would be a cancer on the American healthcare system, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said at a news conference. The new CBO score predicts the AHCA would cover 1 million more Americans than Republicans previous version of the bill, which the agency estimated would have left 24 million more people uninsured than Obamacare in 2026. To allay concerns about coverage of people with pre-existing illnesses, House Republicans allocated an additional $8 billion over five years in their bill to help sick people pay for insurance premiums but the CBO said the money would not be enough to help them afford coverage. The CBO said premiums would fall for younger people and rise for older people in states that did not waive Obamacare requirements for an overall decline of about 4 percent. In states that made moderate changes to their markets, representing about one-third of the U.S. population, premiums would fall 20 percent on average. Reaction on Wall Street was muted, with shares of hospitals affected by the cuts to Medicaid, like Community Health Systems, and health insurers specializing in Medicaid, such as Molina Healthcare (MOH.N) and Centene Corp (CNC.N)unchanged in light after-hours trading. The Republicans first attempt at undoing Obamacare this year resulted in a setback for the Trump agenda in March. Conservative and moderate Republican factions in the House were opposed to the initial legislation and the leadership decided not to put it up for a vote.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the U.S. Senate, says he could live without the drama surrounding President Donald Trumps White House, but from a policy standpoint sees the new commander-in-chief as a solid ally in the mode of any president from his party. McConnell told Reuters that he finds Trump accessible and that they talk regularly, even more frequently than he spoke to the last Republican president, George W. Bush. While McConnell would not discuss the substance of their conversations, he said the two are able to be frank with one another without it damaging their relationship. We have a good relationship. Hes never, as far as I can tell, gotten angry at me - in my presence, anyway. We have a good working relationship, McConnell said during a roundtable with Reuters reporters on Wednesday. McConnell, who last week said he hoped to see less drama from the White House, said that Trump does not always take his advice. He knows, as you all know, that Ive not been a fan of the tweets and the extracurricular comments. I said last week we could do with a little less drama, McConnell said. Cracking a grin, he added, The reason Im smiling - obviously, hes disinclined to take my advice on some things. But it has not impaired the ability to communicate and convey my opinion, which I do frequently. In matters of style, McConnell and Trump are a study in contrasts. The Senate majority leader is a taciturn traditionalist steeped in the ways of Washington, after more than three decades in Congress. Trump, a real estate magnate and reality TV celebrity who had never held public office until he assumed the presidency in January, airs his views regularly on Twitter and has vowed to drain what he calls the swamp of the U.S. capital. McConnell declined to say if he had advised Trump to speak less about the controversy dogging the administration: questions about whetherassociates of Trump colluded with alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, and concerns about Trumps abrupt dismissal of FBI Director James Comey as the agency was probing the Russia matter. On questions concerning Russia, McConnell stuck to his script. I think all of that is going to be handled by the special counsel and the Senate intelligence committee, and Im confident in their ability to do the job, he said, referring to a special counsel appointed by the Justice Department last week, and to one of several congressional panels probing the Russia issue. Some Republican lawmakers and lobbyists worry the issue will slow legislative plans. Republicans have yet to chalk up significant legislative achievements despite being in control of the White House and both chambers of Congress. But McConnell said he and Trump are aligned in putting an overhaul of Obamacare and a rewrite of the tax code at the top of their agenda. McConnell acknowledged there had been doubts within his party during the 2016 campaign about what Trump would do in the White House. This was a guy who was giving fund-raisers for (Senate Democratic leader) Chuck Schumer four or five years ago, McConnell said. But McConnell, whose wife Elaine Chao is a member of Trumps cabinet as transportation secretary, said he sees Trump as someone who has embraced Republican orthodoxy. In other words, what the administration is doing, not only am I comfortable with it, but I think the vast majority of Republicans in Congress feel that this is a right-of-center presidency, which is what we had hoped for, he said. If you look at what the president is actually for, it strikes me as indistinguishable from what a President Jeb Bush or a President Marco Rubio would have been advocating: deregulation, tax reform, repeal and replace of Obamacare, judges like Neil Gorsuch, McConnell said. Trumps relationship with Congress has been boosted by the frequent and very significant presence of Vice President Mike Pence in the halls of Capitol Hill, McConnell said, describing Pences role as serious value-added. He is, in my view, kind of the de facto congressional relations guy for the administration, he said, noting Pence, a former Indiana governor and Republican congressman, has strong relationships on the Hill. McConnell described Pence as playing a similar role with Congress as Vice President Dick Cheney did during the George W. Bush administration: listening and sometimes weighing in on discussions about healthcare and tax reform. Its been really helpful because members feel like they can go over and whisper in his ear about whatever their particular problem is, and something will be done about it, because theyve kind of elevated it to a higher level, McConnell said.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury is reviewing licenses for Boeing Co and Airbus to sell aircraft to Iran, department head Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday, telling lawmakers he would increase sanctions pressure on Iran, Syria and North Korea. We will use everything within our power to put additional sanctions on Iran, Syria and North Korea to protect American lives, Mnuchin said in testimony to the House Ways and Means Committee. I can assure you thats a big focus of mine and I discuss it with the president. Mnuchin did not elaborate on the review of the licenses, which were issued under a 2015 agreement between Tehran and world powers to lift sanctions in return for curbs on Irans nuclear activities. His statements followed President Donald Trumps Middle East trip, in which he called on Iran to stop funding terrorists and militias. The review suggests that Trumps support for Boeings defense and jetliner businesses could have political limits. Iran has accused Washington of supporting terrorism by backing rebels in Syria and says halting the airplane deals would breach the 2015 nuclear agreement. Mnuchin told the Ways and Means hearing that sanctions really work and were responsible for bringing Iran to the negotiating table ahead of the nuclear deal.  For Boeing, losing the IranAir deal could affect 777 production, since 15 of the widebody jetliners are included in the first approved batch of Boeing aircraft due for delivery to IranAir by 2020. Deliveries start in May next year.  Boeing said in December it would cut 777 output by 40 percent this year under plans that include IranAirs still-tenative order. IranAir has agreed to buy 200 U.S. and European passenger aircraft worth up to $37 billion at list prices, though such deals typically include big discounts.    They include 80 jets from Boeing, 100 from Airbus and 20 turboprops from Franco-Italian ATR. All the aircraft need U.S. licenses because of their reliance on U.S. parts. Boeing continues to follow the lead of the U.S. government with regards to working with Irans airlines, and any and all contracts with Irans airlines are contingent upon U.S. government approval, a spokeswoman said by email. An Airbus spokesman had no immediate comment. In its first business with the Islamic Republic since U.S. President Donald Trump took office vowing a tougher stance on Iran in January, Boeing last month announced a tentative deal to sell 30 jets to Iran Aseman Airlines, its third-largest carrier. Boeing said it would apply for licenses for the deal. People involved in the deals say the Treasury has so far issued licenses for the main contracts between Western suppliers  and IranAir, but that many need to be renewed beyond 2020. IranAir does not need further approvals to take delivery of the first 70 or so aircraft, they say, though legal experts have said the U.S. Treasury can withdraw licenses at any time. About a third of the Airbus jets, or some 37, also are due to arrive by 2020, including three already delivered. IranAir last week took delivery of four ATR turboprops and plans to take the remaining 16 next year.  Even with licenses in place, bankers say talks between Iran and Western banks to fund deliveries of the aircraft have been disrupted by concerns that sanctions could be reintroduced or that banks could be penalized for dealing with Iran.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""BRUSSELS (Reuters) - He still has a chance for missteps, but so far on his maiden international trip, Donald Trump has managed to avoid major stumbles and has stuck to the script in a way his advisers have wanted him to do for months.  The U.S. presidents rare display of discipline is in part a result of a desperate need for some smooth sailing. He began the trip in scandal mode, accused of impeding justice by firing former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey for not stopping a federal probe into his campaigns Russia ties.   Whether it will hold is unclear. He is in a portion of his nine-day trip, in Brussels for a NATO summit and later in Sicily for a Group of Seven conclave, where he will meet with European leaders who are at sharp odds with him on many issues.  Trumps change comes after increasingly loud alarm bells sounded from Republican congressional leaders, who say he must tamp down the tirades and tantrums that have contributed to a dismal public approval rating of about 38 percent.  Just in the past month alone, Trump used Twitter to issue a veiled threat to Comey, warning that he better hope that there are no tapes of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press! And when he fired Comey, White House aides said the move was based on a Justice Department recommendation that said Comey had mishandled the investigation into Democrat Hillary Clintons handling of classified information last year. Trump blew up that reason the next day, saying he had already decided to fire Comey when the Justice recommendation came in because the FBI man was a showboat. Trumps advisers planned the overseas journey trip in such a way as to keep the president busy with back-to-back meetings and appearances. This has given him little time for tweet storms and cable news watching. It sometimes has left him fatigued, as manifested when he canceled an evening forum with young people in Riyadh.  As they normally do when he travels, staff members have managed to provide him with some creature comforts, like keeping bags of potato chips at easy reach.  The president has limited his interactions with reporters, taking few questions. As a result, the Russia issue came up only once  during a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  Initial plans for an end-of-the-trip news conference in Sicily have been set aside, meaning there are fewer chances for him to veer off script, but less opportunity to promote his achievements. When Trump has talked to the news media, his responses to questions have been fairly brief and non-substantive. Asked about his meeting with Pope Francis on Wednesday at the Vatican, Trump kept it simple despite the differences between him and Francis on issues like climate change.  Great...We had a fantastic meeting...We are liking Italy very much, and it was an honor to meet with the pope, Trump said.  He has also reined in some of his hyperbole.After boasting earlier this year that finding a peace agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians should not be all that hard, Trump acknowledged that maybe it would be hard after all.   Iveheard its one of the toughest deals of all, he said. But I have a feeling were going to get there eventually. I hope.  Aides said most every word spoken was written carefully with some thought of the message that would be sent. Most speeches were performed with a Teleprompter to keep Trump from drifting off into his own ad libs.  He understands that even the slightest phrasing can have big implications, said a senior White House official. Hes worked really hard on being directly involved in the preparation.  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters that behind the scenes, Trump has been calibrating his style to fit the leader who he is meeting and the urgency of the issue he is discussing.  He tends to dial the urgency up and therefore the style dials up, Tillerson, noting that when talking to Israeli and Palestinian leaders, He was very energized because he does feel theres a certain sense of urgency for these parties to finally get on with it. Trump has been on script before only to lapse. Privately, aides realize this could happen again.  He is who he is, one aide said. Hes definitely someone who speaks his mind.  Trump has found himself on this trip increasingly reliant on a core group of his inner circle: Son-in-law Jared Kushner, a top White House adviser; daughter Ivanka, who is Kushners wife; Secretary of State Rex Tillerson; economic adviser Gary Cohn; national security adviser H.R. McMaster and deputy national security adviser for strategy, Dina Powell.  The more disciplined Trump was a victory for Kushner, who organized the trip around some specific objectives, such as a $110 billion arms deal for Saudi Arabia and Trumps visit to holy sites in Israel, including his visit to the Western Wall, a first for a U.S. president.   Were very focused on the substance of the actions and then ultimately on delivering results, said a senior administration official. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"
"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Wednesday he does not yet know how Republicans will amass the votes needed to pass legislation now being crafted to dismantle Obamacare, but expressed some optimism on another top priority, overhauling the tax code. In an exclusive interview with Reuters, McConnell said healthcare and taxes still top the Republican legislative agenda, and he added that he will not reach out to the minority Democrats on either one because differences between the two parties are too stark. McConnell also said he has not asked the White House for input as the Senate devises its own healthcare legislation after the Republican-led House of Representatives passed its version on May 4, but may do so in the future. Excluding Democratic involvement will leave McConnell, a conservative 75-year-old Kentuckian with a reputation as a dealmaker, a narrow path to win passage of these ambitious goals, which are also at the head of Republican President Donald Trumps policy agenda. A repeal of Obamacare was one of Trumps leading campaign promises last year. Asked about behind-the-scenes work among Senate Republicans on hammering out the provisions of a healthcare bill, McConnell said, I dont know how we get to 50 (votes) at the moment. But thats the goal. And exactly what the composition of that (bill) is Im not going to speculate about because it serves no purpose, McConnell said. Republicans hold a 52-48 Senate majority. In the event of a 50-50 tie, Republican Vice President Mike Pence would be called upon to cast a tie-breaking vote. McConnell opened the interview by saying, Theres not a whole lot of news to be made on healthcare. He declined to discuss what provisions he might want to see in the bill or provide a timetable for producing even a draft to show to rank-and-file Republican senators and gauge their support. On the other hand, he said, prospects for passage of major tax legislation were pretty good. While this too will be difficult, McConnell said, it is not in my view quite as challenging as healthcare. Trump and his fellow Republicans in Congress want to cut tax rates across the board, but a House proposal to use the tax code to boost exports and discourage imports has split the business community and some lawmakers. The House narrowly passed its legislation to overhaul the healthcare system and dismantle major parts of the Obamacare law, formally called the Affordable Care Act, that was Democratic former President Barack Obamas signature legislative achievement, overcoming unified opposition from Democrats. On Wednesday, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the House-passed bill would result in 23 million people losing health insurance coverage by 2026, a sobering figure for Senate Republicans as they mull action. The CBO also said federal budget deficits would fall by $119 billion over 10 years under that bill. Asked if he was getting any guidance from the White House on healthcare legislation, McConnell said, Honestly I havent asked for any. I told the president there would be a point at which we might well want him and the vice president to be helpful. McConnell said Trump and Pence could play an important role when it comes to whipping up support for whatever bill is produced. If the Senate passes a healthcare bill, lawmakers would have to work out the differences in the House and Senate versions and pass a compromise bill before it could go to Trump for his signature. With Republicans holding a slim Senate majority, McConnell likely needs the cooperation and support of hard-line conservative Republicans such as Senator Ted Cruz who in the past have been difficult to corral. Cruz is a member of a working group within the Senate in charge of crafting the Senate Obamacare repeal legislation. Im grateful that he wants to help us get an outcome here, McConnell said. Republicans face a tricky balancing act. Because they cannot expect any Democratic support and have a razor-thin majority, they must devise legislation that appeals not only to the most conservative senators but also does not drive off many Republican moderates. Since it became law in 2010, Republicans have railed against Obamacare, arguing that it is too expensive and involves the government too deeply in Americans healthcare decisions. They have said they want to replace it with a program that repeals most Obamacare taxes, reduces federal spending in the Medicaid insurance program for the poor and leaves more decisions up to the states. McConnell in the past has promised to undo Obamacare root and branch. Now that Republicans are in a position to do so with control of both Congress and the White House, they have struggled to come up with a consensus plan. The Republican leader compared the effort to solving a Rubiks Cube. Many Senate Republicans have misgivings about the House-passed legislation, which Democrats have said would deprive millions of people of insurance, benefit the wealthy and roll back Obamacare protections such as guaranteed coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. McConnell made clear that senators are writing their own bill, saying, Were working on a separate approach. In taking a Republican-only approach to healthcare and taxes, McConnell said of Democrats, Theyre not interested in doing what were interested in doing. McConnell expressed optimism two parties can band together to pass legislation funding the federal government in the fiscal year starting on Oct. 1. He also noted good prospects for bipartisanship on a bill to expand sanctions against Iran, due for debate in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee this week, and renewal of a Food and Drug Administration user-fee program that expires later this year.

The Trump proposal cuts about a third from U.S. diplomacy and aid budgets, or nearly $19 billion. This includes cutting some $1 billion from a U.N. peacekeeping funding and a steep cut to funding for international organizations. The United States is the biggest U.N. contributor, paying 22 percent of the $5.4 billion core budget and 28.5 percent of the $7.9 billion peacekeeping budget. These assessed contributions are agreed by the 193-member U.N. General Assembly. The figures presented would simply make it impossible for the U.N. to continue all of its essential work advancing peace, development, human rights and humanitarian assistance, Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said in a statement. Congress sets the federal government budget, and Republicans who control both houses and Democrats have said they do not support such drastic cuts. Trump has said the U.S. share of the U.N. budgets was unfair. The General Assembly is currently negotiating the peacekeeping budget from July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018 and will later this year negotiate the next U.N. regular budget. Trump wants to cap the U.S. peacekeeping contribution at 25 percent. The United States is reviewing each of the 16 U.N. peacekeeping missions as the annual mandates come up for renewal by the Security Council in a bid to cut costs. During a lunch with U.N. Security Council ambassadors at the White House last month, Trump described the U.S. contributions to the United Nations as peanuts compared to the important work as he pushed the world body to reform. The Secretary-General is totally committed to reforming the United Nations, Dujarric said. We stand ready to discuss with the United States and any other member state how best we can create a more cost-effective organization to pursue our shared goals and values. Trumps budget proposal included a 44 percent cut to funding for international organizations, but does not specify the cuts, other than funding for organizations that work against U.S. foreign policy interests. The State Department said last month it was ending funding for the U.N. Population Fund, an agency focused on family planning and maternal and child health in more than 150 countries. Guterres warned the cut could have devastating effects. U.N. agencies such as the U.N. Development Program (UNDP), the childrens agency UNICEF, and the U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA), are funded by governments voluntarily. In 2016, the United States was the top contributor to the UNDPs core budget, with an $83 million donation; the leading donor to UNICEFs core budget in 2015 with $132 million; and the fourth-largest donor to the UNFPA, giving $75 million.

In vetoing the measure to decriminalize possession of small amounts of the drug for adults and to pave the way for a regulated market in the state, Republican Governor Phil Scott stressed he was not philosophically opposed to the concept, which he said he views through a libertarian lens. But in an effort to get it right, he said the bill needs to improve protections for children and motorists. I want to reiterate that we can all work together on this issue in a thoughtful and responsible way, the governor said at his weekly news conference in Montpelier. Scott said the bill should make clear that there will be no change in current penalties for giving or selling the drug to minors under 21 or near schools, and it should have stiffer penalties for smoking marijuana while driving or in front of children. The Marijuana Regulatory Commission the bill would create needs to include police, health and tax collecting representatives, and should be responsible for coming up with impairment limits for drivers, testing mechanisms, and education and prevention programs for minors, he added. If the legislature agrees to make the changes I am seeking, we can move this discussion forward in a way that ensures the public health and safety of our communities and our children continues to come first, said Scott. The Marijuana Policy Project, a pro-legalization group, said it was disappointed, but held out hope that the governor and legislators would reach a compromise. Most Vermonters want to end marijuana prohibition, and it is critical that the legislature respond by passing a revised legalization bill this summer, said Matt Simon, the groups New England political director.      The bill, which won the approval of the states House of Representatives 79-66 and the state Senate 20-9, both of which are controlled by Democrats, would have made Vermont the first state to legalize recreational marijuana legislatively, instead of by popular referendum. Of the eight states and the District of Columbia that have legalized recreational marijuana, two - Massachusetts and Maine - are nearby, while Canada, to Vermonts north, is considering legalization.

The brawl that erupted on May 16 between protesters and Turkish security personnel outside the Turkish ambassadors residence during Erdogans visit to meet U.S. President Donald Trump has caused a diplomatic dispute between the two NATO allies. At least 11 people were injured in the encounter, two so seriously they had to go to the hospital. Turkey blamed the violence on demonstrators linked to the militant Kurdistan Workers Party while Washingtons police chief described the incident as a brutal attack on peaceful protesters. The U.S. State Department said in a statement the conduct of Turkish security personnel during the incident was deeply disturbing. And the Turkish government summoned the U.S. ambassador in Ankara to discuss the violent incidents.  The congressional aide said the Foreign Affairs Committee would take up the resolution on Thursday.     ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Trump administration plan to sell off half the U.S. emergency crude oil stockpile to help balance the budget faces opposition in Congress, with lawmakers from both parties worried the proposal would undermine the drilling industry and make the country vulnerable to supply shocks.  The White Houses 2018 budget proposal, sent to Congress on Tuesday, proposes raising nearly $16.6 billion by 2027 by gradually selling millions of barrels from the reserve, which now holds about 688 million barrels of oil in underground caverns in Texas and Louisiana. News of the proposal had briefly sent oil prices tumbling on concern it would oversupply the market, but prices recovered and finished slightly higher on hopes that OPEC and other countries would extend supply cuts. We should not be selling oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve now, said Senator John Hoeven, a Republican from North Dakota, a leading oil producer state. We should use the SPR for emergencies, and selling now would disrupt the markets. The SPR sell-off plan is part of a broader White House proposal to balance the U.S. budget that is meant as starting point to debate policy with Congress - which will ultimately pass its own version.  Whether the SPR proposal will survive the budget process could depend in part on Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, a member of the appropriations committee and the head of the chambers energy panel. In 2015, when Congress was considering selling a modest amount of oil from the reserve to help fund a transportation bill, Murkowski opposed the idea, saying the reserve should not be used as an ATM.  Murkowski did not directly address the SPR plan in a statement on Tuesday, but she said a Presidents budget is more of a vision than anything else. Efforts to reach Murkowski on Tuesday were not successful. Murkowskis Democratic counterpart on the energy panel, however, raised concerns that liquidating half of the reserve would run counter to the original purpose of the facility, which Congress created in 1975 to protect against global oil disruptions that could harm the U.S. economy.  We are not going to let Donald Trump auction off our energy security to the highest bidder, Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington said in an email. The Arab oil embargo of the early 1970s led to chaos at U.S. filling stations and fears of long-term damage to the economy. Much has changed since then: U.S. oil production has surged in recent years and supply from Canada has increased, displacing a large portion of the imports from some less stable Middle Eastern suppliers. U.S. oil imports from the producer group OPEC have fallen to less than 3.2 million bpd in 2016 from more than 5.4 million barrels per day in 2008, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Richard Newell, a former head of the EIA, noted that the plan could cause the United States to break its obligation as a member of the International Energy Agency to hold 90 days worth of oil imports on reserve. Currently, the SPR holds about 145 days worth of oil imports.  There are a number of possible scenarios under which reducing the SPR to the levels proposed would violate our IEA treaty obligations, he said.  Lawmakers from both parties also said releasing oil from the SPR could dampen crude prices and hurt drilling companies still recovering from a price crash in 2014. Trump had campaigned on a promise to revive the drilling industry. Putting that much oil on the market, you will see a lot of layoffs in the energy business, said Representative Gene Green, a Democrat from Texas.  Mick Mulvaney, the head of the Office of Management and Budget told reporters on Tuesday, however, there are ways to tap the SPR slowly and telegraph it over the course of time to avoid having a dramatic impact on prices.  Representative Pete Olson, a Texas Republican, said the SPR infrastructure needs improvement because tanks and other equipment are constantly exposed to corrosive salt air. But he did not rush to embrace a sell-off of oil, saying that the larger budget deserves careful scrutiny. Some oil industry representatives also came out against the proposal. Randall Luthi, President of the National Ocean Industries Association said the plan to cut the SPR in half threatened national security. He added he also opposed a proposal in the budget to cut federal oil royalty payments to U.S. Gulf Coast states - funds meant to help them defend their coasts from hurricane damage.

Under clear blue skies, Trump received a tribute from the Swiss Guard in a Vatican courtyard when he arrived. He entered a small elevator taking him to the third floor of the Apostolic Palace and, after a long ceremonial walk past frescoed corridors, shook the popes hand at the entrance to the private study that the frugal pontiff uses only for official occasions. Before the door of the wood-lined elevator closed, a Vatican protocol official was heard quipping to the president that it was not like Trump Tower in New York. Francis smiled faintly as he greeted Trump outside the study and was not as outgoing as he sometimes is with visiting heads of state. Trump, seeming subdued, said, It is a great honor. Even when the two were sitting at the popes desk in the presence of photographers and reporters, the pope avoided the  small talk that usually occurs before the media is ushered out. The two spoke privately for about 30 minutes with translators. Both men looked far more relaxed at the end of the private meeting, with the pope smiling and joking with Trump and his wife Melania. Franciss interpreter could be heard translating a comment by the pope to the First Lady: What do you give him to eat? Francis then gave Trump a small sculptured olive tree and told him through the interpreter that it symbolized peace. It is my desire that you become an olive tree to construct peace, the Pope said, speaking in Spanish. Trump responded: We can use peace. Francis also gave Trump a signed copy of his 2017 peace message whose title is Nonviolence -  A Style of Politics for Peace, and a copy of his 2015 encyclical letter on the need to protect the environment from the effects of climate change. Well, Ill be reading them, Trump said. During his election campaign, Trump said scientific findings that human economic activity contributed to global warming were a hoax. As president, he has proposed deep cuts for the Environmental Protection Agency and the elimination of many environmental regulations. Trump gave the pope a boxed set of five first-edition books by murdered U.S. civil rights leader Martin Luther King. As Trump and the pope said goodbye at the door of the study, Trump told him: Thank you, thank you. I wont forget what you said. Asked how the meeting with the pope went, Trump said: Great. He is something. He is really good. We had a fantastic meeting. A Vatican statement said the meeting was cordial and that the Vatican hoped there could be serene collaboration between the U.S. government and the American Catholic Church, including assistance to immigrants. The U.S. Catholic Church hierarchy opposes Trumps attempt to cut federal assistance for cities that give sanctuary to illegal immigrants. It also opposes his plan to build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico. The pope said last year a man who thinks about building walls and not bridges is not Christian. Trump, who was a candidate at the time, responded that it was disgraceful of the Argentine-born pope, who represents just over half of the worlds two billion Christians, to question his faith. The meeting with the pope was the third stop on Trumps nine-day foreign tour, and part of his world tour of religions after meeting leaders of Muslim nations in Saudi Arabia and visiting holy sites in Jerusalem. Trump at first did not plan to stop in Rome during his visit to Europe, which some in the Vatican saw as a snub. When he changed his mind, the Vatican squeezed him in at 8:30 a.m. on a Wednesday morning, an unusual day and an unusually early time. He later flew to Brussels where he was to meet Belgiums king and prime minister on Wednesday evening before a day of meetings with European Union and NATO leaders on Thursday.

Fox Business Network and ABC first reported that Trump hired Marc Kasowitz, a New York-based trial lawyer known as a tenacious litigator, to represent him in a Justice Department investigation headed by former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Robert Mueller. The appointment of a private attorney may indicate that Trump is seriously considering the impact the federal investigation could have on him personally and that he may wish to protect himself should others in his administration turn against him. The source said Kasowitz is expected to bring other lawyers on to work as a team to protect Trump.  Other candidates for the job, including Brendan Sullivan and Robert Giuffra, withdrew their names from consideration, the source said.  He can be aggressive - hes got that in him for sure, said John Quinn of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart and Sullivan, who has worked with and opposite Kasowitz. He also can be smooth as silk, respectful and deferential.  Kasowitz and the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters. Kasowitz has represented Trump for more than 15 years but he is not known as a criminal defense lawyer. During last years presidential campaign, Kasowitz threatened to sue the New York Times if it did not retract a story about women who accused Trump of touching them inappropriately. The Times did not retract the story. He also assisted in the defense of fraud claims against Trump University, a series of real-estate seminars. After the election, Trump settled the claims for $25 million. Trump has looked to Kasowitzs firm to fill positions in his administration. He has described former Senator Joseph Lieberman, a senior counsel at the firm, as a top candidate to serve as FBI director and is considering Edward McNally, a white-collar defense lawyer at the firm, as the next U.S. attorney in Manhattan. A former partner at the firm, David Friedman, was chosen by Trump as U.S. ambassador to Israel. Kasowitz also represents OJSC Sberbank of Russia, the countrys largest bank, which is being accused in a U.S. federal court of conspiring with granite company executives and others to raid the assets of a competitor.  The outside counsel would be separate from the White House Counsels Office, led by Donald McGahn. Mueller was appointed as special counsel by the Justice Department last week to investigate the Trump campaigns possible ties to Russia. Several congressional committees and the FBI are also investigating the matter. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in January that Moscow tried to sway the November vote in Trumps favor. Russia has denied involvement, and Trump has denied any collusion between his campaign and Russia.

Democrats on the U.S. House Financial Services Committee said on Wednesday they had sent a letter the previous day to Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Officer John Cryan seeking details of internal reviews to determine if Trumps loans for  his real estate business were backed by the Russian government.  The congressional inquiry also seeks information about a Russian mirror trading scheme that allowed $10 billion to flow out of Russia. Congress remains in the dark on whether loans Deutsche Bank made to President Trump were guaranteed by the Russian government, or were in any way connected to Russia, the Democrats wrote. It is critical that you provide this committee with the information necessary to assess the scope, findings and conclusions of your internal reviews. The Democrats requested the documents from the bank, but cannot compel it to hand over the information. The committee has the power to subpoena the documents, but that would require cooperation from committee Republicans who make up the majority of the panel because the party has control of the House. No Republicans signed on to the document request. Citing media reports, the Democrats called for the bank to hand over any documents tied to internal reviews of Trumps personal accounts at the bank. They also said the bank should  state publicly that it had reviewed both the mirror trading scheme and Trumps accounts.  Mirror trading involved buying stocks, for example, in Moscow in rubles, with related parties selling the same stocks shortly thereafter through a banks London branch. They also called on the bank to name an independent auditor to verify the results of the reviews, which should be turned over to the committee as soon as reasonably practicable. Renee Calabro, a spokeswoman for Deutsche, declined to comment. The House panel request to Deutsche comes as Trump is mired in controversy over FBI and congressional probes into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and potential collusion between the Moscow and the Trump campaign.

The measure called Senate Bill 5 is intended to remedy flaws found by courts in the previous Republican-backed law. It allows people who cannot produce an authorized photo ID to show other documentation such as a utility bill or bank statement and sign an affidavit stating that they had a reasonable impediment in presenting an authorized ID. Critics contend the measure backed by the Republican-dominated lawmakers will still exclude ethnic minorities, who tend to support Democrats, and imposes harsh penalties of up to 10 years in prison for lying on the affidavit. Texas is the most-populous Republican controlled state. For more than 20 years, the party has won every statewide race for offices such as governor or U.S. senator. But shifting demographics have given hopes to Democrats that they can one day turn the state to their column, which would alter the U.S. political landscape.  The original voter ID measure was signed into law in 2011 by then Texas Governor Rick Perry, a Republican. It was considered one of the nations strictest and has been subject to years of court challenges, with the laws opponents saying it could exclude up to 600,000 voters. In January, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal by Texas seeking to revive the states strict Republican-backed voter-identification requirements. Critics had said the Texas law and similar statutes enacted in other Republican-governed states were tailored to make it harder for minorities including black and Hispanic voters, who are less likely to have the authorized IDs, to cast ballots. Backers of these laws have said they are necessary to prevent voter fraud, despite little evidence of such fraud. Both the previous law and the measure in the Texas legislature list authorized photo ID to include: a drivers license, U.S. military ID, a U.S. passport and a Texas concealed handgun license. The Texas Senate approved SB 5 in March and on Tuesday the state House of Representatives preliminarily approved the measure. Final votes on the bill may be held on Wednesday, media reported.  Texas used a similar system as outlined in the bill in the 2016 election after being ordered by a federal court to weaken its voter ID law.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"
"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump asked lawmakers on Tuesday to cut $3.6 trillion in government spending over the next decade, taking aim at healthcare and food assistance programs for the poor in an austere budget that also boosts the military. Republicans who control the U.S. Congress - and the federal purse strings - will decide whether to make politically sensitive cuts, and the proposal is unlikely to be approved in its current form. Although it is not expected to survive on Capitol Hill, the proposal puts numbers on Trumps vision of a government that radically cuts assistance to lower-income Americans. The biggest savings would come from cuts to the Medicaid healthcare program for the poor, which are embedded in a Republican healthcare bill passed by the House of Representatives. Trump wants lawmakers to cut at least $610 billion from Medicaid and more than $192 billion from food stamps over a decade. He seeks to balance the budget within 10 years.  The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan policy organization, said the plan relied on gimmicks, unrealistic cuts and rosy assumptions of economic growth that would reach 3 percent annually by the end of Trumps first term.  The Congressional Budget Office projects the economy to grow at an annual pace of 1.9 percent over that period.  The White House said its proposed tax cuts would help fuel higher growth and pay for themselves by generating an additional $2 trillion in revenue over 10 years. Lawrence Summers, a former economic adviser to Democratic President Barack Obama, said the Trump administration was double-counting that money by saying it would help close budget deficits while also offsetting the revenue lost by cutting tax rates.  It appears to be the most egregious accounting error in a presidential budget in the nearly 40 years I have been tracking them, Summers wrote in the Washington Post. Mick Mulvaney, Trumps budget office director, said his office made other assumptions that were probably too conservative. We stand by the numbers, he said. Federal aid to states would shrink by 3 percent, though the cuts would fall most heavily on states that backed Trump's Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. States that voted for Clinton would collectively face a drop of 4.8 percent, while those that backed Trump would see assistance cut by 1.2 percent. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2qhwnLV) There is some new spending in Trumps plan for fiscal year 2018, which starts in October.       The Pentagon would get a spending hike, and there would be a $1.6 billion down payment to begin building a wall along the border with Mexico, which was a central promise of Trumps presidential campaign.     Trumps proposal foresees selling half of the U.S. emergency oil stockpile, created in 1975 after the Arab oil embargo caused fears of price spikes. The announcement surprised oil markets and briefly pulled down U.S. crude prices.    Republicans are under pressure to deliver on promised tax cuts, the cornerstone of the Trump administrations economic agenda.     But the effort has stalled as the White House grapples with the political fallout from allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. Mulvaney said the plan is the first one in a long time to pay attention to taxpayers. You have to have compassion for folks who are receiving the federal funds, but also you have to have compassion for the folks who are paying it, he told reporters. Republican leaders in the House said lawmakers would be able to find common ground with the budget plan. Senator Bernie Sanders, who ran a populist campaign during the Democratic presidential primary, said the budget showed that Trumps campaign promises to stand up for working people was just cheap and dishonest campaign rhetoric that was meant to get votes, Sanders told a news conference. While the plan boosts defense spending by $54 billion, it falls short of campaign promises for a historic hike in military spending amid plans to rebuild the U.S. Navy. That is only 3 percent more than former President Barack Obama had sought in his long-term budget plan. The president would reduce nearly a third of funding for diplomacy and foreign aid including global health and food aid, peacekeeping and other forms of non-military foreign involvement. If we implemented this budget, youd have to retreat from the world or put a lot of people at risk, said Republican Senator Lindsey Graham. This budget is not going to go anywhere. Trump upheld his promise - for the most part - that he would not cut Medicare and Social Security, two expensive safety-net programs that deficit hawks have long targeted for reforms. Those programs may not come out of Capitol Hill unscathed, however. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a fellow Republican, said lawmakers would have to reform both programs to save them. The White House proposed changes that would require more childless people receiving help from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as food stamps, to work. Most government departments would see steep cuts, particularly the State Department and the Environmental Protection Agency.   Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the budget plan will boost economic growth by fostering capital investment and creating jobs for workers who gave up their job hunts during tough times.

The Daily Mail images showed the diminutive pop star dressed casually in sweats and appearing downcast as she greeted her boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller, on the tarmac and getting into a waiting car. Grande had not been seen publicly since an explosion ripped through the packed Manchester Arena at the end of her performance there.

British police have identified the man suspected of carrying out the massacre as 22-year-old Salman Abedi, who was born in Manchester to parents of Libyan origin. Islamic State claimed responsibility for what it called revenge against Crusaders, but there appeared to be contradictions in its account of the operation.

Brennan, who headed the agency until Trump became president in January, also told a congressional hearing that he personally warned the head of Russias FSB security service in a phone call last August that meddling in the election would hurt relations with the United States. Separately, the top U.S. intelligence official, Dan Coats, sidestepped a question on a Washington Post report that Trump had asked him and the National Security Agency chief to help him knock down the notion there was evidence of such collusion. But Coats did say he has made clear to Trumps administration that any political shaping of intelligence would be inappropriate. The comments by Brennan and Coats, the Director of National Intelligence, added fuel to a controversy that has engulfed Trump since he fired FBI Director James Comey two weeks ago amid the agencys investigation into possible collusion between people associated with his presidential campaign and Russia. I encountered and am aware of information and intelligence that revealed contacts and interactions between Russian officials and U.S. persons involved in the Trump campaign, Brennans said in testimony to the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee. Brennan said that he cannot say definitively there was actual collusion. Brennans testimony was the first public confirmation of the worry at high levels of the U.S. government last year over suspicious contacts between Trump campaign associates and Moscow. It was also the most complete account to date of the CIAs thinking at a time when intelligence agencies were putting together evidence that Russia was interfering in the heated U.S. presidential race to help businessman Trump, a Republican, defeat Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton. Comey was heading the Federal Bureau of Investigation probe into Russian interference and possible collusion with Trumps campaign, leading to accusations by Trump critics that he has sought to curtail the FBI inquiry. In another development, Trump has retained Marc Kasowitz, a New York-based trial lawyer who has represented Trump in the past, as his private attorney for special counsel Robert Muellers investigation into the Russia matter, a Fox Business Network reporter said on Twitter. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in January that Moscow tried to tilt the election campaign in Trumps favor, including by hacking into the emails of senior Democrats. Russia has repeatedly denied the allegation. Trump has denied any collusion but the FBI and congressional probes into the Russia matter have dogged the early months of his presidency. It should be clear to everyone Russia brazenly interfered in our 2016 presidential election process and that they undertook these activities despite our strong protests and explicit warning that they do not do so, Brennan said. Brennan said he worried that Russians tried to recruit Americans during the presidential campaign to work for Moscow. Brennan said it was possible for someone to be helpful to the Russian cause without realizing it. They (the Russians) try to suborn individuals and they try to get individuals, including U.S. persons, to act on their behalf either wittingly or unwittingly, he said, adding that individuals going on a treasonous path often do not realize it until it is too late. Republican Representative Trey Gowdy asked Brennan: Did you see evidence of collusion, coordination and conspiracy between Donald Trump and Russian state actors? I saw information and intelligence that was worthy of investigation by the bureau (FBI) to determine whether or not such cooperation or collusion was taking place, Brennan replied, but declined to elaborate. Reuters reported last week that Trumps fired former national security adviser Michael Flynn and other advisers to Trumps campaign were in contact with Russian officials and others with Kremlin ties in at least 18 calls and emails during the last seven months of the presidential race. Flynn was forced out in February for failing to disclose the content of his talks with Sergei Kislyak, Russias ambassador to the United States, and misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations.  Brennan said he believed he was the first U.S. official to raise the matter of election interference with the Russians, citing an Aug. 4, 2016 phone call he had with the head of Russias FSB, Alexander Bortnikov. He said he raised media reports of Russian attempts to meddle in the election with Bortnikov, who denied any involvement by Moscow, and told him if Russia pursued this course it would destroy prospects for improved U.S.-Russia relations. Trumps public approval ratings dropped to a new low in Reuters/Ipsos poll data released on Tuesday, with 37 percent of U.S. adults surveyed approving of the president while 57 percent disapproving. Support for Trump appears to have dropped among Americans of all political stripes. At a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, Coats sidestepped questions about a Washington Post report that Trump had asked Coats and Admiral Michael Rogers, director of the National Security Agency, to help him knock down the notion that there was evidence of such collusion. But Coats did not deny Trump had made such a request. Coats said that I dont feel its appropriate to characterize discussions and conversations with the president. The Post reported Coats and Rogers declined the request. Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal told Coats that the fact he had not denied the Post report should lead to even more intensive investigation of the alleged effort by the president to enlist you in shutting down, or stifling that investigation. This evidence, if true, goes to criminal intent and constitutes mounting evidence of obstruction of justice, Blumenthal added. The leaders of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee said they will subpoena two of Flynns businesses after he declined to comply with a subpoena for documents in the panels Russia probe.

Illinois is limping toward the June 30 end of its second straight fiscal year without a complete budget due to gridlock between Republican Governor Bruce Rauner and Democrats who control the state legislature. The development is not necessarily a breakthrough, however, as the House remains non-committal on the measures and Rauner has said he will not support them without certain conditions. The package of revenue and appropriations bills would raise income tax from 3.75 percent to 4.95 percent and corporate tax from 5.25 percent to 7 percent. The income tax hike would generate an estimated $4.4 billion annually and the corporate income tax increase would generate around $514 million annually, according to figures provided by Illinois Senate Democrats. The budget measure allocates $37.3 billion in spending from the states General Revenue Fund, a figure that matches the one proposed by Rauner. The balanced budget removes a $405 million in previously proposed cuts to Medicaid.  It is time for us to save the state, Democratic state Senator Toi Hutchinson said on the Senate floor on Tuesday before the votes.  The bills now move to the Democrat-controlled House where it is unclear if they will garner enough support.  The measures would be thoughtfully considered, Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan said in a statement on Tuesday evening.  Holding the bills from the House until after May 31, the final day of the legislature, triggers a supermajority requirement, which means Republicans would have to approve them in order to advance the bills to Rauner. But Rauner and other Republicans said on Tuesday they would not support the bills because they do not address property tax relief.  Let me be clear, to get my signature, any agreement must include real property tax relief, Rauner said on Twitter. Illinois, the countrys fifth-largest state, is immersed in one of the most politically turbulent eras in its 199-year history due in large part because of its ongoing fiscal woes.   The states backlog of unpaid bills hit nearly $14.4 billion on Tuesday, according to the state comptrollers office. Rauner is also facing a number of high-profile Democratic challengers in next years election.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trumps proposals to slash federal aid to the poor, the sick and people living in rural areas reflect conservatives demands for a smaller federal government but target many of the very people who voted for him last November. In his first detailed budget submission to Congress on Tuesday, Trump requested major reductions to programs that help poor families afford groceries and poor and disabled people get healthcare.  Job training for unemployed coal miners would be threatened and drug treatment programs would face cuts at a time when heroin and prescription pill addictions are tearing at rural America. Subsidies for commercial air travel in rural areas would be cut by more than half. The White House said many of the proposed cuts were aimed at ineffective programs and that the savings were needed to help balance the budget in 10 years and finance increased spending for defense and other programs. Some Republicans in Congress cheered Trumps budget. Representative Mark Meadows, who heads the House of Representatives hard-right Freedom Caucus, called it a great step forward for conservatives, adding: Its all about economic growth.  But many other Republican lawmakers, seeing a budget they think will be tough to sell back home, greeted it warily. These cuts that are being proposed are draconian. Theyre not mere savings. Theyre really deep, deep cuts, said Republican Representative Hal Rogers, whose eastern Kentucky  district relies heavily on federal aid. Trump trounced Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election in Kentucky, 63 percent to 33 percent, winning every region except the urban Louisville and Lexington areas. Rogers, a 36-year congressman, said the Republican president remained popular in his district, but added: We have not yet had a chance to see how (voters) will react to his budget proposals. It is unclear if the Republican-controlled House and Senate will be able to pass a budget blueprint for the fiscal year starting on Oct. 1. Democratic votes would also likely be needed to pass the fiscal 2018 spending bills needed to carry out budget priorities. But the proposed reductions could trigger a backlash for Republicans, complicating efforts to keep control of the U.S. Congress in the 2018 midterm elections. Trumps own base of political support also could be undermined. Republican Representative Tom Cole, who represents an Oklahoma district that the Almanac of American Politics described as countrified, predicted Congress would look at some of those things differently from the Trump administrations budget. Cole oversees spending on health and social welfare programs as chairman of a House Appropriations panel and has a medical research facility important to his district that relies on federal funding. The National Institutes of Health is not likely to be cut. I think CDC (Centers for Disease Control) is not likely to be cut. I think that is ill-advised personally, Cole told reporters. Atop Rogers list of worries is Trumps proposed elimination of the $146 million Appalachian Regional Commission that has helped bring projects such as job training to unemployed coal miners, a broadband technology center to Kentucky and high-tech medical equipment to impoverished regions. The food stamp program, which helps low-income and disabled people buy groceries, would be reduced by $200 billion over 10 years. According to U.S. Department of Agriculture figures, bedrock Republican states that Trump won have long food-stamp rolls: 3.8 million people in Texas, 682,077 in Vice President Mike Pences home state of Indiana, 815,000 in Alabama and 1.6 million in Georgia, for example. Trump got broad support in last Novembers election in counties with high numbers of white voters who receive food stamps. He was victorious in 991 of the 1,093 counties studied by the U.S. Census Bureau where the percentage of white households receiving food stamps exceeds the national average. Overall, according to a Reuters analysis, states would see federal aid shrink under the proposals by 3 percent in the next fiscal year, with cuts falling more heavily on states that voted for Clinton. States that voted for Trump would see federal aid decline by 1.2 percent, while those that supported Clinton would collectively see a drop of 4.8 percent. Liberal California would be hit hardest, with a 9.8 percent drop. Kentucky, a conservative state that signed on to the Affordable Care Acts Medicaid expansion, would also be hit hard, with assistance dropping by 9.7 percent.  Some Republican lawmakers welcomed the budget cuts. I think were way over in the number of people who have been able to qualify for food stamps, said John Carter, who represents a central Texas district. Trumps proposed budget cuts would help pay for a 10 percent buildup in defense spending for next year, and help finance a wall on the southwest border that Trump previously had promised would be paid for by Mexico, something the Mexican government has adamantly said it will not do. The Medicaid healthcare plan for the poor is slated for about an $800 billion cut, reversing the expansion that former Democratic President Barack Obamas signature Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, brought to Republican states like West Virginia, Arkansas and Kentucky with large populations of poor people. Most of the (budget) cuts will focus on programs for low- income folks and public investments, said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which pushes for long-term fixes to Washingtons debt problems. Levi Russell, spokesman for Americans for Prosperity, the conservative group backed by billionaire Charles Koch, applauded Trumps call to balance the budget within 10 years, cut taxes and roll back regulations - moves he said would stimulate job growth. It sends all of the right signals for the first time in nearly a decade - a budget that actually is focused on the best interests of the American taxpayer rather than whats popular in Washington, he said.

Senator Lindsey Graham, the Republican chairman of the Senate subcommittee responsible for diplomacy and foreign aid spending, said Trumps proposal to cut the diplomacy and aid budget by one third would gut soft power. If we implemented this budget, youd have to retreat from the world or put a lot of people at risk, Graham told reporters. This budget is not going to go anywhere. Congress sets the federal government budget, and Republicans who control both houses and Democrats have said they do not support such drastic cuts.  The funding cuts in Trumps plan for the fiscal year beginning in October would mark a stark decrease in non-military U.S. government engagement abroad as the administration pursues Trumps America First world view. Trump administration officials defend the cuts by saying  the rest of the world must do its fair share as the United States retreats from its traditional spending abroad. In all, the Trump proposal cuts about 32 percent from U.S. diplomacy and aid budgets, or nearly $19 billion. Trumps budget would cut U.S. funding for global health programs including efforts focusing on HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria by about one quarter, to about $6.5 billion for 2018. The budget proposal envisions cuts to the Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) program, a cornerstone of U.S. global health assistance, which supports HIV/AIDS treatment, testing and counseling for millions of people worldwide. Under Trumps budget, PEPFAR funding would be $5 billion per year compared to about $6 billion annually now, the State Department said.  No patient currently receiving antiretroviral therapy, a treatment for HIV, through PEPFAR funds will lose that treatment, officials said. The budget proposal also includes a steep cut to funding for international organizations, without specifying which groups might lose their funding. The NATO military alliance would continue to be fully funded. U.S. funding for international peacekeeping would fall to about $1.5 billion, a cut of over 50 percent from 2017 levels.  The United States is the biggest contributor to the United Nations, paying 22 percent of the $5.4 billion core budget and 28.5 percent of the $7.9 billion peacekeeping budget Given the growing threats we face, we should be supporting  not slashing  anti-terrorism, law enforcement, and humanitarian programs, Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement.  Trumps budget would reduce funding for educational and cultural exchanges by 52 percent, including a 47 percent cut to the Fulbright Program, which enables U.S. citizens to go abroad and brings foreign students to study in the United States. The Trump proposal assumes the State Department will maintain its current structure, though Tillerson has said he wants to restructure the agency and find efficiencies. Nonetheless, the budget makes major shifts in some funding.  A core, $2.8 billion development account overseen by USAID that funds agricultural, water, sanitation and other projects would be consolidated with other funding streams to create the Economic Support and Development Fund. That new account would then be cut by about 45 percent compared to current funding levels. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The budget proposes a modest increase in military spending. Trump is seeking a $52 billion hike for the Pentagon as part of an overall defense spending increase of $54 billion. That is almost 10 percent higher than current budget caps, but only 3 percent more than what former President Barack Obama had sought in his long-term budget plan. The $603 billion includes funding for nuclear weapons programs at the Department of Energy and other national defense programs as well as the Department of Defense. The Pentagons specific defense request is for $574.5 billion, an increase of 4.6 percent compared with the budget for fiscal year 2017. Looking at defense specifically, this is not a historic budget - much less a buildup, said Mackenzie Eaglen, an analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank based in Washington. This budget seeks to repair the cracked military foundation by plugging gaps and filling holes, she said.  At the direction of Defense Secretary James Mattis, the Pentagon is carrying out a broad budget and strategy review, and experts said this budget is more of a placeholder until that is complete.  It feels to me like the Trump administration just doesnt really have it all together at this point, said Laicie Heeley, a fellow at the Stimson Center, another Washington-based think tank. The budget request must be passed by Congress but faces skeptical lawmakers. U.S. officials said the focus of the budget proposal was to improve readiness.  U.S. Senator John McCain, one of the leading military and foreign policy voices in Congress, said on Tuesday that the White Houses budget proposal was inadequate and dead on arrival in Congress.  McCain has been a proponent of increasing base defense spending to above $640 billion in order to renew the military and invest in modern capabilities. Obviously it is going to take a lot in Congress, in both the House and Senate, to try to get it done and we are here to help in any way we can, Acting Comptroller John Roth told reporters. The proposal includes an additional $65 billion in Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) money, which is intended to fund ongoing wars and does not count against the budget caps. The fiscal 2018 budget proposals OCO funding includes $46 billion for operations in Afghanistan, but is based on current U.S. troops levels at about 8,400. The Trump administration is weighing sending between 3,000 and 5,000 additional U.S. and coalition troops to the war-torn country to stem gains made by Taliban militants. The OCO fund also includes $13 billion for the fight against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria and $4.8 billion for the European Reassurance Initiative, which is an increase of about $1.4 billion from the 2017 request. The budget proposes $137.2 billion for the Army, which is looking to keep active-duty troop levels at 476,000. The Obama administration had planned for the number of Army active-duty troops to go down to 450,000 by the end of fiscal 2017.    The White Houses proposal also earmarks a total of $171.5 billion for the Navy. As a presidential candidate, Trump made repeated calls to expand the current 275-ship fleet to 350. However, that will have to wait because the budget proposal did not accelerate the Navys schedule for purchasing additional ships, but instead increased funding for ship maintenance as the duration of overseas deployments increases.  The Navy added a Boeing Co P-8 submarine-hunting aircraft, but delayed the purchase of two F-35C variant jets made by Lockheed Martin Co. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The overall budget proposal is $76 billion, which the administration said is about the same as for 2016. About $60 billion of that is annual mandatory spending, including road repairs paid through gas tax collections. The Transportation Departments discretionary budget is being cut by 12.7 percent, or $2.4 billion to $16.2 billion. The administration proposes $200 billion in government funding over 10 years as part of a goal of getting $1 trillion in public and private infrastructure spending. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao told reporters local communities know best what projects they need. Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer said the budget cuts $206 billion in infrastructure spending across several Cabinet departments, including $96 billion in planned highway trust fund spending. Schumer said the administration would cut funds from states and cities to pay wealthy hedge funds and Wall Street to build more toll roads. Chao said Schumer has called for $1 trillion in direct government funding, which is not very realistic and would add to the deficit. Administration officials said they expect that by 2022 there will be a new mechanism to make up for lost revenue. The budget projects a $15 billion reduction in funding in 2023 and does not include any funding to make up for that. Congress has been adding tens of billions of dollars annually to pay for crumbling roads because gas tax revenue is not keeping up with repair needs. The administration also proposes to allow for private companies to construct and operate highway rest stops. It also wants to raise the airline passenger security fee by $1 to $6.60 per one-way trip, which would generate $530 million for the Transportation Safety Administration. The budget would end subsidies for Amtrak to operate long-distance train service, cutting $630 million of the $1.4 billion in annual government support for passenger rail service. The Trump budget would eliminate the Obama administrations TIGER grant program, saving $5 billion over 10 years in the program that has funded transit projects. It also would cut $18 billion out of another government transit grant program called New Starts. The administration also proposes to privatize the nations air traffic control system, which budget documents suggest would boost the budget deficit by about $45 billion over 10 years.

Trumps austere 2018 budget proposal, which seeks to trim $3.6 trillion from government spending over the next decade and is unlikely to get legislative approval in its current form, envisages steep cuts in most federal departments, but particularly the State Department. Ever since launching his presidential campaign in 2015, Trump has attacked Mexico, threatening to rip up the North American Free Trade Agreement, build a Mexico-funded southern border wall and ramp up deportations of those living without documents in the United States.  Tuesdays proposal foresees 2018 Mexican aid of $87.66 million, down more than 45 percent from the 2016 outlay. The proposed spending cuts comes as the United States leans on Mexico to do more to prop up its poor Central American neighbors, where poverty and gangs are the main drivers pushing migrants to the United States. The budget proposes scrapping most U.S. money for the Mexican military, along with counterterrorism funds and some governance programs. Narcotics and law enforcement spending would fall from $100 million in 2016 to $60 million. In Guatemala, U.S. aid would drop almost 40 percent from 2016, to $80.66 million, while in Honduras and El Salvador it would fall nearly a third. In a call with reporters, U.S. officials stressed the cuts would not prevent them from tackling their regional objectives.  That is a reduction. However it really prioritizes our programs that focus on disrupting the activities of transnational criminal organizations, strengthening border security and combating corruption  were going to continue addressing those root causes as part of our Central America strategy, an official said. Mexico, which is struggling with rising crime, will be co-hosting a June meeting in Miami where the U.S. government hopes to drum up more private sector support to improve employment and security conditions in Central America. Although the number of migrants arriving on the southern U.S. border has fallen drastically since Trump took office, history suggests the decline may prove short-lived if he fails to realize his tough policies.

The White House on Monday proposed $46.54 billion in cuts to federal government funding for the agriculture sector over the next 10 years, including limits on federal subsidies for crop insurance premiums. Congress has the final say on the governments budget and lawmakers said the presidents plan stands little chance of passing. U.S. Agriculture Department Secretary Sonny Perdue said there was no sugarcoating the budget proposal, which could lead to the elimination of 5,263 jobs at the department if implemented, or about 5 percent of its workforce. USDA requested $18 billion for department spending in fiscal 2018, down from $24 billion in 2017. Farmers in the U.S. agricultural heartland overwhelmingly supported Trump last November and are struggling with low crop prices that are hurting incomes. This budget seems to really go after the people that got the president elected, said Zack Clark, director of government relations for the National Farmers Union. Some of the biggest proposed cuts come from changes to the crop insurance system, which many farmers rely on to keep their operations running. Its clear that this budget was written without input from farmers who would be severely affected, Ron Moore, president of the American Soybean Association, said in a statement.  But changes in crop insurance that cause farmers to cut back on plantings could provide relief to a global balance sheet heavy with supplies. Falling production could pay off in the long run by helping to lift prices, said Scott Irwin, agricultural economist for the University of Illinois. Trumps budget imposes a $40,000 limit on crop insurance premium subsidies, which could prevent some farmers from insuring their entire acreage. There is currently no limit. Typically, farmers pay a portion of their insurance premiums and USDA covers the rest, said Jeff Harrison, a lawyer who represents the Crop Insurance Professionals Association. In practical terms, youre really going after full-time farm families.  U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Agriculture Committee, said she would oppose the cuts, which would leave our farmers, families, and rural communities vulnerable in tough times.  House Agriculture Committee Chairman K. Michael Conaway and Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts, both Republicans, said they will fight to ensure farmers have a strong safety net.

He was accompanied by the Rabbi of the Western Wall, Shmuel Rabinowitz, who said on Israel Radio that he recited two psalms with the U.S. leader. One of them, Psalm 122, speaks of Jerusalem as a city that is united together. The ancient stones are in a part of Jerusalem that Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war. It considers all of Jerusalem its indivisible capital, a status that is not recognized internationally. (Trump) said that he understands the significance of the Western Wall for the Jewish people and thats why he decided to visit here during his first trip to Israel. He is certain he will come here again, perhaps many times. He was very moved, Rabinowitz said. He asked about the size of the Western Wall. We presented the maps, what was in the past, whats happening now, the excavations, the finds. The president was joined on the visit by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, an Orthodox Jew who went to the wall shortly after Trump and said prayers. Both he and Trump wore black kippahs, the skull caps worn by religious Jews and by others as a mark of respect.  After a few moments standing silently before the limestone edifice, his right hand resting on the blocks, Trump withdrew and smiled briefly. He did not walk backwards from the wall as religious Jews do as a sign of devotion. It is the first time a sitting U.S. president has visited and prayed at the site. Barack Obama visited in 2008, but it was during the campaign, before he became president. The Wall, the visible portion of which stands more than 60 feet (20 meters) high, was a retaining structure for the second Jewish temple, which stood on an esplanade in the Old City before being destroyed by the Romans in 70 A.D. The site is known to Jews as Temple Mount, the holiest place in Judaism, and to Muslims as The Noble Sanctuary, where al-Aqsa Mosque, the third holiest site in Islam, and the gold-topped Dome of the Rock, now stand. Access to much of the walled Old City, which is divided into four quarters  Muslim, Christian, Armenian and Jewish  was shut down on Monday ahead of Trumps visit. The area has been the scene of multiple stabbing attacks by Palestinians targeting Jews over the past couple of years.  As Trump and Kushner visited the area of the wall set aside for men, Melania Trump and Ivanka, Kushners wife, visited a separate nearby section where women are allowed to pray.  Like her husband, Melania held her right hand up against the towering stones and inserted a note among the cracks, something Jews often do as a means of submitting prayers. Ivanka, who converted to Judaism on marrying her husband, was dressed demurely in black and wore her hair partially covered by a small hat. Video footage showed her crying as she prayed at the wall. Trumps visit to the site sparked some controversy during the planning. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had sought to accompany Trump to the Western Wall. But the State Department said that would not be permitted as officially the Wall is in East Jerusalem, which Israel occupied 50 years ago, and Palestinians seek as the capital of a future state.

The states Republican-controlled legislature has been at the forefront in advancing measures seen by backers as protecting traditional values and religious liberty but criticized by civil rights groups as eroding protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, or LGBT, people. The Texas House gave preliminary approval on Sunday night to the bill, which requires public school students to use bathrooms, changing facilities and locker rooms that match their biological sex, not the gender with which they identify. Under the bill, school districts have to accommodate students who do not wish to use a common facility based on biological sex with a single-occupancy facility, or a multi-occupancy facility if its use occurs when no one else is present. The measure is narrower in scope than a bathroom bill passed along mostly party lines by the state Senate in March that extended to state universities and public buildings. The Senate bill is similar to one enacted last year in North Carolina. The North Carolina law prompted economic boycotts and the loss of sporting events, and was later revamped in the face of criticism. The more limited House measure is seen as a way to avoid an economic backlash in Texas, analysts said. It is absolutely about child safety, Republican state Representative Chris Paddie, who managed the bill, said in House debate on Sunday. The measure heads back to the Senate for consideration of changes made since it was in that chamber. Republican Governor Greg Abbott has said he supports a bathroom bill. Critics said the House and Senate versions undermined civil rights and used children as political pawns. There is no moral middle ground on discrimination,  said Kathy Miller, president of the civil liberties advocacy group  Texas Freedom Network. The legislature on Monday also sent to the governor a bill allowing adoption agencies to reject families on religious grounds, an action slammed by critics as discriminatory against LGBT Texans and non-Christians. LGBT rights groups said they would challenge the adoption bill in court if it became law, arguing discrimination in the name of religion had no place in the state.  The bills backers, which include several Christian groups, said it banned no one and had a mechanism for the state government to offer alternative adoption providers if any service is denied for religious beliefs.

In a somewhat unusual move, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said on Tuesday it is seeking a $31.5 million boost on its current $250 million budget.   The White House, by contrast, proposed to keep the budgets of both the CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission flat.  The SECs current budget is $1.6 billion.  The White House also said it would support allotting an additional $244.5 million to help pay for a new SEC headquarters if it must relocate after its lease expires, though at the same time it called on Congress to kill a $50 million reserve fund in fiscal year 2019 that the agency uses to fund long-term information technology projects. The SEC concurred with the White Houses fiscal 2018 budget proposal, and said it intends to continue making use of the reserve fund, which it called critically important to help it keep pace with rapidly changing technology.  A document released by the agency did not weigh in on whether the fund should be eliminated by 2019, as the White House proposes. The CFTC won broad new powers from the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law to police the massive over-the-counter derivatives marketplace.  However, it has often struggled to convince the Republican-led Congress to boost its resources. The CFTC said Tuesday that it has independent legal authority to seek a different budget from what the White House proposes, and that its pitch to Congress was approved by its two commissioners, Republican Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo and Democrat Sharon Bowen. The money would be used to devote more resources to analyze the economic costs and benefits of its rules, boost compliance examinations of clearing houses that help reduce counterparty trading risks, and further advance its newly unveiled financial technology initiatives.

The U.S. Northeast Gasoline Supply Reserve (NGSR) was established in 2014 to minimize the impact of sudden supply interruptions, such as occurred in 2012 during Sandy, the second-costliest hurricane in the countrys history. The gasoline reserve was established as part of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). It consists of 1 million barrels of gasoline blendstock and is stored in commercial storage terminals in Maine, Massachusetts and New Jersey.  The NGSR has not been utilized and does not have the operational functionality that was envisioned post-Sandy, the budget proposal said. It noted that the NGSRs leased commercial storage contracts expire in the early part of fiscal 2019. A sale would offset $69 million of discretionary spending, with any additional proceeds going to the U.S. Treasurys general fund for deficit reduction, the proposal says.  Sandy battered the northeastern U.S. coast at the end of October 2012, destroying homes and buildings, closing refineries and disrupting gasoline supplies. The U.S. East Coast accounts for over a third of national gasoline consumption.  The gasoline market is not likely to be affected significantly if the budget proposal is approved in its current form by Congress, said Robert Campbell, head of oil products markets at consultancy Energy Aspects, but it would leave the region at risk if another disaster struck. Nothing has changed very much (since 2012)... if we were to get in a situation where we once again have refinery closures on the East Coast, it would be a much more vulnerable market, he said. The budget proposal for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1 also calls for selling half of the 688 million barrels of oil in the SPR, the nations emergency crude stockpile. That would represent about 141 days of U.S. oil imports of oil but only about three days worth of global production. In some ways it seems more logical now to have a gasoline reserve than a separate crude reserve, said David Thompson, executive vice president at energy-specialized commodities broker Powerhouse in Washington. There is a time component involved in making and distributing gasoline, so if the Northeast refineries or the Colonial (pipeline) were affected by a major incident, it would take time to develop an alternative supply chain, he said. Traders also said the gasoline reserve had been created so recently that its liquidation was unlikely to be approved by lawmakers quickly.  Under the Trump budget proposal, the existing Northeast home heating oil reserve of 1 million barrels would continue to operate. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The White House does not detail how those savings, which are equivalent to the annual economic output of the Democratic Republic of Congo, would be realized. But the administration said an ongoing review of existing financial rules will likely result in proposals that will provide significant savings to the federal government. While it is not expected to be passed by Congress, the fiscal 2018 budget unveiled by the White House on Tuesday hews closely to Trumps view that slashing financial regulations  would boost the economy. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is currently conducting a comprehensive review of the impact of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation. An initial report recommending policy changes is expected to come at the beginning of June. The White Houses projected savings from easing financial rules exceed estimates offered by the Congressional Budget Office. That policy scorekeeper calculated that $24 billion would be saved over a decade if a broad Dodd-Frank rollback bill currently in the House of Representatives were passed.  Most of those savings identified by CBO come from eliminating a Dodd-Frank provision allowing the government to step in and wind down failing financial institutions, and by placing tighter control over the funding of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which was set up to protect consumers from predatory lending. Trumps budget would give control of funding that agency to Congress, a policy change sought by Republicans eager to rein it in. Currently, the CFPB gets its funding from the Federal Reserve. The White House estimates that moving oversight of the CFPB to Congress would save the federal government $6.8 billion over a decade. However, the budget proposal does not account for any funds appropriated to the CFPB beyond fiscal 2018. The Office of Financial Research, also created by Dodd-Frank to gather data on financial markets, is facing a 28 percent budget cut under the new plan. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission would see their budgets hold steady at $250 million and $1.6 billion, respectively, under the new budget.

Target CEO Brian Cornell has been one of the most vocal opponents of the Republican-backed border adjustment tax and testified alongside Juan Luciano, president and CEO of ADM, who spoke in favor of the proposal. The border tax would imposes a tax on imports while providing a credit for exports and has been proposed by House Republicans as part of a larger tax code overhaul. Target is a big importer of goods, while ADM exports. House Speaker Paul Ryan argues the proposed border tax, which is estimated to garner $1 trillion, will not affect prices and will allow rate cuts for businesses while not creating deficits, but retailers warn that it could raise consumer prices as much as 15 percent.  Cornell and Luciano took staunchly different positions on the tax.  Under the new border adjustment tax, American families  your constituents  would pay more so many multinational corporations can pay even less, Cornell told the committee.  Luciano, on the other hand, argued that the tax would make American companies more competitive. A competitive tax code will help us continue providing American-made food and feed to our customers in the United States and abroad in the face of robust and, from a tax perspective, ever strengthening competition from abroad, he said. The outlook for passage of the border tax - which drew staunch opposition from retailers - remains perilous, especially as key Senate Republicans and President Donald Trump have refused to endorse it. Several Republican members of the committee expressed concerns about the tax during the hearing that stretched more than three hours, including Republican Representative Jim Renacci who argued the proposal could hurt small businesses that rely on imports. Dimming the prospects more, lawmakers and lobbyists have begun to speculate that Congress will be unable to rally support for a sweeping tax code overhaul this year, and are beginning to look instead at cutting tax rates without broad reform. The committee heard from two additional supporters of the tax, including William Simon, the former CEO of Wal-Mart Stores Inc, who despite his past with a large retailer that opposes the tax, endorsed the measure. We will see more good middle class jobs, a robust U.S. economy and an era of growth that will be led by a new industrial revolution, Simon said. Lawrence Lindsey, the former director of the National Economic Council under President George W. Bush, also supported the tax. Economist Kimberly Clausing, of Reed College, criticized the proposal, saying she disagrees with the argument by proponents that currency markets would prevent consumer prices from increasing.  This is an untested tax reform that is not ready for primetime, she said.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

An internal Department of Homeland Security (DHS) plan in February estimated the total cost for the wall at $21.6 billion, but the White Houses budget proposal for 2018, released in full on Tuesday, included a request for just $1.6 billion. Two Republican aides in Congress said the modest request is an acknowledgement from the White House that full funding is not realistic given opposition from Freedom Caucus conservatives in the House of Representatives as well as Democrats in the House and the Senate. Unless Trump is able to rally broader support and win more funding for construction in another fiscal year, his plans for a big beautiful wall that he promised during his election campaign last year may not be realized, the aides said. The budget, which includes 10-year projections for spending for most areas of the government, did not include a 10-year plan for funding wall construction.  We are absolutely dead serious about the wall, White House budget director Mick Mulvaney told reporters on Tuesday.  He said the Trump administration was still reviewing prototypes to determine whether to build fences, a brick and mortar wall or some other type of structure.  The $1.6 billion would allow the administration to build small parts of the proposed wall. Trump has said he will find a way for Mexico to repay the United States for construction of the wall but that Congress would need to fund it first.  Members of the House Freedom Caucus said earlier this year that Trump would have to show how he would offset the cost of a wall, which Democrats flatly oppose. Facing opposition, the White House pulled its request for full funding for the wall in the 2017 fiscal year and said it would revisit the issue in the next budget.  One of the congressional aides said Trump still lacks the support needed. Nothing has changed politically on the wall. So far, the DHS has solicited bids for prototypes of a wall using $20 million in existing funds, but no government contractors have been selected to begin construction. A DHS memo shared with a Senate committee last month said the agency would be able to build 34 miles (55 km) of a levee wall in Texass Rio Grande Valley and replace 14 miles (23 km) of fence in San Diego with $1 billion.

MAIN STORY - Trumps first full budget would slash funding for healthcare and food assistance programs that help the poor while it trims the deficit. The plan - if agreed to by Congress - would cut $3.6 trillion in government spending over 10 years, balancing the budget by the end of the decade. More than $800 billion would be cut from the Medicaid program for the poor, and more than $192 billion from food stamps. THE WALL - Trump is asking Congress for $1.6 billion for fiscal 2018 to begin building a wall along the border with Mexico, far short of the amount needed for a project sharply criticized by Democrats and even some conservative Republicans. An internal Department of Homeland Security  plan has estimated the walls total cost at $21.6 billion. AGRICULTURE - The White House budget proposed $46.54 billion in cuts to federal funding for the agriculture sector over the next 10 years, with the biggest cut in the form of a $38 billion bite out of farm supports, including new limits on  subsidies for crop insurance premiums and caps for commodity payments. FOREIGN OUTLAYS - The Trump administrations budget proposal would convert some of the United States foreign military grants to loans, part of a larger effort to slash spending on diplomacy, aid and programs abroad by more than 29 percent. ENERGY - Trumps White House would sell half of the nations emergency oil stockpile and open the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge to drilling as part of a plan to balance the budget over the next 10 years and ramp up American energy output.  FINANCIAL REGULATION - Two Wall Street financial regulators, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Securities and Exchange Commission, would face cuts or major structural changes under Trumps  budget proposal. The CFPB, created to protect borrowers from predatory lending, would undergo a restructure that would cut the federal deficit by $145 million, while the SEC, which polices securities markets, would have its reserve fund used to supplement its budget. ASSUMPTIONS - Trumps promise to balance the federal budget in a decade rests on a sustained rise to 3 percent annual economic growth and a vague feedback effect that lowers the annual deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars.

Branstad assured lawmakers during his confirmation hearing he would take a firm line with the Chinese government on issues from North Korea to trade disputes and human rights, despite years working closely with Chinese officials. Branstad said his long ties would help him push Beijing on difficult topics, including North Korea and thorny trade issues. Chinese President Xi Jinping has called Branstad, 70, an old friend after decades of dealings on agricultural trade during his long career in politics in Iowa, an important farming state. The vote was 82-13, with all 13 of the votes against the Republican presidents nominee coming from Democrats.

The White House budget, which will be delivered to Congress on Tuesday, is meant as a proposal and may not take effect in its current form. But it reveals the administrations policy hopes, which include ramping up American energy output.    The U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the worlds largest, holds about 688 million barrels of crude oil in heavily guarded underground caverns in Louisiana and Texas. Congress created it in 1975 after the Arab oil embargo caused fears of long-term motor fuel price spikes that would harm the U.S. economy.  The Trump budget proposes to start selling SPR oil in fiscal year 2018, which begins on Oct. 1, with sales that would generate $500 million, according to the documents. The sales from the reserve would gradually rise over the following years, peaking at nearly $3.9 billion in 2027, and totaling nearly $16.6 billion from 2018 to 2027. The announcement surprised oil markets, and pulled down U.S. crude prices for immediate delivery to just over $50 per barrel during Asian trading hours. [O/R] Yet the bigger effect, if implemented, would be more long-term as it is planned to last a decade. The Brent forward curve <0#LCO:> shows prices rising toward $55.60 per barrel by April 2018, but then declining toward $53.75 per barrel by late 2018. The White House budget plan, released just after Trump left Saudi Arabia, the defacto leader of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), is seen as undermining OPEC-led plans to tighten global markets by cutting production, and points toward a future of ongoing ample supplies. The Trump budget would also seek to raise $1.8 billion over the coming decade by leasing oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve, the largest protected wilderness in the United States, believed to hold rich reserves of crude. Increased drilling in Alaska would add to rising U.S. oil production which, largely thanks to shale, has jumped over 10 percent since mid-2016 to 9.3 million barrels per day. U.S. politicians have been debating whether to open the reserve in northeastern Alaska to drilling since the 1970s, with opponents citing the risk of spills and the contribution to global climate change. Trump has already moved to expand U.S. offshore drilling, including in parts of the Arctic, as part of his broader effort to support the oil and gas industries. He has also moved to trim  the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, including by proposing a more than 30 percent cut to its funding. Mick Mulvaney, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, told reporters on Monday that the overall budget proposal was part of an effort to help the U.S. economy grow at a rate of 3 percent a year.  It drives our tax reform policy, our regulatory policy, trade, energy ... everything is keyed toward getting us back to 3 percent, he said. The White House did not immediately respond to questions about the energy-related budget proposals. Trumps budget would also restart a nuclear waste fund that would bring in more than $3 billion by 2027.  The Obama administration stopped charging nuclear energy utilities the fee in 2014 after it stopped the licensing process for Nevadas Yucca Mountain - a waste dump that cost the government billions of dollars but never opened.

This would reduce the federal deficit by $145 million in the 2018 fiscal year, it said. The Securities and Exchange Commission, which polices securities markets, would have its reserve fund, established under Dodd-Frank, used to supplement its budget. In recent years, the fund has been used to overhaul the SECs information technology, including upgrades to the filing system for public companies and initiatives to help police fraud and track equities trading patterns. The White House document said the elimination of the fund would reduce the deficit by $50 million a year, which is the maximum amount the SEC is allowed to deposit annually. Currently, both the SEC and CFPB budgets do not impact the federal deficit.  The CFPBs $605.9 million budget is funded by the Federal Reserve, which is not subject to congressional appropriations.  Congress does decide the SECs $1.6 billion budget, but it is deficit neutral because the fees it collects from Wall Street firms are matched by the amount Congress sets aside. The reserve fund, which is separate from the rest of the SECs general budget, is funded through registration fees. An OMB spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment about how a restructuring of the CFPB or the elimination of the SECs reserve fund would reduce the federal deficit. The CFPBs structure has been under political fire for years.  Republicans complain it is not held accountable because it is led by a single director who cannot be fired by the president at will, and it falls outside of congressional budget control. Last year, a U.S. appeals court found the CFPBs structure violated the U.S. Constitution. The bureau is slated to fight that decision on Wednesday, when the full panel of appellate judges will reconsider the ruling. Legislation proposed recently by House Republicans would subject the CFPB to appropriations. A report by the Congressional Budget Office estimated that such a change could help reduce direct spending by $6.9 billion between 2018-2027. The SECs reserve fund has long been a target of congressional Republicans, who have led efforts to prevent the SEC from using portions of the money. In July 2015, the SECs inspector general predicted that a cancellation of the fund would stall IT modernization and harm the agency. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The cuts to programs under the State Department are in part meant to fund an increase in military spending. The White House budget documents showed total defense spending for the 2018 fiscal year at $603 billion, about 3 percent higher than President Barack Obamas proposed 2018 fiscal year defense budget. The $603 billion includes funding for nuclear weapons programs at the Department of Energy and other national defense programs as well as the Department of Defense.  The Pentagons specific defense request is for $574.5 billion, an increase of 4.6 percent compared to fiscal year 2017. Under President Donald Trumps proposal, the United States would spend 29.1 percent less on the State Department and other international programs in the 2018 fiscal year compared to 2017, a decrease of $11.5 billion. That decrease includes a re-shaping of the way some countries receive military aid from the United States. Foreign military financing gives countries loans or grants to buy U.S. military equipment. The State Department decides which countries are given the financing while the Pentagon executes the decisions. Under the Trump proposal, many current grants would instead be converted to loans. We do change a couple of the foreign military programs from direct grants to loans, said Mick Mulvaney, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, in a briefing with reporters on Monday. Our argument was instead of ... giving somebody $100 million, we could give them a smaller number worth of loan guarantees and they could actually buy more stuff. Military aid to Israel and Egypt, two close U.S. allies in the Middle East and the biggest recipients of U.S. military assistance, will remain unchanged, Mulvaney said. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the proposal, said the foreign military grants could affect Pakistan, Tunisia, Lebanon, Ukraine, Colombia, the Philippines and Vietnam. U.S. military assistance to partners and allies reached $13.5 billion in 2015, or 28 percent of all U.S. foreign aid spending that year, according to the Congressional Research Service. Most grants through the Foreign Military Financing (FMF) program go to Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Pakistan and Iraq. Congress ultimately controls the government purse strings and may reject some or many of the Trump administrations proposals. Republicans and Democrats in Congress have criticized the size of the cuts to the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development. Mulvaney said that aid to Pakistan would be reduced, though he did not give concrete details. (The) State (Department) still has some flexibility to come up with a final plan on that, but I do know that writ large we have proposed to move several countries from a direct grant program to a loan guarantee program, he said. Todd Harrison, a defense budget analyst with the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, said the switch from grants to loans for military aid may mean that countries will not be able to afford U.S. military equipment, forcing them to go elsewhere for supplies. Countries can buy from China or Russia. They have other places to shop, and one of the ways that we build capacity with our partners is through these grants, Harrison said. Its in our interest to have interoperability with our allies, and these military grants are a part of that. Thomas Spoehr, who directs the Center for National Defense at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said the conversion from grants to loans will be a challenge especially for smaller military aid recipient countries like Macedonia and Tunisia.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trumps promise to balance the federal budget in a decade rests on a sustained rise to 3 percent annual economic growth that he promised in his election campaign and a vague feedback effect that lowers the annual government deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars. The projections are a leap of faith that many economists and the Federal Reserve regard as unlikely in a country where the population is aging and productivity has lagged.  They also hinge on continued low interest rates, low inflation and full employment - a decade free not just of major economic shocks but of the sort of mild recession considered part of a capitalist economys normal ups and downs. According to the summary tables released by the administration on Monday night, the administration is assuming economic growth reaches 3 percent annually by the end of Trumps first term and stays there at least through 2027.  Actual first quarter economic growth was a weak 0.7 percent on an annualized basis, though current Fed forecasts expect about 2.1 percent growth for the year. Economic growth is one reason the plan forecasts tax receipts growing by around 5 percent a year even as the president promises tax cuts that will spur investment and create jobs.   Inflation is assumed to hit the Feds 2 percent goal and stay there, compared to the Feds current forecast of just below 2 percent for 2016. The budget assumes the unemployment rate will rise slightly from its current 4.4 percent rate and stay at a long-term average of 4.8 percent. Without that jump in growth and the steady environment surrounding it, deficits would increase by as much as half a trillion dollars a year - around where they are now - according to administration estimates that include an effect of economic feedback that reduces the governments annual shortfall by an amount that grows to $496 billion by 2027. The exact nature of the effect of economic feedback was not detailed in the initial documents. President Barack Obamas last budget assumed 2.6 percent annual growth, and even that is considered optimistic by professional economists and the Federal Reserve. Central bankers have penciled in trend U.S. growth of around 1.8 percent over the long run. Some Wall Street analysts, giving credit to some of Trumps possible tax cut ideas, forecast economic growth could hit 2.3 percent in 2020, according to the latest quarterly poll of forecasters by the Philadelphia Fed.  With all due respect, the full fiscal Trump magic was never a realistic outlook, Erik Nielsen, chief economist at UniCredit, wrote in a note to clients on Sunday. Growth since 2000 has averaged 1.9 percent in the United States; over the course of a decade the difference between that and Trumps 3 percent figure compounds to an additional $2 trillion annually that would not get spent, invested or taxed. The administration is also assuming that interest rates remain low, with a 10-year Treasury bond rate that rises to 3.8 percent and remains there, a figure critical to projected government borrowing costs. While the 10-year bond has averaged near that level throughout this century and is currently well below it, periods of faster economic growth generally involve higher rates because of both the likelihood of tighter monetary policy and the likely demand for U.S. securities if the economy does accelerate.

Trump already has threatened to withhold federal funds from cities such as Chicago that offer sanctuary to illegal immigrants who commit no serious crimes. The Justice Department in April singled out Chicago and New York, saying they were crumbling under the weight of illegal immigration and violent crime, even though experts say illegal immigration had little to do with Chicagos spike in murders. Last month, a U.S. judge blocked a portion of Trumps executive order that sought to withhold most federal funds from so-called sanctuary cities as part of the administrations efforts to toughen immigration enforcement. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memo on Monday saying that only Department of Justice and Homeland Security grants would be at risk for cities that willfully refuse to comply with federal law. Sanctuary cities generally offer safe harbor to illegal immigrants and often do not use municipal funds or resources to advance the enforcement of federal immigration laws. Emanuel, whose grandparents came to the United States as immigrants from Moldova, said the campaign was meant to reassure those feeling frightened about deportation.

U.S. District Judge William Orrick III in San Francisco last month said Trumps order targeted broad categories of federal funding for sanctuary governments and that plaintiffs challenging the order were likely to succeed in proving it unconstitutional. The Republican presidents moves on immigration have galvanized legal advocacy groups, along with Democratic city and state governments, to oppose them in court. The administration suffered an earlier defeat when two federal judges suspended executive orders restricting travel from several Muslim-majority countries. The government has appealed those decisions. The new filing comes in the wake of a memo released on Monday in which Attorney General Jeff Sessions formally endorsed a narrower interpretation of Trumps order, saying that the only funds the government intended to withhold were certain grants tied to law enforcement programs.  The authoritative position set forth in the AG memorandum squarely contradicts the courts determination, DOJ lawyers wrote. In Orricks original ruling against the Trump order, he cited comments by the president and Sessions which suggested the government intended to target a much wider swath of federal funds.    Sanctuary cities generally offer safe harbor to illegal immigrants and often do not use municipal funds or resources to advance the enforcement of federal immigration laws. Dozens of local governments and cities, including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, have joined the growing sanctuary movement. Supporters of the sanctuary policy argue that enlisting police cooperation in rounding up immigrants for removal undermines communities trust in local police, particularly among Latinos. The Trump administration contends that local authorities endanger public safety when they decline to hand over for deportation illegal immigrants arrested for crimes. Santa Clara County, which includes the city of San Jose and several smaller Silicon Valley communities, sued in February, saying Trumps order was unconstitutional.

An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power is the follow up to An Inconvenient Truth, the documentary credited with bringing climate change into mainstream political discourse in the United States a decade ago.  Shot mostly before Trumps election, it features the Republican candidate on the campaign trail promising to abolish environmental regulations and boost the coal and oil industries. At one point Trump tells a rally: We need some global warming  its freezing! But with legal and political obstacles, Gore said Trump would be unable to stop the momentum that would shift society away from fossil fuels. We now know after four months of the Trump administration, no one person, not even a president, can stop the climate movement, Gore told a news conference at the French film festival. The courts have blocked parts of what President Trump has attempted and the Congress has refused to act on other parts of his agenda. The American people are determined to continue making progress and will do so, he added. Since he took office, Trumps administration has moved to unwind environmental rules but frustrated some conservatives by entertaining the idea of keeping the United States in a global pact to fight climate change. Gore expressed hope that Trump would opt not to quit the 2015 Paris deal on climate change signed by most countries in the world. I do believe that there is a better-than-even chance that he will surprise many by keeping the U.S. within the Paris agreement. I dont know that he will but I think there is a chance that he will. An Inconvenient Sequel premiered at the Sundance Festival in January to mixed reviews.  Variety said it was likely to be another event, a part of the conversation, a movie that glories, once again, in the incisive power of its inconvenience.  But the Hollywood Reporter said the documentarys big weakness was that Gore failed to tackle Trump strongly enough. Quite possibly, Gore thinks talking at this point would jeopardize any influence he might have in the soon-to-be gold-plated Oval Office, it wrote in January.

Flynn invoked his Fifth Amendment constitutional protection against self-incrimination, according to a letter to the Senate committee from his attorney, which was seen by Reuters. Flynns attorneys did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The retired lieutenant general is a key witness in the Russia probe, which has roiled the first months of President Donald Trumps presidency with a spate of negative news reports. Senators Richard Burr and Mark Warner, the top Republican and Democrat on the intelligence panel, said in a statement they were disappointed by Flynns decision, but would vigorously pursue his testimony and documents related to the investigation. The committee is conducting one of the main congressional probes into U.S. intelligence agency reports of Russian meddling in the election and whether there was collusion between Trumps campaign and Russia. Moscow has repeatedly denied the allegations and Trump denies any collusion. Separately on Monday, the Washington Post reported that Trump asked two of the countrys top intelligence officials, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and National Security Agency Director Admiral Michael Rogers, to help him deny any collusion between his team and Russia during his presidential campaign. Coats and Rogers declined the request, the Post reported. Flynn apparently misled Pentagon investigators about his foreign connections when he sought to renew his security clearance in early 2016, according to a document obtained by congressional Democrats and released in part on Monday. Interviewed as part of the clearance renewal process, Flynn said all of his foreign trips as a private citizen were funded by U.S. companies, according to excerpts of a March 14, 2016, report compiled by security clearance investigators. In fact, a trip Flynn made to Moscow in December 2015, where he attended a gala dinner and sat next to Russian President Vladimir Putin, was paid for by Russia Today, which U.S. officials consider a state-run propaganda arm, according to documents previously released by the House Oversight Committee. The document is the latest to shed light on how Flynn received a clearance and was hired as Trumps national security advisor. He was forced to resign in February after less than a month for failing to disclose the content of his talks with Sergei Kislyak, Russias ambassador to the United States, and misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations. Excerpts were released by Representative Elijah Cummings, ranking Democrat on the House committee. Flynns decision to decline to comply with the Senate Intelligence Committee subpoena was first reported by the Associated Press. His attorney wrote to the committee that the context in which the Committee has called for General Flynns testimonial production of documents makes clear that he has more than a reasonable apprehension that any testimony he provides could be used against him. Flynns legal team said he was rejecting the subpoena because the committee spurned his offer, made by the retired Army general in a May 8 letter, to give a full account of the facts and to answer the committees questions, should the circumstances permit, including assurances against unfair prosecution. We stated that, absent such assurances, General Flynn would respectfully decline your request for an interview and for production of documents. It was not clear what the committee would do if Flynn decided not to comply. Burr and Warren did not elaborate. Several panel members said they were waiting to learn more before coming to any conclusion about what might come next. Well see what the future brings, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein told reporters, adding:  This may portend that (Flynn) faces something serious.     Senator James Lankford, a Republican panel member, said Flynn was within his rights to invoke the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. We will get to the truth one way or another, Lankford said on Twitter. We need facts, not speculation & anonymous sources. A Congressional Research Service report outlined three main options if Congress decides to enforce the subpoena: seeking criminal prosecution through the executive branch, asking the courts for a civil judgment and using a dormant power of inherent contempt to detain and imprison an individual. The latter option has not been used in 75 years. Congress has more often relied on the criminal contempt statute recently. Reuters reported on Thursday that Flynn and other advisers to Trumps campaign were in contact with Russian officials and others with Kremlin ties in at least 18 calls and emails during the last seven months of the U.S. presidential race. Two other former Trump associates - one-time campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Republican operative Roger Stone - have turned over documents the Senate panel had requested, while a third - campaign adviser Carter Page - had not yet complied, NBC News reported, citing a congressional source. Flynn has acknowledged being a paid consultant to the Turkish government during the campaign. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The law in Texas, which has the longest border with Mexico of any U.S. state, takes effect on Sept. 1 and calls for jail time for police chiefs and sheriffs who fail to cooperate in U.S. immigration enforcement. The suit filed in a U.S. district court in San Antonio on behalf of the county and its sheriff names Republican Governor Greg Abbott and others as defendants. It said the law would invite unlawful racial profiling in the county of about 800,000 people where more than 80 percent of the population is of Hispanic heritage. History and logic supports that all Texans will not be equally subject to this harassment, the lawsuit said. Abbott has said the law known as Senate Bill 4 will keep criminals off of the streets. Republican backers said there were no major sanctuary cities in Texas and the law would prevent any from adopting such practices. It was the first such legislation approved by a state since Republican Donald Trump, who has called for a crackdown on illegal immigration, became president in January.  The Texas law allows police to ask people about their immigration status during a lawful detention. Supporters have said immigrants who do not break the law have nothing to fear, while critics contend it allows police to detain people for up to 48 hours for immigration checks, even for minor infractions such as jaywalking. Earlier in May, the small Texas border town of El Cenizo, filed suit against the Texas law in federal court, and many major Texas cities and counties have said they also intend to sue to halt its implementation. The Texas law has also faced criticism from the police chiefs of the states largest cities, who said it would divert resources from fighting crime to immigration law enforcement. They added it would widen a gap between police and immigrant communities and eliminate the potential for assistance from immigrants in solving or preventing crimes. In a newspaper editorial last week, Abbott along with the sheriff of Hidalgo County, a border county with about the same population as El Paso, said SB 4 specifically prohibited racial profiling and discrimination.

In a joint filing with the U.S. House of Representatives submitted to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, the administration and Republican lawmakers asked for a second 90-day extension. The subsidies are available to low-income Americans who buy individual health insurance on the exchanges created under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, former President Barack Obamas signature healthcare law, popularly known as Obamacare. President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers want to repeal and replace the law and are working on legislation to overhaul it that would also secure the subsidy funding during a transition period. But it is not clear if or when they will pass it. The two sides said they wanted more time because they were discussing measures that would no longer require a judicial decision, including the new healthcare legislation. Insurers that are trying to set premium rates for insurance plans to be sold in 2018 are running up against deadlines and have repeatedly asked Congress to fund the subsidies during the transition. One Republican senator said on Monday that he believed the money for the subsidies should be appropriated by Congress. I think we have to, Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana told reporters outside the Senate. We need to stabilize premiums, or were not going to have a market. He said he was speaking for himself and not Republican leaders. The legal case was filed by the Republican-led House against the Obama administration to cut off the subsidy payments. A lower court had ruled in favor of the lawmakers, saying that Congress must appropriate the money for the subsidies and that the government could not simply pay for them in the way it does now.  Insurers and medical groups reiterated their view on Monday after the court filing about continuing the payments, which amount to about $7 billion this year and help low-income consumers pay for out-of-pocket medical costs.  Uncertainty is destabilizing the market and leading health plans to raise their rates for 2018 to account for the political risk brought on by Congress and the administration through a protracted debate over the fate of these reimbursements, Margaret Murray, chief executive officer of the Association for Community Affiliated Plans, said in a statement. While the proposed legislation from the House would keep the payments through 2019, Trump has said he could stop paying the subsidies at any time. That has insurers concerned that the monthly government payments could end and leave them exposed financially.         Several insurers, including Aetna Inc and Humana Inc, have already exited the Obamacare marketplace for 2018. Credit Suisse analyst Scott Fidel said insurers such as Centene Corp and Molina Healthcare Inc that focus on the low-income families that qualify for the subsidies have the most at risk. Centene shares closed down 1.4 percent at $74.02 and Molina fell 0.8 percent to $66.84. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

In stressing threats from Iran, Trump echoed a theme laid out during weekend meetings in Saudi Arabia with Muslim leaders from around the world, many wary of the Islamic Republics growing regional influence and financial muscle. Trump has vowed to do whatever necessary to broker peace between Israel and the Palestinians, dubbing a peace accord the ultimate deal. But ahead of his Holy Land visit, he gave little indication of how he could revive talks that collapsed in 2014. Trump will meet Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank town of Bethlehem on Tuesday and the Palestinian leader said he hoped the meeting could be useful and fruitful ... (and) will bring results. But in the Gaza Strip, dozens of Palestinians rallied against Trump and burned his picture and an effigy of him. Trump received a warm welcome in Riyadh from Arab leaders, especially over his tough line on Tehran, which many Sunni Muslim Arab states regard as seeking regional control. In Jerusalem, in public remarks after talks with Israeli leaders on the first day of his two-day visit, he again focused on Iran, pledging he would never let Tehran acquire nuclear arms. Whats happened with Iran has brought many of the parts of the Middle East toward Israel, Trump said at a meeting with President Reuven Rivlin. In his comments to Netanyahu, Trump mentioned a growing Iranian influence in conflicts in Syria, Yemen and Iraq, where it either backs Shiite fighters or has sent its own forces. Trump said there were opportunities for cooperation across the Middle East: That includes advancing prosperity, defeating the evils of terrorism and facing the threat of an Iranian regime that is threatening the region and causing so much violence and suffering. He also welcomed what he said was Netanyahus commitment to pursuing peace and renewed his pledge to achieve a deal.  Netanyahu, in his remarks, did not mention the word Palestinians, but spoke of advancing peace in our region with Arab partners helping to deliver it. Israel shares the antipathy many Arab states have toward Iran, seeing the Islamic Republic as a threat to its existence.  I want you to know how much we appreciate the change in American policy on Iran which you enunciated so clearly, Netanyahu, who had an acrimonious relationship with former U.S. President Barack Obama, told Trump at his official residence. Trump, who is on his maiden foreign trip since taking office in January, urged Iran to cease its deadly funding, training and equipping of terrorists and militias. Irans newly re-elected, pragmatist president, Hassan Rouhani, said regional stability could not be achieved without Iranian help, and accused Washington of supporting terrorism with its backing for rebels in Syria. He said the summit in Saudi Arabia had no political value, and will bear no results. Who can say the region will experience total stability without Iran? Who fought against the terrorists? It was Iran, Syria, Hezbollah and Syria. But who funded the terrorists? Rouhani noted the contrast between young Iranians dancing in the streets to mark the re-election of a leader seeking detente with the West, and images of Trump meeting with a galaxy of Arab autocrats, some of whose countries have spawned the Sunni militants hostile to Washington and Tehran alike.  He also said Iran would continue a ballistic missile program that has already triggered U.S. sanctions, saying it was for defensive purposes only. Trumps foreign tour comes in the shadow of difficulties at home, where he is struggling to contain a scandal after firing James Comey as FBI director nearly two weeks ago. The trip ends on Saturday after visits to the Vatican, Brussels and Sicily. In Jerusalems walled Old City, Trump toured the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and became the first sitting president to visit the Western Wall, Judaisms holiest place where Israel allows Jews to pray in a city sacred to three religions.

The last of the four statues, of Confederate General Robert E. Lee, was taken down on Friday. The Confederacy was made up of states that attempted to preserve slavery in the South and secede from the United States in the Civil War of 1861 to 1865. Oliver, a first-term lawmaker, said the monuments had been erected in the memory of our family and fellow Southern Americans and compared those taking them down them to Nazis.

The decision came in one of a number of lawsuits accusing Republicans of taking steps at the state level to disenfranchise black and other minority voters who tend to back Democratic candidates. The justices found that the manner in which the North Carolina voting district boundaries were sketched violated the U.S. Constitutions guarantee of equal protection under the law. The ruling may offer a roadmap for challenging similarly drawn districts nationwide. The justices unanimously upheld the lower court on one of the districts and split 5-3 on the other, with three conservatives dissenting. The North Carolina Republican legislature tried to rig congressional elections by drawing unconstitutional districts that discriminated against African-Americans and thats wrong, said North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, a Democrat took office in January. Critics accused Republicans of cramming black voters into what the NAACP civil rights group called apartheid voting districts to diminish their voting power and make surrounding districts more white and more likely to support Republicans. Both districts are held by the Democrats. Of North Carolinas 13 representatives in the U.S. House, 10 are Republican. I dont know how any legislature can perform this task when the rules change constantly from case to case, often after the fact, Robin Hayes, chairman of the state Republican Party, said of redistricting. Democrats have accused Republicans of taking a number of actions at the state level, also including laws imposing new requirements on voters such as presenting certain types of government-issued identification, in a bid to suppress the vote of minorities, the poor and others who generally favor Democratic candidates. Republicans have said the laws are needed to prevent voter fraud. Race can be considered in redrawing boundaries of voting districts only in certain instances, such as when states are seeking to comply with the federal Voting Rights Act. That law protects minority voters and was enacted to address a history of racial discrimination in voting, especially in Southern states. Eric Holder, who was U.S. attorney general under President Barack Obama and now heads the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, a group backing Democrats in redistricting fights, welcomed the decision. Todays ruling sends a stark message to legislatures and governors around the country: Racial gerrymandering is illegal and will be struck down in a court of law, Holder said, referring to altering political boundaries to give a party an unfair advantage. The ruling was a rebuke to North Carolina Republicans but the districts in question have already been re-drawn. The new districts already have been challenged in court.  The Supreme Court has never said legislative districts cannot be mapped based on plainly partisan aims like maximizing one partys election chances. North Carolina Republicans said one of the two districts, called the 12th congressional district, was drawn on purely partisan grounds to benefit Republicans at the expense of Democrats, and the other was drawn to comply with the demands of the Voting Rights Act. The split among the justices was over the 12th district. Conservative Justice Samuel Alito wrote in dissent that the court should have followed an earlier precedent in which a previous version of the same district was challenged. A precedent of this court should not be treated like a disposable household item  say a paper plate or a napkin  to be used once and then tossed in the trash, Alito wrote. Writing for the courts majority, liberal Justice Elena Kagan countered that evidence at trial adequately supports the conclusion that race, not politics, accounted for the districts reconfiguration. Conservative Clarence Thomas, the courts only black justice, joined Kagans ruling. Justice Neil Gorsuch, who had not yet joined the court when it heard arguments in the case in December, did not participate. The justices last week rebuffed a Republican bid to revive a strict North Carolina voter-identification law that a lower court found deliberately discriminated against black voters. The Supreme Court in 2013 struck down a key part of the Voting Rights Act in a ruling driven by its conservative justices. Since then it has faulted some Republican redistricting efforts for racial reasons. In 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that Alabamas Republican-backed legislature improperly crammed black voters into certain districts. The justices on March 1 ordered a lower court to reassess whether Virginias Republican-led legislature unlawfully tried to dilute the power of black voters. The justices threw out the lower courts decision upholding 12 state legislature districts. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""DUBAI (Reuters) - The images from the same night broadcast around the Middle East speak as loudly as the words. On the one hand: the young people of Iran, dancing in the streets to mark the re-election of a pragmatist, men and women together. On the other: the president of the United States, swaying through an all-male sword dance under the stars with the absolute rulers of Saudi Arabia, where publicly calling for any form of political change risks prosecution. President Donald Trump told admiring Arab absolute monarchs and military strongmen in a gilt chamber at the weekend that he wanted peace, security and prosperity, and the United States was not there to tell them how to run their own countries. He joined them in berating their arch-foe Iran, and signed a $110 billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia that put him firmly on one side of the sectarian divide fuelling most of the Middle Easts wars. The contrast between the two scenes was noted by Irans newly re-elected president, Hassan Rouhani, who has sought to reach out to the West while batting back hardliners at home. Buying arms or building weapons wont make a country powerful, Rouhani told a news conference on Monday. The foundation of power is national strength and this only happens through elections. Trump saw millions of Iranians took part in an election, but he visited a country whose people have not seen a ballot box and dont know what an election is. PRE-OBAMA ERA ON STEROIDS Trumps attempt to orchestrate a Muslim and Arab coalition against Iran was a repudiation of the regional policy of his predecessor Barack Obama, whose administration held the first direct talks with Tehran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Although Washington and Tehran were still a long way from normalizing their relations, Obama reached an accord to lift sanctions in return for Iran curbing its nuclear program, which Trump repeatedly slated as the worst deal ever signed. By swinging American policy back to firm support for the Sunni Arab states, Trump has jettisoned that carefully constructed balance, said Jean-Marc Rickli, Head of Global Risk and Resilience at the Geneva Centre for Security Policy.  We are back in the pre-Obama era, on steroids, he said. Under Obama you had this attempt of the USA playing the external balancer in the region. Now the regional balancer has gone. The balancer has chosen his camp. Just as dramatically, Trump also repudiated the policies of Obamas Republican predecessor George W. Bush, who promised to spread democracy across the Middle East in a landmark 2003 speech that declared freedom can be the future of every nation. Trump told his audience of autocrats: We are not here to lecture you. We are not here to tell other people how to live, what to do, who to be or how to worship. Washingtons alliance with the mainly Sunni Muslim countries of the Arab world against Shiite Iran is decades old. But in practice the United States has had to improvise in recent years when choosing its friends in a more complex Middle East, where enemies can appear on either side of the sectarian divide. Washington and Tehran are still frequently on opposing sides, most notably in Syria, where Iran supports the government of President Bashar al-Assad. But elsewhere, notably Iraq, U.S. forces are fighting on the same side as Shiites close to Iran. Obamas outreach to Tehran reflected that reality. But those subtleties were cast aside on Sunday when Trump nodded approvingly as Saudi King Salman described Iran as the tip of the spear of terrorism in the Middle East. A senior U.S. official defended the initiative, citing a common threat from terrorist organizations as well as from Iranian subversion throughout the region. In fact, most of the militant groups U.S. troops have fought in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington, such as al Qaeda, Islamic State and the Taliban, are Sunni Muslims who consider Shiite Iran their enemy. The timing of Trumps uncompromising call for a U.S.-backed axis against Iran was particularly awkward because it coincided with the re-election of Rouhani, swept to a second term on his promises to seek rapprochement with the West. Although democracy in Iran has clear limits - all candidates must be vetted by a hardline body and the unelected supreme leader can veto policies of the elected government - it still goes further than in most of the countries that attended Trumps speech, a fact noticed across the region. U.S. arms deals for Irans Sunni foes help bolster the case of Rouhanis hardline opponents, who say any detente with the West is dangerous folly. The Riyadh summit showed that the passivity of Rouhanis government has emboldened the enemies of Iran, wrote Hossein Shariatmadari, editor-in-chief of Kayhan, a newspaper closely associated with security hardliners who opposed Rouhani.         Small and weak countries that could not imagine a fight with Iran, are now publicly talking about forming a military alliance against it. The Revolutionary Guards (IRGC), the powerful Iranian security force that supported Rouhanis hardline opponent in the election, has the power to stir up confrontation across the region to undermine Rouhani at home. All the indicators point to a further arms race in the region and on the rhetorical level we are on a path of escalation, said Rickli. You just need a small trigger that can escalate the situation on the ground.  I would not be surprised to see an increase in hostilities in Syria and Yemen. Also, the IRGC might want to foster pro-Shia groups in Bahrain and some parts of Kuwait to regain power after the elections, Rickli said. Putting a huge arms deal at the center of the visit also plays into the hands of foes who say U.S. policy is driven mainly by money. Saudi Arabia is both the worlds biggest exporter of oil and one of the worlds biggest importers of military hardware made in the West. Trump boasted about the jobs that would be created at home by the arms deals he signed. We will make sure to help our Saudi friends to get a good deal from our great American defense companies, the greatest anywhere in the world, Trump said in his speech. Doubling down on Saudi Arabia has a lot to do with trade and investment considerations.The supporting allies, anti-terrorism and anti-Iranian rhetoric provides a cover for that, said Richard Dalton a former UK ambassador in the Middle East. But the policy could be counter-productive, he said. Furthering more enmity with Iran, rather than seeking common ground and interests at a time when Iran is ready to reach out diplomatically on the regions long-term problems, is going to work against the long term aim of a peaceful and stable Middle East.

The majority of the people of Israel, unlike the media, they love us, so we tell them how you are great and they love you, Sara said to Trump and his wife.  Trump then interjected: We have something very much in common. Trumps presidency has received widespread negative coverage in the U.S. and international media, not least over his firing of FBI director James Comey and amid an investigation into ties between his administration and Russia. In Israel on the second leg of his first overseas trip since entering office, Trump is to hold talks separately with Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in a stopover lasting barely 28 hours. Speaking over the noise of the presidents jet, Sara Netanyahu added: I talk every place about how great you are, she said, and Netanyahu backed her up saying: I can testify to that. Netanyahu and his wife have a tense relationship with the Israeli media, which they have both described as biased against them. In January, Netanyahu described the media as left-wing and Bolshevik and said they were out to bring him down.  Testifying in a libel suit the Netanyahus filed against an Israeli journalist, Sara Netanyahu told the court: Everything that is published about me, its all lies, evil lies that bear no connection with who I really am ... The media uses me as a tool to try and topple the prime minister. Saras red-carpet conversation soon began circulating on social media, along with another awkward arrival moment.  As the Netanyahus strode along holding hands, as they often do, Trump, walking alongside them, reached out to grasp the First Ladys hand, but video circulated on Twitter appeared to show Melania Trump briefly flicking his hand away.

Reuters reported on April 26 that public pension funds in at least seven U.S. states periodically send millions of dollars to an investment fund that owns the upscale Trump SoHo Hotel and Condominium in New York City and pays a Trump company to run it, according to a Reuters review of public records. Trump may be profiting from the retirement plans of millions of our nations public servants, Senator Patty Murray of Washington state wrote in a letter to Walter Shaub, the director of the Office of Government Ethics, citing the Reuters report. The Office of Government Ethics is the U.S. agency that oversees conduct within the executive branch and supervises ethics officials to ensure they are preventing conflicts of interest and other violations. This looks like exactly the type of monetary flow prohibited by the Constitution, said the senator. Murray, who is on the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, asked Shaub to assess what steps Trump can take to ensure he is in compliance with Article II of the U.S. Constitution, which bars the president from receiving additional payments beyond his salary from state governments.  The fees that public pension funds pay the CIM Fund III investment fund that owns the Trump SoHo may fall into that category, several constitutional lawyers have told Reuters. The White House, the Trump Organization, and the Office of Government Ethics did not respond to multiple requests for comment.  At a January news conference at which Trump said he would turn over management of his companies to a trust controlled by his two elder sons, his lawyer, Sheri Dillon, said divesting from his businesses would exacerbate potential conflicts of interest because Trump would still be entitled to royalties from the use of his brand. Some of the pension funds have said Trump or the investment fund that owns the hotel should answer concerns about the chain because they do not have control over the assets in the investment funds portfolio. Others declined to comment on the payment chain between them and Trump.  Other Democratic U.S. senators have criticized the president for not divesting his hotel management company and the hundreds of other businesses that make up the Trump Organization. Democratic Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland said Trump was setting an extremely dangerous precedent by maintaining ownership. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The United States is Israels single-largest trading partner by country, but third-largest regional market behind Europe and Asia. Israel was the first country to sign a Free Trade Agreement with the U.S., in 1985. In 2016, the U.S. exported $8.1 billion of goods and services to Israel while importing $17.6 billion from Israel for a trade deficit of nearly $10 billion.  Overall, the United States has a global foreign trade deficit of about $44 billion. Only 11 percent of total imports into Israel come from the U.S. Already our two countries do a great deal of business together. We have a strong foundation on which to build an even closer trading relationship that benefits both of our countries, Trump said in a speech after meeting Israeli President Reuven Rivlin. He then turned away from his script to Rivlin and added half-jokingly: Im going to try and narrow that trade deficit just a little bit, is that okay? Trumps administration has ordered a study into the causes of U.S. trade deficits and a clamp-down on import duty evasion. He believes that large deficits are slowing American growth and employment. Over the first four months of 2017, the U.S. trade deficit with Israel has narrowed, to $2.8 billion from $3.3 billion in the same period last year, mainly due to higher U.S. exports to Israel. While Israel maintains a trade surplus with the United States, it has deficits with Europe and Asia. Hoping to re-start frozen Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, Trump earlier landed in Israel on the second leg of a trip that began with a weekend visit to Saudi Arabia.

The Republican Party of Louisiana had argued that a provision of the 2002 Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act violates free speech rights under the U.S. Constitution. But the justices let stand a lower courts ruling that rejected the Republican challenge. The brief order noted that conservative Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch favored hearing the case. The conservative-leaning court in recent years has rolled back campaign finance restrictions. In 2010, the court paved the way to unlimited outside spending on elections in a case called FEC v. Citizens United that concerned corporate spending. In 2014, the court struck down limits on the total amount individuals can donate during the federal two-year election cycle. Both those decisions eroded sections of the 2002 law. The measure is commonly known as the McCain-Feingold law after the two senators who sponsored it, Republican John McCain and Democrat Russ Feingold. It barred state and local parties from taking unlimited donations for any activities concerning federal elections. Such donations are often called soft money because they are unregulated. They were a key target of the 2002 law.  The Supreme Court has previously turned down similar cases challenging party campaign finance restrictions, including one in 2010 just after the Citizens United decision that focused on the national parties and was brought by the Republican National Committee.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The man who led President Donald Trumps transition team for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Myron Ebell, told a conservative conference last month that the new administration is moving too slowly to unravel climate change regulations. In closed-door remarks to members of the conservative Jefferson Institute in Virginia on April 18, a recording of which was obtained by Reuters, Ebell said Trumps administration had made a series of missteps, including delays in appointing key EPA officials, that could hamper efforts to cut red tape for industry. This is an impending disaster for the Trump administration,Ebell, a prominent climate change doubter, said in the recording provided to the Center for Media and Democracy and shared with Reuters. Ebell was chosen by Trumps campaign to lead the EPAs transition until the Jan. 20 inauguration, a choice that had reinforced expectations Trump would follow through on promises to rescind Obama-era green rules and pull the United States out of a global pact to fight climate change. Ebell had been seen as a candidate for the EPA administrator job, a post that ultimately went to former Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt.  Ebell no longer works at the agency but remains influential within a faction of the U.S. conservative movement with ties to the Trump administration. His criticism reflects a broader disappointment by some conservatives about Pruitts focus and commitment to scrapping even more complex Obama-era regulations.         Since taking office, Trump and Pruitt have moved to unwind environmental regulations, including former President Barack Obamas Clean Power Plan to reduce carbon emissions from electricity generators. But his administration has frustrated some conservatives by entertaining the idea of remaining in the Paris Climate Agreement, and hesitating to tackle the Obama-era endangerment finding that concludes carbon dioxide is a public health threat and underlies many U.S. regulations governing emissions. Lawyers have said challenging that scientific finding could be time consuming and legally complex.  Pruitt has said he does not want the United States to remain in the Paris agreement but he has not yet decided to tackle the endangerment finding. At least three conservative groups have filed petitions asking the EPA to overturn the finding. Paris and the endangerment finding are the two big outstanding issues. Its the first wave of things that are necessary to turn this country around, particularly in the heartland states, Ebell said at the conference. Ebell cited the slow pace of key EPA appointments, including deputy administrator and various assistant administrators, a lack of experienced personnel at the White House, deep ideological divisions between the presidents close advisers, and an imperfect choice of EPA administrator, as the main reasons Trump was not acting more aggressively on climate rules. He said Trump strategists should have allowed his transition team to roll out the full de-regulatory agenda before Trump took office, instead of delaying. The new president doesnt have long before inertia sets in, he said. He also found fault in Trumps choice of Pruitt to run the EPA, saying the former state attorney is a clever lawyer but his political ambition may distract him from taking-on time-consuming efforts like challenging the endangerment finding.    A spokesman for Pruitt responded to Ebells assertions, saying Pruitt had been implementing Trumps executive orders and had spearheaded about two dozen regulatory reform actions since taking up his position. Ebell also faulted Trump for choosing advisers with broadly different political perspectives and backgrounds - something he said was triggering paralyzing debate, instead of action. Hes got people on different sides and they are all fighting over who gets these jobs and nobody has the clout except the president to say, Hey fix this, lets get this done, Ebell said.     In a statement given to Reuters on Saturday, Ebell said he is still concerned about the White House log-jam in nominating people for key EPA posts and the delay in making the Paris decision. But he said he supports Pruitt as an administrator and is encouraged by his recent actions. Pruitt was an excellent choice to head the EPA, and minor disagreements aside, his recent actions have made me even more confident that he will be an outstanding administrator, he said.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""RIYADH (Reuters) - President Donald Trump urged Arab and Islamic leaders on Sunday to unite and do their share to defeat Islamist extremists, making an impassioned plea to drive out terrorists while toning down his own harsh rhetoric about Muslims. Trump singled out Iran as a key source of funding and support for militant groups. His words aligned with the views of his Saudi Arabian hosts and sent a tough message to Tehran the day after Hassan Rouhani won a second term as Irans president. The U.S. president did not use his signature term radical Islamic terrorism in the speech, a signal that he heeded advice to employ a more moderate tone in the region after using the phrase repeatedly as a presidential candidate. Terrorism has spread all across the world. But the path to peace begins right here, on this ancient soil, in this sacred land, Trump told leaders from about 50 Muslim-majority countries representing more than a billion people. A better future is only possible if your nations drive out the terrorists and drive out the extremists. Drive them out! Drive them out of your places of worship, drive them out of your communities, drive them out of your holy land and drive them out of this earth. The presidents first speech abroad provided an opportunity to show his strength and resolve, in contrast to his struggle to contain a mushrooming scandal at home after his firing of former FBI Director James Comey nearly two weeks ago.    He portrayed the conflict as one between good and evil, not between civilizations, and made clear in a forceful tone that Washington would partner with the Middle East but expected more action in return. There is still much work to be done. That means honestly confronting the crisis of Islamic extremism, and the Islamists, and Islamic terror of all kinds, he said in his speech.  The advance excerpts of the speech had him saying Islamist extremism. A White House official blamed Trumps fatigue for the switch. Just an exhausted guy, she told reporters.  The term Islamist extremism refers to Islamism as a political movement rather than Islam as a religion, a distinction that the Republican president had frequently criticized the administration of his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, for making. As a candidate, Trump proposed temporarily banning Muslims from entering the United States. In office, he ordered temporary bans on people from several Muslim-majority countries, which have been blocked by courts that ruled they were discriminatory. The speech in a gilded hall bedecked with chandeliers is part of an effort to redefine his relationship with the Muslim world. Trumps America first philosophy helped him win the 2016 election and has rattled allies who depend on U.S. support for their defense. Trump received a warm welcome from Arab leaders, who set aside his campaign rhetoric and focused on his desire to crack down on Irans influence in the region, a commitment they found wanting in Obama. For decades, Iran has fueled the fires of sectarian conflict and terror, Trump said. It is a government that speaks openly of mass murder, vowing the destruction of Israel, death to America, and ruin for many leaders and nations in this very room. Trump did not make overt mentions of human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia or the other Gulf nations in his speech. White House officials has said he did not want to lecture, something they believe Obama did, unsuccessfully.  Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif fired back at Trump in a tweet that Trump had attacked Iran in that bastion of democracy & moderation of Saudi Arabia and suggested he had milked his hosts for hundreds of billions of dollars in business deals.      Introducing Trump, Saudi King Salman described their mutual foe Iran as the source of terrorism they must confront together. Our responsibility before God and our people and the whole world is to stand united to fight the forces of evil and extremism wherever they are ... The Iranian regime represents the tip of the spear of global terrorism, the king said.  Iran is a Shiite Muslim country. The groups the United States has been fighting in Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on Washington and New York are mostly Sunni Muslims, and enemies of Iran. Iranian-backed militia are also fighting Islamic State militants in Iraq. The United States and Gulf Arab countries announced an agreement to coordinate efforts against the financing of terrorist groups. Trumps welcome in the region was put on display during a series of individual meetings with Arab leaders. He praised Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, telling him: You have done a tremendous job under trying circumstances. The Obama administration had a difficult relationship with Sisi, who came to power after leading a military coup in 2013 during which hundreds of demonstrators were killed, and has since jailed thousands of opponents. Trump promised to schedule a trip to Egypt soon, and he singled out the Egyptians choice of footwear, a pair of shiny black shoes. Love your shoes. Boy, those shoes, he said. To Bahrains King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa, Trump declared that the two nations had a lot in common and there wont be strain with this administration. The king lauded the relationship and said it had led to great stability in the region and prosperity. Bahrain is home to the U.S. fleet in the Middle East. Its Sunni Muslim royal family rules over a majority Shiite population and was occasionally rebuked by the Obama administration for harsh treatment of opponents. Trumps Riyadh visit kicked off his first presidential trip abroad, with Saudi Arabia the first stop on a nine-day journey through the Middle East and Europe. Soon after Trump embarked on his trip on Friday, he was hit with more accusations that, with Comeys firing on May 9, he was trying to squelch a federal investigation into his campaigns ties with Russia last year.

A Republican healthcare bill that passed the U.S. House of Representatives in early May seeks to overhaul the national healthcare system and cut more than $800 billion over the next 10 years from Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor and disabled. The healthcare bill faces a difficult time in the Senate, where Democrats and some Republicans worry about its impact on costs for low-income Americans, among other issues.

The gist of the conversation was that the president feels as if he is hamstrung in his ability to work with Russia to find areas of cooperation because this has been obviously so much in the news, National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster said on ABCs This Week with George Stephanopoulos program. On the Fox News Sunday show Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Trump was also trying to convey to the Russians that he was not going to be distracted by all these issues at home that affect us domestically. Tillerson and McMaster were present at the May 10 meeting where Trump discussed his firing of James Comey, the former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, with Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister and Sergei Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States.  The New York Times, citing officials familiar with an internal White House summary of the meeting, reported that Trump referred to Comey as a nut job and said his removal would relieve great pressure coming from the agencys probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Lavrov denied that the subject of Comey came up during the meeting, according to Interfax news agency. Russian President Vladimir Putin had offered to provide the U.S. Congress with transcripts of the same meeting to counter reports that Trump also disclosed classified information to Lavrov about a planned Islamic State operation. However, neither McMaster nor Tillerson on Sunday disputed that the subject of Comeys dismissal came up in the meeting with Russian officials. Both said that Trumps remarks had been misinterpreted. A steady drip of revelations about the meeting and the broader issue of Trump administrations ties to Russia have complicated the presidents policy agenda and threatened to overshadow his first foreign trip. Trump arrived on Saturday in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, the first leg of a nine-day trip and is due to go to Israel on Monday. The trip also includes stops at the Vatican, a NATO meeting in Brussels and the Group of Seven summit in Sicily.  Last week, former FBI director Robert Mueller was named special counsel to investigate alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and possible collusion between Trumps campaign and Moscow. Russia has denied any meddling and Trump has said there was no collusion between his campaign and Russia. Two sources told Reuters on Friday the administration was exploring whether it could use an obscure ethics rule to undermine Muellers investigation. In response, Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Minority Leader, said on Saturday she would introduce legislation aimed at protecting Muellers probe. U.S. lawmakers from both parties have expressed varying degrees of concern about ties between the Trump administration and Russia and the presidents handling of the matter. Republican U.S. Senator John McCain of Arizona told Fox News Sunday he was left speechless by reports of Trumps remarks about Comey in the May 10 meeting. I dont know how to read it except that, Im almost speechless because I dont know why someone would say something like that, McCain said, adding that the president should never have met with the Russian officials. Republican Representative Jason Chaffetz, the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, said on ABCs This Week with George Stephanolpoulos show he was trying to obtain notes from the meeting and expected to speak to the former FBI director on Monday.  On the same program, Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the House panel, called on Chaffetz to subpoena the White House for documents related to the committees probe into Comeys firing.  Comey is set to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is also examining Russias role in the election and possible ties to Trumps campaign, in two weeks. Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican on the panel, told CNNs State of the Union program on Sunday he would ask the former FBI director whether he ever felt pressured to not do his job. If any president tries to impede an investigation  any president, no matter who it is  by interfering with the FBI, yes, that would be problematic. That would be not just problematic, it would be obviously a potential obstruction of justice that people have to make a decision on, Rubio said. Rubio emphasized that he will reserve judgment until he has seen all the evidence and heard from sources, including Comey. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Officials on board the Riyadh-bound presidential plane scrambled to coordinate with staff in Washington and those who had just landed in the Saudi capital for a response to the New York Times story about Comey. A second bombshell came from the Washington Post, which reported that a federal investigation about Russian contacts with the Trump campaign last year had reached a current White House official, who was not named. White House chief of staff Reince Priebus sought to play down the reports of disarray. Speaking to reporters on Air Force One, Priebus said Trump had spent the flight reading newspapers, meeting with national security advisers and other staff, getting briefed about the trip and getting a little sleep. But the sense of frustration was clear. Presidential aide Dan Scavino captured the mood of confrontation, seizing on a comment from Trumps nemesis in the 2016 Republican presidential race, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who called Trump a chaos president for all the bad headlines of late. Scavino fired back by reviving the derogatory nickname Trump had given Bush last year to raise doubts about his energy level and ultimately defeat him. LOW ENERGY JEB is out of stock on Jebbity JEB Jebbers. Perhaps @RedBull or @MonsterEnergy could help out. \\_( )_/ Scavino tweeted. Trumps nine-day tour takes him to four countries. White House staffers, shell-shocked from the daily barrage of bad news, were soldiering on, trying to keep the focus on a trip that could bring some significant achievements. Were focused on that. The media will talk about what they talk about and people will get hysterical about what they get hysterical about but theres a lot of people who are not focused on the day-to-day horse race and they are just making sure that the presidents objectives are followed through on, a senior aide told Reuters. It will be Trumps longest time away from the White House since he took office on Jan. 20. He is joined on the trip by some aides who have squabbled in the past but who have sought to set aside their differences to try to advance the presidents agenda, such as his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and senior strategist, Steve Bannon. Trumps agenda has been sidetracked by the hubbub over his firing of Comey and the appointment of a special counsel to investigate the Russia ties. I think this foreign trip is something theyre all looking forward to because it changes the narrative. It buys them a little time, said a Republican close to the White House.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In the Trump White House, its getting lonely at the top. President Donald Trumps fellow Republicans in Congress are showing signs of going their own way, both on politics and policy, determined to salvage what they can of their agenda on healthcare and tax reform in the wake of one of the most difficult weeks of any American presidency. At the same time, Trumps failure to fill senior roles at federal agencies means he does not have a cadre of loyalists who can help rein in a bureaucracy that many in Trumps orbit believe are out to leak information intended to damage the president. That has worsened the isolation of the White House in a city that relies on friends and allies to shake off a crisis. The result is problems on multiple fronts: a government whose bonds with Congress, federal agencies and the public look increasingly fractured; an ambitious but stalled program of reforms; and a president whose low approval ratings threaten his partys control of Congress in the 2018 midterm elections. Trump and his beleaguered staff, some White House aides told Reuters, feel besieged by a parade of negative stories and abandoned by fellow Republicans on Capitol Hill, as the furor over the firing of FBI Director James Comey and allegations that Trump tried to influence the probe into Russian meddling in last years election show little sign of abating. Since Tuesday, when leaked excerpts of a purported memo by Comey detailing his conversations with Trump were made public, few Republicans beyond the White House have rushed to the airwaves to push back against suggestions that the president may have obstructed justice in asking Comey to end the probe into the conduct of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. As the Russia probe entered a new phase on Wednesday with the appointment of former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel in the investigation, a move that will likely place the White House under even stronger scrutiny, some Republicans expressed surprise that the White House had not done more to recruit them to backstop the president. Its kind of funny. The answer is no, said Senator James Inhofe, a Republican from Oklahoma, when asked by Reuters whether the White House had reached out to him to come to Trumps defense. I dont know anyone else that has been contacted.  The White House did not respond to a request for comment on this story. Trump left on Friday for his first foreign trip as president. The 10-day trip will take him to Saudi Arabia, Israel, and Europe.  The administration has continued to struggle to fill the hundreds of open positions at senior levels of government that remain open, leaving the White House alone to grapple with one challenge after another. For example, the Justice Department still lacks senior officials in place to head up the anti-trust, civil rights, criminal, and civil divisions, as well as the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, according to its website. At the Department of Homeland Security, the chiefs of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Transportation Security Administration, have yet to be confirmed. And at the Department of Education, a sprawling bureaucracy of 4,400 employees with a $68 billion budget, all the key roles except for the secretary remain empty or filled with people in an acting capacity, said a Department of Education official. Nobody knows when or if they will be filled anytime soon, said the official, who declined to be identified by name. The department did not respond to a request for comment. Trump has frequently complained that Senate Democrats have stalled the approval process for his nominees. But the White House has also been slower to send nominees to the Senate than previous administrations. Many top State Department posts also remain vacant. One consequence, say several officials, is that department experts played little role in briefing Trump for his telephone call to Russian President Vladimir Putin or his meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Ambassador Sergei Kislyak, where officials say he disclosed highly classified intelligence. State Department and intelligence officials say that as power is increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few Trump loyalists in the White House, the roles of professional Foreign Service, intelligence and civil service officers have shrunk compared to past administrations. For instance, said two U.S. diplomats, no one from the State Department attended Trumps Feb. 15 meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - a sharp contrast from past administrations which would typically staff such a high-profile meeting with high-level State Department officials. Asked for comment, the State Department would not address the circumstances of the meeting with the Russian officials in the Oval Office, but did speak to the efforts involving Netanyahu and the Middle East.  As the president has repeatedly noted, Middle East peace is a top priority for this administration, a department spokesperson said. This is an effort supported by both the White House and the State Department.Claims that the State Department has not been involved have no basis in facts. Overall, more than 500 of the 557 federal government positions requiring Senate confirmation remain vacant. Only 33 nominees have been confirmed, and only 57 other positions now have a nominee, according to the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization in Washington.  A lack of communication from the White House left many Republicans on Capitol Hill frustrated as a sense of crisis mushroomed over the past week. One, Richard Burr, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is conducting its own Russia probe, publicly complained about the situation. Tuesday morning, after news broke the previous evening that Trump had shared classified information with Russian officials, Burr said he couldnt get through to the White House, as the story lit up television news programs and buzzed online.  Maybe theyre busy, he said. Some Republicans said the constant focus on responding to allegations concerning the Russia probe was draining their caucus of focus and energy to push through their agenda. Absent guidance, Republican staff members in Congress were beginning to devise their own strategy about how to respond to the gusher of bad news, one aide told Reuters.  And at the White House, with lines of communication to Congress seemingly frayed at times, a narrowing circle of people has come to the presidents defense, as senior staff grapple not only with the cascade of revelations but with a president who at times contradicts on Twitter their talking points. Everyone is just tired, said one White House aide. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The reports, emerging just as Trump jetted off to Saudi Arabia on his first foreign trip as president, were likely to extend the turmoil engulfing his administration since the May 9 firing of former FBI Director James Comey. The Washington Post, citing sources familiar with the matter, did not identify the senior Trump adviser except to say that the person of interest was close to Trump, a Republican who entered the White House four months ago. U.S. law enforcement uses the term a person of interest to mean someone who is part of a criminal investigation but not arrested or formally accused of a crime. The person may be cooperating or have information of use to investigators. Separately the New York Times reported that Trump boasted to Russian officials at a White House meeting last week that firing Comey relieved great pressure the president faced from a law-enforcement probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.  I just fired the head of the FBI. He was crazy, a real nut job, Trump said, according to the Times, which cited a document summarizing the meeting and read to it by an unnamed U.S. official. I faced great pressure because of Russia. Thats taken off. Trump met Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russias ambassador to Washington in the Oval Office the day after Trump fired Comey, who was in charge of the Russia election probe. The Times said the document was based on notes taken from inside the Oval Office. Reuters was not immediately able to verify the accuracy of that account. Comey, who has not spoken publicly in the 10 days since he was fired, will testify in an open session of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, which is investigating possible Russian meddling in the 2016 election.  Committee leaders said on Friday he would appear sometime after the U.S. Memorial Day holiday on May 29. I am hopeful that he will clarify for the American people recent events that have been broadly reported in the media, the committee chairman, Republican Richard Burr, said in a statement announcing the appearance. Public approval of Trump has dropped to its lowest level since his inauguration, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday. The May 14-18 opinion poll found that 38 percent of adults approved of Trump while 56 percent disapproved. The remaining 6 percent had mixed feelings. U.S. stocks immediately pared gains after the reports but still closed higher for a second straight day. Earlier this week, investors dumped stocks in response to reports that Trump in February had asked Comey to stop investigating his former national security adviser, prompting accusations the president may have tried to hamper the probe. As the president has stated before - a thorough investigation will confirm that there was no collusion between the campaign and any foreign entity, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said in a statement in response to the Post report. After days of political tumult in Washington, the Justice Department announced the appointment on Thursday of a special counsel to look into Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible collusion by the Trump campaign. The Times report added to the impression given by Trump himself in a television interview last week in which he said the Russia issue was a factor in firing Comey. The White House has given different versions of the reasons for the dismissal. Asked about the Times report, Spicer said of the former FBI chief, by grandstanding and politicizing the investigation into Russias actions, James Comey created unnecessary pressure on our ability to engage and negotiate with Russia. The investigation would have always continued, and obviously, the termination of Comey would not have ended it, Spicer said, adding that the real story was the leaks of private and highly classified conversations. Democrats, who have compared the widening scandal to the Watergate break-in and cover-up that brought down Republican former President Richard Nixon in 1974, were quick to pounce on the latest reports. Democratic Senator Edward Markey called them seismic revelations and questioned whether the United States might be heading into a constitutional crisis.  This is an inflection point in the entire Russia collusion investigation, he told MSNBC. It makes it very clear that what Donald Trump was trying to do was to end the Russian investigation.  This is what OBSTRUCTION looks like: I faced great pressure because of Russia. Thats taken off, Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy said on Twitter. Republican Representative Scott Taylor told CNN there was no question that Trump had some stumbles this week. But he added: I havent lost my confidence in the president to be our president, I just havent. Before the latest reports, the White House had hoped to shift attention away from the political firestorm in Washington to foreign policy as well as the presidents ambitious pro-business economic agenda in Congress. Trumps trip, which also includes stops in Israel, Italy and Belgium next week, has been billed by the administration as a chance to visit places sacred to three of the worlds major religions while giving him time to meet with Arab, Israeli and European leaders.   Trump, who has embraced what he describes as an America First approach to U.S. foreign policy and international trade, is expected to be welcomed warmly by leaders in Saudi Arabia  and Israel. Lingering questions over his views on the Iran nuclear deal, commitment to NATO security and skepticism of the Paris climate agreement, however, could generate tension at meetings with European counterparts in Brussels and Sicily.

If you look at the language of Mitch McConnell in the last couple of days, hes talking about tax cuts, hes been saying, Well, I dont know about tax reform, lets have a tax cut, Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said in an interview with Reuters on Friday.  To me that would really be, again, contrary to what the president campaigned on, he said. McConnell is the Senate majority leader.  Sweeping tax reform had been high on the Republican legislative agenda. But so far, House of Representatives and the Senate, both controlled by Republicans, have been unable to find consensus on a tax package that could pass both chambers and be signed into law by President Donald Trump.  Wyden argued there is robust bipartisan agreement that a tax overhaul is needed.  There are plenty of Republicans in Congress - because they talk to me - who would really like to do major tax reform, he said.      Last month, the White House weighed in on the tax discussion, offering only a one-page plan that included deep cuts in rates, many for businesses, but stopped well short of legislative language or providing detail on specific changes. The tax reform proposal is shorter than drug store receipts I have, Wyden remarked.  Several lawmakers have warned that if tax reform is not completed by the end of 2017, it will become more difficult to pass in 2018, when Congressional midterm elections will be held. The House has begun holding hearings and has developed a blue print - including a controversial border adjustment tax proposal that would tax imports while providing credit for exports.  Wyden, in an echo of other senators, including Republicans, said that a border adjustment tax would be unlikely to fare well in the Senate - going so far to call it a grocery tax that would unfairly hit consumers in the middle class.

The May 14-18 opinion poll found that 38 percent of adults approved of Trump while 56 percent disapproved. The remaining 6 percent had mixed feelings.  Americans appear to have soured on Trump after a tumultuous week in the White House during which the president fought back a steady drumbeat of critical news reports that ramped up concerns about his administrations ties to Russia. The week started with revelations that Trump shared highly classified information with Russian diplomats in a private meeting. That was followed by reports that former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey, whom Trump recently fired, had written memos expressing concerns that the president had pressured him to stop investigating Trump campaign ties to Russia.  Later in the week, the Justice Department appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller to oversee an independent probe into contacts between Russia and the Trump campaign. Trump has denied colluding with the Russians and called ongoing efforts to investigate him a witch hunt. No politician in history, he said, has been treated worse or more unfairly.  While Trump remains popular with members of his own party, many rank-and-file Republicans appear to have backed off their support for the president during the past week.  Among Republicans, 23 percent expressed disapproval of Trump in the latest poll, up from 16 percent in the same poll last week. The decline in support from Republicans appears to be a primary reason why Trumps overall approval rating is now at the lowest level since he took office. The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English across the United States. It gathered responses from 1,971 adults, including 721 Republicans and 795 Democrats. It has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points for the entire group and 4 percentage points for the Democrats and Republicans.

The U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday appointed Robert Mueller as special counsel to investigate alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign and possible collusion between Trumps campaign and Russia. The Congress has a broader oversight responsibility than just whether crimes have been committed, Senator Ron Wyden, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee and a senior member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said during a round-table meeting with Reuters.  The Senate Intelligence Committee is conducting one of the main congressional probes of the issue. Bob Mueller doesnt have, for example, the same broader responsibility to get into the kind of financial entanglements that I have especially focused on, Wyden said. Questions remain about what contacts took place between Trump advisers and the Russians, and about Russia investments in Trump businesses.  In March, for example, the White House disclosed that Trumps son-in-law and White House senior adviser, Jared Kushner, met executives of Russian state development bank Vnesheconombank, or VEB, in December. In February, Trumps national security adviser, Michael Flynn, was forced to resign for failing to disclose the content of his talks with Sergei Kislyak, Russias ambassador to the United States, and then misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations. Reuters reported on Thursday that Flynn and other advisers to Trumps campaign were in contact with Russian officials and others with Kremlin ties in at least 18 calls and emails during the last seven months of the 2016 presidential race. U.S. intelligence agencies said Russia hacked emails of senior Democrats and orchestrated the release of embarrassing information in a bid to tip the 2016 U.S. presidential election in favor of Trump, whose views were seen as more in line with Moscows. Russia has denied the allegations. Trump has dismissed suggestions of links with Moscow as Democratic sour grapes for losing the election. Trump and his aides have repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia. Muellers appointment raised questions about whether he would ask Congress to step away from its investigation, or whether the dual track would complicate issues such as calling witnesses or obtaining documents. Some congressional Republicans have also suggested that Muellers appointment would lead to changes in Congress investigation. Wyden said he would go to the mat to be sure congressional investigators get what they need. He has already put a hold on Trumps nomination of Sigal Mandelker to the position of under secretary of the Treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence until Treasury hands over all documents related to financial dealings between Russia, Trump and Trump associates. Wyden also said he was looking into ways to obtain documents related to dealings with Russia by Flynn. The Intelligence Committee subpoenaed Flynn for the documents on May 10. His lawyer said on Thursday that Flynn had not yet decided how to respond. Wyden said he needed time to decide how to respond, but pledged he would do so. We still have to know more ... about how Russia corrupted our democracy, he said. He said he knew that it would involve the Department of Justice.

Wearing a navy suit, maroon tie and his wedding band, a tearful Weiner, 52, described his conduct before U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska in New York City. I have a sickness, but I do not have an excuse, Weiner said, apologizing to the 15-year-old girl to whom he sent inappropriate images and messages last year.  Hours after the court hearing, his wife Huma Abedin, a senior aide to 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, filed for divorce in a Manhattan court, according to the New York Post. A lawyer for Abedin did not immediately respond to a  request for comment. The charge of transferring obscene material to a minor carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, but Weiner is likely to get less when sentenced on Sept. 8. As part of his plea agreement, federal prosecutors said they would consider a term between 21 months and 27 months fair and appropriate. The plea deal appeared to seal the demise of a once-promising political career derailed by a series of scandals, stemming from what Weiner described in court as a compulsive need to seek sexual attention from women on social media. The investigation into his exchanges with the teenage girl also roiled the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign days before Election Day.   While searching Weiners laptop, federal agents found a batch of emails from his wife. As a result, James Comey, then director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, announced in late October that the agency was reviewing the messages to determine whether to reopen its investigation into Clintons handling of official correspondence. Clinton, who was leading in national polls at the time, has blamed her loss to Republican Donald Trump in part on Comeys announcement, even though the director said two days before the election in November that the review had uncovered no new evidence. Abedin had announced her separation from Weiner last summer after the latest round of explicit messages emerged, including an image of Weiners crotch as he lay in bed with their young son. The controversy over Clintons use of a private email server while she was U.S. secretary of state dogged her throughout the campaign. Trump accused Clinton of endangering national security by exposing classified information to potential hacking. In testimony to Congress two weeks ago, Comey said he felt mildly nauseous at the suggestion his actions may have swayed the election, but added that he had no regrets. Trump fired Comey days later amid the FBIs probe into whether Trumps campaign colluded with Russia to defeat Clinton, an allegation the president has denied. Weiner, who served parts of New York City for 12 years in the U.S. House of Representatives, resigned in 2011 after an explicit photograph was posted on his Twitter account. He initially claimed his account had been hacked but eventually acknowledged he had sent the image as well as inappropriate messages to several women. Two years later, he announced a run for New York City mayor but dropped out of the race when more explicit messages became public. The federal investigation into Weiner came to light last year after the Daily Mail, a British newspaper, published an interview with the North Carolina teen. On Friday, Weiner said he has been receiving intensive mental health treatment since then. These destructive impulses brought great devastation to family and friends, and destroyed my lifes dream of public service, Weiner said. In a statement, acting U.S. Attorney in Manhattan Joon Kim said, Weiners conduct was not only reprehensible, but a federal crime, one for which he is now convicted and will be sentenced.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is exploring whether it can use an obscure ethics rule to undermine the special counsel investigation into ties between President Donald Trumps campaign team and Russia, two people familiar with White House thinking said on Friday. Trump has said that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosensteins hiring of former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel to lead the investigation hurts our country terribly.  Within hours of Muellers appointment on Wednesday, the White House began reviewing the Code of Federal Regulations, which restricts newly hired government lawyers from investigating their prior law firms clients for one year after their hiring, the sources said.  An executive order signed by Trump in January extended that period to two years. Muellers former law firm, WilmerHale, represents Trumps son-in-law Jared Kushner, who met with a Russian bank executive in December, and the presidents former campaign manager Paul Manafort, who is a subject of a federal investigation. Legal experts said the ethics rule can be waived by the Justice Department, which appointed Mueller. He did not represent Kushner or Manafort directly at his former law firm. If the department did not grant a waiver, Mueller would be barred from investigating Kushner or Manafort, and this could  greatly diminish the scope of the probe, experts said. The Justice Department is already reviewing Muellers background as well as any potential conflicts of interest, said department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores. Even if the Justice Department granted a waiver, the White House would consider using the ethics rule to create doubt about Muellers ability to do his job fairly, the sources said. Administration legal advisers have been asked to determine if there is a basis for this.  Under this strategy, the sources said the administration would raise the issue in press conferences and public statements. Moreover, the White House has not ruled out the possibility of using the rule to challenge Muellers findings in court, should the investigation lead to prosecution.  But the administration is now mainly focused on placing a cloud over his reputation for independence, according to the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.      Kathleen Clark, a professor of legal ethics at Washington University School of Law, said the Justice Department can grant a waiver if concerns about bias are minimal.  She said subjects of the investigation could later argue that its results cannot be trusted, but she believes the argument would not stand up in court.   The White House did not respond to a request for comment on whether it is reviewing the ethics rule in order to undermine Muellers credibility.  Muellers former colleagues at WilmerHale, James Quarles and Aaron Zebley, are expected to join his investigation, according to a spokeswoman for the law firm. Neither Quarles nor Zebley represented Kushner or Manafort.  Mueller will now lead the ongoing Federal Bureau of Investigation probe into Trumps associates and senior Russian officials.  Unlike Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel appointed by a three-judge panel to investigate Bill and Hillary Clintons real estate holdings in the 1990s, Mueller depends on the Justice Department for funding and he reports to Rosenstein, who was appointed by Trump.  When he announced Muellers appointment this week, Rosenstein said Mueller will have all appropriate resources to conduct a thorough and complete investigation.

The EPA's grants to state and local governments on pollution issues from air quality management to pesticides enforcement would be cut 45 percent to $597 million in the fiscal year 2018 budget proposal the administration will send to Congress next week, according to details released by the National Association of Clean Air Agencies (NACAA). (bit.ly/2qFWvSl) The nonprofit group, an association of pollution control agencies in 40 states and various municipalities and territories, said details on the budget came directly from a leaked administration document.  More than a dozen programs to tackle environmental problems in environmentally sensitive regions, such as the Chesapeake Bay, the Great Lakes and South Florida, would be cut to nothing.  You would have thought the administration would have revised the budget in light of the overwhelming adverse reaction they encountered from previous trial balloons, instead ... they doubled down, said Bill Becker, the NACAAs executive director. Several Republicans, including Senator Rob Portman of Ohio and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, had raised concerns about the EPAs plans to cut Great Lakes program funding. The EPAs budget proposal also includes an overall cut of 31 percent to $5.66 billion, mirroring what was proposed in a preliminary skinny budget the administration released in March.  The EPA would not confirm the veracity of the budget summary released by the outside group. But a spokeswoman defended aggressive proposals to cut the agencys budget. The budget prioritizes federal funding for work in infrastructure, air and water quality, and ensuring the safety of chemicals in the marketplace, said Liz Bowman, an agency spokeswoman. She said the budget aims to reduce redundancies and inefficiencies and focus on our core statutory mission.  The proposed cuts are a starting point and the Republican-controlled Congress would temper them in its budget negotiations. The Trump administration has targeted regulations, which it says have held back business. The budget cuts to the EPA and other agencies, such as the State Department, would help pay for a 10 percent, $54 billion hike in military spending next year. Also zeroed out in the EPA budget are programs on cleaning up lead contamination, reporting greenhouse gas emissions and managing indoor air pollution, the NACCA said.

Ryan said in a radio interview that the delay was out of an abundance of caution until the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) releases its findings on the legislations costs and its impact on health insurance coverage.     The CBOs analysis, or score, is expected late Wednesday,  taking into account final changes to the bill before it passed the Republican-led House earlier this month.  We are just basically being overly cautious, but theres really kind of a non-issue here, Ryan told the syndicated Hugh Hewitt radio show. Were moving it over to the Senate probably in a couple of weeks. Republicans are eager to make good on their campaign promise to repeal and replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act, Democratic former President Barack Obamas signature healthcare law, also known as Obamacare.  Their plan narrowly passed the House on May 4 despite clashes within the Republican Party between hard-line and more moderate members. Ryan dismissed the likelihood that the new CBO score could force another vote in the House. The measure still faces a potentially steep climb in the Senate, where Republicans hold a narrower majority. Senate Republican leaders have formed a Republican working group, but it is unclear how much of the House bill they will accept. Some senators in both parties have vowed to start from scratch.  What weve had so far is a debacle on healthcare, Senator Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate finance committee, said Friday in an interview with Reuters. You cant make this stuff up. Wyden said he was wary of a Senate bipartisan group that is also working on healthcare. Republican Senators Susan Collins and Bill Cassidy, who have proposed letting states decide whether to keep, scrap or replace Obamacare, have attracted several Democrats to bipartisan talks in search of common ground. Wyden said he feared the Cassidy-Collins approach would let states allow insurance companies to sell junk plans that do not include health benefits like hospitalization. Put me down for freedom to innovate and flexibility, but on that issue, that doesnt mean the freedom to leave people without decent care, Wyden told Reuters. Lawmakers in both chambers must also grapple with potential voter backlash ahead of the 2018 congressional election.  Public opinion polls have shown slipping support for Republican efforts. A Politico/Morning Consult poll this month found 44 percent of nearly 2,000 people surveyed disapproved of the House bill compared with 38 percent who approved of it. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosis spokesman, Drew Hammill, said the House bill was becoming a liability for Republicans and has no chance of success in the Senate, and now may even have to come back to the House to be amended.   Before the latest changes, the CBO had said the bill would leave 24 million more Americans uninsured by 2026 and slice about $150 billion off the budget deficit.  The House bill allows states to decide whether insurers can charge more to people with pre-existing conditions and roll back Obamacares Medicaid expansion.

When it was announced this month that Comey had been fired, White House officials initially pointed to the Rosenstein memo as a reason for firing the FBI director, who was overseeing an investigation into any collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Trump said in a subsequent interview with NBC News that he had been planning to fire Comey before he received the Rosenstein memo. In a statement on Friday seen by Reuters, Rosenstein writes: I informed the senior attorney that the president was going to remove Director Comey, (and) that I was writing a memorandum to the attorney general summarizing my own concerns.  The statement, first reported by NBC News, Rosenstein goes on to outline some of his concerns with Comeys job performance. But toward the end of the 2 1/2-page document, Rosenstein writes: My memorandum is not a statement of reasons to justify a for-cause termination (firing). After Rosenstein briefed members of the House of Representatives on Friday, Congressman Darrell Issa was asked by reporters if Rosenstein indicated whether anyone had asked or encouraged him to write the memo about Comey. I dont believe he ... indicated anyone directed him but in fact he wrote the memo, said Issa, who, like Trump, is a Republican.

There was a presentation followed by Q and A and not a whole lot of A, said Democratic Representative Charles Crist. Representative Brad Sherman, also a Democrat, said Rosenstein avoided at least 10 times Democrats queries into whether the Justice Department official was pressured to write a memo critical of Comey.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""DUBAI (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump, departing from his predecessors practice, is expected to sidestep human rights questions when he meets Gulf Arab leaders at the weekend and focus, to the dismay of  beleaguered government critics, on business and security. Civil liberties monitors point to freedom of expression as a right increasingly constrained in Gulf Arab states including summit host Saudi Arabia, which is planning to buy tens of billions of dollars worth of U.S. arms.  Gulf Arab states began stepping up the muffling of political discussion in the dying months of former president Barack Obamas term and have continued this under Trump, they say. Given Trumps tenuous relationship with freedom of the press and free expression in general, we have no expectation that Trump would raise these issues during his visit, said Adam Coogle, Middle East researcher at Human Rights Watch. In Washington, a senior Trump administration official said human rights would not take center stage in Riyadh, where Arab leaders are expected to discuss combating Islamist militancy and what they see as the growing influence of adversary Iran. The official said Trump preferred to keep such conversations private, much as he did with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi recently when he obtained the release of an Egyptian-American humanitarian worker. Trumps visit is likely to contrast with one Obama paid to Egypt in 2009 when he made an appeal to the Muslim world promoting self-determination, democracy and individual rights.  The Saudis dont want any more talk about human rights, democracy, political reform or gender equality. They had enough of that from Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, said Bruce Riedel of the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington.  Theyre pretty confident theyre not going to hear it from Donald Trump. While experts are not surprised, since the Gulf states monarchies abhor discord and dislike free-wheeling political debate as practised in the West, they are nevertheless dismayed. The output of several columnists, economists and clerics in regional powerhouse Saudi Arabia and some of its smaller neighbors has either dried up or grown circumspect since the second half of 2016 in what critics see as an unacknowledged state drive to stifle public criticism, rights monitors say. Among those who have fallen silent are critics, both liberal  and conservative, of the kingdoms ambitious plan to diversify the economy and open up the country culturally under a plan known as Vision 2030. Until late last year Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi commented about issues including Trumps rise to power on social media and a column in the pan-Arab al-Hayat daily. He also spoke in public appearances at think tanks. In December, news circulated on social media that Kashoggi, former editor of the Arabic-language al-Watan daily, one of the kingdoms top newspapers, had been ordered to stop writing or Tweeting. His account has been silent since November last year. Khashoggi declined to comment on the reported ban. Since the 2011 Arab Spring, Gulf states have stepped up efforts to curb dissent with tough new cyber crime laws, sentencing offenders to prison terms for Web posts deemed insulting to rulers or threatening to public order. But in the past two years, unnerved by low oil prices and the slow progress of a war in Yemen targeting the influence of arch foe Iran, Gulf authorities became even less patient with dissenting voices in the media, analysts and rights groups say. Madawi Al-Rasheed, visiting professor at the Middle East Centre, London School of Economics, said Riyadh was engaged in an effort to muzzle intellectuals with dissenting voices. There are so many of them, both men and women, who have left the kingdom, she said. Activists say muzzled writers include economists, academics, columnists and Muslim clerics. There are no precise figures on how many have been affected, but estimates by activists put the number at more than 20 from Saudi Arabia alone. While some were merely advised not to air their views on social media, more vocal critics have found themselves behind bars, facing possible indictments on charges such as disobeying the ruler or incitement against the state, rights activists say. The pursuit by security is increasing rapidly and ... it is killing the voice of moderation, said Walid Sulais, a Saudi rights activist who fled abroad in late 2016 after authorities summoned him for questioning over his rights work. Gulf Arab officials did not respond to requests for comment on the issue of free expression. But asked about the expected absence of human rights from Trumps agenda, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said the issue was one of definition. We look at human rights as the right to safety, the right to a decent life, the right to a job, the right to food. We see it as the right to live your life without people imposing on you, he told a news conference on Thursday. Every Saudi has the right to petition his monarch or the governors. The doors of our leaders are open. We have built institutions. We have a thriving press corps. We have a consultative council that started with 60 members, today it has 150 members, and 30 of them areladies, distinguished ladies. Gulf states have increasingly chafed at what they see as a campaign of vilification by Western media and rights groups. They insist they respect rights which do not violate Islamic Sharia laws and their societies conservative traditions. Political parties are banned in Saudi Arabia as are protests, unions are illegal, the press is controlled and criticism of the royal family can lead to prison. Riyadh says it does not have political prisoners, while top officials have said monitoring activists is needed to keep social stability.  In a statement on Jan. 15, Bahrains information minister scolded Gulf media, warning outlets to shoulder their responsibilities and counter foreign attempts to spread sedition in Gulf states - an apparent reference to Iran which Bahrain accuses of fomenting unrest among Bahraini Shiites. Iran denies interfering in the affairs of Gulf states.     Other Gulf countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Oman, have also been accused by rights groups of curbing free expression. In Qatar, activists noted that Faisal al-Marzoqi, a prominent commentator with more than 100,000 Twitter followers, had not tweeted since November 2016. The UAE said on March 21 it had arrested political activist Ahmed Mansoor, an electrical engineer and poet, on charges of spreading sectarianism and hatred on social media, a move criticized by Amnesty International. Defending the move, Mohammed al-Hammadi, editor of the pro-government al-Ittihad newspaper, wrote that Mansoor either will be convicted or will be cleared through the rule of law and the justice of the judiciary, so what is the problem with this? In February Saudi social media reported the arrest of prominent clerics Sheikh Essam al-Owayed and Saad al-Breik. In a Twitter post on Feb. 23, Owayed wrote in apparent reference to liberalizing reforms: Any decision-maker who thinks he can change the faith and identity of this country by opening the doors to decadence would be calling for a war in which he would be the main loser, no matter who he is. Owayeds Twitter account has had no new postings since then, while the last Twitter message on Breiks account dates to March 20. Neither Owayed nor Breik could be reached for a comment. On May 4 on a visit to Saudi Arabia, UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism Ben Emmerson urged Riyadh to stop using a 2014 counter-terrorism law and security prohibitions against human rights defenders and writers.  When he is meeting with his counterparts from Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries there, he should be equally as clear that any counter-terrorism efforts must include safeguards to protect the rights of individuals to express their opinions and assemble peacefully, Philip Luther, Amnesty Internationals director for the Middle East and North Africa, told Reuters.

The most senior Democrat on the Senate committee overseeing pensions, Washingtons Patty Murray, and two of the partys liberal stars who advocated for the rule, Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren, wrote to newly confirmed Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta about reports that he was looking for a way to freeze the rule and make it stick. Earlier this month, the National Association of Plan Advisors cited Acosta as saying he was seeking the long-term freeze in a meeting with Republican Senator Tim Scott, of South Carolina. He added that he was in constant communication with the White House and recognized the urgency of the situation, the group said in a blog post citing a communication from Scotts office. Scotts spokeswoman Michele Exner told Reuters she did not know what the two discussed in their meeting, what Acosta had said, or anything about the communication cited.  Labor Department Spokeswoman Jillian Rogers said she would ask Acosta, currently in Germany, about the conversation and if permanently paralyzing the rule was a department priority. Approved last year under former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, the rule was intended to ensure that financial advisers put their clients interests first, and to protect consumers from buying unnecessary investment products that line brokers pockets. Heavily criticized by Wall Street and Republicans for potentially raising the cost of investment advice, the rule has faced a rocky time becoming effective, with Trump last month delaying its enactment date, originally April 10, for 60 days. Trump has also ordered a review of the rule. Instead of meeting with all stakeholders and considering multiple points of view, you appear to have prejudged the outcome of the review, the senators wrote in a copy of the letter seen by Reuters. They said an analysis accompanying the rules release that found conflicts of interest would cost those saving for retirement $17 billion annually. They warned there are steep legal standards that the Labor Department would have to meet to justify further delaying, substantially revising, or rescinding this rule.

The infrastructure plan, first reported by Bloomberg News, is likely to include funding to encourage state and local governments to lease assets to the private sector to generate funding for other projects. Trump has long pledged a $1 trillion, 10-year plan to modernize U.S. roads, bridges, airports, the electrical grid and water systems, but has so far been vague on how much of the spending would come from the federal government. Trump, who leaves on Friday for his first foreign trip, will miss the roll-out of his full budget. He was to meet with his budget director, Mick Mulvaney, on Friday before departing. The budget will also include details about Trumps proposals to cut foreign aid and boost military spending. It could provide clues on his plan to cut taxes. The Washington Post reported that the budget will include funds for a program to give parents six weeks of paid leave after the birth or adoption of a child, expected to cost about $25 billion a year. While Trump can propose programs, Congress ultimately controls spending and rarely approves White House budget plans as proposed. Republicans control both the Senate and House of Representatives, but were lukewarm to Trumps initial skinny budget plan for fiscal 2018, released in March.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""JERUSALEM (Reuters) - U.S. presidential trips are an opportunity to project power and burnish statesmanship. But they come with diplomatic dangers and potential pitfalls, too. For Donald Trump, several of those await in Jerusalem and Bethlehem next week. A nine-day tour taking in Saudi Arabia, Israel, the Palestinian territories, the Vatican and NATO would be a tall order for any president. But for Trump, under siege at home over questions about his administrations links to Russia and his firing of FBI chief James Comey, it is a particularly demanding itinerary, especially for a first overseas venture. During his campaign, Trump promised to be Israels best friend if elected, and signaled that it was okay for the Israeli government to go on building settlements on occupied land since he didnt regard it as an obstacle to peace. Since taking office, however, Trump has shifted tack, urging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to hold back on settlements, and praising Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at a White House meeting this month, part of an effort to bring the sides together and launch another attempt at Middle East peace. It looks unlikely Trump will manage to get Netanyahu and Abbas to shake hands during his 28-hour visit to the Holy Land, and the prospects of him setting a timetable for a resumption of peace talks also look dim. But that doesnt mean other diplomatic traps arent lying in wait. Perhaps the most sensitive is what Trump ends up saying  or not saying  about a promise he made during the election campaign to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. No country in the world has its embassy to Israel in Jerusalem since the status of the city remains disputed in the eyes of the international community. While Israelis call Jerusalem their indivisible capital, Palestinians want the capital of any future state in the east of the city. Only once Jerusalems final status is agreed via direct negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians are foreign countries likely to move their embassies to the city. In the meantime, Trump has appointed as his envoy to Israel David Friedman, a devout Jew who insists the embassy must be moved and plans to work out of Jerusalem some days of the week. When Friedman arrived in Israel this week, his first act was to visit Jerusalems Western Wall, the holiest place where Jews are permitted to pray, a symbolic departure from usual protocol. Trump intends to visit the Western Wall too, something past presidents have not done because of the political sensitivities. The Wall stands in the Old City in the east of Jerusalem, which Israel captured during the 1967 Middle East war. Officially, the United Nations, the United States and others consider the Old City and East Jerusalem occupied territory and do not recognize Israels claim to sovereignty over it. As a result, the U.S. State Department turned down a request for Netanyahu to accompany Trump and his family when they visit the site on Monday. Instead, the president will be accompanied by the rabbi of the Western Wall. This is the most appropriate way to show the proper deference to such a significant holy site, a State Department official said. Yet in an interview with Israel Hayom, a pro-Netanyahu paper, Trump said his plans could still change and suggested he might ask Netanyahu to join him, a last-minute move that would please Netanyahu but anger the Palestinians. On Tuesday, Trump is scheduled to visit Abbas for an hour in Bethlehem, the birthplace of Jesus, which lies a few kilometers south of Jerusalem in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.  To get there, the presidents convoy will have to pass through Israels high-security checkpoint and towering concrete barriers that cut the West Bank off from Jerusalem. Both Palestinians and Israelis will be on alert to see what language Trump uses when he meets Abbas. While the president hasnt clearly backed a two-state solution  Israel and a Palestinian state  he is expected to voice support for Palestinian self-determination, a phrase that nods in the direction of an independent Palestinian state. After negotiating that diplomatic minefield, Trump is scheduled to visit Yad Vashem, Israels Holocaust Memorial. He has set aside 15 minutes for the visit, unlike previous presidents who spent an hour or more at the site.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

But as controversies swirl around Trump over alleged ties between his 2016 campaign and Russia, it is unclear whether the Republican president - who slammed the post-World War Two military alliance as obsolete when he was running for office - will say the words that whipsawed NATO partners really want to hear. Alarmed by Russian aggression in Ukraine and wary of the U.S. administrations efforts to build friendlier ties with Moscow, European partners want to know if they have Trumps staunch support. While the White House says Trump will reaffirm the U.S. commitment to the alliance in his remarks at NATO, allies also want a full-throated endorsement of Article 5 of the treaty - the principal that an attack against one member is treated as an attack against all. The 28-member North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which was formed in 1949 during the Cold War, has invoked the collective defense article only once - after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States that leveled the World Trade Centers twin towers in New York, Trumps hometown. Trump plans to dedicate a memorial to the invocation of Article 5 at the new NATO headquarters.  The problem in the plan is that President Trump is the only president who has not yet explicitly endorsed Article 5, said Thomas Wright of the Brookings Institution think tank. I understand that is not an accident. On the campaign trail, Trump accused NATO allies of not paying their fair share for defense and not focusing enough on the fight against terrorism. Since last Novembers election, Trump and his aides have tempered those remarks. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis - who will travel with Trump to Brussels - has pledged support to Article 5, as has Vice President Mike Pence. Trump has said publicly his views on NATO have changed, telling reporters during a White House visit with NATOs Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg that NATO was no longer obsolete. He has never said, like Pence, like Mattis, that U.S. commitment to Article 5 is rock solid, and allies want to hear that at this summit, said Julie Smith, national security aide to former Vice President Joe Biden. While abroad, Trump will be shadowed by the political tumult that ensued after his firing earlier this month of FBI Director James Comey. The U.S. Justice Department has named a special counsel to probe possible collusion between Trumps campaign and Russia, which Trump denies. He said on Thursday he was the victim of a political witch hunt. Trump, who took office in January, departs on Friday for his first foreign trip as president and will visit Saudi Arabia, Israel, the Vatican and Sicily in addition to Brussels. A senior White House official said Trump would press his demands for NATO partners to step up their defense spending. The message may undercut any effort to offer reassurance to NATO allies about the commitment to the alliance and to Europe, said Wolfgang Ischinger, a former German ambassador to the United States and Britain. Republican Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a frequent Trump critic, expressed frustration with the presidents NATO stance. Asked by a reporter what he would like to see Trump do to reassure NATO allies, McCain laughed, saying: Talk about his commitment to NATO - that would be an opener.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump, striking a defiant tone on Thursday after days of political tumult, denied asking former FBI Director James Comey to drop a probe into his former national security adviser and decried a witch hunt against him.  Trumps terse denial followed reports by Reuters and other media about a memo written by Comey alleging that Trump made the request to close down the investigation into Michael Flynn and Russia in February. Trump fired Comey on May 9. No. No. Next question, Trump told a news conference in the White House, when asked if he in any way, shape or form ever urged Comey to end the probe. Comeys dismissal last week set off a series of jarring developments that culminated on Wednesday in the Justice Departments appointment of a special counsel to probe possible ties between Russia and Trumps 2016 presidential campaign. They included media reports that Trump discussed sensitive intelligence on the Islamic State militant group with Russias foreign minister.     In a pair of morning Twitter posts and at a later news conference, the Republican president described calls by some on the left for his impeachment as ridiculous and said he had done nothing to warrant criminal charges. The entire thing has been a witch hunt and there is no collusion between certainly myself and my campaign - but I can always speak for myself - and the Russians. Zero, he told the news conference, standing alongside Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos. In his earlier Twitter posts, Trump criticized the naming of former FBI Director Robert Mueller as a special counsel by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, an official he himself appointed. With all of the illegal acts that took place in the Clinton campaign & Obama Administration, there was never a special counsel appointed! Trump wrote on Thursday morning.  He did not offer any evidence of such acts in his reference to former Democratic President Barack Obama and former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. This is the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history! Trump tweeted. Democrats rejected Trumps characterization. This is a truth hunt, said Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar. Russia has denied U.S. intelligence agencies conclusion that it interfered in the election campaign to try to tilt the vote in Trumps favor. Trump has long bristled at the notion that Russia played any role in his November election victory over Clinton. Trump fired Flynn on Feb. 14 for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the extent of his conversations last year with Russias ambassador.  Reuters reported on Thursday that Flynn and other Trump campaign advisers were in contact with Russian officials and others with Kremlin ties in at least 18 calls and emails during the last seven months of the presidential race. U.S. stocks recovered ground on Thursday as upbeat economic data emboldened investors to return to the market, a day after Wall Street saw the biggest selloff in eight months on worries the political turmoil could undermine Trump initiatives such as tax cuts that investors see as favoring economic growth. Rosenstein, the No. 2 Justice Department official, named Mueller amid mounting pressure in Congress for an independent investigation beyond existing FBI and congressional probes into the Russia issue. Trump later told news anchors at the White House that Muellers appointment was a very, very negative thing, adding: I believe it hurts our country terribly, because it shows were a divided, mixed-up, not-unified country. Rosenstein briefed senators on Thursday but made no public comments. One of the attendees, speaking on condition of anonymity, described Rosenstein as anxious and nervous and said he drank multiple glasses of water and spilled one. Afterward, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told reporters that everything he said was that you need to treat this investigation as if it may be a criminal investigation. A self-described friend of Comeys wrote in a public blog post on Thursday that Comey had told him that he had rebuffed a Trump request for loyalty by promising only honesty. He also told me that Trump was perceptibly uncomfortable with this answer, wrote Benjamin Wittes, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a critic of Trump.  And he said that ever since, the President had been trying to be chummy in a fashion that Comey felt was designed to absorb him into Trumps world - to make him part of the team. Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill said Rosenstein told senators that he knew Comey would be fired before he wrote his letter accusing him of missteps as FBI director, including his handling of an election-year probe into Clintons use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. The White House initially said last week that Trump was prompted to fire Comey after reading the Rosenstein letter. Trump later said he had already decided to dismiss him and was thinking of this Russia thing. The New York Times reported on Thursday that Trump called Comey weeks after he took office on Jan. 20 and asked him when federal authorities were going to say Trump was not under investigation. It cited two people briefed on the call.   Comey told Trump he should not contact him directly about FBI investigations but follow procedure and have the White House counsel ask the Justice Department, which oversees the FBI, the Times reported. A key issue Mueller may have to tackle is whether Trump has committed obstruction of justice, an offense that could be used in any effort in the Republican-led Congress to impeach him and remove him from office.  Asked about possible obstruction of justice, Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters the special counsel would follow the facts where ever they may lead and that it is premature to prejudge anything at this point.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In Washington, the chatter about a deepening, Watergate-style crisis has engulfed the White House - and those conversations are echoed in big cities across the country and in a succession of headlines that seem to suggest almost certain doom for the young Trump administration. But for many Americans, including President Donald Trumps staunchest supporters, the crisis in Washington is not about possible missteps by Trump or questions over whether his campaign colluded with Russia. For them, its the latest egregious example of mainstream media bias and of Washington insiders desperate to preserve their status taking revenge on the New York celebrity businessman. In such an intensely polarized political environment that distrust of mainstream media will make it less likely that Trump supporters - and the Republican officeholders who rely on their votes - will abandon the president any time soon. The more negativity, the more were for him. Its backfiring on them, Arizona resident Nadia Larsen said of media reports about possible collusion with Russia or Trumps conversations with then-FBI Director James Comey. Reports from the Washington Post and New York Times that Trump shared classified information with Russias foreign minister and pressured Comey to end an inquiry into former national security adviser Michael Flynn have been met with skepticism by Larsen and many other Trump supporters. More credible, they say, is news from prominent conservative media outlets, from the Trump-friendly airwaves of Fox News to websites such as Breitbart. Those outlets have cast the allegations as an ideological attack by Obama administration holdovers or the revenge of the deep state, a term used by the far right to refer to what they see as a deeply entrenched bureaucracy opposed to Trump. The only news I watch is Fox, but the only news I watch and believe is whatever comes out of the presidents mouth and whatever he tweets, said Larsen, an Israeli-born immigrant who has lived in Tucson, Arizona, for 25 years. Several Trump supporters decried what they described as baseless news from anonymous sources and said they have not seen any concrete evidence to support the allegations against Trump. This is what I expected, said Jeff Klusmeier, an insurance agent in Louisville, Kentucky. I expected the media to attack Trump. I expected the Democrats to attack him and call for impeachment. So its par for the course for me. Conservative media outlets have developed their own theories about the recent spate of negative headlines. The Breitbart News Network, once headed by Trump chief strategist Stephen Bannon, reported that some of the recent accusations were driven by associates of Comey, who was fired by Trump last week, in a story headlined Comey Strikes Back. Among the headlines on the Drudge Report, a popular conservative news aggregator, were Media Reach Peak Meltdown and Sabotage in DC. The anti-Trump press believes it smells blood in the water, said Fox News commentator Sean Hannity, a staunch Trump supporter who accused the mainstream media of hyperventilating breathlessness. Hannity tweeted on Wednesday that five groups were trying to destroy Trump: the media, Democrats, deep state/intelligence operatives, establishment Republicans and never Trumpers. This effort, this plan, this desire to upend and stop the Trump presidency got going probably on election night and certainly within 24 hours. And now were seeing it manifest itself, radio talk-show host Rush Limbaugh said. On Wednesday, the Justice Department appointed former FBI head Robert Mueller as a special counsel to investigate possible ties between Trumps 2016 presidential campaign and Russia. Trump has fed the theory that the media is out to get him, saying no politician in history has been treated more unfairly. On Thursday he tweeted that the probe of Russian collusion was the single greatest witch hunt in U.S. history. The overwhelming majority of conservatives and Republicans believe that whatever you may think of Donald Trump, this is clearly being driven by many quarters of the media that chose sides in the election and were very upfront about it and havent changed, Republican consultant Keith Appell told Reuters. Trumps approval ratings have been low for a new president, remaining mired in the high 30s to low 40s. But 77 percent of Republicans approve of Trumps performance, according to the most recent Reuters/Ipsos survey, a figure that has stayed relatively steady since his inauguration. Bradd Bostick, a Reynoldsburg, Ohio, resident who started a Bikers for Trump group after the presidents inauguration in January, said he was not concerned about the recent controversies because most of us do not believe anything we hear in the mainstream media. The media thinks its about Trump, and its not, said Steve Deace, an Iowa-based commentator for Conservative Review and a former talk-radio host who has been critical of Trump. Its not about Trumps credibility, its about the medias credibility. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"
"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - More than a dozen Democratic attorneys general on Thursday sought to intervene to defend a key part of the Obamacare healthcare law - subsidy payments to insurance companies - which is under threat in a court case. The 16 attorneys general, led by California Attorney General Xavier Becerra and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, filed a motion to intervene in the case pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The case, which dates back to the Obama administration, was filed by the Republican-led House of Representatives against the federal government in an effort to cut off subsidy payments to insurers for the individual plans created by the Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare. The subsidies payments help cover out-of-pocket medical expenses for low-income Americans. The stakes are very high. In Maryland we have more than 400,000 people who depend on the Affordable Care Act to get normal healthcare. It sounds alarming, but its true: lives are at stake, said Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh, who signed on to the filing. Trump has repeatedly threatened to withhold the payments to insurers, which amount to about $7 billion this year, and referred to them as a bailout.  The attorneys general cited in the court filing Trumps own words vowing to let Obamacare explode as part of the reasoning for their intervention. Trump has made it clear he views decisions on health insurance for millions of Americans as little more than political bargaining chips, the court filing said. The situation is extremely urgent, the Democratic officials argued, because state insurance regulators are making critical choices that will shape their insurance markets for the next year. Several insurers, including Aetna (AET.N) and Humana (HUM.N), have largely left the Obamacare exchanges, citing a pool of patients who are sicker than expected and therefore more expensive. Insurers have also repeatedly called on the Trump administration to fund the cost-sharing subsidies.  Attorneys general and proponents of Obamacare have said the threats to withhold the payments have already wreaked havoc in the marketplaces and are part of the reason some healthcare consumers have seen double-digit rate increases.  Democratic attorneys general have emerged as significant opponents to the Trump administration. They took a lead role to successfully block Trumps executive orders restricting travel from some Muslim-majority countries, and they are also resisting efforts to roll back environmental regulations. The attorney general from Kentucky, a deeply conservative state, is among those Democrats joining the court filing even as the states Republican governor has pledged to rollback a Medicaid expansion made possible by Obamacare.  In May 2016, a U.S. judge ruled in favor of the Republicans in the subsidies case, finding that the Obama administration needed explicit congressional approval. The Obama administration appealed before Trump took office, leaving the new administration to ponder how to proceed. The appeals court put the litigation on hold after the November presidential election at the request of the Republican House lawmakers.  The motion to intervene may not be granted by the court. In February, the same court rejected a similar motion filed by Democratic attorneys general seeking to help defend the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in a legal battle that could defang the agency. The litigation could become moot if Congress passes new healthcare legislation to replace Obamacare. The House passed a bill, called the American Health Care Act, earlier this month. The Senate recently began writing its own version of the bill but has warned it could take months to pass.  The Trump administration has taken action over the past several months to undercut Obamacare through regulatory authority. It backed off enforcing the individual mandate, which requires everyone to purchase health insurance or else pay a penalty, tightened enrollment in Obamacare markets and has enabled people to sign up for insurance plans outside of healthcare.gov, the flagship site of Obamacare that the Obama administration heavily advertised.

In late April, the administration put out a one-page overview of its tax reform plans, which would cut taxes for  businesses to 15 percent, as well as cutting taxes and simplifying income tax brackets for individuals. Critics questioned how the tax cuts would be offset without driving up the federal deficit. What I have said repeatedly is that any plan we put forward we believe should be paid for with economic growth, Mnuchin told the Senate Banking Committee. I am concerned as to whether some of the models will attribute enough growth in dynamic scoring but when we present the details we will present how we think it should be paid for. Mnuchin has said the April plan was deliberately vague in order to allow the White House to more effectively work with lawmakers to come up with a joint agreement that could pass Congress. How to pay for the tax cuts remains a sticking point. Fiscal conservatives in the Republican-controlled Congress would strongly prefer a revenue-neutral plan as they are against increasing deficits. Mnuchin has said the cuts would pay for themselves under a dynamic scoring model analysis, which takes into account the effect of tax changes on economic growth and revenue. At Thursdays hearing, Mnuchin was also peppered by Democrats on the committee about details of the tax plan, including whether or not cuts would mostly benefit the wealthy. I can assure you the presidents objective and my objective is we create a middle income tax cut and we do not raise taxes on the middle income, if anything the opposite, Mnuchin said. He added that the plan would get rid of almost every single tax deduction, which he said were disproportionately used by the wealthy and that the aim was that 95 percent of Americans would no longer need to itemize deductions. Later on Thursday at a U.S. Chamber of Commerce event, the Treasury secretary insisted that tax reforms remain on track despite growing doubts among investors on the size and scope of any cuts achievable in Congress. A renewed push on a repeal of Obamacare is currently being worked on in the Senate while reports that President Donald Trump may have tried to interfere with a federal investigation has shifted focus away from the congressional agenda.

Senator Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, said Mnuchin had not adequately responded to his March 2 letter asking if the Treasury had a list of Trumps business partners to see if any of them were on sanctions lists or had been investigated by a national security watchdog that analyzes foreign investments.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Thursday set the clock ticking toward a mid-August start of renegotiations of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico to try to win better terms for U.S. workers and manufacturers. With a letter to U.S. lawmakers, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said he triggered a 90-day consultation period with Congress, industries and the American public that would allow talks over one of the worlds biggest trading blocs to begin by Aug. 16. Renegotiation of NAFTA was a key campaign promise of U.S. President Donald Trump, who frequently called the 23-year-old trade pact a disaster that has drained U.S. factories and well-paid manufacturing jobs to Mexico. Trump has pledged to use the NAFTA talks to shrink goods trade deficits that stood at $63 billion with Mexico and $11 billion with Canada last year, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. Lighthizer told reporters NAFTA has been successful for U.S. agriculture, investment services and the energy sector, but not for manufacturing. He added that he hopes to complete negotiations by the end of 2017. As a starting point for negotiations, we should build on what has worked in NAFTA and change and improve what has not, Lighthizer said in a conference call with reporters. If renegotiations result in a fairer deal for American workers there is value in making the transition to a modernized NAFTA as seamless as possible. In his letter to congressional leaders, Lighthizer said  NAFTA needs modernization for provisions on digital trade,  intellectual property rights, labor and environmental standards, regulatory practices, rules for state-owned enterprises and food safety standards. The Obama administration attempted to address many of these deficiencies in the 2015 Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, which included Canada and Mexico, but Trump pulled out of TPP in one of his first official acts as president.  Canada and Mexico both welcomed the U.S. move to launch a NAFTA revamp. Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray, speaking at a news conference with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in Washington, said the trade pact needed updating after nearly 25 years. The world has changed, weve learned a lot and we can make it better, he said. Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said Canada was steadfastly committed to free trade in the North American region, noting that 9 million U.S. jobs depend on trade and investment with Canada. U.S. Chamber of Commerce president Thomas Donohue urged U.S. officials to do no harm to businesses that depend on trade with Canada and Mexico and to move quickly on a new trilateral deal. As the administration took its first formal step toward NAFTA renegotiations, the U.S. Commerce Department launched an investigation on Thursday into Boeing Cos (BA.N) anti-dumping claims against Canadian rival Bombardiers (BBDb.TO) new CSeries jetliners, drawing a threat from Canada to review a deal to buy Boeing fighter jets. Lighthizer's letter (here%20Notification.pdf) is less detailed than a draft sent to lawmakers in March, which listed as objectives tax equality and the ability to reimpose tariffs if Mexican and Canadian imports pose a serious injury threat to U.S. industry. Trump late in April had considered a full withdrawal from NAFTA, but was persuaded by senior officials in his administration to pursue negotiations instead. Lighthizer said he did not think a new threat to withdraw from NAFTA would be necessary. As the president has said, we are going to give renegotiation a good strong shot, Lighthizer told reporters, adding that he believed Canada and Mexico would negotiate in good faith. He said he hoped to maintain the current trilateral format of NAFTA, but noted that many of NAFTAs problems are bilateral issues that need to be worked out with either Mexico or Canada. Our hope is that we can end up with the structure similar to what we have now. If that should prove to be impossible, then well move in a different direction. Asked if the NAFTA talks would seek to resolve trade disputes over imports of Canadian softwood lumber or Mexican sugar, Lighthizer said he hoped those issues would be settled before the NAFTA talks begin under separate negotiations being conducted by the U.S. Commerce Department. A Canadian source close to the lumber negotiations said it was unlikely an agreement could be reached by mid-August, however. Lighthizer said he will seek public comment on the NAFTA process and intends to publish negotiating objectives on or about July 16. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The U.S. State Department has proposed requiring about 65,000 visa applicants per year who consular officers believe warrant enhanced screening to provide all prior passport numbers, five years worth of social media handles, email addresses and phone numbers and 15 years of biographical information. More than 50 academic and educational groups across a range of social and physical sciences and representing college admission counselors and advisers said in a letter to State Department officials on Thursday that the changes would cause uncertainties and confusion, lead to unacceptably long delays in processing and applies to a vague and ill-defined class of visa applicants.  We are very concerned that if the proposed changes are implemented, international undergraduate and graduate students, scholars, and scientific collaborators may be discouraged from coming to the United States, the letter said. The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter. The proposal came earlier this month, as part of a push toward the extreme vetting sought by President Donald Trump. The State Department has to obtain approval for the new procedures from the Office of Management and Budget due to federal regulations and allow members of the public to comment. (bit.ly/2qydWWY) Of the approximately 200 comments as of Thursday, the vast majority were opposed, with about a dozen in favor. The deadline to comment is midnight on Thursday. The prospect of requiring tens of thousands of applicants to hand over their social media information stirred particular concern among commenters, who said incoming students would be put off by having their social media presence scrutinized.  The State Department said in its proposal that the extra information would allow it to more rigorously evaluate applicants for terrorism or other national security-related visa ineligibilities. Neil Weissman, interim president of Dickinson College in Pennsylvania, said in a comment on the proposal that the additional criteria will harm the cross-border exchange of ideas. About 10 percent of Dickinsons 2,400 students are international, according to its website. Andrea Pietrzyk advises international students at Lewis-Clark State College, a public college in Idaho, and said her school has seen an approximately 50 percent drop in international applicants for the fall semester compared with last year. If people have the perception that its going to be too difficult to get a visa, theyre not going to want to come, Pietrzyk said. Students from the Middle East do have concerns about whether or not theyll have to show or give up their Facebook passwords. The school had 112 international students in fall 2014, of an overall student body of over 4,300, according to its website. A few people commented in favor of aspects of the proposal, saying they thought it could help protect the United States from terrorism. It seems reasonable to request records of public social media activity as part of an already rigorous vetting process, especially given the role of social media in recent acts of terror, wrote one anonymous commenter. Definitely do this! wrote another commentator, who gave his name as Butch Walton. In this age of terrorism, we need to know as much as possible about who is coming here.

Representative Mac Thornberry, a Texas Republican, told reporters, if youre buying office supplies, you ought to be able to go on Amazon and do it. The current acquisition process prohibits rapid purchases of goods at the best prices because the Department of Defense is restricted to using expensive and onerous contracting processes, committee aides said in a statement about the bill. Thornberry hopes to spark debate about the initiative and then wrap it into the annual National Defense Authorization Act, a broader bill that sets policy for the Defense Department each year, committee aides told reporters. Thornberry and the committee drafted the legislation after more than a year of examining billions of dollars in cost overruns, schedule delays and other problems that have plagued defense procurement programs. The legislation includes measures that would allow existing business to business e-commerce markets, such as Amazon.com Inc or W W Grainger Inc, to sell the military commercial off-the-shelf products such as staplers or forklifts. This would expand procurement options beyond the Pentagons current e-commerce program, EMall. The legislation also aims to make the Defense Departments acquisition system more proactive, agile, transparent and innovative, committee aides said, noting that further measures would be proposed in coming years. This bill would consolidate reporting for services contracts and allow for more transparency and accountability for program managers, committee aids said. In 2015, the Pentagon spent $274 billion on contracts of which $144 billion, about 53 percent, was spent on contracted services. The bill also incentivizes the Pentagon to consider purchasing intellectual property earlier in the acquisition cycle. It was hoped that purchasing intellectual property, such as technical data for missiles, while an acquisition process is still competitive would lead to lower overall costs. Committee aides said the legislation was crafted with input from acquisition officials, industry and outside experts. It is essential to be more agile in the face of technology that changes to fast and threats that change so fast, Thornberry told reporters. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

At a hearing before the House of Representatives tax committee, businessmen including executives from AT&T Inc (T.N), Emerson Electric Co (EMR.N) and S&P Global Inc (SPGI.N), said business needs permanent reforms to enhance certainty for long-term investments that can expand markets, grow jobs and increase wages. I need a permanent tax rate and I need it for at least 10 years, said Emerson Chief Executive David Farr, who is also chairman of the National Association of Manufacturers, a powerful trade group with 14,000 members.  The endorsement of permanent policy changes could help House Republicans advance their revenue-neutral approach in a tax debate that has spawned calls for deficit-funded tax cuts that would have to expire after a decade under Senate rules. The hearing, the first in a series to be held by the House Ways and Means Committee, was intended to show lawmakers moving forward on tax reform at a time of growing doubts about President Donald Trumps ability to overhaul the U.S. tax code this year. Trump officials met this week with leaders from the House and Senate as part of an effort to agree on legislation that could pass Congress. Trump and his fellow Republicans made passing what would be the first major tax reform bill since 1986 a central pledge of last years presidential and congressional campaigns.  But Congress must first enact healthcare legislation. The Senate healthcare debate could drag on through the summer, leaving tax reform for late 2017 or early 2018. Failure could postpone tax reform for years. The business executives formula for business tax reform included permanent tax cuts; an end to taxation of foreign profits; immediate expensing for capital investments and strong research incentives.  Farr also said he backed Trumps 15 percent income tax rate for corporations, less than half of the current 35 percent. Democrats blasted Republican reforms as benefiting the wealthy at the expense of the middle class and charged the white male executives with representing a narrow segment of America.

Representatives Elijah Cummings and Eric Swalwell introduced a bill in December 2016 and again in January 2017 seeking to establish a 12-member, bipartisan-appointed, independent commission to investigate.

Russia has denied that it sought to meddle in the U.S. vote, and Trump has pushed back against such assertions. The Republican leaders of the House have not allowed the legislation to move forward, forcing Democrats to use a parliamentary procedure known as a discharge petition aimed at forcing a vote on legislation that would create the commission. Speaker (Paul) Ryan has shown he has zero, zero, zero appetite for any investigation of President Trump, Cummings told a news conference.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department, in the face of rising pressure from Capitol Hill, named former FBI chief Robert Mueller on Wednesday as special counsel to investigate alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and possible collusion between President Donald Trumps campaign and Moscow. The move followed a week in which the White House was thrown into uproar after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey. Democrats and some of the presidents fellow Republicans had demanded an independent probe of whether Russia tried to sway the outcome of Novembers election in favor of Trump and against Democrat Hillary Clinton. Trump, whose anger over the allegations has grown in recent weeks, took the news calmly and used it to rally his team to unite, move on and refocus on his stalled agenda, a senior White House official said. We are all in this together, Trump told his team, the official said. Trump said in a statement after the Justice Department announcement he looked forward to a quick resolution. As I have stated many times, a thorough investigation will confirm what we already know - there was no collusion between my campaign and any foreign entity, he said. Mueller said in a statement tweeted by CBS News: I accept this responsibility and will discharge it to the best of my ability.  Trump, who said in a speech earlier on Wednesday that no  politician in history has been treated worse or more unfairly, has long bristled at the notion that Russia played any role in his election victory. The Russia issue has, however, clouded his early months in office. Moscow has denied the conclusion by U.S. intelligence agencies that it meddled in the campaign. Pressure on the White House intensified after Trump fired Comey, who had been leading a federal probe into the matter, and allegations that Trump had asked Comey to end the FBI investigation into ties between Trumps first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and Russia. That raised questions about whether the president improperly attempted to interfere with a federal investigation. The issue spilled over onto Wall Street on Wednesday, where the S&P 500 and the Dow had their biggest one-day declines since September as investor hopes for tax cuts and other pro-business policies faded amid the political tumult. The Justice Department announcement came after the market close. My decision (to appoint a special counsel) is not the finding that crimes have been committed or that any prosecution is warranted. I have made no such determination, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said in a statement announcing the special counsel. I determined that a special counsel is necessary in order for the American people to have full confidence in the outcome, he said. Trump heard about Muellers appointment from his White House lawyer Don McGahn about 25 minutes before it was made public, the senior White House official said. Trump assembled his inner circle in the Oval Office - Vice President Mike Pence, chief of staff Reince Preibus, economic adviser Gary Cohn, senior strategist Steve Bannon, and others - and gave them a pep talk, dictating the statement that was soon released. Trump told them the appointment would allow them to refer questions to Mueller, giving them space to focus on policies such as tax reform. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill generally welcomed the Justice Department action and praised Mueller for his integrity, but House and Senate Republican leaders said they would go on with their own investigations of the Russia matter. A special counsel is very much needed in this situation and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein has done the right thing, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement. Republican House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte said he was confident Mueller will conduct a thorough and fair investigation. A discordant note was sounded by Republican Representative Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House of Representatives Oversight Committee, who praised Muellers credentials but said: I dont think they should have appointed someone. I have not seen any evidence of actual collusion. Where is the actual crime that they think they need a special prosecutor to prosecute,Chaffetz told Fox News. Mueller, 72, was decorated as a Marine Corps officer during the Vietnam War. A former federal prosecutor, he is known for his tough, no-nonsense managerial style. Appointed by Republican President George W. Bush, he became FBI director one week before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. He was asked by Democratic President Barack Obama in 2011 to stay on for two more years and was replaced by Comey in 2013. Mueller was credited with transforming the FBI, putting more resources into counterterrorism investigations and improving its cooperation with other U.S. government agencies. Although Mueller will serve at the pleasure of Rosenstein, the job comes with independence and autonomy. Some past independent investigations have stretched for years. Kenneth Starr, who investigated former President Bill Clinton, probed allegations surrounding Clintons past real estate deals but later expanded the inquiry into his relations with then-White House intern Monica Lewinsky, leading to Clintons impeachment by the House. The White House was conducting interviews on Wednesday of candidates to replace Comey as head of the FBI. A senior administration official said former Democratic vice presidential candidate and Senator Joe Lieberman, one of those interviewed by Trump, was among the leading candidates. Trumps spokesman, Sean Spicer, said others being interviewed were acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, former Oklahoma Governor Frank Keating and former senior FBI official Richard McFeely.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Michael Flynn and other advisers to Donald Trumps campaign were in contact with Russian officials and others with Kremlin ties in at least 18 calls and emails during the last seven months of the 2016 presidential race, current and former U.S. officials familiar with the exchanges told Reuters. The previously undisclosed interactions form part of the record now being reviewed by FBI and congressional investigators probing Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election and contacts between Trumps campaign and Russia. Six of the previously undisclosed contacts described to Reuters were phone calls between Sergei Kislyak, Russias ambassador to the United States, and Trump advisers, including Flynn, Trumps first national security adviser, three current and former officials said. Conversations between Flynn and Kislyak accelerated after the Nov. 8 vote as the two discussed establishing a back channel for communication between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin that could bypass the U.S. national security bureaucracy, which both sides considered hostile to improved relations, four current U.S. officials said. In January, the Trump White House initially denied any contacts with Russian officials during the 2016 campaign. The White House and advisers to the campaign have since confirmed four meetings between Kislyak and Trump advisers during that time. The people who described the contacts to Reuters said they had seen no evidence of wrongdoing or collusion between the campaign and Russia in the communications reviewed so far. But the disclosure could increase the pressure on Trump and his aides to provide the FBI and Congress with a full account of interactions with Russian officials and others with links to the Kremlin during and immediately after the 2016 election. The White House did not respond to requests for comment. Flynns lawyer declined to comment. In Moscow, a Russian foreign ministry official declined to comment on the contacts and referred Reuters to the Trump administration. Separately, a spokesman for the Russian embassy in Washington said: We do not comment on our daily contacts with the local interlocutors. The 18 calls and electronic messages took place between April and November 2016 as hackers engaged in what U.S. intelligence concluded in January was part of a Kremlin campaign to discredit the vote and influence the outcome of the election in favor of Trump over his Democratic challenger, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton. Those discussions focused on mending U.S.-Russian economic relations strained by sanctions imposed on Moscow, cooperating in fighting Islamic State in Syria and containing a more assertive China, the sources said. Members of the Senate and House intelligence committees have gone to the CIA and the National Security Agency to review transcripts and other documents related to contacts between Trump campaign advisers and associates and Russian officials and others with links to Putin, people with knowledge of those investigations told Reuters. The U.S. Justice Department said on Wednesday it had appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel to investigate alleged Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential campaign and possible collusion between Trumps campaign and Russia. Mueller will now take charge of the FBI investigation that began last July. Trump and his aides have repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia. In addition to the six phone calls involving Kislyak, the communications described to Reuters involved another 12 calls, emails or text messages between Russian officials or people considered to be close to Putin and Trump campaign advisers. One of those contacts was by Viktor Medvedchuk, a Ukrainian oligarch and politician, according to one person with detailed knowledge of the exchange and two others familiar with the issue. It was not clear with whom Medvedchuk was in contact within the Trump campaign but the themes included U.S.-Russia cooperation, the sources said. Putin is godfather to Medvedchuks daughter. Medvedchuk denied having any contact with anyone in the Trump campaign. I am not acquainted with any of Donald Trumps close associates, therefore no such conversation could have taken place, he said in an email to Reuters. In the conversations during the campaign, Russian officials emphasized a pragmatic, business-style approach and stressed to Trump associates that they could make deals by focusing on common economic and other interests and leaving contentious issues aside, the sources said. Veterans of previous election campaigns said some contact with foreign officials during a campaign was not unusual, but the number of interactions between Trump aides and Russian officials and others with links to Putin was exceptional. Its rare to have that many phone calls to foreign officials, especially to a country we consider an adversary or a hostile power, Richard Armitage, a Republican and former deputy secretary of state, told Reuters. Beyond Medvedchuk and Kislyak, the identities of the other Putin-linked participants in the contacts remain classified and the names of Trump advisers other than Flynn have been masked in intelligence reports on the contacts because of legal protections on their privacy as American citizens. However, officials can request that they be revealed for intelligence purposes. U.S. and allied intelligence and law enforcement agencies routinely monitor communications and movements of Russian officials. After Vice President Mike Pence and others had denied in January that Trump campaign representatives had any contact with Russian officials, the White House later confirmed that Kislyak had met twice with then-Senator Jeff Sessions, who later became attorney general. Kislyak also attended an event in April where Trump said he would seek better relations with Russia. Senior White House adviser Jared Kushner, Trumps son-in-law, also attended that event in Washington. In addition, Kislyak met with two other Trump campaign advisers in July on the sidelines of the Republican convention. Trump fired Flynn in February after it became clear that he had falsely characterized the nature of phone conversations with Kislyak in late December - after the Nov. 8 election and just after the Obama administration announced new sanctions on Russia. Flynn offered to testify to Congress in return for immunity from prosecution but his offer was turned down by the House intelligence committee.

Saudi Arabia has been enthusiastic about Trumps arrival at the White House after seeing his predecessor Barack Obama as too soft on its arch foe Iran and cool toward Washingtons bilateral relationship with Riyadh that is a mainstay of the Middle Easts security balance. Trumps visit to Riyadh, the first stop on his maiden international trip since taking office in January, will include concluding political and commercial agreements with Saudi Arabia, Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said. It will bolster the strategic partnership between the two countries, he told a news conference. Saudi Arabia agrees with the U.S. administrations view in relation to the role of the United States in the world and in relation to uprooting terrorism, he added, referring to the hardline Islamic State group and al Qaeda. Jubeir said Riyadh and Washington were discussing several initiatives related to arms sales, economic and security cooperation and tackling terrorism. Several agreements will be signed, whether political agreements... and big economic agreements, he said. Riyadh backs Trumps efforts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and also agrees with Washington on  confronting Irans aggressive policies and its support for terrorism, he said. Saudi Arabia will be seeking assurances that the Trump administration will continue its harsher tone towards Iran and keep up pressure, through both rhetoric and action, to stop what Riyadh sees as Tehrans destabilizing activities in the region. The Trump administration has heavily criticized the Wests nuclear agreement with Iran that was backed by Obama. Senior  administration officials have also criticized Irans support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, its ballistic missile activities and backing for militant groups in the region. Apart from Saudi officials, Trump will also meet leaders of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and have lunch with leaders of more than 50 Muslim countries in Riyadh. Saudi Arabia will use the opportunity of this gathering to increase cooperation with countries opposing Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, Jubeir said. Jubeir said Saudi Arabia was not concerned about sharing intelligence with the United States, despite a storm over reports that Trump had discussed intelligence with Russia during a White House meeting last week. We share a very, very large amount of intelligence with the United States and vice versa, Jubeir said.

White House officials and Republicans close to the administration say Trump, who campaigned on an America First slogan, wants to demonstrate leadership abroad on his visit with Arab leaders in Saudi Arabia, Israeli and Palestinian leaders in Israel and the West Bank, the pope at the Vatican, NATO leaders in Brussels and G7 counterparts in Sicily. Trump faces fierce criticism over his sharing of sensitive national security information with Russian officials and his firing last week of FBI Director James Comey. Allegations that he previously asked Comey to end an investigation into his former national security adviser drew a new round of attacks on Tuesday. A Republican strategist close to the White House said Trump needed a strong trip to help put the past tumultuous 10 days behind him. If the White House is looking for this international trip to turn the page, then it really needs to come off well without any balls dropped or serious mistakes, said the strategist, who requested anonymity. This is their time to shine, to show Americans and the world that the White House isnt becoming a circus of errors. Airing his frustrations on Twitter, Trump has lashed out at leaks to the news media from officials inside his administration. Confidants say a staff shake-up is possible, although major changes are unlikely before Trumps foreign trip. His political woes will add to Trumps challenges as he tries to bolster ties abroad. This trip combines so many different things and actors that the question is going to be whats the message that he wants to communicate when hes out there, said Lanhee Chen, who advised Republican Mitt Romneys presidential campaign in 2012 and Marco Rubios in 2016. Some doubt whether Trump, a businessman-turned politician who never held elective office before becoming president in January, is ready for a smooth presidential debut abroad. One Republican official, who requested anonymity in order to speak freely, said after meeting Trump recently he did not think  the president had a firm enough grasp on the nuances of the long-running Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I dont think he understands it, said the official, adding that Trump needed more detailed briefings before leaving on Friday. I think its a very difficult challenge and I hope hes going to talk to a lot of smart people. White House advisers insisted Trump was up to speed on the Middle East, having already hosted Arab, Israeli and Palestinian leaders at the White House. His way of doing diplomacy, which really contrasts with President Obamas approach, is to ... prioritize the personal relationship, said Michael Singh, a foreign policy adviser to former Republican President George W. Bush. To prepare for his trip, Trump has been meeting with briefers including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster, deputy national security adviser Dina Powell and senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner. Conversations with some officials who have briefed Trump and others who are aware of how he absorbs information portray a president with a short attention span. He likes single-page memos and visual aids like maps, charts, graphs and photos. National Security Council officials have strategically included Trumps name in as many paragraphs as we can because he keeps reading if hes mentioned, according to one source, who relayed conversations he had with NSC officials. Trump likes to look at a map of the country involved when he learns about a topic. He likes to visualize things, said a senior administration official. The guys a builder. He has spent his whole life looking at architectural renderings and floor plans. Although Trump has a string of golf resorts around the world that he has visited, the trip could take him out of his comfort zone. He generally prefers his own bed to hotel rooms. During the 2016 presidential campaign, he often flew home after a day of campaigning rather than staying in hotels overnight. Presidential rhetoric and gaffes abroad have caused  problems for some of Trumps predecessors. Bush drew fire after his first meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, in Slovenia in June 2001, when he said he had looked the former KGB chief in the eye and I was able to get a sense of his soul. The comment was seen as naive. Even body language is watched carefully. Democratic President Barack Obama was criticized for bowing to Japanese Emperor Akihito in a visit to Japan in November 2009. One Gulf Arab official said Trumps decision to make Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam, the first stop on his trip would send a message that America did not see Islam as an enemy.  The trip could be a chance for the president to counter critics who accuse him of being anti-Muslim because of the order he issued, now blocked by U.S. courts, temporarily banning entry into the United States by citizens of several Muslim-majority countries.  But the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that if Trump, who is prone to speaking off-the-cuff, ended up undercutting his own message, it could be damaging. It can backfire, I mean it can seriously backfire, the official said. Ari Fleischer, former press secretary to Bush, said that since the trip would be Trumps first overseas, the stakes were higher. The meaning and importance of his first trip abroad will be exaggerated, but it gives him a chance to get bipartisan accolades, or a chance to fail badly and have the failure exaggerated, Fleischer said.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - President Donald Trumps firing of FBI Director James Comey on May 9 renewed attention to allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the 2016 election campaign to benefit Trump. The following describes what is publicly known and not known about U.S. investigations into meddling and possible collusion between Russia and members of the Trump campaign: How did the investigations begin? Former President Barack Obama ordered U.S. intelligence agencies to assess whether Russia tried to intervene in the  election after a cyber attack on the Democratic National Committee in July 2016 and the publication of thousands of hacked personal emails from Hillary Clintons campaign manager in the month before the Nov. 8 election. Obama told intelligence officials to deliver a report on possible foreign interference before he left the White House in January 2017. What did the intelligence agencies find?  The Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency concluded in a report declassified in January that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a campaign not just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system but to affect the outcome. The agencies said Putin and the Russian government had a clear preference for Trump to win the White House. Putins  associates hacked information, paid social media trolls and backed efforts by Russian government agencies and state-funded media to sway public opinion, the agencies said.  The report stopped short of assessing whether Russia succeeded in swaying the election result. Putin and other Russian officials have repeatedly denied interfering in the U.S. election. What has Trump said about Russias role in the election? Trump has not taken a clear public position.  I will tell you this, Russia: if youre listening, I hope youre able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing, Trump said at a July 2016 news conference, in reference to an FBI probe into Clintons use of a private email system when she was secretary of state and emails that had possibly been deleted. Trump subsequently dismissed reports, including from U.S. intelligence officials, that Russia had attempted to intervene in the election on his behalf.    The first time Trump said he accepted the findings of the intelligence agencies was at a Jan. 11 news conference ahead of his inauguration. As far as hacking, I think it was Russia, Trump said, although he added: It could have been others also. Earlier this month, Trump said China may have hacked the emails of Democratic officials to meddle with the election, offering no evidence and countering the view of intelligence officials. How many U.S. probes are there into Russias election meddling?  The Justice Department announced on May 17 that it has appointed Robert Mueller, a former FBI director, as special counsel to lead an independent Russia probe. Mueller would, if the evidence merits, work in tandem with the FBI, which is investigating, to handle any related criminal prosecutions.   Committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate are also investigating and those probes will continue. Comey has been invited to testify about the agencys Russia investigation and his dismissal.  Has there been any fallout for Trump associates over contacts  with Russia before, during or after the election campaign? Michael Flynn, Trumps national security adviser, was fired  in February. The White House said he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about the contacts he had with Russias ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kislyak, before Trump took office. On May 9, federal prosecutors issued grand jury subpoenas seeking business records from people who worked with Flynn when he was a private citizen. On May 10, the Senate Intelligence Committee issued the  first subpoena in its Russia investigation, demanding documents from Flynn after he declined to voluntarily comply with an earlier request. Attorney General Jeff Sessions had to recuse himself from involvement in Russia-related probes at the Justice Department because he had not told Congress of his own contacts with Kislyak in 2016. Rod Rosenstein, the deputy U.S. attorney general, is handling matters related to Russia; he appointed Mueller as special counsel. Will the FBI probe continue after Comeys dismissal? Comey told the House Intelligence Committee on March 20 that the FBI was investigating Moscows role in the election, including possible collusion with Trumps campaign. It was the first time he publicly acknowledged the agency was investigating the matter. Comeys departure does not necessarily mean the FBIs Russia investigation will be disrupted or ended as the career FBI officials Comey put in charge of it will likely continue working on the matter even as the search for a new director begins. FBI acting Director Andrew McCabe, who will lead the agency until a new director is named, promised the Senate Intelligence Committee that Comeys firing will not affect the investigation and that he will notify the committee of any attempt to delay or derail it. Why was Comey fired? Attorney General Sessions sent Trump a May 9 letter attaching a memo from Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, on Restoring Confidence in the FBI that recommended Comeys dismissal. Rosensteins memo said Comey erred in July 2016 by announcing the FBI had been examining Clintons use of a private email server and that the case should be closed without prosecution. Rosensteins view was that Comeys decision to make a public statement on the matter broke with longstanding FBI precedent and should have been handled by the then-U.S. attorney general, Loretta Lynch. Trump called Comey a showboat and grandstander in an interview with NBC News on May 11, saying that he would have fired Comey regardless of Rosensteins recommendation.  Did Comeys firing have anything to do with the Russia probe? The White House says Comey was dismissed because of his handling of the Clinton email investigation.  The New York Times was the first to report, on May 16, that a memo Comey wrote after a February meeting with Trump stated that the president had asked him to end the FBIs investigation of Flynn. Trump aides have told Reuters that top Justice Department officials wanted a heads-up from Comey about what he would say during a May 3 congressional hearing about the FBIs investigation of Clintons private email system.  The hearing was just days after Clinton said at a New York event that announcements by Comey in the week before the November election that he had re-opened, and then re-closed, the email probe had swung the election for Trump. Comey told the congressional panel the idea that he may have affected the election result made him mildly nauseous. Is Trump being investigated by the FBI?  In the short letter Trump sent to Comey dismissing him from the FBI, he thanked Comey for informing him on three separate occasions that he was not under investigation. Comey has never stated publicly whether or not the FBI was investigating Trump and it would be unorthodox for him to say such a thing to the president. The White House has offered no proof to back Trumps claim. News of Comeys memo, along with a Washington Post report on May 15 that Trump had revealed classified info during a May 10 meeting at the White House with Russian officials, intensified calls from Democrats and some Republicans for an independent probe of Trumps ties to Russia. Trump has made clear on multiple occasions he believes the Russia investigations have run their course and should be closed.

Muellers appointment comes after the administration was rocked by reports that Trump asked Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey to drop an investigation of Mike Flynn, who resigned amid allegations of contacts with Russia. Trump fired Comey last week. Below are reactions to the Mueller appointment: As I have stated many times, a thorough investigation will confirm what we already know - there was no collusion between my campaign and any foreign entity.I look forward to this matter concluding quickly. - Trump in a statement A special prosecutor is the first step but it cannot be the last.

He cannot take the place of a truly independent, outside commission that is completely free from the Trump administrations meddling. - Democratic Representative Nancy Pelosi in a statement I dont think they should have appointed someone ...

What I worry is Democrats are going to politically exploit this on a daily drumbeat. - Republican Representative Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House Oversight Committee investigating Russian influence, in a Fox News interview in which he also praised Muellers impeccable credentials.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former FBI director and prosecutor Robert Mueller, known for his independence in high-profile government investigations, is taking on a new challenge in the midst of a crisis that threatens the presidency of the United States. Mueller, 72, was named on Wednesday by the Justice Department to probe alleged Russian efforts to sway Novembers presidential election in favor of Donald Trump and to investigate whether there was any collusion between Trumps campaign team and Moscow. President Trump said in a statement there was no collusion between his campaign and any foreign entity.  Mueller is known by some as Bobby Three Sticks because of his full name - Robert Mueller III - a moniker that belies the formal bearing and no-nonsense style of the former Marine Corps officer who was decorated during the Vietnam War. Democrats and Republicans alike praised his appointment and hailed his integrity and reputation. Mueller was named to the post by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. His investigation will run in parallel to those being carried out by the FBI and the U.S. Congress. It would be difficult to fire Mueller, and past special counsel appointments have shown that the job comes with independence and autonomy. Chicago federal prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald was appointed during the George W. Bush administration in 2003 to a similar role to investigate the leak of the identity of Valerie Plame, an undercover CIA officer whose husband had criticized Bush administration policies. Fitzgerald indicted I. Lewis Scooter Libby, a top aide to Vice President Dick Cheney. Bush granted Libby clemency from a prison sentence before he left office. Robert Luskin, a Washington lawyer who defended Bush political adviser Karl Rove during Fitzgeralds investigation, praised the choice of Mueller. I think its good across the board, Luskin told Reuters. He described Mueller as credible and independent and said his appointment would be good for the Department of Justice. Mueller, known for avoiding political controversy, took a stand in 2004 when he and then-deputy attorney general James Comey threatened to resign when the Bush White House sought to reauthorize a domestic wiretapping program that the Justice Department had deemed unconstitutional. In his new role as special counsel, Mueller will have wide latitude to take the investigation wherever he thinks it should go and can use the full range of Justice Department investigative tools, said Jack Sharman, an attorney who served as special counsel during a probe into the Whitewater real-estate investments of President Bill Clinton in 1995. Mueller was appointed director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation by George W. Bush a week before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington, D.C.  He was credited with transforming the FBI after Congress and an independent government commission established that the agency and the CIA had failed to share information before the attacks that could have helped thwart them. At the FBI, Mueller put more resources into counterterrorism investigations and improving its cooperation with other federal agencies. Mueller was chief of the Justice Departments criminal division before becoming FBI director. Among his most famous cases was the fraud and racketeering indictment of individuals associated with a politically connected Luxembourg bank run out of London and led by bankers from Pakistan and Abu Dhabi. He also oversaw the investigation into the Pan Am airline bombing over Scotland and the drug case against former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega. Mueller served 10 years as FBI chief under Bush and his  Democratic successor Barack Obama, who then signed legislation to extend Muellers FBI term for another two years. He was succeeded as FBI director by Comey, who was fired by Trump last week.  In the wake of his firing, there have been media reports that Trump had asked Comey in February to end an FBI investigation into the presidents former national security adviser, Michael Flynn. The reports cited a memo said to have been written by Comey documenting Trumps request.  There have been calls for months for a special counsel to oversee the investigation into any ties between Trumps campaign team and Moscow. Most recently, Mueller had worked at a major Washington law firm, Wilmer Hale, which presents a possible wrinkle for his new assignment. The firm represents Trumps daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner, who have taken on White House jobs. It also represents Paul Manafort, a former campaign chairman who had ties to Russia. Mueller left Wilmer Hale this week but faces a Justice Department ethics requirement that could bar him for a year from investigating anyone represented by his former firm. Mueller may be able to obtain a waiver from the Justice Departments ethics officers or recuse himself from investigating certain individuals, leaving those inquiries to a deputy. Richard Painter, an ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush administration who has been a vocal critic of Trump, said Mueller has good grounds to receive such a waiver.

With the White House and both chambers of the U.S. Congress under Republican control, party leaders and their allies in the business community had expected to get quick traction on their plans, with corporate tax cuts among the top priorities. But four months into Trumps tenure, only limited progress has been made. The House of Representatives passed a measure to rewrite Obamacare, but the Senate is only in the very early stages of considering the issue. Lawmakers are just beginning their push on tax reform. In addition to congressional probes that are taking place into possible collusion between Trumps 2016 campaign team and Russia, the U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday named former FBI Director Robert Mueller to investigate the matter. Its the elephant in the room right now, said Republican Representative Pat Tiberi. The smartest minds in the White House know that, whether its tax reform or anything else on the public policy front. Its hard enough to get things done in the U.S. Capitol under the best of circumstances. The House Ways and Means Committee will hold a hearing on tax reform on Thursday. Key administration and congressional leaders met Wednesday afternoon to discuss a path forward. But they remain a long way from signing a bill into law. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday that less drama from the White House was needed to advance legislative priorities.  Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told reporters on Wednesday that the legislative process had pretty much ground to a halt amid the tumult in Washington. Republican Representative Steve Womack said it was important for committees investigating the Russia matter to move forward expeditiously to both ensure that the public gets answers and to clear the way for Congress to move on to other issues. Any time we get bogged down on these kinds of issues unrelated to the governing agenda, it serves to delay and to sometimes complicate the real job that we have to do for the American people, Womack said. At a news conference on Wednesday, House Speaker Paul Ryan urged his colleagues to seize this moment to pass tax reform. But instead of discussing tax rates and structures, Ryan was faced with a series of questions about James Comey, who Trump fired as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation last week, and the Russia investigation. Several lobbyists said that in the past week their corporate clients have grown more cautious on the prospects for tax reform but still hope that at least a small package can be approved.  My worry level has grown considerably, one lobbyist said. Some lobbyists suggested that Congress could consider focusing on tax breaks and perhaps leave aside the comprehensive overhaul of the tax code that they had originally hoped for.  When this all started, the thing we heard from the Hill was transformative tax reform, said a strategist who consults with major companies focused on tax reform. I think as time passes, tax reform is going to look much different, that it may be begin to look more like tax cuts than tax reform.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""SOCHI/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that U.S. President Donald Trump had not divulged any secrets during a meeting in Washington with Russian officials and offered to prove it by supplying Congress with a transcript. But a leading U.S. Republican politician said he would have little faith in any notes Putin might supply. Two U.S. officials said on Monday Trump had disclosed classified information about a planned Islamic State operation to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov when they met last week, plunging the White House into a fresh controversy just four months into Trumps tenure. Trump, whose administration has been dogged by allegations that Russia helped him win the White House and that he and his allies are too cozy with Moscow, has defended his decision to discuss intelligence with the Russians after media reports of the meeting alarmed some U.S. and foreign politicians. President Putin deployed his trademark sarcasm on Wednesday to make clear he thought the accusation that Trump had divulged secrets absurd.  I spoke to him (Lavrov) today, a smiling Putin told a news conference with Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi. Ill be forced to issue him (Lavrov) with a reprimand because he did not share these secrets with us. Not with me, nor with representatives of Russias intelligence services. It was very bad of him.  Putin, who still hopes Moscow can repair battered ties with the United States despite a deepening political scandal in the United States related to Trumps purported Russia ties, said Moscow had rated Lavrovs meeting with Trump highly. If the Trump administration deemed it appropriate, Putin said Russia could hand over a transcript of Trumps meeting with Lavrov to U.S. lawmakers to reassure them that no secrets were revealed. A Kremlin aide, Yuri Ushakov, later told reporters that Moscow had a written record of the conversation, not an audio recording. U.S. Republican Senator Marco Rubio was unimpressed with Putins offer and alluded to alleged Russian hacking of Democratic groups during the U.S. presidential election.  I wouldnt put much credibility into whatever Putins notes are, Rubio said on Fox News. And if it comes in an email, I wouldnt click on the attachment. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, which is among those probing alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, called Putins offer quite amusing. The last person Trump needs to vouch for him right now is Vladimir Putin, Schiff said in an interview with CBS News. If they want to send something, you know, hats off. Send it our way... Its credibility would be less than zero. Russia has repeatedly denied interfering in the U.S. election. Trump is also under pressure over accusations he asked then-FBI Director James Comey to end the agencys investigation into the Russia ties of former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn. The allegation stems from a memo written by Comey and seen by a source familiar with the contents of the memo. In Washington, Republican and Democratic lawmakers said they wanted to see the Comey memo. U.S. Representative Adam Kinzinger joined a small but growing number of Republican lawmakers who have said they would back some sort of independent investigation into Russias role in the 2016 election. If in fact what was in the memo is true, its very concerning and we need to get to the bottom of that, Kinzinger said on CNN. Complaining about what he said was political schizophrenia in the United States, Putin said Trump was not being allowed to do his job properly. Its hard to imagine what else these people who generate such nonsense and rubbish can dream up next, said Putin, referring to unnamed U.S. politicians.  What surprises me is that they are shaking up the domestic political situation using anti-Russian slogans. Either they dont understand the damage theyre doing to their own country, in which case they are simply stupid, or they understand everything, in which case they are dangerous and corrupt.     Russia has repeatedly said that Trumps opponents are trying to damage him and Moscow by making what it says are false accusations about the billionaire president and the Russian government which initially had high hopes of a rapprochement. Officials have told Reuters Trumps alleged disclosure of classified information to Russias foreign minister is unlikely to stop allies who share intelligence with Washington from cooperating. That view was reinforced on Wednesday when British Prime Minister Theresa May said her government had confidence in its relationship with the United States and would continue to share intelligence with Britains most important defense and security ally.

Though criminal probes can at times complicate congressional matters, legal experts said the complications would be indistinguishable from those created by the already ongoing FBI investigation. * Mueller will steer a parallel probe at the Justice Department.  Mueller will interview relevant witnesses, subpoena documents and, if the evidence merits, work with the FBI to bring criminal charges related to the probe. *Mueller will operate with a high degree of independence from the Trump administration. Rosenstein appointed Mueller to head the departments Russia probe citing department regulations that allow attorney generals to appoint a special counsel from outside the federal government.  The department regulations are not quite as robust as a law related to the appointment of a special prosecutor that lapsed in the 1990s, according to Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. But the regulations are designed to give the special counsel a great degree of independence - decisions can be overridden but if they are, to make sure that Congress knows about them, Levitt said. Rosenstein appointed Mueller because Attorney General Jeff Sessions had to recuse himself from involvement in Russia-related probes because he had not told Congress about his own contacts with Russian officials. *It would be difficult to fire Mueller from the job. Only the attorney general - or in this case Rosenstein, as the acting attorney general in matters related to Russia - has the authority to fire a special counsel. Justice Department regulations state that a special counsel can only be removed for cause, such as misconduct, conflict of interest or dereliction of duty, Levitt said. Though Rosenstein, like Comey, serves at the pleasure of the president and could be removed without cause at any time, Levitt cautioned that doing so in order to jeopardize Muellers probe would come at a high political cost. Each of those actions will come with increasing public and congressional scrutiny, Levitt said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Clarkes office and spokeswoman in Milwaukee could not be reached for comment on Wednesday. He said on the radio show that he would work with local agencies that can feel neglected or ignored by the federal government. The Department of Homeland Security, created after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and the Pentagon, includes agencies that handle customs, border protection and immigration, the Coast Guard, the Transportation Security Administration and the Secret Service. The Black Lives Matter movement grew out of protests over a number of police killings of unarmed black men in various parts of the United States. The movement has challenged the use of excessive force by law enforcement officers.  Clarke has labeled members of the movement subhuman creeps and called for its eradication. He spoke in support of Trump at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland last July.

Under former President Barack Obama, the government created a similar inter-agency review, but it was not required by law and was administered by the NSA itself. The new bill would mandate a review when a government agency discovers a security hole in a computer product and does not want to alert the manufacturer because it hopes to use the flaw to spy on rivals. It also calls for the review process to be chaired by the defense-oriented Department of Homeland Security rather than the NSA, which spends 90 percent of its budget on offensive capabilities and spying. Republican Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Democratic Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii introduced the legislation in the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. Striking the balance between U.S. national security and general cyber security is critical, but its not easy, said Senator Schatz in a statement. This bill strikes that balance. Tech companies have long criticized the practice of withholding information about software flaws so they can be used by government intelligence agencies for attacks. Hackers attacked 200,000 in more than 150 countries last week using a Microsoft Windows software vulnerability that had been developed by the NSA and later leaked online. Microsoft President Brad Smith harshly criticized government practices on security flaws in the wake of the ransomware attacks. Repeatedly, exploits in the hands of governments have leaked into the public domain and caused widespread damage, Smith wrote in a blog post. Agencies like the NSA often have greater incentives to exploit any security holes they find for spying, instead of helping companies protect customers, cyber security experts say.  Do you get to listen to the Chinese politburo chatting and get credit from the president? said Richard Clayton a cyber-security researcher at the University of Cambridge. Or do you notify the public to help defend everyone else and get less kudos? Susan Landau, a cyber security policy expert at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, said that in putting DHS in charge of the process, the new bill was an effort to put the process into civilian control. The new committees meetings would still be secret. But once a year it would issue a public version of a secret annual report.  The NSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Some, such as the online political stock market PredictIt, have seen record volume during the last two days on contracts focused on whether Trump will be impeached. Others based in the United Kingdom are drawing bets on the less-specific question of whether Trump remains in office until his term expires in January 2021. The contract on PredictIt titled Will Donald Trump be impeached in 2017? saw volume of more than 100,000 contracts in the last 24 hours after reports of a memo written by Comey that said Trump had asked him to end the Federal Bureau of Investigations probe into ties between former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn and Russia.  At one point early on Wednesday, the price of a yes contract on the impeachment question jumped to a record 33 cents, implying a 33 percent probability that Trump would be impeached. That compares with only 7 percent just over a week ago. By late in the day, however, the price had slid back to 27 percent, just above where it ended late Tuesday at 24 percent. PredictIt is jointly run by Washington political consultancy Aristotle and Victoria University in Wellington, New Zealand. All of its users are registered U.S. voters. The bookmaker Paddy Power Betfair (PPB.I) (PPB.L) said bettors there had laid out more than 5,000 pounds ($6,470) on an early departure for Trump in the hours after it was reported Trump had asked Comey to shut down the FBIs investigation of Russia ties. In all, the question of whether Trump will make an early exit has drawn more than $270,000 in wagers, while a related question on whether Trump will leave in 2017, 2018, 2019 or 2020 or later has garnered more than $480,000. British betting firm Ladbrokes (LCL.L) cut the price of a Trump impeachment to odds-on at 4-5 from 11-10, equivalent to about 56 percent probability that Trump will be removed from office. Political punters are wondering how many more scandals can Trump overcome, said Ladbrokes spokeswoman Jessica Bridge.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. industry groups have told President Donald Trumps administration that they want two main things from his promised regulatory overhaul: a speedier permit process and simpler environmental rules. Associations representing the drilling, refining, mining, and building industries have submitted hundreds of pages of documents to the Commerce Department and Environmental Protection Agency in recent weeks, outlining regulations they want to see eliminated or modified. The comments, many targeting the EPA, come in response to a pair of executive orders Trump signed during his first weeks in office, meant to cut the regulatory burden on companies. Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress have already moved to rescind a slew of Obama-era environmental protections, including some aimed at combating global climate change. The EPAs regulatory reform office alone has received remarks from more than 65,000 people and groups, many of them criticizing the regulatory rollback plan as a potential threat to public health. But business groups have embraced the plan, calling it the best chance in more than a decade to reshape the regulatory landscape and boost growth, without undermining air and water quality. Last time I remember this was 2001. That was the last big opportunity to make some changes, said David Friedman, vice president of regulatory affairs for the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers industry group.  That year, then Vice President Dick Cheney chaired an energy task force that produced a National Energy Policy report, a road map to boosting domestic systems and supplies. Much has changed since: U.S. oil and gas production hit all-time highs during the administration of former President Barack Obama, helped by high crude prices and improved drilling technology. This time around, industry groups appear focused on easing the permitting process for new facilities and installations, according to a Reuters review of the comments. A common refrain, for example, is for Trumps administration to reject a planned tightening of ozone rules under the U.S. Clean Air Acts National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Several groups said this would expose them to increased permitting hurdles for operations and new facilities. Several groups mentioned other permitting requirements under the Clean Air Act that they say are redundant. These include the New Source Performance Standards, the Maximum Achievable Control Technology rules and the National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants.  We have one proposal to replace eight different regulations with one that achieves the same environmental benefit but substantially reduces the cost of compliance, said Rosario Palmieri, vice president for regulatory policy at the National Association of Manufacturers.  The American Petroleum Institute representing oil and gas companies and the Edison Electric Institute, representing electric utilities, are seeking changes in the way companies must account for greenhouse gas emissions. Comments from members of the public and environmental groups revealed worries that this process would undermine environmental protections. The EPAs comment period ended on May 15. Jeff Baker, a military veteran and energy investor from Alabama wrote: I implore you, as defenders of our nations health and security, to avoid shortsighted steps that might create prosperity for a few in the short term, at the expense of the many in the long term. Trumps administration requested the comments from industry as part of two similar and concurrent processes, stemming from his executive orders.  The first order, issued on Jan. 24, directed Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to review which U.S. regulations were burdens for domestic manufacturing. The Commerce Department solicited feedback from industry as a result of that order, with a March 31 deadline. Ross told Reuters in an interview last week that the department was condensing the comments into a series of recommendations that could be presented to Trump as early as this month. [nL1N1IB240] The second order was issued Feb. 24, directing all U.S. agency heads to launch a process to identify regulatory burdens. Each agency has its own timetable.

The comments can be found at the following web sites: here and here Here is a selection of some of their suggestions: * GREENHOUSE GAS REPORTING RULE - Modify the U.S. Clean Air Acts Greenhouse Gas Reporting rule to create incentives for carbon capture and storage technology, in which carbon dioxide emissions are captured and stored underground. * STACK TESTING - Eliminate redundant stack testing currently required under parts of the U.S. Clean Air Act. * ONCE IN-ALWAYS IN - Eliminate a provision of the U.S. Clean Air Act that requires a major source of emissions to always be treated as a major source, even if it later adds technology to reduce those emissions. This change was also requested by other groups, including the American Fuel & Petrochemicals Manufacturers and the American Petroleum Institute. * NEW SOURCE REVIEW - Modify the New Source Review permitting process required under the U.S. Clean Air Act to eliminate the need to consider emissions increases from non-modified affected emission units at a plant, and allow project netting that accounts for emissions reductions elsewhere at a plant. * NATIONAL AMBIENT AIR QUALITY STANDARDS - Review an EPA decision to tighten ozone standards in a way that would likely expose more company facilities to tougher Clean Air Act rules. * RENEWABLE FUEL STANDARD - Ensure average mandated ethanol content in gasoline does not exceed 9.7 percent of projected U.S. demand. * RENEWABLE FUEL STANDARD - Ensure EPA continues to boost the mandated volumes of biofuels in gasoline and other road fuels. * AIR PERMITS: Reduce the burden of air and ozone permitting regulation to make it easier to greenlight projects. * EPA TRANSPARENCY: Increase the transparency of the science EPA relies upon in its rule-making. * NEW SOURCE PERFORMANCE STANDARDS: Streamline specific NSPS and NESHAP regulations to eliminate redundant requirements, conflicts between rules, and undue complexity, resulting in practical and understandable regulations without reduced protection of the environment. * NEW SOURCE PERFORMANCE STANDARDS: Review rules seeking to limit fugitive emissions from oil and gas installations. * NATIONAL AMBIENT AIR QUALITY STANDARDS: Like AFPM and others, IPAA wants a review of planned tightening of ozone standards that could ramp up regulatory burdens.   * MORE COLLABORATIVE ENFORCEMENT: EPA needs to thoroughly review and revise its federal enforcement process. It needs to create an enforcement program that treats the regulated community with fairness, respect and dignity. * NEW SOURCE REVIEW: There continues to be a need for NSR reforms that simplify and streamline permitting. * NATIONAL AMBIENT AIR QUALITY STANDARDS: Review various aspects of ozone standards and enforcement to ease regulatory burdens.  * GREENHOUSE GAS REPORTING RULE - Require less frequent, and less arduous reporting of greenhouse gas emissions. * NEW SOURCE PERFORMANCE STANDARDS: Reconsider aspects of this regulation, including those requiring a New Source Review permit for a plant undergoing any modification - an enormous additional environmental review process that stifles modernization and efficiency upgrades. * FINANCIAL ASSURANCE FOR HARD ROCK MINING: Eliminate EPA rule that would require an increase in funds available to reclaim post-mining sites. * ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT: Overturn misuse of the Endangered Species Act which has put 10 million acres across a few western states off limits from mining.

On Wednesday a Senate committee sent a bill on to the full chamber that, supporters say, will make regulators more accountable to lawmakers and provide greater understanding of how rules affect the economy.  The next step, debating the bill on the Senate floor, has not been scheduled. The House of Representatives approved companion legislation in January. Critics say the bill, the Regulatory Accountability Act, creates so many new requirements that it would paralyze regulators working to establish even the most basic rules and standards. They also say it makes cutting industry and banks costs a higher priority than protecting public health and safety. For decades the political parties have been starkly divided over regulation and Republicans are currently winning their battle to lessen the red tape they say ties up business and hurts the economy. Republicans also say former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, pushed regulators to go beyond their duties of executing laws passed by Congress to create policy on their own.  Democrats say regulation, which touches nearly every part of American life, shields average people from health, financial and other threats and is needed to accomplish the goals set in laws. The Senate bill would require more cost-benefit and other analyses, give courts and the White House greater checks on rulemaking, classify regulations by potential economic impact, and lengthen rulemaking processes.  One progressive group, Public Citizen, estimates it would add 53 steps to major rulemaking, possibly doubling the average amount of time it takes to finalize a regulation - currently four years. The bill has pitted the powerful business group, the Chamber of Commerce, against progressive ones such as the Natural Resources Defense Council. Senator Heidi Heitkamp broke ranks with her fellow Democrats to write the accountability act, indicating some members of the party may support the bill when the closely-divided Senate votes. Also, Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat, is working on alternative legislation that her party could find more palatable and could keep some of the bills measures. Since Republicans swept Congress and the White House in Novembers elections they have moved swiftly against regulation.  Using the Congressional Review Act, lawmakers killed 14 Obama-era regulations in the span of three months. Trumps efforts have yielded mixed results. His order to cut two existing regulations for every new one has stalled during a legal challenge. Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Agency was jammed with thousands of pleas to maintain regulations when it asked for public comment on Trumps order to look into repealing or rewriting current rules.

The acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Thomas Homan said that arrests by his agency jumped to 41,318 between January 22 of this year and the end of April, up from 30,028 arrests in roughly the same period last year.  Of those arrested almost two-thirds had criminal convictions. But there was also a significant jump - of more than 150 percent - in the number of immigrants not convicted of further crimes arrested by ICE: 10,800 since the beginning of the year compared to 4,200 non-criminal arrests in the same period in 2016. That increase is a result of recent guidance given by Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly to implement Trumps executive orders on interior immigration enforcement and border security signed on Jan. 25, just days after the Republican president took office.  Those that enter the country illegally, they do violate the law, that is a criminal act, Homan said on the call, while emphasizing that immigrants who pose a threat to national security or have criminal records are still a priority for the agency. He said ICE will continue to target people who have been issued a final order of removal by an immigration judge even if they have not committed another crime. When a federal judge makes a decision and issues an order that order needs to mean something, Homan said. If we dont take action on those orders, then we are just spinning our wheels.  While President Barack Obama was also criticized for deporting a large number of immigrants, most of them were recent border crossers apprehended entering the country illegally.  Deportations under Trump have actually fallen by 12 percent compared to the same period under Obama, Homan said, as more people arrested in the interior typically have more complicated cases that can get slowed down in the backlogged immigration court system.   The number of people caught crossing the border with Mexico is down significantly since the begin of the year, according to data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Immigration advocates and some cities with large immigrant populations have raised concerns about the stepped up enforcement in the interior of the country.  On Wednesday, state attorneys general from New York, California, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington state and Washington D.C., issued a report laying out why they have chosen to limit local law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration agents.

Led by Governor John Kasich of Ohio, the governors are using a nine-page proposal they crafted in February as the platform to shape what they think a critical portion of an Obamacare replacement law should look like, according to a half dozen people who helped write the plan.  Among the groups recommendations for the Senate include maintaining the expansion of Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor and disabled, while also limiting federal spending for certain populations, according to a copy of the proposal.  Members of the group, which include governors from Utah, Tennessee and Michigan, are also now looking to form a bipartisan coalition of states to propose reforms for the individual insurance market, according to one source, that they hope the Senate will also use. To see a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2qOZScv They have not yet met or decided on specific reforms about the individual insurance market, but the goal is to address issues such as how to make insurance more affordable and stabilize the markets. The House of Representatives narrowly passed its national healthcare bill earlier this month, called the American Health Care Act, which would slash federal Medicaid funding by more than $800 billion over the next decade.  It has prompted fierce criticism from both Republican and Democratic governors.  Kasich recently called the bill inadequate, and said it would leave millions of people without affordable coverage and living in the emergency rooms again.   Pressure is building from their constituents.  The Reuters/Ipsos poll, which has been tracking public opinion on health care issues for the past several years, has found that Republicans are more supportive than they were in 2013 of benefits including expanded Medicaid and insurance subsidies for low-income families and a government requirement that small businesses provide insurance for their employees. The latest Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English across the United States and gathered responses from 2,126 adults, including 887 Republicans. It has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 2 percentage points for the entire group and 4 percentage points for Republicans. The governors group is looking to the Senate for massive changes as they begin writing their own bill. Several groups, from insurers and hospitals to medical groups and patient advocates, are trying to influence the Senate. But the governors carry extra weight because they will ultimately be responsible for implementing whatever healthcare overhaul is signed into law, and Republicans in Congress have repeatedly spoken about the need to have fewer federal regulations apply to Medicaid and commercial insurance. Under Obamacare, more than 30 states, including about a dozen Republican-led states, expanded Medicaid. One of the thorniest issues Republicans have grappled with is treating both expansion and non-expansion states equally. Governors from both types of states united to craft Medicaid proposals in the hope that their voice would carry added weight and provide a surer path for lawmakers.  The governors are also in the same boat politically as U.S. senators because both are elected statewide, rather than in smaller districts as House representatives are. So many governors and their senators have been better aligned on what healthcare reform should look like, several of the sources said. Several governors and their staff said they have been in regular contact with their senators, and will be pushing for the Senate to use the governors set of reforms as a framework in writing its bill.  Senator Rob Portman of Ohio wrote in an op-ed Monday that he and other senators tasked with writing a healthcare bill have continued to engage with governors, many of who share my concerns about Medicaid but who also want more flexibility to ensure they can design health care programs that meet the individual needs of their states.  He added that the Senate will continue to work with governors on healthcare reform. They are definitely hearing our concerns and questions. They have been very attentive to our interests, said Nathan Checketts, deputy director of the Utah Department of Health. The group of Republican governors has worked to have a unified voice to reconcile needs among a diverse set of states, including Arizona, Illinois, Wisconsin, Arkansas and Nevada. Its leaders, which also include Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan and Governor Doug Ducey of Arizona, deliberately chose some participants from states with influential Republican senators who would become key players in a federal healthcare overhaul.  A 13-member Senate panel has been tasked with writing a healthcare bill, and at least five of its senators are from states from the Republican governors group, including Portman, Orrin Hatch of Utah, Mike Lee of Utah and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee.  Other Republican senators with governors in the group - including Dean Heller of Nevada and Jeff Flake of Arizona - are up for reelection in 2018.  As Senate Republicans take up the bill, one of the most complicated policy and political issues they must grapple with is Medicaid reform.  States that expanded Medicaid, such as Ohio and Michigan, have said a healthcare overhaul must protect those who gained coverage under Obamacare. Non-expansion states, meanwhile, have said they do not want to be penalized with less federal funding because they did not expand and therefore cover fewer people. The governors proposal recommends maintaining Obamacares Medicaid expansion and giving other states the opportunity to expand, but capping federal spending on certain populations through either block grants or per capita caps. It would provide states the option to phase in other groups, such as parents and children, to per capita caps or block grants, and it recommends reducing federal regulations on states and their Medicaid programs.

The explosive new development on Tuesday followed a week of tumult at the White House after Trump fired Comey and then discussed sensitive national security information about Islamic State with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. The Comey memo, first reported by the New York Times, caused alarm on Capitol Hill and raised questions about whether Trump tried to interfere with a federal investigation. The White House quickly denied the report, saying in a statement it was not a truthful or accurate portrayal of the conversation between the president and Mr. Comey. Comey wrote the memo after he met in the Oval Office with Trump, the day after the Republican president fired Flynn on Feb. 14 for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the extent of his conversations last year with Russias ambassador, Sergei Kislyak. I hope you can let this go, Trump told Comey, according to a source familiar with the contents of the memo.  The New York Times said that during the Oval Office meeting, Trump condemned a series of government leaks to the news media and said the FBI director should consider prosecuting reporters for publishing classified information. Coming the day after charges that Trump disclosed sensitive information to the Russians last week, the new disclosure further rattled members of Congress. The memo is powerful evidence of obstruction of justice and certainly merits immediate and prompt investigation by an independent special prosecutor, said Democratic U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal. Republican and Democratic lawmakers said they wanted to see the memo. Republican U.S. Representative Jason Chaffetz, chairman of a House of Representatives oversight committee, said his committee is going to get the Comey memo, if it exists. I need to see it sooner rather than later. I have my subpoena pen ready. In a letter to acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, Chaffetz set a deadline of May 24 for the FBI to produce all memoranda, notes, summaries, and recordings referring or relating to any communications between Comey and the President. Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan backed Chaffetz. We need to have all the facts, and it is appropriate for the House Oversight Committee to request this memo, said Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong. Legal experts took a dim view of Trumps comments, as quoted in the memo. For the president to tell the FBI to end a potential criminal investigation, thats obstruction of justice, said Erwin Chereminsky, a constitutional law professor and dean of University of California, Irvine School of Law. This is what caused President Nixon to resign from office. But the experts said intent was a critical element of an obstruction of justice charge, and the presidents words could be subject to interpretation and possibly put into the context of other actions, like Comeys termination. The fact that the president apparently said he hoped Comey would end the Flynn investigation rather than more directly ordering it makes for a weaker but still viable case, said Christopher Slobogin, a criminal law professor at Vanderbilt University Law School. Flynns resignation came hours after it was reported that the Justice Department had warned the White House weeks earlier that Flynn could be vulnerable to blackmail for contacts with Kislyak before Trump took office on Jan. 20. Kislyak was with Lavrov at the White House when Trump disclosed the sensitive information. A spokeswoman for the FBI declined to comment on the details of the memo. An emailed fundraising appeal by Trumps political organization and the Republican National Committee sent out after reports of the Comey memo said Trump was being victimized by an unelected bureaucracy. You already knew the media was out to get us, it said. But sadly its not just the fake news There are people within our own unelected bureaucracy that want to sabotage President Trump and our entire America First movement. The new development came as Republican and Democratic lawmakers pressured Trump to give a fuller explanation for why he revealed sensitive intelligence information to Lavrov. The information had been supplied by a U.S. ally in the fight against the Islamic State militant group, the officials said.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

President Donald Trump has defended his decision to discuss intelligence with the Russians during a White House meeting last week, saying he had an absolute right to share facts pertaining to terrorism and airline flight safety.  Decisions about what President Trump discusses with anybody that he has in the White House is a matter for President Trump, May told a news conference when asked whether Trumps disclosure had made her reluctant to share intelligence with him. We continue to work with the United States and continue to share intelligence with the United States as we do with others around the world because we are all working together to deal with the threats that we face. The question came during a press briefing ahead of Britains June 8 election, which polls show May is on course to win, and in which national security is seen as one of her political strengths. May is a former interior minister who spent six years in charge of the domestic security brief. May was the first foreign leader to meet with Trump following his inauguration, and has repeatedly reaffirmed the special relationship between the two countries: a military and economic alliance dating back to 19th century. Trump has endured a week of tumult at the White House after he fired the head of the FBI and then discussed sensitive national security information about Islamic State with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. But, May said she remained confident in the special relationship, highlighting the need to cooperate with the United States and other allies to counter the security threats posed by Islamic State and al-Qaeda.

Trump has confirmed via Twitter that during a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov at the White House last week he shared information related to a potential airline plot by Islamic State, thought to involve a laptop bomb. The New York Times, citing a current and a former U.S. official, reported on Tuesday that the information Trump divulged came from an Israeli intelligence asset based in Islamic State-held territory in Syria.  Israeli officials have declined to confirm whether they were the source of the information Trump shared, but have been quick to say counter-terrorism coordination with the United States is strong. On Tuesday, Trump called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss his visit to Israel next week, but the two did not discuss the intelligence leak during their 20-minute conversation, the prime ministers office said.  The security relationship between Israel & our greatest ally the United States is deep, significant &  unprecedented in volume, Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman said on Twitter, remarks that were echoed by the intelligence minister.  Ron Dermer, Israels ambassador to Washington, issued a similar statement, saying: Israel has full confidence in our intelligence-sharing relationship with the United States and looks forward to deepening that relationship in the years ahead under President Trump. Israeli intelligence experts said they could not confirm whether an Israeli asset was the source. But they said Israel had developed a deep network of human and signal intelligence across the region and it was plausible that it had managed to infiltrate Islamic State as part of that long-running effort. Israeli intelligence agencies have shown that they can have such human sources, said Aviv Oreg, former head of the Al Qaeda and global jihad desk in the armys military intelligence department, who now runs a counter-terrorism consultancy.  It would take a lot to put someone inside ISIS. If there is an agent, Im sure its the only one. If we have really lost a human source over there, its a major loss and it will take years to regenerate another one, he said. Israel will be furious about it, he added, highlighting that it was likely to have implications for how Israel operates its human intelligence assets more broadly, and may make others unwilling to cooperate with it in the future. At the same time, he said Israel understood that Trump, as president and commander-in-chief, had the authority to divulge the information, even if in doing so he had shown that he has no experience in how to deal with intelligence. Kobi Michael, a senior research fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies and the former deputy director of Israels ministry of strategic affairs, described Trumps leak as very concerning if there was a risk of having endangered an Israeli asset. While there were good reasons to assume the compromised source was an agent, he said it was also possible it was a well-placed piece of signal intelligence.  When it comes to ISIS, they are very active in the social network world and on digital platforms. So who knows, all options are valid, even if as far as I understand the context, it looks like a human intelligence source. Michael described Israel as having far better intelligence capabilities in the region than the United States, making it a critical partner for Washington. Yet both sides have an interest in continuing to cooperate fully on intelligence. What happened is a problem, it shouldnt have happened. But mistakes do get made, not only by the Americans, but sometimes by the Israelis too, said Michael.  I assume that Trump had other considerations in mind and was perhaps not aware of the consequences of what he was saying. But this should not change the level of cooperation, which needs to be constantly broadened and deepened. Amnon Sofrin, former head of Mossads intelligence directorate, said the issue was unlikely to be touched on when Trump visits Israel on his first foreign trip next week. Handling the fallout from the leak would be dealt with through intelligence channels  between Mossad and the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency  not diplomatic ones. Cooperation between our two organizations is so solid that I dont believe that a special event will cause any big damage, it may cause local damage, but not a disaster, he said. None of us in Israels intelligence community likes this event. But I think it can be put aside and allow (Trumps) visit to be very fulfilling and I hope very successful.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - Washington Governor Jay Inslee on Tuesday signed a bill that paves the way for the state to create what is believed to be the first system in the United States to certify marijuana as organic. The sponsor of the bill, Republican Senator Ann Rivers, said marijuana certified as organically grown is likely to be on sale in Washington in about a year and a half. Washington is among a handful of U.S. states where voters approved the sale of recreational marijuana. Washington was the second state to begin legal recreational pot sales, in mid-2014, after its voters in 2012 approved it. This is consumer-driven, Rivers told Reuters by phone on Tuesday night. As we have moved forward in the legal marijuana market, were hearing people say, We dont want any pesticides, fungicides, none of that stuff in our weed. The new law creates a voluntary program for the certification and regulation of organic marijuana products, to be administered by the Washington agriculture department, according to a state analysis of the new law. Rivers said the heavy lifting in certifying marijuana has been done by the system of doing the same for a multitude of food products on supermarkets shelves across America. That process just needs to be adapted for pot, she said. Rivers said that legal recreational marijuana is the gift that keeps on giving....this year, well make $768 million in revenue for the state of Washington. This pays for drug education and drug addiction treatment as well as public education, she said. Organic pot was just one of a myriad of marijuana-related measures in the bill. Many state legislators wanted to vote for only one marijuana-related bill rather than have to go on the record favoring marijuana several times, Rivers said. The November 2012 measure to allow recreational marijuana in Washington passed 56 percent to 44 percent. While it is legal for adults to smoke marijuana in Washington, it is not legal to grow industrial hemp. The new law allows for the study of a method to allow hemp to be grown and used for industrial purposes. Last week, Vermonts legislature approved a bill to legalize recreational use of marijuana. Unless the measure is vetoed, Vermont would be the first state to legalize pot without a public vote. Voters have approved legal recreational marijuana use in Colorado,Washington, Alaska, Oregon, California, Nevada, Maine, Massachusetts and the District of Columbia.

Guajardo said he would have more information after meeting with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in Vietnam on Thursday as part of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings. During the 2016 U.S. election campaign, Trump vowed to scrap the 1994 deal between the United States, Canada and Mexico if he cannot adjust it to benefit U.S. interests. Probably the notification will be sent to Congress by the U.S. executive at some time early next week, Guajardo told Mexican media on Tuesday a day after meetings in Washington with U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and other U.S. officials. In Washington, Ross declined to predict the exact timing of the notification, saying that there were more consultations with Congress needed first. In a meeting on Tuesday, U.S. senators said Ross and new U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer expressed their preference to keep the current trilateral format in the NAFTA talks.   Guajardo also said that a dispute over sugar with the United States could be resolved within two weeks, before a June 5 deadline to break the impasse.  The U.S. sugar industry pressed the U.S. Commerce Department late last year to withdraw from a 2014 agreement that sets prices and quotas for U.S. imports of Mexican sugar unless the deal could be renegotiated. The U.S. sugar lobby wants Mexico to export less refined sugar and has become emboldened since Trump took office. A U.S. Commerce Department spokesman said Ross and Guajardo  discussed possible solutions and that they continue to work toward a negotiated settlement.

Advisers to Judge Merrick Garland and U.S. Senator John Cornyn of Texas told Reuters they discouraged them from leading the Federal Bureau of Investigation, cautioning that they would be leaving important, secure jobs for one fraught with politics and controversy.  The advisers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the new FBI director would have little job security and heightened scrutiny by political observers following President Donald Trumps abrupt firing of James Comey on May 9.  Garland and Cornyn distancing themselves from the selection process just three days before Trump has said he may make a decision, points to the difficulties the White House has in filling the FBI post amid turmoil in the administration.     Trumps firing of Comey, the man in charge of an investigation into possible collusion between 2016 election campaign associates and the Russian government, outraged many lawmakers, including some Republicans. Garland, the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, loves his job and is not interested in leaving the judiciary, said one source familiar with the judges thinking. Cornyn said in a statement that he had informed the White House that the best way I can serve is continuing to fight for a conservative agenda in the U.S. Senate. White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters on Tuesday that an announcement on FBI director was still possible before  Trump leaves on his first foreign trip on Friday. He said the U.S. Department of Justice was still interviewing candidates. Several Republican senators had promoted Garland even though they had refused to give him a hearing when Republican Trumps predecessor President Barack Obama, a Democrat, nominated Garland last year for a then-vacant seat on the U.S. Supreme Court. The Republicans reasoning appeared to be that Garland would be accepted by Democrats and help restore faith in the FBI as a nonpartisan agency. In an interview on Bloomberg Television, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell referred to Garland, a former federal prosecutor, as an apolitical professional. A second Garland acquaintance who spoke on the condition of anonymity said Garland sought advice from those who told him he would be leaving his life-long position on the federal bench to take a job that could be terminated by Trump overnight. A Republican Senate aide said Cornyns staff also worried that the third-term Texas Senator could cut his- and their own- careers short by going to the FBI.  An adviser to another candidate on the White House short-list, former New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, 75, said Kelly is also being persuaded to step out of the running.  Kelly has not said that he would not consider the job, but so far he has not been interviewed. Republican Representative Trey Gowdy, a former federal prosecutor whose name had been floated, said on Monday he was not interested in the director position.  The difficulty in filling key administration jobs is not just limited to the FBI director post. Trumps habits of contradicting his top aides, demanding personal loyalty and punishing officials who contradict him in public has discouraged a number of experienced people from pursuing jobs, said three people who declined to discuss possible positions with administration officials. Its becoming increasingly difficult to attract good people to work in this administration, said one senior official.

Stuart Jones, acting assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, has extensive experience in the Middle East after serving as U.S. ambassador to Iraq and Jordan and as deputy chief of mission in Cairo. Jones, 57, told colleagues the decision was his own and that he had not been pushed out or asked to leave the department. This is his own decision ... Theres not been a falling out, said a U.S. official who spoke on condition that he not be identified. Theres no story here, except another senior government official with real competence is leaving. A State Department spokesman confirmed Jones planned retirement, saying he was leaving for personal reasons to pursue a new career. Jones case is different from those of two career foreign service officers - former undersecretaries of state Patrick Kennedy, the departments top management official, and Thomas Countryman, its top arms control officer - who had risen to politically appointed jobs and were asked to leave in January. The decision to accept their resignations was entirely within President Donald Trumps rights and there is usually turnover in such politically appointed jobs. But it constituted an abrupt departure for the two. Former State Department counselor Kristie Kenney also left in February, further shrinking the senior ranks of the agency. Jones was elevated to acting assistant secretary of state responsible for the Near East and had neither been offered the job on a permanent basis nor told that he would not get it, said the U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Booker, one of his partys liberal stars, says that rate shows the CRA is prone to abuse, and the law helps special interests sabotage thoroughly vetted rules they do not like.

The CRA bans agencies from issuing new versions of repealed rules in the future. Bookers bill would also lift that ban. Rhode Island Representative David Cicilline and Michigan Representative John Conyers, both Democrats, introduced a companion bill in the House on Tuesday.

She has introduced a bill to help states and cities provide retirement accounts to private-sector workers and has co-sponsored another on employers records of injuries and deaths.  If any of the Democrats bills survive the Senate, they would likely die in the House, where Republicans hold an ample majority. After sweeping Congress and the White House in Novembers elections, Republicans established a beachhead in their battle against regulation through the CRA.  They are now in the next phase: limiting new rule-makings. Later this week a Senate committee will put finishing touches on the Regulatory Accountability Act and send it to the full chamber. Supporters say the bill, already passed in the House, makes regulators more answerable to lawmakers and more responsible for analyzing rules costs. Critics say it establishes so many requirements that it will paralyze regulation in important areas such as education. Republicans are also considering keeping the CRA in play.  Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania has asked congressional auditors to determine if the law can be applied to agencies guidance that effectively resembles regulation. Others are weighing killing two forthcoming rules from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, headed by Democrat Richard Cordray, an Obama holdover.

Garland, the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, has told people around him he loves his job and is not interested in leaving the judiciary, said one of the sources familiar with the judges thinking. The two sources spoke on condition of anonymity. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he has mentioned Garland to Republican President Donald Trump as a possible successor James Comey, who Trump fired last week as FBI chief. In an interview on Bloomberg Television, McConnell referred to Garland, a former federal prosecutor, as an apolitical professional to head the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Under McConnells leadership, the Senate last year refused to consider centrist Garland for a lifetime job as a Supreme Court justice after Democratic President Barack Obama nominated him in March 2016. In doing so, McConnell was able to allow Trump, who took office in January, to nominate Neil Gorsuch to fill the seat, restoring the Supreme Courts conservative majority. Garland, 64, has been praised by both Democrats and Republicans in his two decades on the appeals court. His appointment there is a lifetime one, and if he took on a 10-year term at the FBI it would open up another top judicial seat for Trump to fill.  Trump fired Comey during an FBI investigation into possible collusion between Trumps 2016 presidential campaign and Russia. Comeys replacement would need to be someone with a deep background in law enforcement and no history of political involvement, McConnell said. Garland is an example of that, McConnell added. It would serve the country well and lead to, I think, a more bipartisan approach. Democrats have threatened to hold up a vote on a new FBI director until a special prosecutor is named to investigate the potential ties between Trumps campaign and Russia. At least 11 people have been under consideration for the  FBI top job. As a senior Justice Department official under Democratic President Bill Clinton in the 1990s, Garland oversaw the prosecution of Timothy McVeigh, the man who bombed the federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995, killing 168 people.

Some experts added, however, that the reports could undermine trust between partners.  If this really happened, its an unfortunate episode,  said Adam Thomson, a former British ambassador to NATO and now with the European Leadership Network think-tank in London.But theyll suck it up. Why? Because other countries need U.S. intelligence cooperation more than the other way round.  In a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak, Trump disclosed intelligence about a planned Islamic State operation, which was supplied by a U.S. ally, two officials with knowledge of the situation said. The name of the ally or intelligence-sharing operation was not disclosed. [nL2N1IH1O9] The White House declared the allegations, first reported by the Washington Post, incorrect and Trump said he had an absolute right to share facts to get Moscow to step up its fight against Islamic State. Interfax news agency quoted the Russian foreign ministry saying the reports were fake. [nR4N1I601L] Two of Washingtons allies in the intelligence sharing network known as Five Eyes - which groups the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand - played down the impact on their relationship with Washington. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told a radio station in Adelaide he would maintain my normal circumspection and discretion on classified matters, adding the alliance with the United States is the bedrock of our national security. Trump and Turnbull met last week aboard a decommissioned aircraft carrier in New York City after beginning their relations with a testy phone call in February. [nL1N1I701T] New Zealand Foreign Minister Gerry Brownlee noted the story had been denied. The media reports have been rejected by senior U.S. officials who were in the meeting, he said in an email via his spokeswoman. If there is ever to be a resolution of the dreadful situation in Syria, it will require concerted efforts from both the U.S. and Russia. A Japanese government official said it was simply not possible to stop cooperating with Washington on intelligence matters.If the report is true and Mr. Trump is an untrustworthy person, it doesnt necessarily mean that we dont share information with the U.S. anymore, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. While the president has the authority to disclose even the most highly classified information at will, in this case he did so without consulting the ally that provided it, which threatens to jeopardize a long-standing intelligence-sharing agreement, the two U.S. officials said. National security analysts said relations could be damaged. Effectively, Trumps actions have thrown the worlds most important intel sharing relationship into doubt at best, serious jeopardy at worst, Stephanie Carvin, a former national security analyst for the Canadian government, said on Twitter, referring to the Five Eyes arrangement. James Curran, professor of foreign policy at the University of Sydney, said the intelligence relationships were too important and productive to be damaged by Trumps alleged disclosures to the Russians. No real practical impact, but I do think it will raise more eyebrows about this presidents style and his cavalier attitude to this type of thing, said Curran. Over the long term, however, such behavior can potentially have very serious consequences for Americas intelligence relationships across the world, Curran said. Rhys Ball, who formerly worked for New Zealands intelligence service and is now a Massey University security and defense analyst, said he thought it would be business as usual for the Five Eyes community. Clearly someone has gulped at what was discussed or exchanged. But this might be the new norm when it comes to the United states and its attitude and foreign policy approach to the likes of the Russians, Ball said. Even before Trumps meeting with the Russians, Washingtons intelligence partners abroad have noted a barrage of reports around Trump, the Russians and spies. They include the investigations into his election campaigns ties to Moscow, probes into Russian interference in the election, the presidents own expressions of disdain for the U.S. intelligence community and his claim that former President Barack Obama spied on him, citing a media report. First the firing of the FBI chief and now this, said one NATO diplomat referring to Trumps decision to dismiss FBI Director James Comey. How do we know the U.S. defense secretary wont be fired next week or that intelligence finds its way into the wrong hands?  But Ball said intelligence co-operation was too important to be constrained. Five Eyes is far too significant for anyone to wash their hands of it and Five Eyes has weathered a few storms over the years, Ball said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Ramin Forouzandeh had applied to 13 PhD economics programs in the United States, but after President Donald Trump signed his first travel ban in January, the 25-year-old Iranian turned to Canada for other options.  He said he had focused on U.S. schools because they hosted most of the worlds top 20 economics programs. Before the travel ban, I never really considered other alternatives.  By late March, U.S. courts had halted two versions of Trumps travel ban, yet Forouzandeh signed for University of Torontos Rotman School of Management and turned down the University of Minnesotas prestigious PhD program. His countryman, Mahdi Ebrahimi Kahou, 30, was well into his first year of the Minnesota program when he decided to transfer to the University of British Columbia because of Trumps executive orders that banned travel from seven and later six Muslim-majority countries, including Iran. I lost my motivation to work completely, he said.  A Reuters survey of 19 Canadian universities showed a spike in international applications, most notably from Iran and India. Five top Canadian economics and business PhD programs are getting at least half of their new Iranian students this fall because of the ban, based on interviews with universities and students. Most of those, like Forouzandeh and Ebrahimi Kahou, are opting out of U.S. programs in a field where the United States both dominates and relies on foreign talent. While those programs represent only one field and a fraction of the U.S. student population, they offer early evidence of the direct impact of Trump administration policies. Academics fear they may also be a sign of things to come if the chilling effect of Trumps America First agenda spreads beyond any specific field of study or nationality. This strikes at the heart of what has made U.S. higher education the envy of the world, said Mary Sue Coleman, chair of the Association of American Universities.    Its this notion that the U.S. is no longer a welcoming place for the best and the brightest.   Iranians are by far the biggest group among students directly affected by the bans and form a small but notable part of the talent pool in areas such as engineering and economics, where U.S. academic institutions excel. Iranians ranked sixth last year among international students enrolled in U.S. graduate programs, according to the Institute of International Education.  A survey conducted jointly by five U.S. higher education associations in February showed 38 percent of U.S. colleges reporting a drop in foreign applications, with those from the Middle East down the most, while 27 percent saw no change - a significant cool-down after nearly a decade of steady growth. In 2015, at least 35 percent of graduate students at U.S. universities granting graduate degrees in science, engineering and health were foreigners, according to the National Science Foundation.  (For a graphic on U.S. universities, global brains, click tmsnrt.rs/2qLARio ) This year, about 60 percent of graduating PhDs from the top 10 U.S. economics departments come from other countries, a Reuters analysis shows. Youve got an issued order thats been temporarily blocked that applies to six countries. But the destabilization of the whole situation for international students and faculty could not be overstated, said Rice University President David Leebron. He said that for foreign students everything from getting a visa on time to employment opportunities had been thrown into question. According to Rices dean of graduate and postdoctoral studies, this years PhD programs will have slightly fewer Chinese, Indian and Middle Eastern students than expected. More Iranian students declined offers of admission than usual, with several saying that they decided to study in another country because of concerns about getting a U.S. visa.  There is no evidence of a mass exodus of foreigners - indeed, Rice will have more students than expected from Europe and Latin America, offsetting declines elsewhere - but academics cite dozens of examples where Trumps policies had an impact. At Arizona State University, for example, Iranians would typically make up a fourth of the economics PhD program, but there will be none in the incoming class this fall. Of those already enrolled, two are moving to Canada. One student who visited his family in Iran over the Christmas break still has not been able to return, leaving the university scrambling to cover the classes he was supposed to teach.   The effects of this are big, said Gustavo Ventura, ASUs economics department chair. These people, not just the ones that come to us - anyone who comes to a PhD program abroad - are the cream of their student population. The University of Illinois now has 10 Iranians in its PhD program, and while its not certain why, none of the Iranians whom it offered admission are among the 22 students from 11 countries entering in the fall.  At Indiana Universitys economics program, three Iranians withdrew their applications almost immediately after the travel ban, said Todd Walker, director of the departments graduate studies. We also had many more international applicants turn us down this year relative to the last three years, he said. I cannot say definitively how much of this is attributable to the travel ban, but I suspect it played a role. In British Columbia, the Simon Fraser University has admitted 20 percent more international students for the fall term, according to Associate Dean Jeff Derksen. He said queries he had received and an online survey suggested more graduate students were considering alternatives to U.S. programs. This indicates that the international map of academic knowledge production has changed. The prestige of the U.S. programs remains a big draw, but those committed to a U.S. career are more aware of risks.  For example, SoheilGhili, who is getting a PhD in economics from Northwestern Universitys Kellogg School of Management this month and will start as a post-doctoral fellow at Yale this summer, is hedging his bets. Let me put it this way: I will be more careful to not miss networking opportunities with people from Toronto and London.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The intelligence, shared at a meeting last week with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak, was supplied by a U.S. ally in the fight against the militant group, both officials with knowledge of the situation said. The White House declared the allegations, first reported by the Washington Post, incorrect. The story that came out tonight as reported is false, H.R. McMaster, Trumps national security adviser, told reporters at the White House, adding that the leaders reviewed a range of common threats including to civil aviation. At no time were intelligence sources or methods discussed. The president did not disclose any military operations that were not already publicly known...I was in the room. It didnt happen, he said. Russias foreign ministry said reports that Trump had revealed highly classified information were fake, according to the Interfax news agency. The White House also released a statement from Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who said the Oval Office meeting focused on counterterrorism, and from Deputy National Security Adviser Dina Powell, who called the Washington Post story false. Still, the news triggered concern in Congress.  The Senates No. 2 Democrat, Dick Durbin, called Trumps conduct dangerous and reckless.  Bob Corker, the Republican head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called the allegations very, very troubling if true.  Obviously, theyre in a downward spiral right now and theyve got to come to grips with all thats happening, he said of the White House.     The latest controversy came as Trumps administration reels  from the fallout over his abrupt dismissal of former FBI Director James Comey and amid congressional calls for an independent investigation into allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. One of the officials said the intelligence discussed by Trump in his meeting with Lavrov was classified Top Secret and held in a secure compartment to which only a handful of intelligence officials have access. After Trumps disclosure of the information, which one of the officials described as spontaneous, officials immediately called the CIA and the National Security Agency, both of which have agreements with a number of allied intelligence services around the world, and informed them what had happened. While the president has the authority to disclose even the most highly classified information at will, in this case he did so without consulting the ally that provided it, which threatens to jeopardize a long-standing intelligence-sharing agreement, the U.S. officials said. Since taking office in January, Trump has careened from controversy to controversy, complaining on the first day about news coverage of his inauguration crowds; charging his predecessor, former President Barack Obama, with wiretapping; and just last week firing the FBI director who was overseeing an investigation into potential ties between Trumps presidential campaign and the Russian government. Trump, a Republican who has called allegations of links between his campaign team and Russia a total scam, sharply criticized his 2016 election rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton, for her handling of classified information as secretary of state, when she used a private email server.  The FBI concluded that no criminal charges against Clinton were warranted, but Comey said she and her colleagues had been careless with classified information.     In his conversations with the Russian officials, Trump appeared to be boasting about his knowledge of the looming threats, telling them he was briefed on great intel every day, an official with knowledge of the exchange said, according to the Post. Some U.S. officials have told Reuters they have been concerned about disclosing highly classified intelligence to Trump. One official, who requested anonymity to discuss dealing with the president, said last month: He has no filter; its in one ear and out the mouth. One of the officials with knowledge of Trumps meeting with the Russian called the timing of the disclosure particularly unfortunate, as the President prepares for a White House meeting on Tuesday with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, an ally in the fight against Islamic State. Trumps first foreign trip also begins later this week and includes a stop in Saudi Arabia, another Islamic State foe, and a May 25 NATO meeting in Brussels attended by other important U.S. allies. He also has stops planned in Israel and the Vatican. The presidents trip and latest uproar over his meeting with Russian officials come amid rumors that he might shake-up his  senior staff in a bid to refocus his administration.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""SEATTLE (Reuters) - U.S. appeals court judges on Monday questioned the lawyer defending President Donald Trumps temporary travel ban about whether it discriminates against Muslims and pressed challengers to explain why the court should not defer to Trumps presidential powers to set the policy. The three-judge 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel was the second court in a week to review Trumps directive banning people entering the United States from six Muslim-majority countries. Opponents - including the state of Hawaii and civil rights groups - say that both Trumps first ban and later revised ban discriminate against Muslims. The government argues that the text of the order does not mention any specific religion and is needed to protect the country against attacks. In addressing the Justice Department at the hearing in Seattle, 9th Circuit Judge Richard Paez pointed out that many of Trumps statements about Muslims came during the midst of a highly contentious (election) campaign. He asked if that should be taken into account when deciding how much weight they should be given in reviewing the travel bans constitutionality. Neal Katyal, an attorney for Hawaii which is opposing the ban, said the evidence goes beyond Trumps campaign statements. The government has not engaged in mass, dragnet exclusions in the past 50 years, Katyal said. This is something new and unusual in which youre saying this whole class of people, some of whom are dangerous, we can ban them all. The Justice Department argues Trump issued his order solely to protect national security. Outside the Seattle courtroom a group of protesters gathered carrying signs with slogans including, The ban is still racist and No ban, no wall.  Paez asked if an executive order detaining Japanese-Americans during the World War Two would pass muster under the governments current logic.  Acting U.S. Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall, arguing on behalf of the Trump administration, said that the order from the 1940s, which is now viewed as a low point in U.S. civil rights history, would not be constitutional.  If Trumps executive order was the same as the one involving Japanese-Americans, Wall said: I wouldnt be standing here, and the U.S. would not be defending it. Judge Michael Daly Hawkins asked challengers to Trumps ban about the wide latitude held by U.S. presidents to decide who can enter the country. Why shouldnt we be deferential to what the president says? Hawkins said. That is the million dollar question, said Katyal. A reasonable person would see Trumps statements as evidence of discriminatory intent, Katyal said.   In Washington, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said at a news briefing that the executive order is fully lawful and will be upheld. We believe that.   The panel, made up entirely of judges appointed by Democratic former President Bill Clinton, reviewed a Hawaii judges ruling that blocked parts of the Republican presidents revised travel order.  The March order was Trumps second effort to craft travel restrictions. The first, issued on Jan. 27, led to chaos and protests at airports before it was blocked by courts. The second order was intended to overcome the legal problems posed by the original ban, but it was also suspended by judges before it could take effect on March 16.  U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Hawaii blocked 90-day entry restrictions on people from Libya, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, as well as part of the order that suspended entry of refugee applicants for 120 days. As part of that ruling, Watson cited Trumps campaign statements on Muslims as evidence that his executive order was discriminatory. The 9th Circuit previously blocked Trumps first executive order.  Last week the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Virginia reviewed a Maryland judges ruling that blocked the 90-day entry restrictions. That court is largely made up of Democrats, and the judges questioning appeared to break along partisan lines. A ruling has not yet been released. Trumps attempt to limit travel was one of his first major acts in office. The fate of the ban is one indication of whether the Republican can carry out his promises to be tough on immigration and national security. The U.S. Supreme Court is likely to be the ultimate decider, but the high court is not expected to take up the issue for several months. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The May 10-14 poll, which was conducted after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, suggests the public is increasingly uneasy with allegations of meddling by the Russians in the U.S. election. Trumps dismissal of Comey, who was leading the Federal Bureau of Investigations probe into ties between the White House and Russia, intensified calls by Democrats for an independent probe.  According to the poll, 59 percent of adults, including 41 percent of Republicans and 79 percent of Democrats, agreed that Congress should launch an independent investigation into communications between the Russian government and the Trump campaign during the 2016 election.  That compares with 54 percent of all adults, including 30 percent of Republicans and 81 percent of Democrats, who felt that way when the poll last asked the question in February.  I really dont know what to believe anymore, said John Kremer, 74, a Trump supporter from Birmingham, Alabama, who wants an independent investigation. Kremer does not think Trump had any illegal contact with the Russians, but he does not like the way the president is handling he issue.  If Comey hadnt been fired, I would have been comfortable with the results of their investigation, Kremer said. My concern now is whether he (Trump) is trying to minimize the investigation.  The Reuters/Ipsos poll also found that public confidence in the executive branch and in Congress has eroded since the Nov. 8 election. Thirty-six percent of Americans said they had hardly any confidence at all in the executive branch and 43 percent said they felt that way about Congress. That is up from 30 percent and 37 percent, respectively, who answered that way in a November poll.  When asked who should replace Comey, 48 percent wanted an FBI outsider with credible experience in law or law enforcement. Thirty-seven percent said they wanted someone from within the FBI while 5 percent wanted an FBI outsider who is close to the Trump administration.  The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. It included responses from 1,541 adults, including 515 Republicans and 686 Democrats. The poll has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points for the entire group, 5 percentage points for Republicans and 4 percentage points for Democrats.

Lighthizer, a veteran trade lawyer and deputy USTR during the Reagan administration, was sworn into office by Vice President Mike Pence, capping months of delays and filling the last open seat in President Donald Trumps cabinet. Lighthizer will be one of three key leaders on trade policy, working alongside Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and White House trade and industrial policy adviser Peter Navarro. All three have vowed to help shrink chronic U.S. trade deficits through stronger enforcement of U.S. trade laws and to negotiate deals that boost U.S. exports without leading to jobs and factories migrating overseas.   When my grandchildren, who are here today, talk to their grandchildren, they will say that President Trump permanently reversed the dangerous trajectory of American trade, put America first and made our farmers, ranchers and workers richer and the country safer, Lighthizer said. I hope I can make some small contribution to that accomplishment. Lighthizer, 69, will be the principal U.S. negotiator in talks expected to start later this year to revamp the 23-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. On Tuesday, he will start two days of meetings with members of key trade-related panels in Congress, a spokeswoman for the Senate Finance Committee said. The meetings are required before USTR can formally launch the formal renegotiating process with a 90-day consultation period. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer also said Lighthizer will attend the May 20-21 meeting of trade ministers from the 21 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) countries in Hanoi, Vietnam. At that meeting, Lighthizer will face many counterparts who were signatories to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the 12-country free trade agreement from which Trump withdrew in January. Some countries, including Japan, have been exploring options to revive TPP without the United States. China, the largest U.S. trading partner, also is a member of APEC, allowing Lighthizer an opportunity to meet his Chinese counterparts as the Trump administration seeks to build on agreements to shrink the U.S. trade deficit with China. Last week, Commerces Ross said the United States and China had agreed to take action by mid-July to increase access to Chinese markets for U.S. beef, financial services and liquefied natural gas.

The new policy means that $8.8 billion in U.S. assistance to an array of programs fighting HIV/AIDS, malaria and maternal and child health will be subject to the so-called Mexico City policy. The policy, introduced in 1984, holds that no U.S. government funding for family planning services can be given to foreign clinics or groups that offer abortion services or discuss abortion, even if the funds for those activities come from non-U.S. government sources. The policy previously applied to a much narrower stream of about $600 million in U.S. government funds. Since it was unveiled, the Mexico City rule has been routinely rescinded under Democratic administrations and reinstated under Republican ones, and is used by presidents to signal where they stand on abortion rights. Critics of the policy call it the global gag rule, and say it hurts vulnerable women worldwide who depend on aid groups for their healthcare. Even when the Mexico City policy is not in place, federal law prevents the use of U.S. funding for abortions abroad.  President Donald Trump, a Republican, reinstated the policy in January, just days after taking office, but he went further and directed government agencies to figure out a plan to apply the policy to global health assistance furnished by all departments or agencies. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has approved a plan to expand the policys provisions to funding for HIV/AIDS, maternal and child health, malaria and other health programs, the State Department said on Monday. That includes about $6 billion in funding for the Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, the worlds largest provider of AIDS-fighting medicine. PEPFAR, launched in 2003 during Republican President George W. Bushs administration, has been credited with saving millions of lives and enjoys bipartisan support.  Other programs affected by the expanded policy, called Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance, include the Presidents Malaria Initiative, which received about $621 million in funding in 2016, according to its website. The State Department said in a statement: Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance does not reduce the amount of global health assistance the U.S. Government makes available, and funding previously obligated will not be affected as a result of this policy. U.S. officials said the malaria and HIV/AIDS programs would be resilient even if the United States had to deny funding to existing healthcare providers. We have a diversity of partners who are providing services and that would be available to continue those services, a senior administration official told reporters on condition of anonymity. The new policy applies to funds provided to foreign non-governmental organizations, but not to aid provided to governments or multilateral organizations, the State Department said. The expanded policy also does not apply to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief or to U.N. funds and programs. Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the expanded policy would have severe consequences for millions of vulnerable women and children. Anti-abortion groups praised the decision, saying it merely represented a realignment of funding.     ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

(Reuters) - On an overcast spring morning, about 40 Mexican men turned out in the pre-dawn hours to board a bus for Californias Salinas Valley where they would harvest 16 acres (6.47 hectares) of lettuce over the next three days.  Hector Manuel Morales, 20, came north from Mexico to work the fields with his three cousins. He said his family worried about his journey, spooked by President Donald Trumps talk of a crackdown on illegal immigrants. But he does not anticipate problems.  While about half of U.S. crop workers are in the country illegally, Morales and the other men have H-2A visas, which allow them to work temporarily as seasonal agricultural laborers on American farms.  We are not violating any law here in the U.S., he said. We come to work.  His co-worker Rafael Gonzalez Arredondo, 23, said listening to Trumps statements about Mexico was difficult, but we are going to show him that Mexicans are hard working people, that we are not what he says. The men came to the country through a labor brokerage company, Fresh Harvest, which brings in H-2A laborers to work on farms in need of temporary workers. This year, the companys owner, Steve Scaroni, says he expects to bring in about 4,000 workers.  Companies like Fresh Harvest are attractive for farmers who want to employ legal workers but do not want to deal with the considerable government red tape and regulations associated with the H-2A program. Employers who bring in workers on the visas must provide them with free transportation to and from the United States as well as housing and food once they arrive. Wage minimums are set by the government and are often higher than farmers are used to paying.  Still, Scaroni says he could find work for even more people if he had enough housing. While use of the H-2A program has steadily increased over the past decade, it still accounts for only about 10 percent of the estimated 1.3 million farmworkers in the United States, according to government data. In 2016, the government granted 134,000 H-2A visas. Alfredo Lopez Granados, 27, from Michoacan, Mexico has come north to work on an H-2A visa five times. He misses his family back home, he says, but the decision is not difficult.  Once you are here, he said, in one day you make more than you make in a week in Mexico.

In a highly unusual move, Trump last week appeared to suggest on Twitter that he might have tapes of conversations with Comey and warned the former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation against talking to the media. Trump and a White House spokesman declined to confirm or deny whether such tapes exist. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said the White House must clear the air about whether there are any taped conversations. You cant be cute about tapes. If there are any tapes of this conversation, they need to be turned over, Graham told NBCs Meet the Press program.  Trump sparked a political firestorm when he abruptly fired  Comey last week. The FBI has been investigating alleged Russian meddling in the U.S. election and possible ties between Moscow and the Trump campaign. Democrats have accused Trump of attempting to thwart the FBIs probe and have called for some type of independent inquiry into the matter.  Trump has said he removed Comey because he was not doing a good job and that Comey had lost the support of FBI employees. Trump tweeted on Friday that James Comey better hope that there are no tapes of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press! If there are recordings, Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah told the Fox News Sunday program it was inevitable that they would be subpoenaed and the White House would have to release them. Lee, who was on Trumps list of potential replacements for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, also said recording conversations in the White House is not necessarily the best idea.   Trumps threat about tapes has intensified calls from Democrats for an independent probe of alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.     Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Trump must immediately provide Congress with any tapes and warned that destroying existing tapes would violate the law. Schumer also said Senate Democrats are weighing whether to refuse to vote on a new FBI director until a special prosecutor is named to investigate Trumps potential ties to Russia. Russia has denied the claims and the White House says there was no collusion. To have that special prosecutor, people would breathe a sigh of relief because then there would be a real independent person overlooking the FBI director, Schumer told CNNs State of the Union program. Trump, who has sought better relations with Russia, has continued to question whether it was behind the hacking of email accounts belonging to Democrats involved in Hillary Clintons 2016 presidential campaign. But Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told NBCs Meet the Press program there is no question that the Russians were playing around in our electoral processes. He defended Trumps decision to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in the Oval Office last week. Its in the interest of the American people, its in the interest of Russia and the rest of the world that we do something to see if we cannot improve the relationship between the two greatest nuclear powers in the world, Tillerson said.     The Justice Department began interviewing candidates for the FBI director job on Saturday. Some people under consideration include acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, Republican Senator John Cornyn of Texas, New York Appeals Court Judge Michael Garcia and former Assistant Attorney General Alice Fisher, according to a White House official. Meanwhile, a NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released on Sunday found that 29 percent of Americans approve of Trumps decision to fire Comey, while 38 percent disapprove. If a Senate vote on a new FBI director breaks down along party lines, Democrats would not have the votes to block a nominee because Republicans hold a majority in the chamber. The key is getting some of our Republican colleagues to join us, Schumer said. Republican leaders in the Senate have rebuffed calls for a special prosecutor, saying it would interfere with ongoing congressional probes. Graham said there may come a time when a special prosecutor is needed but not now. Right now, it is a counterintelligence investigation, not a criminal investigation.

At a roundtable on farm labor at the White House last month, Trump said he did not want to create labor problems for farmers and would look into improving a program that brings in temporary agricultural workers on legal visas.           He assured us we would have plenty of access to workers, said Zippy Duvall, president of the American Farm Bureau Federation, one of 14 participants at the April 25 meeting with Trump and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue. During the roundtable conversation about agriculture, farmers and representatives of the sector brought up labor and immigration, the details of which have not been previously reported. Some farmers told Trump they often cannot find Americans willing to do the difficult farm jobs, according to interviews with nine of the 14 participants. They said they were worried about stricter immigration enforcement and described frustrations with the H-2A visa program, the one legal way to bring in temporary seasonal agricultural workers. The White House declined to comment on the specifics of the discussion, but described the meeting as very productive. The U.S. Department of Agriculture did not respond to a request for comment on the April meeting.  About half of U.S. crop workers are in the country illegally and more than two-thirds are foreign born, according to the most recent figures from the U.S. Department of Labors National Agriculture Workers Survey.  During the roundtable, Luke Brubaker, a dairy farmer from Pennsylvania, described how immigration agents had recently picked up half a dozen chicken catchers working for a poultry transportation company in his county.  The employer tried to replace them with local hires, but within three hours all but one had quit, Brubaker told the gathering at the White House.  Trump said he wanted to help and asked Secretary Perdue to look into the issues and come back with recommendations, according to the accounts. While other issues such as trade, infrastructure and technology were also discussed,  participants were more positive after the meeting about the conversation on foreign labor than about anything else we talked about,said Bill Northey, a farmer and Iowas secretary of agriculture. Tom Demaline, president of Willoway Nurseries in Ohio, said he told the president about his struggles with the H-2A guestworker program, which he has used for 18 years. He told Trump the program works in concept, but not in practice. I brought up the bureaucracy and red tape, he said. If the guys show up a week or two late, it puts crops in jeopardy. You are on pins and needles all year to make sure you get the workers and do everything right. While use of the program has steadily increased over the past decade, it still accounts for only about 10 percent of the estimated 1.3 million farmworkers in the country, according to government data. In 2016, the government granted 134,000 H-2A visas Employers who import workers with H-2A visas must provide free transportation to and from the United States as well as housing and food for workers once they arrive. Wage minimums are set by the government and are often higher than farmers are used to paying.

For a related photo essay click on:  reut.rs/2qdtfnb Trump recently signed another executive order titled Buy American, Hire American, calling for changes to a program granting temporary visas for the tech industry, but not to visas used by farmers and other seasonal businesses, including Trumps own resorts. Trump also signed two executive orders, just days after taking office, focused on border security that called for arresting more people in the United States illegally and speeding up deportations. Roundtable participants said that many farmers have worried about the effect of the stepped up enforcement on their workforce, but Trump told them his administration was focused on deporting criminals, not farmworkers. He has a much better understanding about this than some of the rhetoric we have seen, said meeting attendee Steve Troxler, North Carolinas agriculture commissioner and a farmer himself. The farmers at the meeting said they stressed to the president the need for both short-term and permanent workers. They said there should be a program to help long-time farmworkers without criminal records, but who are in the country illegally, to become legal residents.  Last Tuesday, Democrats in the House and Senate said they would introduce a bill to give farmworkers who have worked illegally in the country for two consecutive years a blue card to protect them from deportation.  Brubaker, the Pennsylvania farmer, said he liked what he had heard about the bill and hoped it would get the presidents support to make it a bipartisan effort.

Trump told reporters he might even be able to make his decision on who should succeed James Comey to lead the Federal Bureau of Investigation before he leaves on his first foreign trip on Friday. Even that is possible, Trump said, speaking on Air Force One before departing for Lynchburg, Virginia, where he delivered a commencement address. I think the process is going to go quickly, he said, adding that the candidates under consideration were mostly well known. Theyve been vetted over their lifetime essentially. But very well known, highly respected, really talented people. And thats what we want for the FBI. Critics have assailed Trump for abruptly dismissing Comey, who was leading the agencys investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, and possible ties between Moscow and the Trump campaign.. Russia denies the claims and the White House says there was no collusion. Trump made the remarks to reporters prior to speaking to about 50,000 people at Liberty University in Lynchburg, where he did not mention Comey or the controversy his dismissal on Tuesday caused. It was Trumps first public event outside the White House since Comeys ouster. A White House official had said 11 people were under consideration - including acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, Republican Senator John Cornyn, New York Appeals Court Judge Michael Garcia and former Assistant Attorney General Alice Fisher - to replace Comey as FBI chief. Two new names, however, emerged on Saturday: FBI special agent Adam Lee and U.S. District Judge Henry Hudson. A source familiar with the process said Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, had interviewed Hudson, Lee and five others on Saturday. The FBI Agents Association, which claims more than 13,000 active and retired agents as its members, on Saturday endorsed another candidate: former Representative Mike Rogers, who had also worked as an FBI agent. At Liberty, the nations largest Christian college, Trump peppered his remarks with the kind of anti-establishment rhetoric that fueled his maverick presidential campaign, telling graduates to challenge entrenched interests. He thanked the crowd for their support and repeatedly invoked his own unlikely election victory.  Relish the opportunity to be an outsider, Trump said. The more that a broken system tells you that youre wrong, the more certain you should be that you must keep pushing ahead. He also had strong words that seemed aimed at his critics. No one has ever achieved anything significant without a chorus of critics standing on the sidelines explaining why it cant be done, Trump said. Nothing is easier or more pathetic than being a critic, because theyre people that cant get the job done.  Libertys president, Jerry Falwell, Jr., was a key early supporter of Trump during his campaign and helped rally support among religious conservatives.

Previewing Trumps first foreign trip, McMaster also said he would use a visit to Saudi Arabia, his first stop, to encourage Arab and Muslim partners to take bold new steps to confront those from Iran, Islamic State, al Qaeda and Syrian President Bashar al-Assads government who perpetuate chaos and violence. Trumps travels, which begin late next week and will also  include stops in Israel and Rome, are intended to broadcast a message of unity by visiting holy sites of Christianity, Judaism and Islam, McMaster told reporters. Trumps meetings with Israeli and Palestinian leaders, currently due to be held separately, will be closely watched for whether he begins to articulate a cohesive strategy to revive long-stalled negotiations. Most experts are skeptical of Trumps chances of brokering a peace accord that eluded his predecessors. Trump plans, in talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to reaffirm Americas unshakeable bond to the Jewish state and in a meeting with Abbas to express his desire for dignity and self-determination for the Palestinians, said McMaster, a decorated Army general with extensive Middle East experience. Trump is expected to meet Abbas, the Western-backed head of the Palestinian Authority, in Bethlehem in the West Bank, Palestinian sources say. Palestinians were disappointed when Trump failed to mention a two-state solution in a joint appearance with Abbas on May 3. Trump sparked international criticism in February when, during a news conference with Netanyahu, he appeared to back away from a longstanding U.S. commitment to Palestinian statehood, saying he would leave it up to the parties to decide. An independent state is not only the aspiration of the vast majority of Palestinians but has been the objective of successive U.S. administrations and the international community. Asked whether Trump would bring Netanyahu and Abbas together in the same room during the visit scheduled for May 22-23, McMaster said that would be up to the president and the other leaders. The final plans arent set yet, he said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

U.S. Homeland Security Department Secretary John Kelly told European ministers by phone Friday the department does not plan to immediately unveil any new measures, the EU said. U.S. Homeland Security spokesman David Lapan said no final decision had been made on whether to expand the restrictions, and he declined to immediately confirm Kellys trip to Brussels. The U.S. and the EU are on the same side when it comes to fighting terrorism and protecting our security, Dimitris Avramopoulos, EU commissioner for migration, home affairs and citizenship, said in a statement.  Our phone call today proved once again the strong cooperation we have on these matters. I look forward to welcoming Mr Kelly and his experts in Brussels next week to continue our positive talks. Fears that a bomb could be concealed in electronic devices prompted the United States to announce in March that it would restrict passengers from bringing laptops onto flights originating from 10 airports, including those in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey. Britain followed suit with restrictions on a slightly different set of routes.         Airlines and several countries affected by the electronics ban have pushed for more consultation with American and British regulators after the abrupt introduction of the restrictions took the industry by surprise. U.S. and European carriers are concerned about the logistics of checking large numbers of devices. Some airline officials say they would need to hire more staff to impose additional curbs and are worried about how much advance notice they would have. On Wednesday, Reuters reported that the Trump administration is likely to include some European countries in the in-cabin electronics ban.  Some U.S. and European airlines have been planning for a wider ban, industry officials have told Reuters. European regulators have warned that placing hundreds of devices in the hold on long-haul flights could also compromise safety by increasing the risk of fire from poorly deactivated lithium-ion batteries. The EU said in a document approved Thursday and reviewed by Reuters that it did not have information that would require the adoption of additional security measures, such as the restrictions being considered by the U.S authorities. The EU document added that placing laptops in luggage holds presents an increased safety risk to the aircraft, due to the lithium batteries contained in such devices. Kelly briefed members of Congress on Thursday and held a meeting with high-level executives of Delta Air Lines (DAL.N), United Airlines (UAL.N), American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O) and Airlines For America, a trade group. A congressional official said Homeland Security was likely to expand the ban soon but did not say when or to what airports. The airlines declined to comment, but an airline official said government officials suggested an expansion of the ban was expected soon but it wasnt certain when.  The trade group said in a statement it appreciated the meeting to discuss the current state of aviation security. The group voted to work with government officials to minimize the impact on the traveling public by utilizing the risk-based solutions that are the core of our foundation as the safest aviation system in the world. In 2016, 30 million people flew to the United States from Europe, according to U.S. Transportation Department data. According to airports association ACI Europe, summer schedules for 2017 at airports in 28 European Union countries show there are 3,257 flights per week to the United States. Kelly said last month the ban was likely to expand, given the sophisticated threats in aviation and intelligence findings that would-be attackers were trying to hide explosives in electronic devices. The predicament is reminiscent of the aviation industrys response to the 2014 downing of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17.  At the time, airlines called for greater sharing of information about potential threats to commercial aircraft from conflict zones, even as intelligence agencies expressed reluctance over the risk of revealing sources.

The letter, dated March 8, said the tax returns did not reflect any Trump income from Russian sources, aside from money earned during the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow and the 2008 sale of a Florida estate to a Russian billionaire.  Trumps businesses also may have earned immaterial amounts of money from Russians over the years through ordinary sales transactions, including condominium rentals or sales, hotel rooms, rounds of golf, or sales of Trump-licensed products, Sheri Dillon and William Nelson, attorneys at Morgan Lewis and Bockius, said in the letter. The tax returns also did not reflect any payments by Trump or his businesses to Russian lenders, any Trump investments in Russian firms or any investment by Russians in Trumps companies, the letter said. Morgan Lewis, a global law firm with 30 offices in cities around the world including New York and Moscow, was named Russia Law Firm of the Year in 2016 by London-based Chambers and Partners, a firm that ranks lawyers and law firms. The release of the letter by Trumps long-time attorneys came as the president sought to calm the furor caused by his firing this week of FBI Director James Comey, who was leading an investigation into possible collusion between the Trump presidential campaign and Russia to influence the U.S. election. Comeys firing on Tuesday and the White Houses shifting explanations about the rationale for the move have raised concerns among Democrats and others that the White House was trying to blunt the FBI probe. Trump and the White House have denied any such motive, but Trump told NBC on Thursday that the Russia probe was on his mind when he made the decision to fire the FBI director.     Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said on Tuesday he wanted to know more about Trumps business dealings with Russia and intended to examine whether any connections existed between Russia and the Trump campaign or the presidents associates. The White House welcomed the fact-finding effort by Graham and a subcommittee he chairs. He has no business in Russia; he has no connections to Russia, White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters, adding that the president had directed his law firm to send Graham a certified letter stating as much.

According to marketing materials from one of the organizers of the roadshow, sales events for the project are scheduled in the southern cities of Shenzhen on Saturday and Guangzhou on Sunday. No one from Kushner Companies will be in China this weekend, James Yolles, spokesman for the firm, said. The company and KABR Group are raising money for a two-tower apartment complex in New Jersey called One Journal Square, marketing materials showed. Kushner Companies earlier this week apologized for Meyer having mentioned Jared Kushner, U.S. President Donald Trumps son-in-law, in discussing the project.

In addition to Meyer, Laurent Morali, president of Kushner Companies, was included in marketing materials online for the China road show. Jared Kushner, whose White House portfolio includes relations with China, sold his stake in Kushner Companies to a family trust early this year.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": "" WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Thursday ran into resistance for calling ousted FBI chief James Comey a showboat, an attack that was swiftly contradicted by top U.S. senators and the acting FBI leader, who pledged that an investigation into possible Trump campaign ties to Russia would proceed with vigor.  In his first interview since firing Comey on Tuesday, Trump appeared to try to underscore that Comeys dismissal was about his performance at the Federal Bureau of Investigation and not about the Russia probe.  Trump faces accusations from Democrats that he fired Comey to hinder the FBI investigation into U.S. intelligence agency allegations that Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election to benefit Trump. The probe has hung over Trumps presidency since he took office in January and threatens to overwhelm his policy priorities.  Hes a showboat. Hes a grandstander, Trump told NBC News. The FBI has been in turmoil. You know that, I know that, everybody knows that.  Trumps characterization was at odds with that of the top Republican and Democratic lawmakers on the Senate Intelligence Committee.  At a hearing on Thursday, the Republican chairman of the panel, Richard Burr, and the top Democrat, Mark Warner, praised Comey. Warner said he was offended at Trumps remarks.  Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, testifying in place of Comey, contradicted Trumps appraisal of turmoil at the FBI, saying that Comey had broad support from the rank and file and still does to this day.  A White House spokeswoman on Thursday morning had said that Trump was expected to soon visit FBI headquarters, but MSNBC later reported that plan had been thrown out after agency officials told the White House that Trump would not be greeted warmly following his firing of Comey.  Several candidates are being considered to replace Comey, a senior White House official said, including Mike Rogers, a former Republican representative; Trey Gowdy, a Republican representative and former federal prosecutor; Alice Fisher, assistant attorney general in the George W. Bush administration; and Ray Kelly, former commissioner of the New York Police Department.  The nominee must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate.  McCabe promised to tell senators of any White House meddling into the agencys probe on Russia. Democrats have called for a special counsel to look into the matter.  It is my opinion and belief that the FBI will continue to pursue this investigation vigorously and completely, McCabe told the senators.  Moscow has denied interference in the election, and the Trump administration denies allegations of collusion with Russia.  In firing Comey, Trump said he knew he ran the risk he would confuse people and lengthen out the investigation into ties to Russia.  In fact when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said, You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story, its an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won, he told NBC.  Trump said in the interview that he never pressured Comey into dropping the FBI probe, adding: If Russia did anything, I want to know that. Trump said there was no collusion between me and my campaign and the Russians, but that the Russians did not affect the vote.  His explanation of why he fired Comey ran counter to previous administration explanations of Comeys dismissal.  The White House and Vice President Mike Pence had said Trump fired Comey on the recommendation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and No. 2 Justice Department official Rod Rosenstein.  On Thursday, Trump said he would have taken the action regardless. I was going to fire Comey. My decision, Trump said. I was going to fire regardless of recommendation.  Rosenstein, who met privately with some senators on Thursday, was invited to brief all 100 senators next week, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said. Schumer said he hoped that Sessions would also speak to senators separately on the firing of Comey.  In the House of Representatives, Justin Amash, a Republican member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said on Twitter that he had signed onto Democratic-sponsored legislation calling for an independent, bipartisan commission to probe Russian meddling in last years U.S. election campaign.  U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an effort to disrupt the election that included hacking into Democratic Party emails and leaking them, with the aim of helping Trump.  Leaders of the U.S. intelligence agencies, including Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and CIA chief Mike Pompeo, testified to the senators on Thursday that they agreed with that finding.  Trump, in his interview, also gave further details of his account that Comey had told him on three separate occasions that he was not under investigation in the Russia matter.  Trump said he had asked Comey once over dinner and twice by telephone. I said: If its possible, would you let me know, am I under investigation? Trump told NBC. He said: You are not under investigation.  Trump said the dinner with Comey was at the White House and Comey wanted to discuss staying on as FBI chief. We had a very nice dinner. And at that time, he told me: You are not under investigation.  White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said she believed it was not a conflict of interest for a president to ask the FBI chief such a question.  Comey has not publicly discussed any conversations he had with Trump.  At the Senate hearing, McCabe testified it was not typical practice to tell people they were not a targets of an investigation.  Republican chairman Burr asked McCabe whether he ever heard Comey tell Trump that the president was not the subject of investigation. McCabe sidestepped the question, saying he could not comment on an ongoing probe.  Warner, the top Democrat on the panel, said it was hard to avoid the conclusion that Trumps firing of Comey was related to the Russia investigation.  And while its clear to me now more than ever that an independent special counsel must be appointed, make no mistake our committee will get to the bottom of what happened during the 2016 presidential election, Warner said.

Delays in Senate confirmation of veteran trade lawyer Robert Lighthizer more than 100 days after his nomination have set back Trumps trade agenda, including the start of talks about revamping one of the worlds biggest trading blocs. Lighthizer won support from both Republicans and Democrats in the Republican-led Senate on Thursday, with an 82-14 vote to confirm his nomination.   The administration has had to wait for Lighthizer to be in place before triggering the formal process to begin renegotiating NAFTA.  It was not immediately clear when the White House would begin that process. To do so, the Trump administration must send a letter to Congress declaring its intention to launch  negotiations in 90 days. The Republican president has said the 23-year-old trade pact devastated U.S. workers and has vowed to tear it up if he fails to get a better deal.  Some Democrats, while critical of Trumps views on trade, said they were confident Lighthizer would work to help U.S. workers. Hes a real pro, Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, said before voting in favor. Lighthizers approval came despite the objections of two Republican senators, John McCain of Arizona and Ben Sasse of Nebraska, who said they were worried he did not appreciate NAFTAs benefits. Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, in charge of trade ties with the United States, said she did not expect the administration would move immediately on NAFTA. I imagine that Ambassador Lighthizer may need to spend a bit of time in consultations prior to formally triggering that 90-day period, she said on a conference call on Thursday night.      While the U.S. trade deficit with Mexico has ballooned since NAFTA was enacted in 1994, U.S. farmers have profited from exports to Americas southern neighbor, while automakers have cut costs by building cross-border supply chains that benefit from lower Mexican wages.  Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican who chairs the Senate Finance Committee and voted in favor of Lighthizers nomination, also urged the incoming trade representative not to put at risk the gains NAFTA had brought.  There are definitely opportunities to update and improve NAFTA, Hatch said. But it is important that the administration follow the spirit of the Hippocratic oath: First do no harm.

The following describes what is publicly known and not known about U.S. investigations into meddling and possible collusion between Russia and members of the Trump campaign: How did the investigations begin? Former President Barack Obama ordered U.S. intelligence agencies to assess whether Russia tried to intervene in the  election after a cyber attack on the Democratic National Committee in July 2016 and the publication of thousands of hacked personal emails from Hillary Clintons campaign manager in the month before the Nov. 8 election. Obama told intelligence officials to deliver a report on possible foreign interference before he left the White House in January 2017. What did the intelligence agencies find?  The Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency concluded in a report declassified in January that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a campaign not just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system but to affect the outcome. The agencies said Putin and the Russian government had a clear preference for Trump to win the White House. Putins  associates hacked information, paid social media trolls and backed efforts by Russian government agencies and state-funded media to sway public opinion, the agencies said.  The report stopped short of assessing whether Russia succeeded in swaying the election result. Putin and other Russian officials have repeatedly denied interfering in the U.S. election. What has Trump said about Russias role in the election? Trump has not taken a clear public position.  I will tell you this, Russia: if youre listening, I hope youre able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing, Trump said at a July 2016 news conference, in reference to a FBI probe into Clintons use of a private email system when she was secretary of state and emails that had possibly been deleted. Trump subsequently dismissed reports, including from U.S. intelligence officials, that Russia had attempted to intervene in the election on his behalf.    The first time Trump said he accepted the findings of the intelligence agencies was at a Jan. 11 news conference ahead of his inauguration. As far as hacking, I think it was Russia, Trump said, although he then added: It could have been others also. Earlier this month, Trump said China may have hacked the emails of Democratic officials to meddle with the election, offering no evidence and countering the view of intelligence officials. How many U.S. probes are there into Russias election meddling?  Committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate, along with the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, are all known to be investigating. Some Democrats and Trump critics have also called on the Justice Department to appoint a special counsel. Has there been any fallout for Trump associates over contacts  with Russia before, during or after the election campaign? Michael Flynn, Trumps national security adviser, was fired  in February. The White House said he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about the contacts he had with Russias ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kislyak, before Trump took office. On May 9, federal prosecutors issued grand jury subpoenas seeking business records from people who worked with Flynn when he was a private citizen. On May 10, the Senate Intelligence Committee issued the  first subpoena in its Russia investigation, demanding documents from Flynn after he declined to voluntarily comply with an earlier request. Attorney General Jeff Sessions had to recuse himself from involvement in Russia-related probes at the Justice Department because he had not told Congress of his own contacts with Kislyak in 2016. Will the FBI probe continue after Comeys dismissal? Comey told the House Intelligence Committee on March 20 that the FBI was investigating Moscows role in the election, including possible collusion with Trumps campaign. It was the first time he publicly acknowledged the agency was investigating the matter. Comeys departure does not necessarily mean the FBIs Russia investigation will be disrupted or ended as the career FBI officials Comey put in charge of it will likely continue working on the matter even as the search for a new director begins. The leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee had raised concerns about the pace of the FBI inquiry before Comeys firing. The congressional probes are dependent on the intelligence produced by the FBI and other agencies. FBI Acting Director Andrew McCabe, who will lead the agency until a new director is hired, promised the Senate Intelligence Committee that Comeys firing will not affect the investigation and that he will notify the committee of any attempt to delay or derail it. Why was Comey fired? Attorney General Sessions sent Trump a May 9 letter attaching a memo from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein on Restoring Confidence in the FBI that recommended Comeys dismissal. Rosensteins memo said Comey erred in July 2016 by announcing the FBI had been examining Clintons use of a private email server and that the case should be closed without prosecution. Rosensteins view was that Comeys decision to make a public statement on the matter broke with longstanding FBI precedent and should have been handled by the then-U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch. Trump called Comey a showboat and grandstander in an interview with NBC News on May 11, saying he was going to fire Comey regardless of Rosensteins recommendation.  Did Comeys firing have anything to do with the Russia probe? The White House says Comey was dismissed because of his handling of the Clinton email investigation. But many Democrats challenged that and some Republicans have expressed skepticism given the delay between Trump taking office on Jan. 20 and Comeys dismissal. Trump aides have told Reuters that top Justice Department officials wanted a heads-up from Comey about what he would say during a May 3 congressional hearing about the FBIs investigation of Clintons private email system.  The hearing was just days after Clinton said at a New York event that announcements by Comey in October 2016, a week before the election that he had re-opened, and then re-closed, the email probe had swung the election for Trump. Comey told the congressional panel the idea that he may have affected the election result made him mildly nauseous. Just days before his firing, Comey asked Rosenstein for a significant boost in resources to fund the agencys Russia probe, according to media reports. The Justice Department has denied this request was made. Is Trump being investigated by the FBI?  In the short letter Trump sent to Comey dismissing him from the FBI, he thanked Comey for informing him on three separate occasions that he was not under investigation. Comey has never stated publicly whether or not the FBI was investigating Trump and it would be unorthodox for him to say such a thing to the president. The White House has offered no proof to back Trumps claim. Trump has made clear on multiple occasions he believes the Russia investigations have run their course and should be closed. The Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end? he wrote on Twitter on May 8. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

But they gathered on the steps of City Hall to criticize a provision they said would unfairly deprive some people of the right to due process under the law.  De Blasios proposal would deny city-funded lawyers to immigrants previously convicted of one of 170 crimes that the city considers serious or violent.   Jennifer Friedman, who runs the immigration practice at Bronx Defenders, said the mayors plan would create a two-tier system that treats people different based on their criminal history. The funding be in addition to the New York Immigrant Family Unity Project (NYIFUP), which has been funded by the City Council since 2013 and provides free lawyers to immigrants facing deportation hearings at the federal immigration court.  In the United States, the right to a lawyer does not extend to federal immigration hearings which are civil, not criminal, proceedings.  The plan contradicted de Blasios description of New York as a sanctuary city for immigrants, the public defenders said. Seth Stein, a City Hall spokesman, wrote in an email that the public should not be expected to foot the bill for immigrants convicted of dangerous crimes. The vast majority of immigrants have not been convicted of violent crimes, he wrote. More than 2,000 immigrants have received free lawyers under the council-funded program, which provides free lawyers regardless of an immigrants criminal record, in the four years since it began, Legal Aid said.  In New York City, immigrants without lawyers managed to overturn a removal order in court only 3 percent of the time, while those with lawyers were able to remain in the country 30 percent of the time, Legal Aid said.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A major challenge to the U.S. watchdog for consumer finances fizzled on Thursday, as Congress missed a deadline to repeal the agencys new rule on prepaid cards. Late last year, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued a rule requiring greater disclosures and overdraft limits for the cards sold by companies such as Mastercard Inc. (MA.N) and Greendot and frequently used in place of paychecks. The timing made the rule eligible for Congress to repeal it under the Congressional Review Act (CRA), but lawmakers only had until Thursday to kill the regulation by passing a disapproval resolution in both chambers with simple majorities. Republican Senator David Perdue of Georgia, one of the agencys biggest critics, had introduced a resolution that he tried to speed through his chamber, but congressional aides and advocacy groups said he could not gather enough votes. Perdue has repeatedly said the CFPB, created in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law to protect individuals against fraud, oversteps its authority. Earlier this week he said he intends to keep up pressure on the agency.  The resolutions failure indicates that future regulations from the CFPB, reviled by many Republicans, may have shots at survival. The agency is led by Democrat Richard Cordray, was created by former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, and was originally conceived by Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, a leader in the liberal wing of the Democratic Party. The CFPB was expected to soon finalize restrictions on the fine print in contracts known as mandatory arbitration clauses that require consumers to give up their rights to class-action lawsuits as a condition of buying a service or product. But the rules fate has been caught in limbo. Congress is expected to kill it swiftly with a CRA resolution once it is official. While the first half-dozen CRA resolutions flew easily through Congress, repealing a wide spectrum of Obama-era regulations, the final resolutions faced a tougher time. One limiting methane emissions from oil and gas production on public lands failed on Wednesday. All told, Congress killed 14 regulations since Feb. 1. Lawmakers could still vote after this week to repeal rules that Obama finished in the last six months of his administration, but they will need super-majorities in each chamber, which is nearly impossible to achieve in the more closely divided Senate.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday to bolster the governments cyber security and protect critical infrastructure from cyber attacks, marking his first significant action to address what he has called a top priority. The order seeks to improve the often-maligned network security of U.S. government agencies, from which foreign governments and other hackers have pilfered millions of personal records and other forms of sensitive data in recent years. The White House said the order also aimed to enhance protection of infrastructure such as the energy grid and financial sector from sophisticated attacks that officials have warned could pose a national security threat or cripple parts of the economy. The directive, which drew largely favorable reviews from cyber experts and industry groups, also lays out goals to develop a more robust cyber deterrence strategy, in part by forging strong cooperation with U.S. allies in cyberspace. White House homeland security adviser Tom Bossert said the order sought to build on efforts undertaken by the former Obama administration.  Among the notable changes, heads of federal agencies must use a framework developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology to assess and manage cyber risk, and prepare a report within 90 days documenting how they will implement it. The Obama administration had encouraged the private sector to adopt the voluntary NIST framework. But it did not require government agencies to do so, which opened it up to criticism as it frequently scrambled to respond to major hacks, such as the theft of more than 20 million personnel records from the Office of Personnel Management. Government agencies would now practice what they preach, Bossert told reporters during a White House briefing. A lot of progress was made in the last administration, but not nearly enough. Michael Daniel, who served as White House cyber security coordinator under former Democratic President Barack Obama, generally praised the order but said it was largely a plan for a plan. Trump, a Republican, has also asked agencies to review their federal workforces cyber talent, an area where the government has faced a growing shortfall of qualified personnel in recent years. The order calls for an examination of the impact of moving agencies toward a shared information technology environment, such as through cloud computing services. It also urges voluntary cooperation with the private sector to develop better strategies to fend off and reduce attacks from botnets, or  networks of infected devices. Trump nearly signed a cyber security measure just days into his presidency in January, but it was pulled back to allow for more input from federal agencies and consultation with experts. Before taking office, Trump said he intended to make cyber security a priority of his administration. But he has raised alarm among cyber security experts by frequently using a personal Twitter that could be hacked by an adversary. His skepticism of the conclusion by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia hacked Democratic emails during the election to help him win has drawn criticism. Russia has repeatedly denied assertions it used cyber means to meddle in the U.S. election. Bossert said Russias alleged hacks were not a motivation for the order, adding that the Russians are not our only adversary on the internet. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Brown, 70, was convicted on 18 counts of participating in a conspiracy involving a fraudulent education charity, concealing material facts required on financial disclosure forms and filing false tax returns, the Justice Department said in a statement. Former Congresswoman Brown chose greed and personal gain over the sacred trust given to her by the community that she served for many years, acting U.S. Attorney Stephen Muldrow said after a jury reached a verdict in Jacksonville. Brown, a Democrat who served 24 years in Congress, lost her re-election bid last year after being indicted. Her sentencing date has not been set. James Smith, her attorney, told reporters outside the federal courthouse in Jacksonville that he would seek a new trial. She maintains her innocence, he said. This is just part one of a very long process. Prosecutors said Brown participated from 2012 to 2016 in a conspiracy and fraud scheme involving the One Door for Education fund, along with her chief-of-staff Elias Ronnie Simmons and the charitys president, Carla Wiley. The group solicited more than $800,000 in charitable donations that they said would be used to pay for college scholarships, computers for schools and other charitable causes, prosecutors said.    The money instead was spent by the three for their own personal use, including for a golf tournament honoring Brown and for luxury box seats at a Beyonce concert. The charity awarded only two scholarships totaling $1,200 to college students, according to trial evidence. Simmons and Wiley previously pleaded guilty to charges stemming from their involvement in the scheme.      Brown, known as a talkative politician who does not shy away from the media, stayed silent as she left the courthouse on Thursday. Brown was elected to Congress in 1992 as one of the first three black members of Floridas congressional delegation since the Reconstruction period following the Civil War.

The bill, which received final passage in a 33-22 state Senate vote on Wednesday, also aims to keep abortions legal in Illinois if the U.S. Supreme Court follows President Donald Trumps call to overturn its landmark Roe v. Wade ruling that made abortions legal 44 years ago.  Democratic state Senator Don Harmon filed a motion Wednesday night to reconsider the Senates vote, meaning the bill will not immediately be sent to Governor Bruce Rauner.  This measure is too important to immediately put it in the hands of a governor whose public opinions about womens access to safe, affordable reproductive health care have been inconsistent at best, Harmon said in a statement on Thursday. The Senate can hold the bill for the duration of the legislative session, said Harmon spokeswoman Jayette Bolinski.   Illinois Medicaid program covers abortions in cases of rape, incest and when a mothers life or health is threatened. The expansion would enable poor women to obtain elective abortions. Also, the legislation would allow state employees to have the procedures covered under state health insurance. A spokeswoman for Rauner declined to comment on Thursday. Rauner, who faces re-election next year, has promised to veto the legislation, saying Illinois should focus on less divisive issues and instead pass a full-year operating budget for the first time in nearly two years. A veto would be a sharp turn from his previous position, which political opponents are poised to exploit. As a candidate in 2014, he supported expanding abortion access.  Illinois, the countrys fifth-largest state, is immersed in one of the most politically turbulent eras in its 199-year history. Rauner has feuded with Democrats, who control the state legislature, over his insistence a state budget be tied to his list of policy demands that would weaken unions, impose legislative term limits, freeze property taxes and impose new rules on injured workers seeking compensation from their employers.  With House Speaker Michael Madigan and fellow Democrats blocking that agenda, Illinois has been without a complete budget during Rauners first two years in office. The fiscal futility has left Illinois - the only state ever to go 22 months without a budget - with around $12.2 billion in unpaid bills as of Wednesday.

The vacancies on the Feds seven member Board of Governors include the position of vice chair in charge of banking oversight, a critical role in Trumps plan to revamp financial rules. The White House wants to get all nominees vetted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Government Ethics before they name them publicly and that process can take months, according to people familiar with the matter. If the vetting drags on, it runs the risk of delaying those people from taking their jobs until sometime this fall, complicating Trumps plan to reshape regulation of Wall Street. The Fed positions require confirmation by the Senate and could be delayed further by a five-week congressional recess from the end of July to the beginning of September. Randal Quarles, a veteran of the George W. Bush administration, is expected to be Trumps pick for the Feds top bank regulator, Reuters has previously reported. Trump met him late last month, according to sources familiar with the matter. Quarles, who worked as a partner at private equity firm the Carlyle Group, currently runs a private investment firm, the Cynosure Group, from Salt Lake City, Utah. He also served in the Treasury Department under Bush and was the U.S. executive director of the International Monetary Fund. Quarles did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday. A spokesman for the Federal Reserve declined to comment. The vice chair for supervision and regulation and another seat that governs community banking were created as part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law but were never filled by President Barack Obama. Former Fed governor Daniel Tarullo had stepped in to fill the supervision void before leaving the central bank in April. The White House would like to name all three regulatory positions at the Fed at the same time, according to people familiar with the matter. But Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin dismissed that idea publicly last month, saying, I dont think were going to do that. In addition to the three current vacancies, one of which must be filled by someone with community banking experience, Chair Janet Yellen and Stanley Fischer, the vice chairman, could step down when their terms expire next year. Trump could therefore fill as many as five of the boards seven seats within the next year, giving him the opportunity to nominate a block of people who will have a big say in the direction of interest rates.

Trump signed an executive order creating the bipartisan Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, which would be chaired by Vice President Mike Pence, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters. The move provoked anger among top U.S. civil rights groups and Democratic lawmakers, who called it a voter suppression tactic. Trump, who took office in January, has said there was  widespread voter fraud in the November election. The Republican won the White House through victory in the Electoral College, which tallies wins in states, but lost the popular vote to  Democratic rival Hillary Clinton by some 3 million ballots. Trump said in January he would seek an investigation into voter fraud in the election, even though the consensus among state officials and election experts is that it is rare in the United States. The Presidents Election Integrity Commission is purpose-built to encourage and enable voter suppression, said U.S. House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi in a statement. She said the commission would lend legitimacy to state efforts to enact discriminatory voting laws. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and Elijah Cummings, ranking Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, issued similar statements. Top civil rights leaders said the commission would encourage voter suppression by justifying new barriers like requiring identity cards for voting.  When Attorney General Jeff Sessions led a similar effort as a former prosecutor in Alabama, it had a chilling effect on the black vote, said Kristen Clarke, the head of the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.  Dale Ho, director of the American Civil Liberties Union voting project, said, Signing a piece of paper will not make Trumps false statements about voter fraud true. The bipartisan commission would not be limited to investigating Trumps election fraud claims but look at issues that have been raised over many years.  The commission will review policies and practices that enhance or undermine the American peoples confidence in the integrity of federal elections, and provide the president with a report that identifies system vulnerabilities, Huckabee Sanders said. She said the report would be complete by 2018. The new panel coincides with several U.S. investigations into alleged Russian meddling in the November election, including selectively leaking hacked emails and circulating false news reports.

Democratic attorneys general in states across the country have assumed lead roles in opposing some of the Republican presidents agenda. State attorneys general in Washington and Hawaii successfully sued to block Trumps executive orders restricting travel from some Muslim-majority countries, and California attorney general Xavier Becerra has pledged to defend the states environmental standards and health care access. Brown has been particularly outspoken against Trumps policies. In budget revisions released on Thursday, Browns office proposed a $6.5 million increase for Californias Department of Justice, enough to fund 31 positions to address various actions taken at the federal level that impact public safety, healthcare, the environment, consumer affairs and general constitutional issues. The department has expended over 11,000 hours of legal work in response to federal issues since Trumps inauguration in January, according the governors office.  Browns proposals would have to be approved by Californias legislature, which is dominated by Democrats. At a press conference, Brown repeatedly expressed the need to fight the Trump administration on health care reforms under discussion in Washington. The potential loss of funds for the states Medicaid program alone would be enough to fund the University of California system for a year, Brown said. Given that backdrop, Brown said Becerra deserves some latitude in pursuing litigation.  A spokeswoman for Becerra could not immediately be reached for comment.

With the Republican president facing a storm of criticism from many Democratic lawmakers and some in his own party, the Trump administration accused Comey of atrocities on the job and denied his firing was related to the FBIs Russia investigation. Trump, who met Russias foreign minister at the White House on Wednesday, lashed out at critics, calling Democrats phony hypocrites, and defended his decision to abruptly oust Comey on Tuesday from the law enforcement post he held since 2013. In a farewell letter to staff seen by CNN, Comey, who was appointed by Trumps predecessor, Democratic President Barack Obama, said he had long believed that a president can fire an FBI director for any reason, or for no reason at all. Comey added he would not spend time dwelling on Trumps decision or the way it was executed. But Democrats ramped up accusations that Comeys removal was intended to undermine the Federal Bureau of Investigation probe and demanded an independent investigation into the alleged Russian meddling, with some calling the firing an attempt to cover up wrongdoing related to Russia. A congressional source with knowledge of the matter said Comey told lawmakers within the past few days he had asked the Justice Department to make additional resources available - mainly more staffing - for the Russia probe. Comey informed lawmakers of that request after the Senate Intelligence Committee, conducting its own investigation, had asked the FBI to speed up its Russia inquiry, the source said. Democrat Dianne Feinstein, the Senate Judiciary Committees top Democrat, told reporters she understood Comey was seeking more resources for the FBI investigation. Responding to media reports that Comey had asked Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein last week for a significant boost in resources for the agencys probe, Justice Department spokesman Ian Prior said in an email: Totally false. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in a January report that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered an effort to disrupt the 2016 election that included hacking into Democratic Party emails and leaking them, with the aim of helping Trump. Russia has denied any such meddling. The Trump administration denies allegations of collusion with Russia. Top U.S. Republicans rallied to Trumps defense, but some called the action troubling. Republican House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz said in a statement on Wednesday he had requested a review by the Department of Justices inspector general of Trumps decision to fire Comey, who had more than six years left in his 10-year post. Comeys dismissal stunned Washington and plunged Trump deeper into a controversy over his campaigns alleged ties with Russia that has dogged the early days of his presidency, while also threatening to hinder his policy goals. He wasnt doing a good job, very simply, the Republican president said of Comey during a meeting with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in the White House Oval Office. The administration said on Tuesday that Comeys firing stemmed from his handling of an election-year FBI probe into Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clintons use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state. White House officials said Trumps anger at Comey had been building for months but a turning point came when the FBI chief refused to preview for top Trump aides his planned testimony to a May 3 Senate hearing on the Clinton email issue, an act Trump and his aides took it as an act of insubordination. Trump had been considering letting Comey go since the day he was elected in November, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said. She referred to what she called Comeys atrocities in circumventing the chain of command at the Justice Department. Many Democrats have criticized Comeys management of the Clinton investigation, but they questioned the timing of his dismissal, given that Trump could have acted soon after taking office on Jan. 20 and that he has repeatedly criticized the FBI and congressional probes into Russias role in the election. In a flurry of Twitter posts, Trump said Comey had lost the confidence of almost everyone in Washington, Republican and Democrat alike. He added, Dems have been complaining for months & months about Dir. Comey. Now that he has been fired they PRETEND to be aggrieved. Phony hypocrites! The Senate minority leader, Democrat Chuck Schumer, said Rosenstein should appoint a special prosecutor. Schumer called on Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to hold closed and potentially classified briefings with all senators to question the top Justice Department officials, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Rosenstein. We know Director Comey was leading an investigation (into) whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians, a serious offense. Were those investigations getting too close to home for the president? Schumer said. McConnell accused Democrats of complaining about the removal of an FBI director who they themselves repeatedly and sharply criticized and said a special prosecutor would impede existing probes like one under way in the Senate Intelligence Committee. Paul Ryan, the Republican leader of the House of Representatives, told Fox News in an interview it was entirely within the presidents role and authority to remove Comey and that a special prosecutor was unnecessary. Mark Warner, the intelligence committees top Democrat, said he and the panels Republican chairman, Richard Burr, had asked Comey to testify before the panel in private next Tuesday. On Wednesday evening, the intelligence panel said it had issued a subpoena requesting documents from Trumps former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, in relation to its Russia probe. The committee said it had first requested the documents in a letter to Flynn on April 28. Flynn was forced to resign in February for failing to disclose the content of his talks with Sergei Kislyak, Russias ambassador to the United States, and then misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations.  Trump said he had a very, very good meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and they discussed Syrias civil war. Their meeting was the highest-level public contact between Trump and Putins government since Trump took office.  During an earlier appearance at the State Department, Lavrov responded in a sarcastic tone when asked about Comeys dismissal, saying: Was he fired? Youre kidding. Youre kidding. In the Russian city of Sochi, Putin said Comeys firing would not have an impact on U.S.-Russian relations. Trumps nominee as the new FBI director would need to win Senate confirmation. Trumps possible choices to head the FBI on an interim basis, according to a White House official, include acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, Assistant Director Paul Abbate, Chicago FBI agent Michael Anderson and Richmond, Virginia, agent Adam Lee.

By Steve Holland and Jeff Mason WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The anger behind Donald Trumps firing of FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday had been building for months, but a turning point came when Comey refused to preview for top Trump aides his planned testimony to a Senate panel, White House officials said. Trump, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had wanted a heads-up from Comey about what he would say at a May 3 hearing about his handling of an investigation into former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clintons use of a private email server. When Comey refused, Trump and his aides considered that an act of insubordination and it was one of the catalysts to Trumps decision this week to fire the FBI director, the officials said.  It gave the impression that he was no longer capable of carrying out his duties, one official said. Previews of congressional testimony to superiors are generally considered courteous. Comey, who testified for four hours before the Senate Judiciary Committee, said it made him feel mildly nauseous that his decision to make public his reopening of a probe into Clintons handling of classified information might have affected the outcome of the Nov. 8 presidential election. But he said he had no regrets and would make the same decision again. Trumps sudden firing of Comey shocked Washington and plunged Trump deeper into a controversy over his campaigns alleged ties with Russia that has dogged the early days of his presidency. Democrats accused the Republican president of firing Comey to try to undermine the FBIs probe into Russias alleged efforts to meddle in the 2016 election and possible collusion with members of the Trump campaign, and demanded an independent investigation. Some of Trumps fellow Republicans called his dismissal of Comey troubling.  The Trump administration said on Tuesday Comey was fired because of his handling of the Clinton email probe. Before he axed Comey, Trump had publicly expressed frustration with the FBI and congressional probes into the Russia matter. Moscow has denied meddling in the election and the Trump administration denies allegations of collusion with Russia. A former Trump adviser said Trump was also angry because Comey had never offered a public exoneration of Trump in the FBI probe into contacts between the Russian ambassador to Washington, Sergei Kislyak, and Trump campaign advisers last year. According to this former adviser, Comeys Senate testimony on the Clinton emails likely reinforced in Trumps mind that Comey was against him.  He regretted what he did to Hillary but not what he did to Trump, the former Trump adviser said of Comey. Clinton has said that the Comey decision to announce the renewed inquiry days before the election was a likely factor in her loss to Trump. Aides said Trump moved quickly after receiving a recommendation on Monday to terminate Comey from Rosenstein, who began reviewing the situation at the FBI shortly after taking office two weeks ago. Trumps move was so sudden that his White House staff, accustomed to his impromptu style, was caught off guard. Stunned aides scrambled to put together a plan to explain what happened. White House spokesman Sean Spicer ended up briefing reporters about the move in the dark on Tuesday night near a patch of bushes steps away from the West Wing. Comey, who was in Los Angeles meeting with FBI employees on Tuesday and returned later to Washington, has made no public comment on his firing. Many questions remained about what caused Trump to move so quickly. Two former senior Justice Department officials said it made little sense to fire Comey while the Justice Department Inspector General was still doing a review of the FBIs handling of the Clinton email investigation. I take Rod (Rosenstein) at his word that be believed everything in that memo but he must know that its going to be used as a fig leaf to fire Comey, one former official said.  U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, told reporters it was her understanding Comey had been seeking more resources for his investigation into the tangled Russia controversy. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump had pondered dumping Comey as soon as he took office on Jan. 20, but decided to stick with him. Trump shrugged off the political firestorm he created with Comeys dismissal as he met with former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in the Oval Office on Wednesday. Asked by reporters why he fired Comey, Trump said, He wasnt doing a good job, very simply. He wasnt doing a good job. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""NEW YORK (Reuters) - Not even a week after the Trump administration and Congress rekindled optimism that they could soon make progress on a pro-growth agenda including tax cuts, the unexpected firing of the head of the FBI late Tuesday presented investors with a fresh reason to second-guess their confidence in the Trump trade. At the least, financial market participants viewed President Donald Trumps abrupt dismissal of FBI Director James Comey as an unwelcome distraction, while some fretted it could tie Washington in knots for months, potentially postponing already-delayed reforms. The takeaway for the stock markets: dont bet on any quick legislation around trade, the budget, healthcare or infrastructure. There is nothing good out of this for markets, said Michael Purves, chief global strategist at Weeden & Co. It will weigh on Trumps ability to cut deals with Congress. It costs him negotiating leverage. Jack Ablin, Chief Investment Officer at BMO Private Bank, said, on a medium-term basis, it does undermine the administrations power to get things done.  Trump's election last November unleashed a powerful upswing in U.S. stock markets on the premise that he would cut taxes and regulation and usher through a major infrastructure spending package. The benchmark S&P 500 .SPX has gained 12 percent since Election Day, while shares of tech stocks and smaller companies have performed even better.  Nagging concerns about Trumps ability to get things done, along with some anxiety about stretched equity valuations, have combined to cap the rally, and stocks have done little since early March. Around midday Wednesday, the S&P was near unchanged, as were other market benchmarks. The administration recovered some credibility last week when the House of Representatives voted to repeal major portions of former President Barack Obamas Affordable Care Act after failing to do so a month earlier. The simple achievement of advancing the healthcare bill to the Senate had been seen by investors as a signal that enacting tax cuts was doable, the big question was just how soon - this year or next.  Theres a tremendous amount of hope baked into the market that Trump is going to be able to act, particularly on tax reform, said Brad McMillan, Chief Investment Officer for Commonwealth Financial in Waltham, Massachusetts. Edward Perkin, Chief Equity Investment Officer at Eaton Vance, said if the date to pass tax is pushed out its not so much a problem, but if people question if it will ever happen, then thats a problem. The degree to which this further alienates Democrats on Capitol Hill, especially in the Senate, was another concern given how narrow support has been so far for Trumps agenda. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a senior Democratic lawmaker from California, was not optimistic that tensions between the parties would ease anytime soon. I had been hopeful that we could have a line of activity thats going to bring a very divided country together, Feinstein told Reuters Wednesday. The problem out there is that people are so divided. Should the Comey episode weaken Trumps bargaining ability with lawmakers, it may actually act as a catalyst for a tax bill, just one that might resemble congressional Republicans version more than Trumps. An ongoing special investigation or shift in the balance of power could actually make Trump more eager to sign off on the previously existing congressional tax plan, analysts at NatWest Markets said. Of course, some had already adopted the view that Trumps promised reforms were a distant hope, at best. Investors are realizing that the fiscal policy agenda is being pushed out farther on the horizon, Michael Arone, Chief Investment Strategist at State Street Global Advisors (STT.N).

In a joint statement, Senators Richard Burr, the committees Republican chairman, and Mark Warner, its top Democrat, said the committee had first requested the documents from Flynn in a April 28 letter, but the retired lieutenant general had declined, through counsel, to cooperate with the committees request. It was the first subpoena announced by the committee in its investigation. Warner said on Tuesday that the committee has been receiving documents as it investigates allegations that Russia sought to influence the U.S. election, something Moscow denies. But he told Reuters that some people were not complying so we were going to take next steps. The Trump administration denies any collusion with Russia. Flynn has been a focus of investigations into Russia and the election. He was forced to resign in February as Trumps national security adviser for failing to disclose the content of his talks with Sergey Kislyak, Russias ambassador to the United States, and then misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations.  Former Acting U.S. Attorney General Sally Yates testified at a high-profile hearing on Monday that she had warned the White House in January that Flynn had been compromised and could have been vulnerable to blackmail by Russia. The subpoena was announced a day after Trump abruptly fired FBI Director James Comey, who had been leading the bureaus investigation of Russia and the election. Comeys firing prompted a storm of criticism from Democrats, who accused the president of seeking to stall the probe.

The Congressional Review Act resolution received just 49 votes after Republican leaders scrambled for weeks to secure the 51 needed to pass it. The resolution would have revoked the rule and prevented similar regulations from being introduced. Getting the Trump administration to repeal the BLM rule had been a top priority of the oil and gas industry. Companies said it was unnecessary, would could cost them tens of thousands of dollars per well and hinder production. But not all Republicans supported the measure, in part because it would have made regulating methane waste more difficult in the future.  Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona made a surprise vote against the resolution, joining fellow Republicans Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Susan Collins of Maine in opposition to torpedo it. While I am concerned that the BLM rule may be onerous, passage of the resolution would have prevented the federal government, under any administration, from issuing a rule that is similar, McCain said in a statement. He said the Interior Department should issue a new rule on to replace the existing one on methane leaks, which he called a public health and air quality issue. The rule, finalized by President Barack Obama in his last weeks in office, updated 30-year-old regulations that govern flaring, venting and natural gas leaks from oil and gas production. Obamas administration said it would preserve up to 41 billion cubic feet (BCF) of natural gas per year that is currently lost to leaks and flaring. The American Petroleum Institute and other industry groups have said the methane rule is unnecessary because companies have made strides in reducing leaks on their own.  The rule could impede U.S. energy production while reducing local and federal revenues, said Erik Milito, APIs Upstream and Industry Operations Group Director. Members of the Western Energy Alliance, which include Devon Energy , Whiting Petroleum and EOG Resources  had also been strongly opposed to the rule. Environmental groups hailed what they depicted as a rare victory for the environment after several regulatory rollbacks by the Trump administration. In recent months, thousands of Americans asked the Senate to stand up for clean air and against the oil lobby, and their efforts were successful today, said Jamie Williams, president of the Wilderness Society. The Western Values Project estimated that if the rule had been rescinded, the U.S. Treasury would have lost out on $800 million in lost potential royalties from leaked or vented natural gas over the next decade. Republican Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works who supported the resolution to kill the rule, called on Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to act unilaterally to revoke it.

The talks with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov were the highest-level public contact between Trump and the government of Russian President Vladimir Putin since the Republican took office on Jan. 20.  While not unprecedented, it is a rare privilege for a foreign minister to be received by a U.S. president for a bilateral meeting in the White House. In a stunning development, Trump on Tuesday fired FBI Director James Comey, whose agency is investigating alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and the possibility Trump associates may have colluded with Moscow. Democrats accused Trump of trying to slow down the investigation by firing the FBI chief. Trump described his talks with Lavrov as very, very good. When asked whether the Comey dismissal had affected his meeting, Trump said, not at all. He and Lavrov said they discussed the civil war in Syria, where Russia backs President Bashar al-Assad. We want to see the killing, the horrible killing, stopped in Syria as soon as possible and everyone is working toward that end, Trump told reporters. Lavrov, who earlier met with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, said his discussions with members of the Trump administration had convinced him they were people who wanted to cut deals and solve problems. The Trump administration, and the president himself, and the secretary of state, I was persuaded of this once again today, are people of action, Lavrov said. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in a January report that Putin had ordered an effort to disrupt the 2016 election that included hacking into Democratic Party emails and leaking them, with the aim of helping Trump. Russia denies the allegations. Blaming fake information, Lavrov said: I believe that politicians are damaging the political system of the U.S., trying to pretend that someone is controlling America from the outside.  The Trump administration denies claims of collusion with Russia. Earlier, as Tillerson and Lavrov posed for photographs, the Russian sarcastically deflected a reporters question about Comeys dismissal. Asked if the firing would cast a shadow over his talks, Lavrov replied: Was he fired? Youre kidding. Youre kidding.              The Russian embassy in Washington tweeted a picture from the Lavrov meeting of Trump shaking hands with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak, a man at the center of the controversy on Russian contacts with associates of Trump. Former U.S. National Security Advisor Michael Flynn was forced to resign for failing to disclose the content of his talks with Kislyak and then misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations. Senior Democratic Senator Dick Durbin said the Oval Office encounter was a photo opportunity for Russia. President Trump in these pictures, is shaking hands with Russians, and the Kremlin is gleefully tweeting these pictures around the world, Durbin said on the Senate floor. Wednesdays meetings followed talks Tillerson held with Putin last month in Moscow. Tensions in the relationship grew following U.S. air strikes against a Syrian airfield in April in response to a chemical weapons attack that Washington blamed on Assad.  Both Trump and Lavrov appeared to strike a more conciliatory tone after both capitals had presented souring views of the relationship recently. The White House said Trump raised the possibility of broader cooperation on resolving conflicts in the Middle East and elsewhere and still sought to build a better relationship between the two countries. Lavrov said that despite difficulties our countries can and should contribute jointly to the settlement of the most urgent issues in international affairs.     Trump underscored the need for Russia to rein in the Assad regime, Iran and Iranian proxies, the White House said. Lavrov said the meeting mainly focused on ideas of de-escalation zones in Syria. Russia brokered a deal for de-escalation zones with backing from Iran and Syrian opposition supporter Turkey during ceasefire talks in the Kazakh capital Astana last week.

The Senate must still vote to confirm Delrahim. In a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee overshadowed by repercussions over Trumps firing of Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey, Delrahim reiterated that he would recuse himself from a fight over whether health insurer Anthem may merge with rival Cigna. Delrahim had worked for Anthem as a lobbyist when he was with the law firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, LLP. Obamas Justice Department sued to stop the deal, and the case is currently under appeal. Asked what he would do if the White House wanted to discuss a deal being considered by the division, Delrahim said antitrust enforcement was law enforcement. The independence of the decisions made in prosecuting and reviewing mergers as well as other conduct is a serious one that should be free from any political influence, he said. They will be free if I am fortunate enough to be confirmed. Delrahim currently works in the White House as deputy assistant and deputy counsel to the president. If confirmed as expected, Delrahims antitrust division would review corporate mergers at a time when many investors and corporate executives are anticipating a more relaxed view of deal-making. Former President Barack Obamas administration faced a large number of megadeals in what one enforcer called a merger tsunami and blocked many of them. Antitrust experts who have followed Delrahims career expect him to follow in the footsteps of a former boss, Hewitt Pate, who was assistant attorney general for antitrust from 2003 to 2005. Delrahim was Pates deputy, specializing in international antitrust. Under Pate, the division was criticized for allowing too many deals, but it sued to stop US Airways from merging with United Airlines and blocked a deal to combine DirecTV and EchoStar. It tried but failed to stop Oracle Corp from buying PeopleSoft. If confirmed, Delrahim would oversee the Justice Departments assessment of AT&Ts Inc plan to buy Time Warner Inc, the owner of HBO, Warner Brothers and news network CNN.  The department is reviewing major transactions in seeds and agricultural chemicals, like the mergers of Dow Chemical Co and Dupont, and of Bayer and Monsanto. Those proposed deals, along with ChemChinas purchase of Syngenta, would consolidate six agricultural chemical companies into three. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Democrats are worried Comeys firing on Tuesday could jeopardize the ongoing FBI probe and have renewed calls for an independent investigation. Some Republicans have said that could undermine concurrent investigations underway in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. Here is what could happen next: * The investigations already underway could continue. Comeys firing does not necessarily mean the FBIs investigation into Moscows role in the 2016 election will be disrupted or end, legal experts told Reuters. The career FBI staffers Comey put in charge of the probe will likely continue it, even as the search for a new director begins. The parallel inquiries underway in Senate and House committees could likewise progress. * The Justice Department, other federal agencies or the U.S. Congress could conduct independent investigations. The Justice Department could conduct a criminal investigation. But other federal agencies and departments have the power to conduct fact-finding inquiries, according to University of Southern California law professor Sam Erman. Congress could also create a special commission or appoint a special master separate from the committee probes, Erman said. * The Justice Department could appoint a special counsel. Most Democrats have said they prefer the appointment of a special counsel at the Justice Department to oversee the probe since it is the only agency that can bring a criminal case. A law related to the appointment of a special prosecutor lapsed in the 1990s but department regulations provide that the attorney general can appoint a special counsel from outside the federal government. If the attorney general ignores the recommendations of a special counsel, the rules specify that a report must be sent to Congress, according to Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. The attorney general can hire staff to do the job of a special counsel without triggering department rules. This occurred in 2003 when a special counsel investigated the disclosure of the identity of intelligence officer Valerie Plame. * Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein would likely appoint a special counsel. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has recused himself from involvement in Russia-related probes after misstating his own contacts in 2016 with Russias ambassador in Washington. Rosenstein would likely appoint a special counsel. Some Democrats, however, have already raised questions about Sessions role in advising Rosenstein on Comeys firing and called for a nonpolitical appointee at the Justice Department to make the special counsel decision. * The appointment of a special counsel would not end the congressional probes. Senate Republicans, including some from leadership, have said a special counsel should not be appointed because it would imperil ongoing congressional probes but a special counsel would not have the authority to demand Congress halt a probe. Criminal probes can at times complicate congressional matters, particularly with witness testimony. But an investigation undertaken by a special counsel would be no different than the one already underway at the FBI. It wouldnt interfere any more or any less if a special counsel were appointed, Levitt said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

State prosecutors for California, New Mexico, New York and Washington are arguing new coal extraction would exacerbate global warming and violate the federal governments statutory duty to use public lands in a manner that will protect the quality of scientific, scenic, historical, ecological, environmental, air and atmospheric, water resource, and archaeological values, according to the filings. The move was one of several recent attempts to block a broad pledge by U.S. President Donald Trump to roll back environmental regulations put in place under former President Barack Obama. The former president placed a moratorium on new coal mining leases on public lands more than a year ago, in January 2016.  On March 29, Zinke, whom Trump appointed Interior secretary, formally lifted the ban. The prosecutors argued in addition to harming the environment, more coal mining on public lands would burden state and local governments with expenses related to healthcare, flood control and other infrastructure needs related to potentially harmful effects of nearby mines.  They also argued the United States outdated structure for collecting royalties from mining companies meant the government was not obtaining as much money for the leases as it deserved.

In a news conference at a waterfront park near his childhood home, an emotional Murray denied the claims against him, which he has called politically motivated, according to a video posted on the mayors Facebook page. Murray, a Democrat and the citys first openly gay mayor, also suggested that the accusations were rooted in stereotypes of gay men. The mayors race must be focused on... issues, not on a scandal, which it would be focused on if I were to remain in this race, Murray, who became mayor in 2014, said in announcing his withdrawal from the race. As a senator in the Washington state legislature, Murray championed gay rights and legalizing same-sex marriage. During his term as mayor, Seattle sued President Donald Trump over his executive order cracking down on sanctuary cities that limit their cooperation with federal immigration agents.     A primary election for mayor will take place Aug. 1 and the two candidates with the most votes will face off in the Nov. 7 general election.     In April, a 46-year-old man sued Murray, claiming that the mayor paid him for sex when he was a homeless, drug-addicted teenager in the 1980s, according to the lawsuit.     The Seattle Times newspaper said that in 2008 two other men had accused Murray of abusing them when they were teenagers in the 1980s. Murray has denied those claims, which did not become public until last month. A fourth accuser in a sworn court declaration made similar allegations against Murray, according to the Seattle Times. Murray consistently denied the claims, calling the accusations politically motivated, but also garnered criticism for questioning the trustworthiness of the accusers, which the Seattle Times said had criminal records. An attorney for the first accuser, Lincoln Beauregard, said on Twitter that his client saw the mayors withdrawal from the race as one step towards justice.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": "" WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump ignited a political firestorm on Tuesday by firing FBI Director James Comey, who had been leading an investigation into the Trump 2016 presidential campaigns possible collusion with Russia to influence the election outcome.  READ THE LATEST ON THE COMEY FIRINGDefending firing of FBI director, Trump derides Democratic criticsSenate Republican leader opposed new Russia investigationThe Republican president said he fired Comey, the top U.S. law enforcement official, over his handling of an election-year email scandal involving then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.  The move stunned Washington and raised suspicions among Democrats and others that the White House was trying to blunt the FBI probe involving Russia.  Some Democrats compared Trumps move to the Saturday Night Massacre of 1973, in which President Richard Nixon fired an independent special prosecutor investigating the Watergate scandal.  White House officials denied allegations that there was any political motive in the move by Trump, who took office on Jan. 20.  Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said he spoke to Trump and told him he was making a very big mistake in firing Comey, adding the president did not really answer in response.  An independent investigation into Moscows role in the election is now the only way to go to restore the American peoples faith, Schumer said.  Though many Democrats have criticized Comeys handling of the Clinton email probe, they said they were troubled by the timing of Trumps firing of him.  Senator Richard Burr, the Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is overseeing its own investigation into Russian interference during the election, said in a statement he was also troubled by the timing of Comeys termination.  His dismissal, I believe, is a loss for the Bureau and the nation, Burr said.  U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in a January report that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered an effort to disrupt the 2016 election, with the aim of helping Trump.  CNN reported on Tuesday night that federal prosecutors had issued grand jury subpoenas to former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn, seeking business records, as part of the probe into Russian interference in the election.  Trumps firing of Comey came a day after former acting Attorney General Sally Yates told a Senate panel that she had informed the White House on Jan. 26 that Flynn was at risk of blackmail by Moscow because he had been untruthful about his discussions with the Russian ambassador, Sergei Kislyak. Trump fired Flynn 18 days later.  Russia has repeatedly denied any meddling in the election and the Trump administration denies allegations of collusion with Russia.  Trump, in a letter to Comey released by the White House, said: It is essential that we find new leadership for the FBI that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission.  The president told Comey in the letter that he accepted the recommendation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions that he could no longer provide effective leadership. Comeys term was to run through September 2023. He was appointed director by Democratic President Barack Obama in 2013.  Sessions advised Trumps campaign before being picked by the president to lead the Justice Department. Sessions had recused himself from involvement in the Russia investigation, after he misstated his own 2016 contacts with Russias ambassador to Washington.  Comeys deputy, Andrew McCabe, became acting FBI director. The White House said the search for a new permanent director would begin immediately.  Pushing back against critics of the move, White House officials said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a career prosecutor who took office on April 25, assessed the situation at the FBI and concluded that Comey had lost his confidence.  Rosenstein sent his recommendation to Sessions, who concurred and they forwarded their recommendation to Trump, who accepted it on Tuesday, they said.  The White House released a memo in which Rosenstein wrote: I cannot defend the Directors handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clintons emails, and I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken.  Rosenstein cited several former Justice Department officials comments criticizing Comeys handling of the Clinton email investigation, including his public statements.  But one of those he cited, Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general under President H.W. Bush, questioned the purported reasons for the firing. Reached by Reuters, Ayer said in an email that the administrations explanation was a sham.  Comey was traveling in Los Angeles when the news broke that he had been fired.  In an odd twist, a White House official said the letter firing him was delivered to the FBI by Keith Schiller, Trumps longtime armed personal bodyguard who is now director of Oval Office Operations at the White House.  Trump, in the letter, said: While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the bureau.  Comey, 56, had been the target of criticism from many quarters for his handling of a probe involving Clintons use of a private email server while she was U.S. secretary of state under Obama. As recently as Tuesday, the FBI clarified remarks that Comey made on the matter last week.  Trump had originally criticized the FBI director for not pursuing criminal charges against Clinton last July, but later lavished praise on him.  Comey had said in July the Clinton email case should be closed without prosecution, but then declared - 11 days before the Nov. 8 election - that he had reopened the investigation because of a discovery of a new trove of Clinton-related emails.  Clinton and other Democrats say they believe Comeys decision help cost her the election.  The firing came as a shock to FBI staff, nearly all of whom had confidence in Comey despite the controversy surrounding his handling of the Clinton email situation, according to an FBI official who spoke on condition of anonymity.  The official said there was concern among agents that the firing was a political act related to the Russian investigation.  Other current and former U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials questioned the White House explanation for Comeys firing.  Trump praised him for the work on the email investigation, so thats not it, said Austin Berglas, a former FBI supervisory agent on hacking cases. I think he realized the extent of the Russia investigation under way and moved him out. To me, thats the only logical explanation right now.  Trumps dismissal of Comey does not mean the FBIs investigation into Russias interference in the U.S. presidential election will be disrupted or end - career FBI staffers can continue the probe even as the search for a new FBI director begins, legal experts said.  Republican Representative Justin Amash wrote on Twitter that he and his staff were reviewing the possibility of drafting legislation to create an independent commission to look into the Russian campaign meddling.  Legislation related to the appointment of a special prosecutor or independent counsel has lapsed. But Justice Department regulations provide for the appointment of a special counsel, which is selected by the attorney general, or acting attorney general in the case of recusal, the experts said.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trumps firing of FBI Director James Comey followed a turbulent year for Comey in which he became embroiled in controversy over his handling of investigations involving both Trump and former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Here is a timeline of the events that preceded Comeys firing and Trumps reaction to them. Comey announced he had recommended no criminal charges filed against Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for her handling of classified information while she was secretary of state but called her extremely careless for using a private email server. Trump responded to the news by tweeting that Comeys decision was an example of a rigged system in the United States. Very very unfair! As usual, bad judgment, he tweeted. Less than two weeks before the Nov. 8 presidential election, Comey announced in a letter to Congress that the FBI had learned of the existence of emails that appeared to pertain to the Clinton investigation and they would be reviewed whether they contained classified information.  The abrupt decision to renew the investigation upset Democrats who believed the announcement would have an impact on voting trends on Election Day and harm Clintons chances of victory. Campaigning in Michigan, Trump exulted at the news of a reopened probe into actions surrounding an opponent he had dubbed Crooked Hillary. That was so bad what happened originally, and it took guts for Director Comey to make the move that he made in light of the kind of opposition he had where theyre trying to protect her from criminal prosecution, Trump said. Two days after his inauguration, Trump was at an event in the White House and saw Comey in the audience. He called out to him and Comey strode up and they warmly shook hands and briefly embraced.   Hes become more famous than me, Trump said with a chuckle. Trump fired his national security adviser, Michael Flynn, after only 24 days in office after it was disclosed that Flynn had misled Vice President Mike Pence about the contacts he had with Russian ambassador to the United States Sergei Kislyak. Comey, in testimony before the House Intelligence Committee, said the FBI had been investigating possible coordination between the Trump presidential campaign and Russia. Clinton told a Women for Women event in New York that the Comey announcement threw the election for Trump. If the election had been onOct. 27, I would be your president, she said. Trump responded with a late-night series of tweets. FBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds! Trump tweeted. White House spokesman Sean Spicer was asked about Trumps tweet about Comey. The president has confidence in the director, Spicer told reporters. May 4, 2017 Comey, in testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, said it made him mildly nauseous to think his announcement of the reopening of an investigation into Clintons emails affected the 2016 presidential election, but he had no regrets and would make the same decision again.  In four hours of testimony Comey gave an impassioned defense of his decision to reopen the Clinton probe. May 8, 2017 ProPublica reported possible inaccuracies about Comeys statements about Clinton aide Huma Abedin. It said the FBI was said to be preparing to correct the record but that the plan appeared to be on hold with the bureau undecided about what to do. MIDAFTERNOON, May 9, 2017 At his afternoon daily briefing White House spokesman Sean Spicer was asked whether Trump still had confidence in Comey. Unlike his statement from a week earlier when he said Trump had confidence in Comey, Spicer equivocated. I dont want to start speaking on behalf of the president without speaking to him first, Spicer said. ABOUT 5:30 PM, May 9, 2017 In a brief appearance in the White House press room, Spicer announced Trump had accepted the recommendation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to fire Comey. A letter provided to the news media from Rosenstein cited Comeys handling of the Clinton probe. The New York Times reported Comey got the news while in Los Angeles where he had been addressing FBI employees there. When a TV in the background flashed the news, Comey at first thought it was a prank, but then got word he had been fired. At the FBI headquarters in Washington, Trump personal aide Keith Schiller was seen leaving the building. A White House official said he had delivered Trumps letter announcing Comeys dismissal.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The newly appointed second-in-command at the U.S. Justice Department faced a weighty task just two weeks after taking office - writing the rationale for firing FBI Director James Comey. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein argued the case for Comeys sacking in a three-page memo to Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Tuesday. President Donald Trump acted swiftly to dismiss the director later that day. Rosenstein cited Comeys controversial public statements about the bureaus investigation into Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clintons use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. It is a textbook example of what federal prosecutors and agents are taught not to do, Rosenstein wrote of Comeys public comments. Spokespeople for the Department of Justice and the FBI did not return calls seeking comment late Tuesday. Comeys firing will likely be seen as further evidence of Washingtons hyper-partisan upheaval. Rosenstein has drawn fire from Democrats who allege political motives in the White House decision to dismiss Comey - and particularly, its timing. Why did it happen today? asked Senate Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, of New York. We know the FBI has been looking into whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians ... Were those investigations getting too close to home for the President? The rationale for canning Comey, however, came from a 26-year Justice Department veteran who is widely viewed by his peers and many lawmakers as uncommonly nonpartisan. Named as Marylands top prosecutor by President George W. Bush, Rosenstein stayed in office through the Obama administration.  Rosenstein was the longest-serving U.S. attorney when he was nominated by Trump last January. When he was confirmed by the Senate, he enjoyed overwhelming bipartisan support - a 94-to-6 vote - despite the deeply divided culture of todays Washington. Bonnie Greenberg, a federal prosecutor in Maryland told Reuters in March that Rosenstein was admired as a rare career prosecutor who could insulate himself from political pressure. He only does something if he thinks its right, said Greenberg, who worked with Rosenstein for 11 years.  Many in the Justice Department saw Rosensteins appointment as a counter-balance to the extreme partisanship surrounding accusations of Russian interference in last years election. And he was immediately swept into that fray.  Before Rosenstein was confirmed for the position by the U.S. Senate, some Democratic lawmakers asked him to pledge he would appoint a special independent prosecutor to investigate allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials.  He was easily confirmed despite rebuffing those demands. Some Republicans have been angered by Comeys public statements about the FBI investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.  But Rosensteins criticism of Comey focused on actions seen to have damaged Democratic candidate Clinton. Rosenstein focused in particular on Comeys news conference last July, when the director announced his conclusion that Clinton should not be prosecuted - while at the same time publicly bashing her use of a private email server for sensitive U.S. government business. That day, Rosenstein wrote, Comey usurped the authority of the U.S. Attorney General - who has authority over whether prosecutions should proceed, based on the quality of FBI investigations. Comey also violated longstanding practice by gratuitously releasing damaging information about Clinton - even as he acknowledged the evidence against her was insufficient to warrant continued investigation, Rosenstein wrote. We do not hold press conferences to release derogatory information about the subject of a declined criminal investigation, Rosenstein wrote, adding that Comey laid out his version of the facts for the news media as if it were a closing argument, but without a trial.  U.S. Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the timing of Comeys firing was suspect - coming so long after the election of Trump and Comeys alleged mishandling of the case. He directly criticized Rosenstein.  I am very disappointed with this deputy attorney general, who I was told had a good reputation, he said. But signing this letter saying that he recommends firing Comey because of Comeys actions with Hillary Clinton nine months ago, or 10 months ago? That doesnt pass any smell test. Rosenstein, in his letter, cited broad, bipartisan agreement on Comeys errors in judgment. Last summer, Comey defended his decision to speak publicly about the Clinton investigation, saying the American people deserve those details in a case of intense public interest. Last week, before a Senate committee, Comey defended his decision in October - two weeks before the presidential election - to publicly announce the bureau had discovered new emails that might be related to the closed investigation into Clinton. To not speak about it would require an act of concealment in my view, Comey said. Rosenstein wrote that he was perplexed at Comeys continued defenses of his handling of the probe. I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken, Rosenstein wrote. It is one of the few issues that unites people of diverse perspectives.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The FBI was reeling after President Donald Trump unexpectedly fired its director James Comey, with agency staff scheduling an emergency high-level meeting for Tuesday night amid speculation about who would replace Comey in the top job. An FBI official, who was not authorized to speak to reporters and so asked not to be identified, said the staff meeting would explore next steps for the law-enforcement agency. Trump sacked Comey amidst a probe into the Trump 2016 presidential campaigns possible collusion with Russia to influence the election outcome, sparking backlash from some Democrats in Congress who said the decision had the appearance of a cover-up and some Republicans who called the timing troubling.  The official said the FBI had no idea the Trump administration was considering dismissing Comey and the news took even top officials by surprise. An FBI spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. Deputy Director Andrew McCabe was expected to step in for now, but he was unlikely to be nominated by Trump for the directors post, said two former FBI officials. Comey, who was appointed by former Democratic President Barack Obama, had 6-1/2 years left in his term as director of  an agency with 56 U.S. field offices and more than 30,000 employees.  The new director must be appointed by Trump and confirmed by the U.S. Senate.      Comey is the third high-profile law-enforcement official to be fired under Trump. Preet Bharara was fired as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York and Sally Yates was fired as acting attorney general. Trump, a Republican businessman and former TV celebrity, was elected on Nov. 8 and took office on Jan. 20. One possible contender for director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation is Dana Boente, No. 3 at the Justice Department and former acting attorney general, said the two former FBI officials. Other potential choices include Republican Representative Trey Gowdy, a former prosecutor who led a congressional inquiry into former secretary of state and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clintons role in the 2012 attacks on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya. Close campaign allies of Trump include former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, Sheriff David Clarke. But both men would be seen as highly political nominees for an agency designed to be independent. The White House has to avoid all the politicos if they are going to get a nominee through the Senate, said one of the former FBI officials.   Boente was tapped to temporarily lead the Justice Departments Trump-Russia investigation after Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a Trump appointee, stepped down because of his dealings with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak. Rod Rosenstein replaced Boente in that role when the Senate confirmed him as deputy attorney general last month. Rosenstein served as a federal prosecutor under both Republican President George W.

Democrats likened the dismissal to President Richard Nixons firing of an independent special prosecutor during the Watergate investigation and discounted Trumps contention that the move was related to the Federal Bureau of Investigation probe of the emails of Hillary Clinton, Trumps rival for the presidency. Some Republicans defended the firing, saying new leadership was needed at the law enforcement agency. Here are reactions from Democrats and Republicans to Comeys firing: No one should accept President Trumps absurd justification that he is now concerned that FBI Director Comey treated Secretary Clinton unfairly. ... This is nothing less than Nixonian. - Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy  Todays action by President Trump completely obliterates any semblance of an independent investigation into Russian efforts to influence our election and places our nation on the verge of a constitutional crisis. - Democratic Representative John Conyers  Given the recent controversies surrounding the director, I believe a fresh start will serve the FBI and the nation well. - Republican Senator Lindsey Graham  This is Nixonian. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein must immediately appoint a special counsel to continue the Trump/Russia investigation. -Democratic Senator Bob Casey  I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Director Comeys termination ... His dismissal, I believe, is a loss for the bureau and the nation. - Republican Senator Richard Burr, head of the Senate committee investigating Russia role in the election The decision ... raises profound questions about whether the White House is brazenly interfering in a criminal matter ... The same president who has called the investigation into the Russian hacking of our democracy and the potential complicity of his campaign a fake, cannot pretend to have made such a decision uninfluenced by his concerns over Comeys continued involvement in the investigation. - Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House committee looking into possible Russian connections Any suggestion that todays announcement is somehow an effort to stop the FBIs investigation of Russias attempt to influence the election last fall is misplaced. The president did not fire the entire FBI; he fired the director. - Republican Senator Susan Collins Earlier this afternoon, President Trump called me and informed me he was firing Director Comey. I told the president: Mr. President, with all due respect, you are making a big mistake ... Given the way the president has fired Director Comey, any person who he appoints to lead the Russia investigation will be concerned that he or she will meet the same fate as Director Comey if they run afoul of the administration. - Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer in remarks to reporters There is now a crisis of confidence at the Justice Department and President Trump is not being held accountable because House Republicans refuse to work with us to do our job. - Democratic Representative Elijah Cummings, who called for immediate emergency hearings Many, including myself, have questioned his actions more than once over the past year. I believe new leadership at the FBI will restore confidence in the organization and among the people who do the hard work to carry out its mission. - Republican Senator Roy Blunt in a statement The presidents actions today are shocking. ... The only way this administration can begin to demonstrate a commitment to the rule of law ... is to cooperate fully with the ongoing congressional investigations and to support the appointment of an independent special counsel. - Democratic Senator Mark Warner  This FBI director has sought for years to jail me on account of my political activities. If I can oppose his firing, so can you. - Fugitive former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, who leaked intelligence documents and is now living in Russia, on Twitter Over the course of the last several months, Director Comeys decisions on controversial matters have prompted concern from across the political spectrum and from career law enforcement experts. - Republican Senator Charles Grassley  There can be no question that a fully independent special counsel must be appointed to lead this (Russia) investigation. At this point, no one in Trumps chain of command can be trusted to carry out an impartial investigation. - Democratic Senator Ron Wyden on Twitter I find it deeply troubling that this decision comes a day after damning testimony by former acting Attorney General Sally Yates on Russias ties to the Trump campaign and just days before Comey was scheduled to appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee. - Independent Senator Bernie Sanders  It is essential that ongoing investigations are fulsome and free of political interference until their completion, and it is imperative that President Trump nominate a well-respected and qualified individual to lead the bureau at this critical time. - Republican Senator Bob Corker  James Comey is a man of honor and integrity ... I have long called for a special congressional committee to investigate Russias interference in the 2016 election. The presidents decision to remove the FBI director only confirms the need and the urgency of such a committee.  - Republican Senator John McCain  The need for a special prosecutor is now crystal clear. President Trump has catastrophically compromised the FBIs ongoing investigation of his own White Houses ties to Russia. Not since Watergate have our legal systems been so threatened. - Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal  Mr. Comey did not seem to understand some of the laws he was asked to investigate and unfortunately politicized his sensitive position as the FBI director. - Conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch FUN FACT: President Nixon never fired the Director of the FBI #FBIDirector #notNixonian - Official Twitter account of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

After a meeting of the Senate healthcare group, lawmakers were bombarded with questions as to why no women were named to the 13-man panel. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell tried to explain. The working group that counts is all 52 of us, McConnell told reporters, referring to all 52 Republican senators in the 100-member chamber. Nobody is being excluded based upon gender ... Everybodys at the table. Everybody. Democrats pounced. Republican men are negotiating a secret healthcare plan, which I really hope is not happening in the mens locker room, said Senator Patty Murray, a member of the Democratic leadership from Washington state.      If the criticism was any sign of what lies ahead as senators try to improve on a rollback bill passed on Thursday by House of Representatives Republicans, it could be a long road ahead. Dismantling the parts of President Barack Obamas signature healthcare law that they dislike and preserving other parts of it is proving to be a difficult task for President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans. A House of Representatives plan for doing that, approved last week amid much drama, faces an uncertain future in the Senate. Some Republicans eye drafting a similar Senate bill by mid-summer, possibly with the involvement of Democrats. Others indicate the House bill requires major surgery and that the effort to replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, could take months.  Regardless of timing, two decisive factors will come into sharper focus soon. One is voter reaction to the House bill, now being voiced in town hall events being hosted nationwide by House members in their home districts. The other factor is an expected analysis by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office of how many million Americans would lose their health insurance coverage under the House bill, if it became law, and how it would affect the U.S. budget deficit. Both the CBO analysis and the town hall events have the potential to do damage to the House legislation, which Trump hailed as a triumph just days ago. Senators are already talking about major changes in the House bill concerning Medicaid, the government healthcare program for the poor, and tax subsidies for healthcare coverage. Trying to get past the controversy over the absence of women on the healthcare panel, Senate Republicans said they expected to devote much time to healthcare in the near future.  I dont think were going to be talking about much else other than healthcare at least three days a week with all members of our conference present, said Senator John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican. Cornyn said senators would start with the House bill. If we have to make modifications in order to pass it, well make those modifications and work out the differences with the House. Medicaid was the topic at the Senate working group meeting  Tuesday. The House bill would cut federal spending on Medicaid by $880 billion over 10 years. But some Republicans want any reductions to be more gradual, and Trump made a campaign pledge not to cut the program. There ought to be a glide path where you do not have a cliff that the House provides in 2020, when the expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare is abruptly ended, said Senator Rob Portman of Ohio. But other Republicans said cutbacks were important to save taxpayer money. The public wants every dime you can give them. Lets face it, once you get them on the dole, they are going to take every dime they can.

The comment by Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah is the strongest sign yet of the daunting legislative challenge that lies ahead for the border adjustment tax, or BAT, a controversial House Republican proposal that has already divided the business community and Republicans in Congress. Hatchs finance committee, which consists of 14 Republicans and 12 Democrats, has oversight authority for tax policy and would need to approve any tax reform legislation considered in the Senate. Its going to be tough to pass. I dont think we can move it through the Finance Committee, the Utah Republican told reporters after discussing the BAT proposal at a meeting with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Hatch said the administration also opposes BAT: Theyre against that ... if I interpret it correctly. The proposal, which would exempt U.S. export revenues from federal taxation but impose a flat 20 percent tax on imports, is strongly backed by House Speaker Paul Ryan and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady. Neither Ryans office nor Bradys had an immediate comment on Hatchs remarks. If the House approved BAT but the Senate excluded it from legislation, House Republicans would need to use bicameral negotiations to get it included in final legislation for President Donald Trumps signature. House Republicans have billed border adjustment as a way to meet Trumps pledge to create jobs at home while preventing American companies from moving manufacturing jobs and production facilities overseas. But it has divided U.S. business by drawing enthusiastic support from exporters and fierce opposition from import-dependent industries, leaving many Republican lawmakers wary of the proposal. Republican supporters say BAT is needed to pay for steep business tax cuts, citing independent analyses that estimate it would raise more than $1 trillion over a decade. Administration officials have called for financing tax cuts with future economic growth. Some lawmakers have suggested deficit-financed tax cuts instead.        We have to raise revenue, Hatch said.

Many Republican lawmakers, along with President Donald Trump, have expressed support for more oil drilling, coal mining and other energy projects on Native American reservations, which are overseen by the federal government. Several additional layers of regulatory bureaucracy have slowed those efforts. I think we will be able to get the bill through the House this go around, Republican Senator John Hoeven of North Dakota, who authored the bill with seven other Republican Senators, said in a recent interview with Reuters.  He said he believed the bill also had the support of a broad spectrum of tribes across the country and would empower Native Americans. The bill, dubbed the Tribal Energy Development and Self Determination Act, would authorize tribes to conduct their own energy resource appraisals. It would streamline the permitting process for drilling and mining and provide incentives for tribes to enter into joint-venture agreements with private companies. Former President Barack Obama had opposed a previous House version of thebill in 2015 because it would have exempted tribes from some federal environmental regulations. Other versions were blocked after being rolled into broader bills that were defeated. Tribal lands cover just 2 percent of the nations surface but by some estimates contain as much as a fifth of all remaining U.S. oil and gas reserves. But clearing regulatory hurdles for a single project on tribal lands can take as many as 50 steps, compared to a half dozen on private property, according to Reuters interviews conducted in January with tribal leaders, lawyers, oil company executives and federal regulators. Hoeven and Montana Republican Senator Steve Daines joined around a dozen representatives of mineral-rich tribes for a meeting with White House officials last week to discuss ways to reduce those barriers. Tribal participants at the meeting included representatives of the Crow Agency of Montana, the Three Affiliated Tribes of North Dakota, the Navajo Nation and the Southern Ute Indian tribe of Colorado - all tribes that currently produce oil, gas or coal. We are just trying to amplify our opportunities, change the narrative of Indian country, and establish access to the administration, said C.J. Stewart, a representative of the Crow.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Eight Democratic senators asked U.S. regulators on Tuesday to launch an investigation into billionaire Carl Icahns activities in the U.S. biofuels blending credit market, saying the activist investor may have violated trading laws since becoming an adviser to President Donald Trump. We are writing to request that your agencies investigate whether Carl Icahn violated insider trading laws, anti-market manipulation laws, or any other relevant laws based on his recent actions in the market for renewable fuel credits, the senators said in a letter to the heads of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency. The letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, was signed by Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and five others. The agencies are not required to act on it.  Efforts to reach Icahn for comment were not immediately successful. There have been months of public outcry from Democratic lawmakers and liberal watchdog groups concerned that Icahns dual role as a high-powered investor and presidential adviser could lead to conflicts of interest. Trump, a Republican, named Icahn as an unpaid adviser on regulation shortly after Novembers election, saying the choice could help him slash red tape and bolster economic growth.  In February, Icahn submitted a proposal to the White House to change the U.S. biofuels program in a way that would ease its regulatory burden on oil refining companies, already struggling with low profit margins. Icahn owns a majority stake in refining company CVR Energy Inc (CVI.N). The White House is considering the proposal. An administration official did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. A Reuters review of securities filings last month showed that CVR had accumulated a large short position in biofuels blending credits, called Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs, which many refiners are required to purchase under the biofuels law. That meant the company would have been in a strong position to profit if RIN prices fell. In their letter, the senators pointed out that RIN prices dropped sharply in late February after Icahns proposal on the biofuels regulation was reported. We have no way of knowing at this time whether Mr. Icahn made any of his renewable fuel credit trades or decisions about trades based on material, non-public information or otherwise manipulated the market, the senators wrote.  But the publicly available evidence is troubling, and based on this evidence, we ask that your agencies investigate whether Mr. Icahns conduct violated any laws under your jurisdiction, they said. Icahn previously dismissed accusations that his proposal to the White House to change the biofuels program was self-serving, saying the overhaul would help other refining companies too, including his competitors.  CVR Energy shares fell 0.4 percent to $22.20 on Tuesday. A CVR spokesman declined to comment. Shares in Icahns investment firm, Icahn Enterprises (IEP.O), fell 4.3 percent to $50.82. Icahn, 81, has spent decades doing battle with major companies as an activist investor, and has amassed a fortune that Forbes Magazine pegs above $20 billion. In recent years, he built up an 82 percent stake in CVR, making him a player in the niche biofuels market. Carl Icahn is not shy, and he knows his voice and his actions as special adviser can influence the RIN markets, said Tyson Slocum of Public Citizen, a liberal watchdog group that has already asked Congress to investigate whether Icahn had violated any lobbying disclosure laws. The real issue is did Carl Icahn use his position as special adviser to unduly impact the RIN market and then make corresponding bets on those moves, Slocum said.  CVR Energys refining unit (CVRR.N) posted a net gain of $6.4 million associated with the biofuel credits market in the first quarter of 2017, a $50 million turnaround from the year-ago period when CVR shelled out $43.1 million, the company said in a filing. The U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard, overseen by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, requires increasing volumes of biofuels to be blended into the nations gasoline and diesel every year. It places that responsibility mainly on refiners, who are required to blend the fuel themselves or purchase credits from others that do it for them. Icahns proposal had called for regulators to shift the responsibility for blending from refiners, many of which lack sufficient blending capacity, to terminal operators.  A number of biofuels groups oppose the proposed change, saying it could undermine the Renewable Fuel Standard by making it more complicated, since there are many times more terminal operators than refining companies.  Moving the point of obligation would require a dramatic increase in the staff required to track this at EPA, all while delivering poorer supervision, increasing the complexity of the program, and ultimately higher costs for American drivers, said Growth Energy Chief Executive Emily Skor.

We ask the senators from both parties to pass the best negotiated package they can, and then we will take up their work in the House, the group said in a statement.  The package, which includes tax hikes, pension changes and a local property tax freeze, stalled in the Democratic-led Senate in March, when most Republicans withdrew their support. John Patterson, a spokesman for Senate President John Cullerton, said on Tuesday both sides are trading ideas in trying to find agreement. Illinois is limping toward the June 30 end of a second-straight fiscal year without a complete budget due to a standoff between its Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature. Lawmakers face a May 31 deadline to pass budget bills with simple majority votes. The bipartisan House statement surfaced after House Speaker Michael Madigan on Monday urged Governor Bruce Rauner to restart budget negotiations and appointed four top Democrats from his chamber to work on a deal. Meanwhile, the Chicago-based Civic Federation, a nonpartisan government finance watchdog, released a report on Tuesday calling for an end to piecemeal funding that has kept the nations fifth-largest state operating. The governor and General Assembly need to end this unacceptable stalemate by passing and enacting a comprehensive plan, Civic Federation President Laurence Msall said in a statement. Cherry-picking certain areas of government to fund while pledging to work toward a complete budget sometime in the abstract future has not and will not end the crisis and in fact is making it worse. Illinois reliance on continuing appropriations, court-ordered spending and partial budgets has ballooned an unpaid bill backlog from $9.1 billion at the end of fiscal 2016 to more than $13 billion in fiscal 2017. Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza told a Senate committee on Tuesday that late payment penalties owed to vendors total about $800 million. Eleni Demertzis, a Rauner spokeswoman, said the governor continues to push for a truly balanced budget with structural reforms.  Major rating agencies, which have pushed Illinois down the credit scale six times since Rauner took office in January 2015, have indicated the states triple-B bond ratings could fall closer to junk in the absence of a fiscal fix.

Trump, who wants to boost the U.S. coal industry, is expected to announce in the coming days whether he will scrap an accord for which his predecessor campaigned. Just over three months after leaving office, Obama told a food industry conference in Milan that climate change was a challenge that will define the contours of this century more dramatically, perhaps, than any other.

Because of current debate in Washington, it could be that policies move more slowly but I am confident that the United States will continue to move in the right direction, he said.

Yates testified at a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing that focused primarily on Flynn, and did not shed much light on other aspects of investigations of allegations that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. election and whether there was collusion between President Donald Trumps campaign and Moscow. Yates repeatedly declined to discuss details of the investigation in a public forum. Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who also testified, said he stood by past assertions that he had not seen evidence of such collusion but also declined to comment on classified matters. Yates briefly led the U.S. Justice Department until Trump fired her on Jan. 30 for declining to defend his travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries. She told White House counsel Don McGahn on Jan. 26, less than a week into Trumps presidency, that Flynn had not been telling the truth about his contacts with Russias ambassador to Washington. Making her first public statements about the issue, Yates said she feared Moscow could try to blackmail Flynn because it also knew he had not been truthful about conversations he had with Ambassador Sergei Kislyak about U.S. sanctions on Russia. Flynn, a retired general once seen as a potential Trump vice president, has emerged as a central figure in the Russian probes. Russia has repeatedly denied any meddling in the election and the Trump administration denies allegations of collusion with Russia.                  Yates told the hearing she had been concerned that the national security adviser essentially could be blackmailed by the Russians. Logic would tell you that you dont want the national security adviser to be in a position where the Russians have leverage over him, she said. Trump, who continued to praise Flynn, waited 18 days after Yates warning before Flynns forced resignation for failing to disclose the content of his talks with Kislyak and then misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations.  Several Democratic senators questioned Trumps delay. Yates said that in her meetings, McGahn demonstrated that he understood this was serious. .. If nothing was done, certainly that would be concerning. During that section of the hearing, Clapper described as accurate a report in the Guardian newspaper that British intelligence officials became aware in late 2015 about suspicious interactions between Trump advisers and Russian agents, and that the information was passed on to U.S. intelligence agencies. Yes, it is (accurate), and its also quite sensitive, Clapper said. Yates was a holdover from the administration of President Barack Obama. Obama had warned Trump, then president-elect, not to give the post of national security adviser in his administration to Flynn just after the Republicans surprise victory in the Nov. 8 election, a former Obama aide said.     The warning, first reported by NBC News, came up during a discussion of White House personnel. White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters Obama had communicated concerns about Flynn. It shouldnt come as a surprise to anyone, given that General Flynn had worked for President Obama, was an outspoken critic of President Obamas shortcomings, Spicer said.     Obama pushed Flynn out in 2014 from his job as director of the militarys Defense Intelligence Agency, or DIA. Congressional committees began investigating after U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered hacking of Democratic political groups to try to sway the election toward Trump. The main investigations are being conducted by congressional Intelligence Committees, although Democrats have clamored for a special prosecutor or independent committee. They argue that congressional committees are too partisan to conduct credible probes. After Mondays hearing, Trump took to Twitter to bash the media and deny any collusion. Director Clapper reiterated what everybody, including the fake media already knows- there is no evidence of collusion w/ Russia and Trump, he said. And in another tweet, the president seemed to denounce the hearings. The Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end? he asked. FBI Director James Comey testified in the House on March 20 that the agency was investigating potential links between Trump associates and Moscows attempts to tilt the election. Trump had also used Twitter before the hearing to insinuate that Yates had leaked information on Flynn to the media. Yates and Clapper both swore under oath that they had never leaked classified information. Questioning on Monday often broke along party lines.     Some Republicans veered away from Russia to focus on issues such as whether the Obama administration had improperly revealed the names of Trump associates contained in surveillance records.  Senator John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, was one of a handful who grilled Yates about her objections to Trumps travel ban. Trump fired Yates after she defied the White House on the travel ban, a policy that Trump said would help protect Americans from Islamist militants.

President Donald Trump has pledged to do a big number on the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law, which raised banks capital requirements, restricted their ability to make speculative bets with customers money and created consumer protections in the wake of the financial crisis. In February, Trump ordered Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to review the law and report back within 120 days, saying his administration expected to be cutting large parts of it.  But the Treasury Department is still filling vacancies after the transition from the Obama administration and there are not  enough officials to get the full review done by early June, three sources said. A Treasury spokesperson dismissed the idea the report that would be broken up because the department is short-handed, saying the reach of the project could require several separate reports, as permitted under the executive order. Treasury has an entire team dedicated to reviewing the financial regulatory rules and will begin reporting our findings to the president in June, the department spokesperson said. Given the volume and scope of the issues we are reviewing that involve potential changes to the financial regulatory system, we are carefully considering the best options to begin rolling them out in the most effective and responsible manner, the spokesperson said. The Treasury Department will first report back on what banking rules could be changed, including capital requirements, restrictions on leverage and speculative trading. Examinations of capital markets, clearing houses and derivatives as well as the insurance and asset management industries and financial innovation and banking technology will come later, the sources said. It could be several months until these other stages of the financial reform review are completed, some of the sources said.  The piecemeal approach could create challenges for some sectors if parts of the report are significantly delayed. The report has been highly anticipated, as it marks the new administrations most detailed foray into outlining what it wants to do with financial rules. Trump previously has spoken only in broad terms about easing regulation surrounding lending.    Any efforts to rework existing regulations or craft new legislation will be a lengthy and contentious process, something that banking lobbyists have said will make any delay to the administrations initial findings costly for businesses eager for regulatory relief. Former BlackRock Inc executive Craig Phillips is leading the administrations plan for financial deregulation. Alongside other Treasury officials, he is soliciting feedback from banking industry groups and executives for how banking policy should be shaped. The change in the timing of the Treasury report comes after Trump ordered a separate review of some key planks of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law. In April, Trump signed a pair of executive orders directing a review of two additional regulatory powers - orderly liquidation authority, which allows regulators to step in and wind down a failing financial institution, and systemic designation, in which certain large firms may be deemed critical to the overall health of the financial system, meriting stricter oversight.  The findings from those reviews are not expected until October. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

But three Republican appointees on the Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals seemed to lean toward the administration, asking whether the president should be second-guessed when it comes to protecting the countrys borders and whether the plaintiffs bringing the suit had been sufficiently harmed by the order during arguments before 13 judges.  Based on the judges questions, a ruling could hinge on whether the appeals court agrees with a lower court judge that past statements by Trump about the need to prevent Muslims from entering the United States should be taken into account. That would be bad news for a young administration seeking victory on one of its first policy changes. This is not a Muslim ban, Acting Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall, arguing for the government, told the judges during the hearing that lasted two hours, twice as long as scheduled. Judge Robert King, named by Democratic former President Bill Clinton, told Wall that Trump has never retracted previous comments about wanting to impose a ban on Muslims.  Hes never repudiated what he said about the Muslim ban, King said, referring to Trumps campaign promise for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.   Wall told the judges past legal precedent holds that the court should not look behind the text of the Trumps executive order, which does not mention any specific religion, to get at its motivations. He warned that despite the heated and passionate political debate about the ban, there was a need to be careful not to set legal precedent that would open the door to broader questioning of presidential decision making on security matters. Judge Paul Niemeyer, appointed by Republican former President George H.W. Bush, told Omar Jadwat, the American Civil Liberties Union lawyer representing the plaintiffs who challenged the order, that they were asking the court to rule on a presidents national security judgments.   You have the judiciary supervising and assessing how the executive is carrying out his office, Niemeyer said, pressing Jadwat, who seemed to stumble at times after pointed questioning by the judges. I just dont know where this stops. The revised travel ban was challenged in Maryland by refugee organizations and individuals who said they were being discriminated against because they were Muslim and because they had family members adversely affected by the ban. They argue the order violated federal immigration law and a section of the U.S. Constitutions First Amendment barring the government from favoring or disfavoring a particular religion. The administration appealed a March 15 ruling by Maryland-based federal judge Theodore Chuang that put the ban on hold just a day before it was due to go into effect. The arguments marked the latest legal test for Trumps ban, which also was blocked by federal judge Derrick Watson in Hawaii in a separate legal challenge. An earlier version of the ban was also blocked by the courts. Chuang, in Maryland, blocked the part of Trumps order relating to travel by people from the six countries. Watson, in Hawaii, also blocked another part of the order that suspended the entry of refugees into the United States for four months. To a packed audience in the ornate pre-Civil War era courthouse, Judge Pamela Harris said Trumps action clearly had a disparate impact on Muslims, asking, How is this neutral in its operation as to Muslims? Judge Barbara Keenan, who like Harris was appointed by Democratic former President Barack Obama, said the order could affect some 200 million people. Regardless of how the 13 judges rule, the matter is likely to be decided ultimately by the U.S. Supreme Court. The full 4th Circuit took up the appeal but two Republican-appointed judges did not participate. That left nine judges appointed by Democratic presidents, three Republican appointees and one judge originally appointed by a Democrat and later re-appointed by a Republican. It was unclear when the court would rule. Trump issued the March executive order after federal courts blocked an earlier version, issued on Jan. 27 a week after he took office, that also had included Iraq among the nations targeted. That order, which went into effect immediately, triggered chaos and protests at airports and in several cities before being put on hold due to legal challenges. The second order was intended to overcome the legal problems posed by the original ban. The administrations appeal in the Hawaii case will be heard in Seattle on May 15 by a three-judge panel of the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The three judges assigned all are Democratic appointees. Wall said the temporary ban was intended to give the government time to evaluate whether people from the six countries were being subjected to adequate vetting to ensure they did not pose a security threat to the United States. But he said the administration had not been able to proceed on all the work it wanted to do because of the litigation, noting we have put our pens down.

Speaking in an interview, Rice also described Trump as having a somewhat transactional view of foreign relations but she broadly endorsed his approach of seeking to enlist Chinas help to get North Korea to rein in its nuclear program. Asked about Trump lashing out at judges when rulings go against him and describing the media as the enemy of the people, Rice replied: Its language that I would prefer not to hear. But I dont think that you can erode the scaffolding of democracy in the United States, she added during a tour to promote her book Democracy: Stories from the Long Road to Freedom.  Rice, national security adviser and secretary of state under Republican former President George W. Bush, is now a professor at Stanford University. She described U.S. institutions as very strong and said Trump may have even found himself a bit surprised by how constraining that scaffolding really is. Courts have blocked parts of two Trump executive orders that sought to temporarily ban entry to the United States for people from six Muslim-majority countries. In a 30-minute interview, Rice said the United States needed to find a way to punish Russia for its alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. election but without engaging in tit-for-tat retaliation by meddling in Russian elections. She suggested prosecuting anyone in the United States who took part in what intelligence agencies believe was a deliberate effort to sway the presidential election in Trumps favor, and to consider putting sanctions, such as visa bans, on people who did so from abroad. Rice, who has interspersed periods in public service with  academic posts, suggested Trump, a New York real estate magnate, may see foreign policy more in terms of striking deals than finding common interests. Before meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping last month, Trump suggested China might get better trade deals with the United States if it put more pressure on North Korea to restrain its nuclear and missile programs. The president still has a kind of transactional view of international politics but, in fact, interests are more enduring than transactions, Rice said. However, Rice endorsed Trumps policy of trying to enlist Chinese help against North Korea, which is believed to have conducted five nuclear tests since 2006 and to be developing intercontinental ballistic missiles that could strike the U.S. mainland. China, the Norths main trading partner and the closest thing it has to an ally, has historically been unwilling to tighten the economic screws on Pyongyang for fear of triggering a collapse and sending millions of refugees across the border. Rice said the U.S. task was to convince the Chinese that they had to choose between doing really hard things to bring this regime into line or we will have to do harsh things. The former secretary of state also said North Koreas current leader, Kim Jong Un, is far less predictable than his father, Kim Jong Il, and may not be fully rational. Kim Jong Un is far more reckless than his father ... I wonder if he is not a little unhinged, she said. I wonder if the Chinese arent beginning to reconsider their view that ... a stable North Korean regime, even if it is nuclear-armed, is better than an unstable one.

The Texas measure comes as Republican U.S. President Donald Trump has made combating illegal immigration a priority. Texas, which has an estimated 1.5 million illegal immigrants and the longest border with Mexico of any U.S. state, has been at the forefront of the immigration debate. As governor, my top priority is public safety, and this bill furthers that objective by keeping dangerous criminals off our streets, Abbott said in a statement.The law will take effect on Sept. 1. The Republican-dominated legislature passed the bill on party-line votes and sent the measure to Abbott earlier this month. It would punish local authorities who do not abide by requests to cooperate with federal immigration agents. Police officials found to be in violation of the law could face removal from office, fines and up to a year in prison if convicted. The measure also allows police to ask people about their immigration status during a lawful detention, even for minor infractions like jaywalking. Any anti-sanctuary city measure may face a tough road after a federal judge in April blocked Trumps executive order seeking to withhold funds from local authorities that do not use their resources to advance federal immigration laws. Democrats have warned the measure could lead to unconstitutional racial profiling and civil rights groups have promised to fight the Texas measure in court. This legislation is bad for Texas and will make our communities more dangerous for all, the police chiefs of cities including Houston and Dallas wrote in an opinion piece in the Dallas Morning News in late April.  They said immigration was a federal obligation and the law would stretch already meager resources by turning local police into immigration agents. The police chiefs said the measure would widen a gap between police and immigrant communities, creating a class of silent victims and eliminating the potential for assistance from immigrants in solving or preventing crimes. One of the sponsors of the bill, Republican state Representative Charlie Geren, said in House debate the bill would have no effect on immigrants in the country illegally if they had not committed a crime.  He also added there were no sanctuary cities in Texas at present and the measure would prevent any from emerging. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former Acting U.S. Attorney General Sally Yates said on Monday she warned the White House in January that then-national security adviser Michael Flynn had been compromised and could have been vulnerable to blackmail by Russia. Yates testified at a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing that focused primarily on Flynn, and did not shed much light on other aspects of investigations of allegations that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. election and whether there was collusion between President Donald Trumps campaign and Moscow. Yates repeatedly declined to discuss details of the investigation in a public forum. Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who also testified, said he stood by past assertions that he had not seen evidence of such collusion but also declined to comment on classified matters. Yates briefly led the U.S. Justice Department until Trump fired her on Jan. 30 for declining to defend his travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries. She told White House counsel Don McGahn on Jan. 26, less than a week into Trumps presidency, that Flynn had not been telling the truth about his contacts with Russias ambassador to Washington. Making her first public statements about the issue, Yates said she feared Moscow could try to blackmail Flynn because it also knew he had not been truthful about conversations he had with Ambassador Sergei Kislyak about U.S. sanctions on Russia. Flynn, a retired general once seen as a potential Trump vice president, has emerged as a central figure in the Russian probes. Russia has repeatedly denied any meddling in the election and the Trump administration denies allegations of collusion with Russia.                  Yates told the hearing she had been concerned that the national security adviser essentially could be blackmailed by the Russians. Logic would tell you that you dont want the national security adviser to be in a position where the Russians have leverage over him, she said. Trump, who continued to praise Flynn, waited 18 days after Yates warning before Flynns forced resignation for failing to disclose the content of his talks with Kislyak and then misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations.  Several Democratic senators questioned Trumps delay. Yates said that in her meetings, McGahn demonstrated that he understood this was serious. .. If nothing was done, certainly that would be concerning. During that section of the hearing, Clapper described as accurate a report in the Guardian newspaper that British intelligence officials became aware in late 2015 about suspicious interactions between Trump advisers and Russian agents, and that the information was passed on to U.S. intelligence agencies. Yes, it is (accurate), and its also quite sensitive, Clapper said. Yates was a holdover from the administration of President Barack Obama. Obama had warned Trump, then president-elect, not to give the post of national security adviser in his administration to Flynn just after the Republicans surprise victory in the Nov. 8 election, a former Obama aide said.     The warning, first reported by NBC News, came up during a discussion of White House personnel. White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters Obama had communicated concerns about Flynn. It shouldnt come as a surprise to anyone, given that General Flynn had worked for President Obama, was an outspoken critic of President Obamas shortcomings, Spicer said.     Obama pushed Flynn out in 2014 from his job as director of the militarys Defense Intelligence Agency, or DIA. Congressional committees began investigating after U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered hacking of Democratic political groups to try to sway the election toward Trump. The main investigations are being conducted by congressional Intelligence Committees, although Democrats have clamored for a special prosecutor or independent committee. They argue that congressional committees are too partisan to conduct credible probes. After Mondays hearing, Trump took to Twitter to bash the media and deny any collusion. Director Clapper reiterated what everybody, including the fake media already knows- there is no evidence of collusion w/ Russia and Trump, he said. And in another tweet, the president seemed to denounce the hearings. The Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end? he asked. FBI Director James Comey testified in the House on March 20 that the agency was investigating potential links between Trump associates and Moscows attempts to tilt the election. Trump had also used Twitter before the hearing to insinuate that Yates had leaked information on Flynn to the media. Yates and Clapper both swore under oath that they had never leaked classified information. Questioning on Monday often broke along party lines.     Some Republicans veered away from Russia to focus on issues such as whether the Obama administration had improperly revealed the names of Trump associates contained in surveillance records.  Senator John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, was one of a handful who grilled Yates about her objections to Trumps travel ban. Trump fired Yates after she defied the White House on the travel ban, a policy that Trump said would help protect Americans from Islamist militants.

The two-tower luxury apartment complex in New Jersey, One Journal Square, is being developed by KABR Group and the Kushner Companies, which until recently was headed by senior White House advisor Jared Kushner, the husband of Trumps daughter Ivanka. The developers are seeking to raise $150 million, or 15.4 percent of funding for the project, from investors through the EB-5 visa program, according to marketing materials posted by the events organizer, immigration agency Qiaowai. The controversial EB-5 program allows wealthy foreigners to, in effect, buy U.S. immigration visas for themselves and families by investing at least $500,000 in certain development projects. Sorry, this is a private event, said a man stopping journalists from entering a function room at the Four Seasons Hotel in Shanghai. Guests at the event said Kushners sister, Nicole Kushner Meyer, spoke for about 10 minutes, including about her familys humble roots. According to the New York Times, Meyer attended a similar event in Beijing on Saturday and told the audience of about 100 people the project means a lot to me and my entire family. Jared Kushner, whose White House portfolio includes relations with China, sold his stake in Kushner Companies to a family trust early this year.  Mr. Kushner has no involvement in the operation of Kushner Companies and divested his interests in the One Journal Square project by selling them to a family trust that he, his wife, and his children are not beneficiaries of, a mechanism suggested by the Office of Government Ethics, his lawyer, Blake Roberts of WilmerHale law firm, said in a statement emailed to Reuters by the White House. As previously stated, he will recuse from particular matters concerning the EB-5 visa program. A Kushner Companies spokeswoman declined to comment in a New York Times article about the Beijing event published on Saturday. The Times story said Meyer did not respond when asked if she was concerned about possible conflicts of interest facing her brother. Journalists from the Times and Washington Post were removed from Saturdays Beijing event, the newspapers reported. One potential investor, Sophie Xing, said a very important factor in her decision to attend Sundays event was the fact the project was a Kushner Companies investment and that Trumps son-in-laws sister would be in Shanghai. Actually I really dont know how close they are but I felt that this was a pretty good project, she said. In a promotional text message seen by Reuters, Qiaowai made note of Meyers relationship to Trump and called her the events heavyweight honored guest. Qiaowai representatives at the event declined to answer questions from journalists, and calls to its listed phone number went unanswered. Qiaowai is also known as QWOS. Its promotional materials for the project, which it also calls Kushner1, advertise the prospect of putting money in under the federal EB-5 program. The program is popular among wealthy Chinese looking to shift assets abroad or move overseas, but it has come under fire in the United States. Some U.S. lawmakers have called for changing or abolishing  the EB-5 program, but the scheme was recently renewed by Congress until Sept. 30. Potential investor Xing said a Kushner representative who spoke on Sunday stressed that EB-5 rules could change after September to raise the minimum required investment. Another person who attended Sundays event, Liu Guoqi, was mindful of the potential rule change. Liu said he had been to previous pitches for EB-5 investments but had concerns about the risks. The whole thing may change later this year so we feel that there isnt much time left, he said. In the United States, the EB-5 program has also sparked concerns about possible scams. Some immigrants have been burned by misrepresentations made about the program by promoters, both inside and outside the United States. Many have lost not only their money but their chance at winning U.S. citizenship. Trump has vowed to clamp down on illegal immigration. In addition to Beijing and Shanghai, the road show for One Journal Square was scheduled to visit the Chinese cities of Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Wuhan, according to Qiaowais marketing materials online. It calls the Kushner family a famous real estate clan, and touts EB-5 immigration as peace of mind. Qiaowais Chinese-language marketing material describes the project as supported by the government, created by a star developer, and says the project is its 87th EB-5 program.

As the Senate begins to wrestle with a Republican healthcare bill narrowly approved by the House of Representatives last week, senators questioned why the 13-member working group put together by Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell does not include any of the chambers five Republican women. Womens health is a big part of this and women are a majority of the population, and their health interests deserve to be contemplated in any reform, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of California said on NBCs Meet the Press. Democratic Senator Patty Murray of Washington wrote on Twitter: It matters to have women at the table  and it matters when they arent. Republicans pushed their healthcare restructuring through the House on a 217-213 vote, handing President Donald Trump his first major legislative success. But the bill faces an uncertain future in the Senate, where Republicans have a narrow majority and several members have suggested they will develop their own plans. Democrats are united in opposition to the House bill. Trump pledged on Sunday that the effort to gut former President Barack Obamas signature healthcare law would be successful. Republican Senators will not let the American People down!, he wrote on Twitter. ObamaCare premiums and deductibles are way up-it was a lie and it is dead! The Senates healthcare working group includes the Republican leadership, several committee chairmen and a combination of conservatives such as Ted Cruz of Texas and more moderate Republicans from politically important swing states such as Rob Portman of Ohio and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania. Critics said the groups lack of diversity would eliminate crucial viewpoints. The GOP is crafting policy on an issue that directly impacts women without including a single woman in the process. Its wrong, Democratic Senator Kamala Harris of California wrote on Twitter on Saturday. Don Stewart, a senior aide to McConnell, said critics were getting hung up on process while ignoring the problems of Obamacare such as higher costs and limited choices. So you can get caught up in process, or you can focus on the actual reality, Stewart said in an email on Sunday. Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine, who has been working on her own healthcare plan, said she was reaching out to moderate Democrats to try to find common ground. She did not criticize the working groups all-male make-up but said she wanted to see a broader effort to replace Obamas 2010 healthcare law. I would like to see us put together a bipartisan group to solve this problem, of Democrats who acknowledge there are problems with the current law, that it is not working well in several states, and Republicans who also want to make sure that were not reducing coverage and were giving flexibility, Collins said on ABCs This Week. Senators have questioned aspects of the House bill, which would slash funding for Medicaid, the program that provides insurance for the poor, and roll back much of its expansion during the Obama administration. It also would allow states to opt out of some existing protections for people with pre-existing health conditions. While insurers could not deny insurance because of such conditions, they would be allowed to decide how much to charge. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, one of the most moderate Democrats in the Senate, said his state gets absolutely slammed in the House bill because it has a lot of elderly residents and people with pre-existing conditions. I just want to work and sit down and try to get something done, but no ones asked us, he said on CBSs Face the Nation program. Our congressional delegation says, dont worry, the Senate will fix it. And no one has asked any Democrat. And I am the most centrist. White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said the White House would not dictate the process. I think we want to let them do their work, let them work this out. They are all very mature. They all know what is going on. They all know the commitments we have made to the American people to repeal and replace a failing program in Obamacare, he said on the Fox News Sunday program.

Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination last year, also said the Senate should use the Australian system as a model while crafting an alternative to Republican healthcare legislation that Trump endorses. President Trump is right. The Australian healthcare system provides healthcare to all of its people at a fraction of the cost than we do, Sanders commented on Twitter. The tweet was accompanied by a short video that set out the virtues of Australias universal healthcare system, saying it guarantees better service to all Australians at about half the cost of U.S. healthcare. The video also noted that Australians can expect to live longer than Americans, on average.  Sanders tweet came two days after Trump told Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in New York: You have better healthcare than we do. The presidents comment raised eyebrows, coming just after the U.S. House of Representatives had approved a Trump-backed bill that would overturn much of former President Barack Obamas signature healthcare law and move the U.S. system further away from universal coverage. The White House later said Trump was simply being nice to an ally and does not think the United States should adopt Australias healthcare approach.    The healthcare legislation that Trump endorses would pare back insurance protections for the sick, and, according to nonpartisan congressional researchers, would lead to 24 million more Americans being without health coverage by 2026. But the bills approval in the House on Thursday sent the legislation to the Senate, where it has little support. We will take this pathetic healthcare bill, throw it in the garbage can and do something that will work for ordinary Americans instead, Sanders said in a second Saturday tweet.

Miller, a partner at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius in New York, has in recent weeks spoken with officials in the U.S. Department of Justice and the White House as well as members of Congress about the job, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity about the private discussions. The administrations interest in Miller for the prestigious post has not been previously reported. Edward McNally, a partner at Kasowitz Benson Torres, has been viewed as the leading candidate among at least four people said to have been under consideration, according to sources and media reports. It is not clear who is now favored to get the position, which requires the Presidents nomination and is subject to confirmation by the Senate. Spokespeople for Morgan Lewis, Kasowitz and the Department of Justice declined to comment. The White House did not respond to questions about Miller as a candidate. U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York is considered one of the most important posts in the U.S. justice system. It entails overseeing more than 200 prosecutors handling high-profile cases ranging from terrorism to wrongdoing on Wall Street, cyber attacks and corruption. In addition to Wall Street cases, whoever is chosen will inherit the offices investigation into a scandal at Fox News Channel over payments to settle sexual harassment claims and the prosecution of a Turkish gold trader in a politically charged case that has angered Turkeys president Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Miller, 43, was an assistant U.S. attorney under Bharara from 2009 to 2014. During that time he was on a team of prosecutors involved in the offices crackdown on insider trading and was lead counsel in prosecutions of narcotics-related cases, as well as mail fraud and embezzlement schemes. Bhararas former deputy Joon Kim is currently acting Manhattan U.S. Attorney. Bharara was fired in March after refusing to resign along with 45 other U.S. attorneys from the Obama administration. The dismissal was a surprise because Bharara was asked by Trump in November to stay on. Bharara had built a strong reputation as Wall Streets top cop and for going after political corruption, regardless of party. Both Millers and McNallys law firms have ties to U.S. President Donald Trump. Sheri Dillon, a partner at Morgan Lewis, took part in  Trumps January news conference on his plans to avoid conflicts of interest.Kasowitz has handled various cases for Trump for more than a decade and David Friedman, a former name partner at the firm, was confirmed in March as U.S. ambassador to Israel. Miller and McNally are both Republicans. Before his stint under Bharara, Miller served as a trial attorney in the Justice Departments counterterrorism section and as assistant general counsel for the Central Intelligence Agency. While at the CIA, he assisted in prosecuting Lewis Scooter Libby, who was found guilty of lying and obstructing a probe into who blew the cover of a CIA officer in a case that fueled debate over the Iraq war. Millers former and current colleagues described him as a talented, by-the-book lawyer who - if chosen - could be expected to protect the offices culture of independence.   David Miller would be a fine choice, said Carrie Cohen, a partner at Morrison Foerster whose time as a prosecutor in Manhattan overlapped with Millers. Appointing someone who previously worked in the office bodes well for bringing the types of cases it has historically brought, without fear or favor. McNally, 61, has had a wide-ranging career in law and government. He was interim U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Illinois in late 2005 and 2006 and, during the 1980s, he worked as a prosecutor in the U.S. Attorneys office in Manhattan under Rudolph Giuliani. He also has served as a White House speechwriter under President George H.W. Bush, was general counsel for homeland security and terrorism and spent three years as senior counsel in the criminal division of the U.S. Department of Justice. Other names that have cropped up in media reports as contenders for the post are Marc Mukasey, a defense lawyer whose father served as attorney general under Republican President George W. Bush andEdward OCallaghan, a partner at Clifford Chance. OCallaghan and Mukasey did not respond to emailed requests for comment. Besides Giuliani, who went on to become New York City Mayor and more recently a Trump adviser, past U.S. Attorneys forManhattaninclude James Comey, now FBI director, and Robert Morgenthau, who was the inspiration for the first district attorney on the television series, Law & Order.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""FRANKFORT, Ky./SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - For nearly three years, Democrats and former President Barack Obama pointed to Kentucky as one of the Affordable Care Acts biggest success stories. A poor, rural state that straddles the North and South, Kentucky was an early adopter of the healthcare law commonly known as Obamacare and saw one of the countrys largest drops in the uninsured rate. Now Kentucky is poised for a new distinction: to be the first state to save money by reducing the number of people on Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor and disabled and a central tenet of Obamacare. If successful, Kentucky would provide a roadmap for other states who are worried about paying an increasing share for people on Medicaid.  A new Republican health law that passed the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday, along with state initiatives like Kentuckys, would dramatically change the national healthcare system and cut more than $800 billion from Medicaid over the next 10 years.  The Republican bill still faces a long road ahead in the U.S. Senate and its final passage is far from assured, making initiatives like Kentuckys all the more important.  Kentucky has proposed to lessen its financial burden before it grows by reducing the number of residents on Medicaid by nearly 86,000 within five years, saving more than $330 million in the process. (For a graphic click tmsnrt.rs/2on0HVK) Kentuckys plan also calls for new work requirements for able-bodied adults to get insurance. Plus, it would establish new fees for all members based on income and lock out some people who miss a payment or fail to re-enroll. By following these proposed rules, Kentucky believes Medicaid enrollees will over time graduate from Medicaid to private and employer insurance plans.  One of the most remarkable lies that has perpetrated in recent years in the healthcare community in America is that expanded Medicaid was working well in Kentucky, Republican Governor Matt Bevin, who is leading the state effort, told Reuters from the governors mansion in Frankfort, Kentucky. That view is in line with President Donald Trumps administration, which has criticized Obamacares Medicaid expansion and urged states to pursue similar Medicaid reforms to what Kentucky is now attempting.  If Kentucky is successful, youll see this spread through the more conservative-leaning states. Its possible even a Democratic blue state could do it, said George Huang, director and senior municipal healthcare research analyst at Wells Fargo Securities. Its the flexibility that some states are seeking.  Kentucky, a state Trump won handily last November, has been devastated by the loss of coal mining jobs and an opioid epidemic. The state sits near the bottom of health rankings for smoking rates, cancer deaths and diabetes. To me, morally, it was the right thing to expand Medicaid, but I had a responsibility to not to do something that would bankrupt the state, said former Governor Steve Beshear, a Democrat, referring to the increased costs of caring for a larger population with Medicaid insurance. More than 30 states, about a dozen of which are led by Republican governors, expanded Medicaid under Obamacare. In Kentucky, more than 400,000 people gained health insurance through the program, the highest growth rate of Medicaid coverage of any state. Beshear commissioned independent studies by PricewaterhouseCoopers and Deloitte on the financial and health impacts of expanding Medicaid. Both studies found health and economic gains. Deloitte reported that 90,000 newly covered residents received cholesterol screening and 80,000 got preventative dental care within a year. It estimated Kentucky would see an economic boost of $30 billion and 40,000 new jobs by 2021. Beshears successor, Republican Governor Bevin, was elected in 2015 on a promise to repeal and replace the healthcare law on the view that thousands of Kentuckians had unaffordable premiums and only one health insurer to choose from. He dismissed the projections in the Beshear-commissioned studies as preposterous, and says the states share of expanded Medicaid - $74 million in 2017 and totaling $1.2 billion over five years - was too expensive and unsustainable.  We want this to be a helping hand for people at a time when they need it, but then be able to return to the commercial marketplace, Bevin said.  Last year, Bevin submitted the waiver to restrict Medicaid eligibility by requiring enrollees to work or volunteer at least 20 hours per week and to pay monthly premiums based on income. Hes still awaiting approval. Bevin said he has spoken with several governors about the waiver and has had extensive conversations with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price about fast-tracking the approval process in order for other states to quickly adopt similar programs. Such conversations are occurring across the country in response to encouragement from the new administration to reform state Medicaid programs, said Alleigh Marre, a Health and Human Services spokeswoman.  Louisiana and Wisconsin are considering work requirements for Medicaid enrollees. The Obama administration rejected previous attempts by other states, including Ohio and Arizona, to require work programs and monthly premiums for Medicaid, historically a free program for those eligible.  Every state is watching this to see what happens, said Bevin of Kentuckys waiver. Its the first one in the queue. The odds look good for Kentucky to get the waiver in the coming months, based on the track records of health officials that Trump named after his inauguration.  Seema Verma, the new head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which approves Medicaid waivers, said during congressional testimony that the agency will usher in a new era of state flexibility and leadership.  Verma helped craft Kentuckys waiver, but said she will recuse herself from the approval process to avoid conflicts of interest.  She and Tom Price wrote a letter to governors in March encouraging Medicaid reforms that more closely resemble commercial insurance plans. In the letter, they suggested features such as premium fees, health savings accounts, and emergency room co-payments that encourage the use of primary care.  CMS declined to comment on Kentuckys waiver and said it does not speculate on the process while ongoing. Under federal law, waivers must promote Medicaids objective of delivering healthcare services to vulnerable populations who cannot otherwise afford them.  Waivers have never been used to cut people from the rolls, said Emily Parento, associate professor at the University of the Pacifics law school and the former executive director of Kentuckys Office of Health Policy. But Vermas office is encouraging changes to Medicaid that make the government program look more like private insurance policies - goals that are similar to Bevins in Kentucky. I think what will happen is that other states will look at it and go, We want everything they got, Bevin said. (This story has been refiled to fix spelling in paragraph 3.)

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A draft of President Donald Trumps new counterterrorism strategy demands that U.S. allies shoulder more of the burden in combating Islamist militants, while acknowledging that the threat of terrorism will never be totally eliminated. The 11-page draft, seen on Friday by Reuters, said the United States should avoid costly, open-ended military commitments. We need to intensify operations against global jihadist groups while also reducing the costs of American blood and treasure in pursuit of our counterterrorism goals, states the document, which is expected to be released in coming months. We will seek to avoid costly, large-scale U.S. military interventions to achieve counterterrorism objectives and will increasingly look to partners to share the responsibility for countering terrorist groups, it says. However, it acknowledges that terrorism cannot be defeated with any sort of finality. Michael Anton, spokesman for the White House National Security Council, said, As part of its overall approach, the administration is taking a fresh look at the entire U.S.  national security strategy, to include the counterterrorism mission - which is especially important since no such strategy has been produced publicly since 2011. The process is aimed at ensuring the new strategy is directed against the pre-eminent terrorist threats to our nation, our citizens, our interests overseas and allies, Anton said. Moreover, this new strategy will highlight achievable and realistic goals, and guiding principles. Combating Islamic extremism was a major issue for Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign. The draft strategy paper,  which officials said was still being fine-tuned at the White House, describes the threat from Islamic militant groups in stark tones.      It remains to be seen how Trump can square his goal of avoiding military interventions with ongoing conflicts involving U.S. troops in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Yemen and elsewhere. Rather than scale back U.S. commitments, he has so far largely adhered to former Obama administration plans to intensify military operations against militant groups and granted the Pentagon greater authority to strike them in places like Yemen and Somalia. Trump may soon reverse years of Obama-ordered drawdowns in Afghanistan. His administration is now considering boosting by 3,000 to 5,000 soldiers the 8,400-strong U.S. contingent helping Afghan forces fight a resurgent Taliban, current and former U.S. officials say. A senior administration official noted that only a small number of troops have been added to U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria under Trump, at the discretion of his military commanders.  If you do see additions elsewhere, they will be in keeping with this (draft) strategy, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The increased pace of U.S. military operations has seen a recent spate of American casualties. The latest came in Somalia, where a Navy SEAL died and two others were wounded in an attack by al Shabaab militants, U.S. officials said on Friday. Since President Barack Obama released the last U.S. counterterrorism strategy in 2011 before the emergence of Islamic State, the threat has diversified in size, scope and complexity from what we faced just a few years ago, the draft strategy said. In addition to Islamic State, the United States and its allies are endangered by a reconstituted al Qaeda, groups such as the Haqqani network and Hezbollah, as well as from homegrown extremists radicalized online, it said. Bruce Hoffman, director of Georgetown Universitys Center for Security Studies and who reviewed the document at Reuters request, said the draft strategy paints - and I think accurately - a more dire picture of the threat than the Obama document, which sounded a triumphalist tone following al Qaeda leader Osama bin Ladens death in a 2011 U.S. raid in Pakistan. The senior administration official said the document describing an overarching counterterrorism approach is separate from a detailed strategy to defeat Islamic State that Trump also has ordered.  The draft strategy seen by Reuters appears to flow from Trumps America First foreign policy calling for foreign aid cuts and more burden-sharing by allies and alliances such as NATO. It does not include a signature phrase from Trumps 2016 campaign, radical Islamic terrorism. Instead, it says that jihadist groups have merged under a global jihadist ideology that seeks to establish a transnational Islamic caliphate that fosters conflict on a global scale. The drafts first guiding principle is that the United States will always act to disrupt, prevent and respond to terrorist attacks against our nation, our citizens, our interests overseas and our allies. This includes taking direct and unilateral action, if necessary. The administration would boost U.S. homeland security by working with allies and partners to eliminate terrorist leaders, ideologues, technical experts, financiers, external operators and battlefield commanders. The draft also calls for denying militants physical and online sanctuaries in which to plan and launch attacks and degrade their efforts to develop and deploy chemical and biological weapons. Yet it provides few details on how the United States, which has led global counterterrorism efforts since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, can achieve those goals by passing more of the burden to other countries, many of which lack the requisite military and intelligence capabilities. The draft makes little mention of promoting human rights, development, good governance and other soft power tools that Washington has embraced in the past to help foreign governments reduce grievances that feed extremism. In contrast, the Obama counterterrorism strategy made respecting human rights, fostering good governance, respecting privacy and civil liberties, committing to security and transparency and upholding the rule of law the foremost of its guiding principles. Soft power has a role to play, but not to the exclusion of kinetics, or military action, said Hoffman. He called the draft a very sober depiction of the threat and what is needed now and in the immediate future to counter it. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The legal fights may end up at the U.S. Supreme Court perhaps in the fall, many months after Trump first issued an executive order in January saying there was an urgent need to halt some immigration to the United States for 90 days while officials reviewed the visa process.          Trump dropped the original travel order after unfavorable legal rulings and replaced it with a more limited ban which is itself now being challenged in appeals courts on two coasts. Arguing that the United States needed to tighten national security measures, Trumps attempt to limit travel was one of his first major acts in office. The fate of the ban is one indication of whether the Republican can carry out his promises to be tough on immigration and national security. Omar Jadwat, an attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, who will be arguing the case at the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Virginia on Monday, said the fact that so much time has passed since the ban was issued is proof that there was no pressing national security need for it in the first place. The court fight will give those challenging the order an opportunity to argue that the government never intended for the travel pause to be temporary, said Buzz Frahn, an attorney at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett in Palo Alto, California whose firm has been closely tracking the ongoing litigation.  Now almost 100 days after the original travel ban, the government says the period of 90 days was reset when the administration issued the new order in March. The Department of Homeland Security is, and will be, continuously examining ways to enhance the screening and vetting process to shut down terrorist and criminal pathways into the United States, agency spokesman David Lapan said. Some improvements will be classified, others will be public, but the Department has only just begun ways to enhance the security of our immigration system, he said in an email. Opponents - including states and civil rights groups - say that both the first ban and the revised ban, which also put a halt to all refugee admissions to the country for four months, discriminates against Muslims.  The government argues the text of the order does not mention any specific religion and is needed to protect the country against attacks.      The 4th Circuit will decide the fate of a ruling from a Maryland district judge that struck down a section of the revised executive order barring visitors from Syria, Iran, Libya, Sudan, Yemen and Somalia.  The hearing will take place before 14 full-time judges of the appellate court. Ten of them were appointed by Democrats, and four by Republicans.  Then, on March 15, a three-judge panel at the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will review a decision from a Hawaii judge that halted not just the travel portion of the ban but also the section that barred refugees. The judges  who will sit on a panel in Seattle - have been assigned but their identities have not been made public. The 9th Circuit blocked Trumps first ban in February, in a unanimous vote by one Republican-appointed judge and two-Democratic appointees. Trump lashed out at the ruling on Twitter and said he is ready for a fight at the Supreme Court. The nations highest court is more likely to hear a case if the federal appeals courts reach opposite rulings or if the issue is of great national importance, according to legal experts.       But the Supreme Courts session ends in June, and if it take the case it would probably not be heard until after the justices return in October.

The Military Office carries and safeguards the football, the device that contains the top secret launch codes the president needs to order a nuclear attack, as well as providing him secure communications wherever he is. The White House, Secret Service, and Defense Department had no comment on whether similar arrangements have been made at other properties Trump frequents - Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida and the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, where Trump is spending this weekend.     In a letter to Representative Jackie Speier, a Democrat on the House Armed Services and intelligence committees, Defense Department official James MacStravic, said the apartment is privately owned and ... lease negotiations have been with the owners representatives only. MacStravic, who wrote that he was temporarily performing the duties of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, said any acquisition of leased space with an annual rental in excess of $1 million must first be approved by my office. He approved this action after consulting with the White House Military Office and other officials, he said. Officials declined to reveal the cost of the lease or identify the owners of the apartment.      MacStravics letter, dated March 3, added: We are not aware of any means through which the President would personally benefit from a Government lease of this space.  The letter explained that the White House Military Office, a Pentagon unit, requested approval to lease space in the Trump Tower for personnel assigned to support the President when at his private residence. The letter said such arrangements are typical of support provided by the Military Office to previous U.S. presidents and vice presidents at their private residences. It is not clear, however, whether the office has ever paid to rent space to house the classified equipment presidents need when they are staying at homes they own outside Washington. A White House spokeswoman said the White House had no information on the leasing issue. The Defense Department and U.S. Secret Service declined to comment. The Trump Organization did not reply to an email requesting comment.  When the Pentagon in February first acknowledged that it was seeking to lease space in Trump Tower, some Democrats questioned whether such a move would produce a financial windfall for Trump. I am concerned by the appearance that the President of the United States will financially benefit from this deal at the expense of the Department of Defense - and ultimately, taxpayers, Speier wrote to Defense Secretary James Mattis shortly after the Trump Tower issue became public in February.

President Donald Trump, a Republican, praised the bills passage in the House but acknowledged that some of its provisions may change before it becomes law. A part of the Republicans proposed American Health Care Act would prevent Planned Parenthood from being reimbursed for any of its services, including cancer screening and pre-natal care, through the Medicaid program for the poor. About 60 percent of the patients who use Planned Parenthoods 600 or so clinics are on Medicaid or other federal public health programs. Republican congressional offices from coast to coast were targeted on Friday, with protests planned at the offices of Representatives Rodney Frelinghuysen in Morristown, New Jersey, Kevin Yoderice in Shawnee Mission, Kansas, and Darrell Issa in Vista, California, among others. Many Republicans oppose any funding for Planned Parenthood, citing religious grounds, because its services include abortions, although it receives no federal funding or reimbursement for abortions, as stipulated by federal law.

But even as Republicans predicted that tax reform would succeed before year-end, lawmakers encountered new uncertainties about what a final tax package might contain, as well as doubts about whether Republicans will be able to enact reforms without Democratic help. President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress have pledged to complete the biggest tax reform since 1986, when President Ronald Reagan was in office, before the end of 2017. But they face an uphill battle, mainly over policy differences within their own ranks.  Thursdays 217-213 House vote on healthcare legislation raised confidence in the Republican-controlled chambers ability to move major legislation after two earlier pushes ended in failure. But to move forward on tax reform, the House, Senate and Trump administration must agree on where to set tax rates, how to pay for cuts and whether the final package should add to the deficit or pay for itself, all areas where common ground may be hard to find. A plan to enact reforms without Democratic support will also require Republicans to pass a 2018 budget authorizing the parliamentary process known as reconciliation. But a new budget agreement poses a daunting task given Republican opposition to Trump demands for deep domestic spending cuts.   That may prove to be one, if not the most difficult votes of the tax reform process, Jonathan Traub, a managing principal at the consulting firm Deloitte Tax LLP.   Meanwhile, the need to reach agreement between the House, Senate and White House will likely delay introduction of a tax reform bill, which had been expected in early June.  But Republicans say it will ultimately make it easier to enact reforms before the end of the year.  The House Ways and Means Committee, which will unveil the initial tax bill, is still aiming for a revenue-neutral package that raises $2.4 trillion for tax cuts through a new border adjustment tax and elimination of business deductions for net interest payments, both controversial measures. Panel chairman Kevin Brady told reporters that revenue neutrality is necessary to ensure bold, permanent changes to tax policy that can drive economic growth.   Thats the argument and the case were going to make to the Senate and the Trump administration, he said. But Representative Mark Meadows, who chairs the conservative Freedom Caucus that helped block Trumps first healthcare bill,  voiced opposition to a revenue neutral approach. If its revenue neutral, youre not really lowering taxes. Youre shifting the burden, Meadows told reporters.       The Trump tax plan unveiled last week calls for steep tax cuts financed by government revenues that officials say will result from higher growth. Some fear the plan could add trillions of dollars to the deficit if growth does not materialize. Meadows said tax cuts should be offset by cuts to entitlement programs including Social Security and Medicare, which Trump has promised not to touch.

They said we had a rough phone call. We didnt really have a rough phone call, Trump said in dinner remarks. It got a little bit testy. But thats okay. Dressed in tuxedos as they prepared to attend a dinner, the two leaders met on board the USS Intrepid, a World War Two aircraft carrier that is now a museum moored on Manhattans West Side. Joined by their wives, the two leaders later attended a gala to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea. Turnbull was one of the first foreign leaders Trump spoke to after taking office on Jan. 20. The Republican president became irritated that he was expected to honor an agreement made by his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, to accept as many as 1,250 refugees held in Australian processing centers on remote Pacific islands. Trump had broken off what was supposed to be an hour-long call after 25 minutes and later tweeted that the refugee agreement was a dumb deal and vowed to study it. The call aroused criticism and raised questions about his diplomatic skills. Vice President Mike Pence visited Australia in April and made clear that while Trump was not happy about the refugee agreement, the United States would honor it out of respect for Australia. Under the agreement, Australia is to resettle refugees from three Central American countries. Thursdays get-together with Turnbull was delayed because of Trumps hastily arranged White House celebration with Republicans from the U.S. House of Representatives after they narrowly passed a healthcare bill that would repeal and replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. The measure has yet to come before the Senate/    Trump and Turnbull were all smiles as they answered questions about the January phone call and the refugee deal during a picture-taking session. We get along great.We have a fantastic relationship, I love Australia, Ialways have, Trump said. Turnbull added: We can put the refugee deal behind you and move on. Trump said the refugee deal had been worked out for a long time and that reporters had exaggerated the phone call. We had a great call, he said, adding, I mean, were not babies. Young at heart, added Turnbull. Trump vowed to visit Australia as president, calling it one of the great, great places and noted he had many friends there. One such friend, pro golfer Greg Norman, was among the attendees at the Intrepid dinner. In dinner remarks after their meeting, Turnbull celebrated the unity of spirit that brought the two countries together against Japan in World War Two, and said Australia and the United States are united against North Koreas nuclear and missile programs and are fighting together in Afghanistan. Today and together, we condemn and we resist North Koreas provocation, he said. It was Trumps first trip back to New York, his home and where he made his name and fortune, since the former real estate executive moved into the White House in January. His motorcade passed hundreds of protesters as it arrived at the Intrepid in the early evening. Trump did not plan to visit Trump Tower, his home in midtown Manhattan where his wife, first lady Melania Trump, and their young son Barron still live, but instead was to spend the weekend at his golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey.

The order was widely praised by religious organizations that either felt hemmed in by the law or openly violated it, but others denounced it as putting womens health in jeopardy or weakening the U.S. tradition of separating church and state. We will not allow people of faith to be targeted, bullied or silenced any more, Trump said at a signing ceremony at the White House where religious leaders had gathered in support. No one should be censoring sermons or targeting pastors, he said. Trumps order directs the Internal Revenue Service to alleviate the burden of the Johnson Amendment, the White House said in reference to a 1954 law sponsored by Lyndon Johnson, then a Texas senator who later became president. Under that amendment, the tax code prohibits organizations that enjoy tax-free status from participating in a political campaign or supporting any one candidate for elective office. The order also asks the government to issue rules that would allow religious groups such as the Little Sister of the Poor to deny their employees insurance coverage for services that they oppose on religious grounds, such as birth-control pills. Those employees would be forced to go outside their employer-provided insurance plan for subsidized contraceptives, said Lori Windham, a lawyer who represents the group. Todays announcement is a great day for the Little Sisters, Windham said. The American Civil Liberties Union had threatened a lawsuit to stop the order but later backed off, saying the most onerous provisions had yet to be enacted and that it falls way short of meeting Trumps pledge to totally destroy the Johnson Amendment. At least one expert said Trumps order appears legally sound. Rolling back the Johnson Amendment does not favor any particular religious views over others, and the president has broad authority to decide not to enforce certain laws, said Robin Fretwell Wilson, a professor at the University of Illinois College of Law.

Leaders of the U.S. religious left, a rising force of opposition to Trumps hard-line stance on immigration and healthcare, said they were poised to benefit from the move, which lifts the risk of religious groups losing their tax-exempt status if they advocate for particular candidates. This is going to backfire on Trump, said the Rev. Jennifer Butler, chief executive of progressive policy group Faith in Public Life. We are morally outraged at what is going on and we are appalled at the weaponization of religion. The group plans to mobilize voters who view some of Trumps policies as immoral. While the group does not endorse candidates, those voters in the 2018 midterm elections would back candidates who oppose those policies. Trumps order gives religious groups more liberty to do so without jeopardizing tax-exempt status. Were going to be mobilizing millions of voters to turn out at the polls and vote their values, Butler said.  Sojourners, a Washington-based progressive Christian network that advocates for immigrants and the poor, also believes more of its members will now feel free to speak out against Trumps policies. I wouldnt tell people who to vote for but I would tell them what to vote against and this might encourage more churches to speak out against him, said Jim Wallis, the groups founder. Donald Trumps use of racism and racial bigotry is unchristian. His attack on refugees is anti-Christian. Trump has repeatedly and angrily denied allegations that his policies are racist, calling immigration limits essential for national security. Before signing the order, the Republican president cited historically black churches and slain civil-rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. as drivers of U.S. social progress. Evangelical and Roman Catholic leaders as well as a prominent U.S. rabbi joined Trump when he signed the order instructing the Internal Revenue Service to alleviate the burden of the Johnson Amendment, the 1954 law prohibiting organizations with tax-free status, including churches, from participating in political campaigns or supporting particular candidates. The move by Trump, who appealed to religious conservatives in his 2016 presidential run, was widely praised by religious organizations that felt hemmed in by the law or openly violated it. We will not allow people of faith to be targeted, bullied or silenced any more, Trump, who criticized the Johnson Amendment during his campaign, said at the ceremony. Rescinding the law would require an act of Congress. Ralph Reed, a longtime leader of the religious right and chairman of the Faith & Freedom Coalition, praised Trumps executive order in a statement, saying it removed a sword of Damocles that has hung over the faith community for decades. Several prominent leaders of the religious left noted that neither Republican nor Democratic policy stances lined up neatly with any major religions teaching and said the move could fracture congregations by encouraging leaders to take sides. Once faith leaders become partisan, it hijacks their moral authority and their impartiality in this hyper-partisan environment, said Rabbi Jonah Pesner, director of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism. The American Civil Liberties Union had threatened a lawsuit to stop the order, but later backed off, saying the most onerous provisions had yet to be enacted and that it fell far short of meeting Trumps pledge to totally destroy the Johnson Amendment. Several leaders interviewed said they worried that Trumps move could be unevenly enforced, allowing conservative Christian churches to promote political candidates without extending the same exemptions to other views or other denominations. The biggest religious liberty issue now for me is how Christians are going to protect the liberty of Muslims, said Wallis, of Sojourners. Thats the top issue, more than whether they have to hire gay people. Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said his group would keep urging U.S. imams to speak out on moral issues with political consequences, but would urge them to remain nonpartisan. He wondered if all religious leaders would follow that guidance. These kind of moves, particularly by this administration, have a vast ocean of unintended consequences, he said.

In his first ministerial meeting with all 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Tillerson also called on nations with competing claims in the South China Sea to cease all island building and militarization while talks aimed at creating a maritime code of conduct were under way. Patrick Murphy, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asia, said Tillerson stressed Washingtons security and economic commitment to the region, amid doubts raised by President Donald Trumps America First platform and withdrawal from the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact. Tillerson called on ASEAN countries to fully implement U.N. sanctions on Pyongyang, which is working to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the United States, and to show a united front on the issue, Murphy said. We think that more can be done, not just in Southeast Asia, he told reporters. We are encouraging continued and further steps across all of ASEAN.  Last week, Tillerson called on all countries to suspend or downgrade diplomatic ties with Pyongyang, saying that North Korea abuses diplomatic privileges to help fund its arms programs. Tillerson also warned that Washington would sanction foreign firms and people conducting business with North Korea if countries did not act themselves. All ASEAN members have diplomatic relations with North Korea and five have embassies there. Murphy said Washington was not encouraging ASEAN states to formally cut ties, but to examine the North Korean presence where it clearly exceeds diplomatic needs. He said some countries were already doing this and also looking at the presence of North Korean workers, another significant revenue earner for Pyongyang. Some officials of ASEAN members, speaking to reporters, acknowledged concerns about North Korea, but also cited concerns about trade relations with the United States. Philippine acting Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo, whose country currently chairs ASEAN, said of the U.S. call to minimize relations with Pyongyahng, We havent really discussed that among the ASEAN countries, so thats probably something we will look at. Our immediate concern is to try and ensure the tension on the peninsula doesnt increase. ... The last thing we would like to see is to have a conflict break out due to some miscalculation, Manalo said. Singapores foreign minister, Vivian Balakrishnan, said sanctions would have to be fully implemented, but North Koreas presence in his country is already minimal.Asked if that could be further reduced, he said: I wont say never, but at this point in time thats not the issue - we will stick with the U.N. Security Councils resolutions. Balakrishnan, whose country signed the TPP, stressed the importance of U.S.-ASEAN business ties - annual trade of $100 billion supporting half a million U.S. jobs and $274 billion of U.S. investment. Southeast Asia is replete with economic opportunities and its too big to miss out on, he said. His remark highlighted growing concern in Asia that Trump has ditched former President Barack Obamas economic pivot to the region by abandoning the TPP, something analysts say has led to more countries being pulled into Chinas orbit. Murphy said Tillerson stressed that ASEAN remained a very important ... strategic partner, which is shown by Trumps commitment to attend regional summits in the Philippines and Vietnam in November. Manalo called the meeting with Tillerson and Trumps travel plans encouraging signs. Washington wants ASEAN countries to crack down on money laundering and smuggling involving North Korea and to look at restricting legal business too. It has been working to persuade China, North Koreas neighbor and only major ally, to increase pressure on Pyongyang. U.S. officials are also asking China to urge more China-friendly ASEAN members, such as Laos and Cambodia, to do the same. U.S. efforts have included a flurry of calls by Trump to the leaders of the Philippines, Thailand and Singapore. Diplomats say U.S. pressure has caused some irritation in  ASEAN, including Malaysia, which has maintained relations with Pyongyang in spite of the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Uns estranged half brother at Kuala Lumpur International airport in February/         On the issue of the South China Sea, ASEAN has adopted a cautious approach recently, with a weekend summit avoiding references to Chinas building and arming of artificial islands there. This stance coincided with moves by China and ASEAN to draft a framework to negotiate a code of conduct. Murphy said Tillerson had stressed that this process needed room and space through avoiding fortifying existing claims. The United States has conducted freedom of navigation operations to challenge South China Sea claims, angering China, but not yet under Trump. Murphy said such operations would continue, but declined to say when the next might occur. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The presidential motorcade passed hundreds of demonstrators as it arrived at the decommissioned aircraft carrier Intrepid in the early evening for a meeting with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull hours after it was originally scheduled.  Before leaving Washington, Trump held a hastily arranged White House celebration with fellow Republicans from the U.S. House of Representatives who narrowly passed a healthcare bill that would repeal and replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. [nL1N1I61UA] If anything, Trumps role in efforts to scrap the signature domestic achievement of his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, further incensed the protesters. Among those on the street were members of the New York State Nurses Association, who chanted: What do we want? Health care! When do we want it? Now!  Demonstrators from the Working Families Party spent much of the afternoon rallying and marching near the Intrepid, now a floating museum on Manhattans West Side, banging pans, chanting: Not my president and carrying signs including one that read: This village doesnt want its idiot back! Rob Adkins, 33, a professional musician from Brooklyn who is insured through Obamacare, said he was alarmed by the Trump-backed Republican healthcare plan that passed the House. It could cost me my health insurance, he said, echoing the sentiments of several other protesters. The demonstrations, which included other groups throughout Manhattan, were reminiscent of the weeks after Trumps Nov. 8 election when frequent protests took place outside his home in the Fifth Avenue tower that bears his name.    The first 100 days since the Jan. 20 inauguration of the businessman-turned-politician brought rollbacks of environmental regulations and crackdowns on immigrants, none of which play well in the liberal Northeast city. Fewer than one in five residents in the United States most populous city voted for Trump, even though he comes from its Queens borough, built a real estate brand and other ventures associated with New York, and has been fodder for its tabloid newspapers for decades. Providing security for first lady Melania Trump, who has continued to live in Trump Tower while their 11-year-old son Barron finishes the school year, has been a costly obligation for New York.  After security costs for Trump and his family of about $24 million during the transition and $300,000 a day since then, Congress voted last week to reimburse the city and other local governments for $61 million. Following the events with Turnbull, which include a black-tie dinner on the Intrepid to mark the 75th anniversary of World War Twos Battle of the Coral Sea, Trump was expected to go to his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, for the weekend.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday narrowly approved a bill to repeal Obamacare, handing Republican President Donald Trump a victory that could prove short-lived as the healthcare legislation heads into a likely tough battle in the Senate. The vote to repeal former President Barack Obamas signature domestic achievement, which enabled 20 million more Americans to get health insurance, was Trumps biggest legislative win since he took office in January, putting him on a path to fulfilling one of his key campaign promises as well as a seven-year quest by Republican lawmakers. It marked a reversal of fortune for the Republican president who suffered a stunning defeat in late March when House Republican leaders pulled legislation to scrap Obamacare after they and the White House could not resolve the clashing interests of Republican moderates and the partys most conservative lawmakers. Trump has called Obamacare a disaster and congressional Republicans have long targeted the 2010 law, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, calling it government overreach. But despite holding the White House and controlling both houses of Congress, Republicans have found overturning Obamacare politically perilous, partly because of voter fears, loudly expressed at constituents town-hall meetings, that many people would lose their health insurance as a result.     With Thursdays 217-213 vote, Republicans obtained just enough support to push the legislation through the House, sending it to the Senate for consideration. No Democratic House members voted for the bill. Democrats say it would make insurance unaffordable for those who need it most and leave millions more uninsured. They accuse Republicans of seeking tax cuts for the rich, partly paid for by cutting health benefits. The legislation, called the American Health Care Act, is by no means a sure thing in the Senate, where the Republicans hold a slender 52-48 majority in the 100-seat chamber and where only a few Republican defections could sink it. As Republicans crossed over the vote threshold to pass the bill, Democrats in the House began singing Na na, na na na na, hey hey hey, goodbye, a rowdy suggestion that Republicans will lose seats in the 2018 congressional elections because of their vote. Within an hour of the vote, Trump celebrated with House lawmakers in the White House Rose Garden. I went through two years of campaigning and Im telling you, no matter where I went, people were suffering so badly with the ravages of Obamacare, Trump said. We are going to get this passed through the Senate. I am so confident. PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS The treatment of people with pre-existing conditions was one of the central issues in the House debate on the bill and is sure to resurface in the Senate. Obamacare prevented insurers from charging those with pre-existing conditions higher rates, a common practice before its implementation. It also required them to cover 10 essential health benefits such as maternity care and prescription drugs. The Republican bill passed on Thursday would allow states to opt out of those provisions. While insurers could not deny people insurance because of pre-existing conditions, they would be allowed to charge them as much as they want. In an analysis released on Thursday, healthcare consultancy and research firm Avalere Health said the Republican bill would cover only 5 percent of enrollees with pre-existing conditions in the individual insurance markets. Republicans have argued that their bill would give people more choice and reduce the role of government. In a push to pass the bill before members leave on Friday for a week in their home districts, the House voted before the bill was assessed by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, which estimates its cost and effect on insurance rolls. Republicans have said the bill will be scored by the CBO and other fixes will be made before the Senate votes. Health insurers, such as Anthem Inc, UnitedHealth Group Inc, Aetna Inc and Cigna Corp, have faced months of uncertainty over healthcares future. So have hospital companies, such as HCA Holdings Inc and Tenet Healthcare Corp. Obamacare expanded Medicaid, the government insurance program for the poor, provided income-based tax credits to help the poor buy insurance on individual insurance markets set up by the law, and required everyone to buy insurance or pay a penalty. The Republican bill would repeal most Obamacare taxes, which paid for the law, roll back the Medicaid expansion and slash the programs funding, repeal the penalty for not purchasing insurance and replace the laws tax credits with flat age-based credits. In a sign of the challenges ahead for the legislation, nearly every major medical group, including the American Medical Association and the American Hospital Association, and the AARP advocacy group for older Americans, strongly opposed the Republican bill. Many said last-minute amendments further eroded protection for the most vulnerable groups, including the sick and elderly. Ive already made clear that I dont support the House bill as currently constructed because I continue to have concerns that this bill does not do enough to protect Ohios Medicaid expansion population, said Republican Senator Rob Portman.   While the bills fate in the Senate is uncertain, its House passage could boost Trumps hopes of pushing through other big-ticket items on his agenda, such as tax reform. The previous failure to overhaul healthcare legislation had raised questions about how much Republicans could work together to help Trump fulfill his campaign pledges. Anything that they (the Republicans) get done, that they accomplish, popular or unpopular, will show that they have the ability to make progress and to get things done and work together, said Randy Frederick, vice president trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. This puts the idea of tax reform a little bit closer to reality, simply because its shown that they have figured out a way to negotiate and work together, he added.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - After months of internal discord, Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday approved a bill to overhaul the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, which they have been attacking since it was enacted in 2010.  Two attempts in recent weeks to pass an overhaul bill had collapsed in confusion, but Republicans overcame their differences in a 217-213 vote that will send the bill to the Senate, where its outlook was uncertain. Obamacare brought health insurance coverage to millions of Americans. An early estimate by nonpartisan congressional researchers of the impact of the Republican rollback bill, known as the American Health Care Act, or AHCA, said it would leave 24 million more Americans without insurance coverage by 2026. Here are the bills main provisions:  The Republican plan would maintain some of Obamacares most popular provisions. It would allow young adults to stay on their parents health plan until age 26. The bill would let states opt out of Obamacares mandate that insurers charge the same rates on sick and healthy people. It would also allow states to opt out of Obamacares requirement that insurers cover 10 essential health benefits, such as maternity care and prescription drug costs.  The measure would provide states with $100 billion, largely to fund high-risk pools to provide insurance to the sickest patients. The bill also would provide $8 billion over five years to help those with pre-existing conditions pay for insurance. It would let insurers mark up premiums by 30 percent for those who have a lapse in insurance coverage of about two months or more. Insurers won a provision they had long sought: The ability to charge older Americans up to five times more than young people. Under Obamacare, they could only charge up to three times more.  The bill would end in 2018 Obamacares income-based tax credits that help low-income people buy insurance. These would be replaced with age-based tax credits ranging from $2,000 to $4,000 per year that would be capped at upper-income levels. While Obamacares credits gave more help to those with lower incomes, the Republican plan would be largely age-based. The Republican bill would abolish most Obamacare taxes, including on medical devices, health insurance premiums, indoor tanning salons, prescription medications and high-cost employer-provided insurance known as Cadillac plans. Those taxes paid for Obamacare. Republicans have not said how they would pay for the parts of the law they want to keep. The bill would also repeal the Obamacare financial penalty for the 2016 tax year for not purchasing insurance, as well as a surtax on investment income earned by upper-income Americans. It would repeal the mandate that larger employers must offer insurance to their employees.  Under Obamacare, more than 30 states, including about a dozen Republican states, expanded the Medicaid government health insurance program for the poor. About half of Obamacare enrollees obtained insurance through the expansion. The bill would allow the Medicaid expansion to continue until Jan. 1, 2020. After that date, expansion would end and Medicaid funding would be capped on a per-person basis. State Medicaid plans would no longer have to cover some Obamacare-mandated essential health benefits, fulfilling a Republican promise to return more control to the states.

The relatives assert that by allowing Islamic State militants to spread propaganda freely on social media, the three companies provided material support to the group and enabled attacks such as the one in San Bernardino. For years defendants have knowingly and recklessly provided the terrorist group ISIS with accounts to use its social networks as a tool for spreading extremist propaganda, raising funds and attracting new recruits, family members of Sierra Clayborn, Tin Nguyen and Nicholas Thalasinos charge in the 32-page complaint, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Wednesday. Without defendants Twitter, Facebook and Google (YouTube), the explosive growth of ISIS over the last few years into the most feared terrorist group in the world would not have been possible, the complaint said. Spokeswomen for Twitter and Google declined to comment on the lawsuit. Representatives for Facebook could not immediately be reached by Reuters on Thursday afternoon. Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, opened fire on a holiday gathering of Farooks co-workers at a government building in San Bernardino on Dec. 2, 2015, killing 14 people and wounding 22 others. Farook, the 28-year-old, U.S.-born son of Pakistani immigrants, and Malik, 29, a Pakistani native, died in a shootout with police four hours after the massacre. Authorities have said the couple was inspired by Islamist militants. At the time, the assault ranked as the deadliest attack by Islamist extremists on U.S. soil since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. In June 2016, an American-born gunman pledging allegiance to the leader of Islamic State shot 49 people to death at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, before he was killed by police.  In December 2016 the families of three men killed at the   nightclub sued Twitter, Google and Facebook in federal court on allegations similar to those in the California lawsuit.

Lawmakers who met with him said he spoke with them, not at them. Some lawmakers and aides in the U.S. House of Representatives were hesitant to credit Trump or his softer approach with Thursdays 217-213 vote rolling back President Barack Obamas signature 2010 healthcare overhaul. Several aides emphasized the role of House Republican leaders and Vice President Mike Pence in bridging differences between the partys moderates and hardline conservatives. Others said they saw a different Trump at work this week versus March 24, when he backed a bill that collapsed and again in April when his fellow Republicans failed a second time.  Representative Mark Sanford, a Republican member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said on Thursday that in March the White House threatened to work against his re-election bid if he balked at supporting the healthcare bill. This time Trump, who took office in January, was largely absent, Sanford said, adding: They got it clear that threats were not going to work with me. In White House talks with Republican Representatives Fred Upton and Billy Long, Trump helped to nail down critical moderate votes. A senior White House official said Trump worked the phones this time and realized it had been a mistake to set a deadline the first time. Trump spoke with Speaker Paul Ryan, the leading House Republican, during late-night calls. In conversations with lawmakers, Trump kept the focus on meeting a Republican promise from the 2016 election campaign to roll back a federal government healthcare law that they view as too costly and over-reaching. Any plan to overhaul Obamacare faces a tougher battle in the 100-member U.S. Senate, where Republicans hold a slimmer majority. While Republicans control both the White House and Congress, senators are traditionally less easily moved by presidential pressure than members of the House. Democrats in both houses remained firmly opposed to a bill they said would deprive millions of Americans of healthcare coverage. The bill is going nowhere fast in the United States Senate, said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. PRE-EXISTING MEDICAL CONDITIONS A KEY House Republicans joined an exuberant Trump for a victory lap in the White House Rose Garden after the vote. Turning to Ryan, Trump reminded him of the criticism the speaker faced when the healthcare bill stalled in the House the first time. For the last week, Ive been hearing, Paul Ryan doesnt have it ... Then today, I heard Paul Ryan is a genius, Trump said. A key turning point came on Monday, when Upton and four other Republican lawmakers met to discuss how the rollback bill could be changed to better protect people with pre-existing medical conditions, a concern for Republican moderates. No amendment had been hammered out by Tuesday and Upton, an influential moderate, said he opposed the bill, as did Long, a close Trump ally. Trump called them both to the White House. At their meeting on Wednesday, Upton and Long reminded Trump of his promise in a weekend television interview that the Republican plan would protect people with pre-existing medical conditions. They pressed him to stand by that commitment and it worked. Trump endorsed their amendment to add some money to the Republican bill for that purpose.  White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump had 15 to 20 meetings or calls with House Republicans ahead of the vote. She said the president was directly engaged. If Senate Republicans can pass a bill, a House-Senate panel of negotiators likely would have to iron out the differences and present a compromise version for both chambers to pass. My only concern is the U.S. Senate, said Republican Representative Dave Brat, a Freedom Caucus member. If they come back with any big changes that will make life a little tough. Brat said Trumps role will be important. The new variable is President Trump. If he gets out there and puts a little heat on it, then a Senate-House compromise is possible.

Representatives Mike Conaway, the new Republican leader of the House Intelligence Committee probe, and Adam Schiff, the top Democrat, addressed reporters together after Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey and Admiral Mike Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, testified at a classified hearing. We had a very successful hearing, Conaway said. Schiff said the witnesses had provided some additional insights, and the committee was working together very well.  Neither responded to questions. The committees Republican chairman, Devin Nunes, recused himself from the investigation and was replaced by Conaway last month after a dispute caused Democrats to question whether Nunes could credibly lead a probe of possible Russian attempts to influence the election in favor of President Donald Trump. Russia denies the allegations. Nunes had infuriated Democrats by telling reporters, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan and Trump - before informing committee Democrats - that he had seen documents showing that the communications of Trump associates had been caught up in surveillance. It later emerged that Nunes, a close Trump ally, obtained the information at the White House, after the Republican president pushed back against suspicions that Russia boosted his campaign by making the unsubstantiated accusation that former President Barack Obama had ordered a wiretap of Trump Tower in New York. Schiff and Conaway later issued a joint statement on Thursdays classified hearing saying they remained committed to working with the FBI as it continues its investigation. They said they are currently sending out invitations for witnesses to testify and requesting documents. They said they were looking forward to the next steps of the investigation, including an open hearing with former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates and John Brennan, who was director of the Central Intelligence Agency under Obama.

Senators from both Republican and Democratic parties voted in favor of the bill, which passed 79 to 18 with only Republicans opposing the measure, citing minimal changes to spending levels.   The bill, which was passed 309-118 in the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday, now heads to Trump.  While it failed to include many of the items Trump had requested, he is expected to sign the bill before midnight Friday, when without his signature the government would shut down.  As soon as this spending measure is law, lawmakers and Trump must already begin looking forward to the next deadline on Oct. 1. Lawmakers are hopeful they can pass regular spending bills but the process is likely to be complicated by Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare, a desire to rewrite the tax code and a need to find a deal to raise the debt ceiling since the limit is expected to be reached in the fall.  Under the compromise measure, the Pentagons funding increased, a priority that had been laid out by Republicans and Trump. It also funded Democratic priorities, including health care subsidies.  This bill is far from perfect, but its better than how we are spending our money today, better than how we were spending our money a year ago, Republican Senator Roy Blunt said on the Senate floor.  Democrats also claimed victory in the passage of the legislation, arguing that it fails to fund Trumps priorities including money to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Additionally, the bill funds subsidies for health care coverage provided through the Affordable Care Act, former Democratic President Barack Obamas signature domestic legislation.  Republican Senator Ted Cruz gave his reasons for voting against the bill.  While I am pleased to see increased funding for our men and women in uniform and their critical missions across the globe, this bill fails in a number of ways, including by continuing to fund sanctuary cities, Planned Parenthood, and Obamacare, Cruz said.  Sanctuary cities are those that give limited cooperation to the federal government in enforcing immigration laws and Planned Parenthood is a conservative target because abortion is among the womens health care services it provides. The spending bill does not include many of the spending cuts on domestic programs Trump had sought and adds $2 billion for the National Institutes of Health, $295 million for Puerto Ricos underfunded Medicaid healthcare for the poor and $407 million for firefighting in Western states. The legislation adds $12.5 billion in defense spending. It makes $2.5 billion more available after Trump gives details on his plans for fighting the Islamic State militant group. The bill was approved months after the Oct. 1 2016 deadline to pass government funding for the fiscal year.

STEPHEN WOOD, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, RUSSELL INVESTMENTS, NEW YORK: This strikes to me that the market is breathing a sigh of relief more than a nod of approval. I think there will be progress on individual and corporate tax cuts but they will come at the end of 2017. This will be positive for the economy and markets. We think there will be knots in the floss to get legislation done. We expect to see more sloppiness in the legislative process so you have to focus on fundamentals. Valuation is currently very high in the equity space. The outlook for the United States is good, but we need very good fundamentals to justify current equity valuation. Europe is increasingly interesting from an equity perspective. One would be more comfortable with Europe compared with the U.S. Elections have consequences, and I think that this is the very first manifestation of it. It would be foolish to say that it doesnt reinvigorate Trump because ... earlier this week the main headlines were that the budget was an Obama-type budget instead of anything that was promised during the campaign. Once Republicans develop cohesion you are going to see more of a domino effect. Its like, We all got onboard with this (healthcare reform), whats stopping us from trying to get money for the wall or having tax reform thats going to be agreeable to the presidents agenda? So I think that it does in some way invigorate it.  GUY LEBAS, CHIEF FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT, PHILADELPHIA: What is a bit lost in the perception that Houses healthcare reform bill is positive for financial markets is a proposed repeal of a surcharge of roughly 3.9 percent on investment income on high-income individuals, which is in the Affordable Care Act. Now this bill goes to the Senate. For the market, the odds of passage of at least this version of repeal-and-replace in the Senate isnt very high. Its going to a tough sell in the Senate. This is largely a non-event for the bond market. Its more gearing up for tomorrows jobs report and what Yellen might say. RANDY FREDERICK, VICE PRESIDENT, TRADING AND DERIVATIVES, CHARLES SCHWAB, AUSTIN, TEXAS: I think anything that they (Republicans) get done, that they accomplish, popular or unpopular, will show that they have the ability to make progress and to get things done and work together. Because obviously the biggest divisions are not between the Democrats and the Republicans but within the Republican party. This puts the idea of tax reform a little bit closer to reality, simply because its shown that they have figured out a way to negotiate and work together. JOSEPH KRIST, PARTNER, CREDIT SPECIALIST, COURT STREET GROUP RESEARCH, NEW YORK:  It means that it satisfies those members of Congress who have made this a primary campaign issue and want to say they want to repeal Obamacare and we voted to did it. From a policy standpoint it is virtually meaningless. The bill from everything I have seen is virtually impossible to pass in the Senate.  I dont think this really should have any impact. The fundamentals driving peoples healthcare ideas came before the election. People looking at small standalone and rural hospitals, saw they were wall badly positioned for healthcare reform going forward, whether it be because of Obamacare, should it remain, due to cost reduction measures. And conversely people were looking at size as a really important factor, whether a large institution or large chains. The consolidation was already coming whether repealed or not. It is not really a big factor from a public finance fixed income perspective. You still want big balance sheets, large pools of cash and diversity revenues.  This morning going in the market was expecting the House was going to pass it and it did. This is just one of several different things Trump is trying to get accomplished. This is out of the way and now they have to go to tax reform. Thats something thats going to drag out for a while and probably the next key thing, aside from the geopolitical things that are going on.  As far as traders and investors I talk to, this (healthcare bill) isnt affecting their position or what they want to do.  RICK MECKLER, PRESIDENT, LIBERTYVIEW CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, JERSEY CITY, NEW JERSEY: The fact that they could pass this doesnt make much of a difference. The real risk in the near term to the so-called Trump rally was a failure to pass it. I dont know if this market is really that focused on healthcare as the big issue. I think theyre really focused on the tax plan. If they couldnt pass the healthcare, it would bode very poorly for the tax plan.  But the fact that they could pass the healthcare, even pass it in the House, and pass it so narrowly, I dont think it necessarily means the tax plan is more likely to come through. KEN POLCARI, DIRECTOR OF THE NYSE FLOOR DIVISION, ONEIL SECURITIES, NEW YORK: It passes the House, thats fine, now it goes to the Senate, and we know in the Senate it is going to have a very tough time. So even though it has passed the one, it is certainly not a done deal yet. Obamacare is still very much alive and intact.  The market has really been flat. I dont necessarily think this is such a surprise, after all the news reports today and yesterday, people were expecting it. They are all high-fiving and cheering and all that stuff in the Congress but it still has to go to the Senate and that is where it is going to run into some problems.  The market is again biding time, there is no reason its not really taking off, we are hitting our head at the ceiling, we have been hitting our head on the ceiling. If anything it is going to cause it, the catalyst is going to be the (French election) Sunday night. It is listless trading at the moment, nobody is making big huge bets one way or the other.

With support only from the panels Republicans, the bill approved by the House Financial Services Committee would eliminate significant parts of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law and place new restrictions on regulators monitoring Wall Street. The odds of the bill offered by Representative Jeb Hensarling becoming law are long, given staunch opposition by  Democrats to many of its central proposals. The bill marks the new Congress first attempt to significantly roll back existing financial rules after Republicans made gains in the 2016 election. President Donald Trump has identified easing rules on banks as a key component of his economic agenda and effort to spur lending and grow the economy. Critics of the bill argue that it undoes many of the critical protections enacted following the financial crisis and puts the nation at greater risk of another meltdown. If made law, the bill would repeal regulators ability to step in and wind down failing financial institutions. It also would hamstring their ability to identify and more closely regulate firms they believe are critical to the health of the financial system. Under the bill, banks that agree to adopt a 10 percent capital ratio would be allowed to receive an exemption from many of Dodd-Franks existing rules. It will also require regulators to get congressional approval on any major new rulemaking project, and overhaul the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The powers of that agency, created by Dodd-Frank, would be curtailed, limiting the steps it can take to punish wrongdoing by banks and subjecting it to a number of outside checks on its authority and funding. In addition, the bill significantly changes how the Federal Reserve operates, subjecting its monetary policy decision-making to a stricter rules-based process, while separating its economic policymaking from its financial regulatory work. Hensarling has said he expects the bill will be considered soon by the full House, where it likely would be passed by the Republican majority.  However, the Senate Banking Committee will be considering its own proposals to rework financial rules. More modest legislation coming from that committee is more likely to become law, given it will likely be designed to attract necessary support from Democrats.

The U.S. president cast himself during his election campaign last year as a Washington outsider and a populist champion, and often seemed most comfortable at raucous campaign rallies. Trump still constantly tells Americans what is on his mind through prolific use of Twitter messages, but he has not traveled out into the country often since taking office on Jan. 20.  Trump made comments at official appearances 132 times in the first 100 days, compared with 139 by Barack Obama in the same period, 177 by George W. Bush and 162 by Bill Clinton. (tmsnrt.rs/2p8M8EU) Some 22 of his appearances were in settings other than the White House, Air Force One, a government agency or at Mar-a-Lago, a Florida resort that his administration has called the winter White House. That compares to 62 such appearances by Obama in his first 100 days, 80 for Bush and 46 for Clinton. Reuters reviewed public remarks delivered by the presidents using White House websites, pool reports and documents archived by the American Presidency Project at the University of California, Santa Barbara.  Trump made public comments on five separate occasions at Mar-a-Lago. None of the other three presidents spoke to the public from a personal residence during their first 100 days, although Bush spoke twice at Camp David, the rustic presidential retreat in Maryland.     Asked about his travel, Trumps advisers say he is focused on implementing the promises he made at his campaign rallies.  There is obviously a premium on his time, said White House spokeswoman Natalie Strom. We proceed with any additional travel very thoughtfully.  Bradley Blakeman, who was deputy assistant for scheduling and appointments under Bush, said Trump may be missing out on opportunities to sell his message to the public.  Deals are made in Washington on Pennsylvania Avenue, but they are sold on Main Street, USA, Blakeman said. Its an important part of the bully pulpit.  He said Trump should do targeted events focused on specific legislative priorities that will get coverage by local news outlets, where stories on presidential visits tend to be more positive than in the national media.  During his first 100 days, Bush visited more than half a dozen schools in Washington and at least five different states as he promoted his education initiative, No Child Left Behind.  Trumps first major legislative push has focused on reforming the U.S. healthcare system, but he has not yet delivered remarks at a medical facility. In an interview with Reuters last week, Trump lamented the confining nature of the presidency with its 24-hour Secret Service protection. Youre really into your own little cocoon, because you have such massive protection that you really cant go anywhere, he said. Still, he remains a constant focus of public attention, helped by his use of Twitter, a tool that was seldom used or was entirely unavailable to his most recent three predecessors. Interaction online does not completely replace the value of in-person appearances, but you cant ignore the fact that there is no limit on the amount of people the presidents tweets can reach, Strom said. Larry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, said that while Trumps use of social media had opened a new chapter in presidential communication, his lack of sustained attention on any one issue undercut his message.  Theres not a focus there. When a president is all over the map, then he loses his power, Jacobs said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Trumps executive order to mark the National Day of Prayer will also mandate regulatory relief to religious employers that object to contraception, such as Little Sisters of the Poor, the official said in a briefing. The order does not include provisions to allow government agencies and businesses to deny services to gay people in the name of religious freedom, as was feared by some civil liberties and gay rights groups. This executive order isnt about discrimination, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Anything currently illegal under current law would still be illegal.  It directs the IRS to exercise maximum enforcement discretion to alleviate the burden of the Johnson amendment which prohibits religious leaders from speaking about politics and candidate from the pulpit, the official said. Trump frequently complained about the 1954 law known as the Johnson amendment during his campaign for the presidency, bolstering his support among religious conservatives who contend it violates free speech and religious freedom rights. Changing the law altogether would require action in the Republican-led U.S. Congress. And it provides regulatory relief for religious objectors to Obamacares burdensome preventive services mandate, which is a position supported by the Supreme Court decision in Hobby Lobby, the official said. In the case of Hobby Lobby, an arts and crafts retailer, the high court said certain employers could, on religious grounds, choose to not pay for employee contraception mandated under President Barack Obamas signature healthcare law.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Wednesday outlined for his staff how an America First agenda translates into foreign policy, but did not address the Trump administrations proposed budget cuts, which worry many diplomats. It was the first time Tillerson had addressed all employees since his first day on the job on Feb. 2, when he spoke to hundreds of State Department officials in the buildings lobby, and the most thorough explanation yet of the Trump administrations approach to foreign policy. Some allies and even some U.S. officials have interpreted Republican President Donald Trumps America First agenda, which puts Americans interests at home ahead of those of its partners overseas, as a threat to retreat from the world. Tillerson said U.S. foreign policy priorities had gotten a little bit out of balance in the previous decades, with the United States too focused on promoting economic activity and trade with emerging economies. These are really important relationships to us, and theyre really important alliances, but weve got to bring them back into balance, he said, speaking without notes and walking around the stage in a packed State Department auditorium. He also signaled that the United States would de-emphasize human rights concerns in some of its interactions with other countries, saying that while U.S. values remain constant, its policies can adapt. If we condition too heavily that others must adopt this value that weve come to over a long history of our own, it really creates obstacles to our ability to advance our national security interests, our economic interests, Tillerson said. Tillerson gave a tour of U.S. priorities around the world, including in East Asia, Russia, Africa, and the Western Hemisphere, omitting Europe. With regard to North Koreas nuclear program, Tillerson said the administration is willing to use so-called secondary sanctions to target foreign companies that continue to do business with Pyongyang in contravention of United Nations sanctions. The pressure campaign on North Korea is at about dial setting 5 or 6 right now, Tillerson said. On China, Tillerson said the United States has a tremendous opportunity to define its relationship with the superpower for the next several decades, and that he sensed great interest by the Chinese leadership to do that as well. He and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis will chair a dialogue with their Chinese counterparts in June, in addition to a dialogue focused on economics and trade and led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. Tillerson said he had told Russian President Vladimir Putin during his visit to Moscow last month that U.S.-Russia relations were at their lowest point since the Cold War.  He did not disagree, Tillerson said. He shrugged his shoulders and nodded in agreement. But in remarks lasting nearly 40 minutes, Tillerson did not address the administrations proposed 28 percent budget cut for U.S. diplomacy and foreign aid, which would reduce funding for the United Nations, climate change and cultural exchange programs. That proposal has made many American diplomats and aid workers anxious.  The Trump administration also has not named candidates for the vast majority of State Department positions requiring Senate confirmation, and many are being filled by career diplomats in acting positions. Tillerson began his remarks by thanking those officials, to applause from the crowd. One veteran official who watched the speech criticized Tillersons use of the America First slogan. The phrase was used in the 1930s by isolationists who sought to keep the United States out of World War Two. The fact that they still use America First shows they know nothing about history, and whats worse is they dont care. Its offensive, said the official, who requested anonymity. Tillersons remarks followed an invitation to State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development employees this week to participate in an online survey to help identify efficiency improvements, in line with a March directive from Trump to reorganize governmental functions and eliminate unnecessary agencies. In his speech, the secretary urged employees to fill out the survey and give input on how to reform the agency. Tillerson said the State Department, like many institutions, was built for the Cold War era. He said he recognized that deep change to the State Department is really stressful for a lot of people and said the administration has no preconceived notions on the outcome of a review. One State Department official faulted Tillerson for not talking in detail about the budget cuts, as well as for not taking questions from employees. Previous secretaries of state, including Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice and Hillary Clinton, held question-and-answer sessions with State Department employees within weeks of taking office. They wanted to make this look like he was talking to us, but it was more about the appearance than any substance, said the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Two other State Department officials, however, spoke highly of Tillersons remarks, saying it was early to expect him to take questions from the rank and file and saying he provided guidance both on foreign policy and on the challenge of reorganizing the department. I can understand folks wanting more details. I just dont think we are in a place where he can provide more details, said one of these officials about the expected State Department budget cuts. My big takeaway was put on your big-girl britches, and when you look back you will feel like you were part of making this reform happen. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump vowed on Wednesday to do whatever is necessary to broker peace between Israel and the Palestinians as he hosted Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the White House, but gave no sign of how he could revive long-stalled negotiations. In their first meeting, Trump pressed Abbas to do more to stop incitement to violence against Israelis and, according to the White House, urged him in private to halt payments to families of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails, a demand long pressed by Israel. Even as Trump boldly predicted he would achieve peace where other presidents had failed, he stopped short of explicitly recommitting his administration to a two-state solution to the decades-old conflict, a long-standing foundation of U.S. policy. Some Palestinians said they were disappointed by the omission. Despite what many experts see as a long-shot bid, Trump told Abbas: I will do whatever is necessary. ... I would love to be a mediator or an arbitrator or a facilitator, and we will get this done. Abbas reasserted the goal of a Palestinian state, saying it must have East Jerusalem as its capital with the borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East war.  Most Israelis want all of Jerusalem as their capital and reject a full return to 1967 borderlines as a threat to their security. Trump has faced deep skepticism at home and abroad over the chances for him to achieve any quick breakthrough, not least because his administration has yet to articulate a cohesive strategy for restarting the moribund peace process. Abbas White House talks followed a February visit by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who moved to reset ties after a combative relationship with the Republican presidents predecessor, Democrat Barack Obama.  Trump sparked international criticism at the time, when he appeared to back away from a two-state solution, saying he would leave it up to the parties to decide. Palestinian statehood has been the objective of successive U.S. administrations and the international community. The meeting with Abbas, the Western-backed head of the Palestinian Authority, was another test of whether Trump, in office a little more than 100 days, is serious about pursuing the kind of comprehensive peace deal that eluded his predecessors. Trump insisted he was ready to try to reach the toughest deal. But when he later sat down to lunch with the Palestinian leader, he said it was maybe not as difficult as people have thought over the years. Trump, who said he decided to start a process but offered no new policy prescriptions or timetable, may be underestimating the challenge when trust between the two sides is low, analysts said. You cant just pretend you only have to handle a few key issues and thats it, said David Makovsky, a member of Obamas negotiating team during the last talks, which collapsed in 2014. Still, plans are being firmed up for Trump to visit Netanyahu in Jerusalem and possibly Abbas in the West Bank on May 22 and 23, say people familiar with the matter. That has sparked speculation about a meeting of the three. U.S. and Israeli officials have declined to confirm the visit. Trump and Abbas appeared friendly but businesslike as they stood at side-by-side lecterns. But that was a far cry from the way Trump and Netanyahu interacted in February. Abbas promised that under your courageous stewardship and your wisdom, as well as your great negotiating ability, the Palestinians would be partners seeking a historic peace treaty. But under pressure at home to avoid major concessions, the 82-year-old leader said: Its about time for Israel to end its occupation, referring to Jewish settlements in the West  Bank. Abbas, however, did not repeat in public his demand that Israel freeze settlement construction on land Palestinians want for a state as a condition for negotiations. U.S. lawmakers have warned that Palestinian funding could be cut off unless Abbas halts PLO stipends to families of prisoners whom Israel considers terrorists but many Palestinians see as heroes. There was no indication Abbas, who governs in the West Bank while Hamas militants rule Gaza, bowed to pressure on the issue, especially with hundreds of Palestinian prisoners on hunger strike. In Gaza, Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri said the promises Abbas made at the White House dont obligate anyone. Questions have been raised about Trumps choice of son-in-law Jared Kushner to oversee the peace initiative, along with Trumps longtime business lawyer, Jason Greenblatt, as envoy. Efforts to enlist Israels Sunni Arab neighbors, who share Israeli concerns about Shiite Iran, to help rejuvenate peacemaking, have yet to yield results. National security adviser H.R. McMaster described Trumps foreign policy approach as disruptive, saying his unconventional ways could create an opportunity to help stabilize the Middle East. But Trumps unpredictability has even at times rattled a close ally like Israel. His pro-Israeli campaign rhetoric suggested he might give Netanyahu free rein. But Trumps promise to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv is on the back burner, and he caught Netanyahu off-guard by asking him to put unspecified limits on settlement activity.

In four hours of testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Comey delivered his most impassioned defense yet of a decision that many Democrats believe cost them the White House: telling Congress 11 days before the Nov. 8 election that the FBI had uncovered a new trove of Clinton-related emails. Comey said he felt he had to speak out at that time because he had repeatedly told lawmakers the Clinton email probe was over. To not speak about it would require an act of concealment in my view, Comey said. Concealing, in my view, would be catastrophic. He told the panel one reason for the FBIs renewed interest in Clintons case was that investigators had found emails, some of them classified, forwarded by Clintons assistant Huma Abedin to her husband, who was not authorized to see such information. It makes me mildly nauseous to think that we might have had some impact on the election, but honestly, it wouldnt change the decision, Comey said. The FBI, which is supposed to remain politically neutral, said a few days later that the new emails did not change its  decision not to recommend criminal charges against Clinton, but many Democrats believe the political damage was done. Clinton said on Tuesday her election bid was derailed in part by Comeys announcement about the renewed probe of her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. She said her effort also was damaged by the WikiLeaks release of her campaign chairman John Podestas emails, allegedly stolen by Russian hackers.         Senator Dianne Feinstein, ranking member on the committee, led the Democrats in hammering Comey with questions about why he went public with the Clinton probe but kept silent on an  investigation related to the Republican candidate, Donald Trump. Its still very unclear - and I hope director that you will clear this up - why the FBIs treatment of these two investigations was so dramatically different, she asked.  U.S. intelligence agencies in December accused Russia of hacking of Democratic emails in an effort to tilt the election to Trump. Comey confirmed in March the FBI was investigating possible collusion between Trump surrogates and Russia. Comey said on Wednesday the probe into whether Russian hacking activities and American citizens was a classified investigation in its early stages  far different from the almost completed email probe.   Comey declined to comment on whether Trump, or anyone else, had been ruled out as a possible subject. Moscow has denied the hacking allegations. The FBI director acknowledged recent months have been difficult. But I think Ive done the right thing at each turn. Im not on anybodys side. Its so hard for people to see that, Comey said, adding later, I dont have any regrets. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trumps effort to roll back Obamacare gained momentum on Wednesday as Republican leaders scheduled a vote in the House of Representatives on Thursday on newly revised legislation. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy expressed confidence the bill would pass and several moderate Republican lawmakers who previously objected to the bill said they could now support it. A vote was expected as early as midday Thursday, with lawmakers planning to leave town later that day for a week-long recess. Late on Wednesday, the bill cleared a procedural step allowing it to advance to the House floor. Even if a narrow majority in the House approves the bill, it still faces a steep climb in the Senate, where only a few defections could kill the effort. Keen to score his first major legislative win since taking office in January, Trump threw his own political capital behind the bill, meeting with lawmakers and calling them in an effort to cajole their support. Trump, whose Republican party controls both the House and Senate, is seeking to make good on his campaign promise to repeal and replace Obamacare. Aides said he worked the phones furiously. Wavering moderate Republicans had worried that the  legislation to overhaul President Barack Obamas 2010 signature healthcare law would leave too many people with pre-existing medical conditions unable to afford health coverage. But several Republican skeptics got behind the bill after they met with Trump to float a compromise proposal that is still expected to face unanimous Democratic opposition. The legislations prospects brightened further after members of the Freedom Caucus, a faction of conservative lawmakers in the House who played a key role in derailing the original version of the bill last month, said they could go along with the compromise. The bill is also receiving a torrent of opposition from medical groups, including the American Medical Association, who say millions of Americans will lose coverage or face higher costs. Millions more Americans got healthcare coverage under Obamacare, but Republicans have long attacked it. They view it as a government intrusion into the healthcare system and blame it for driving up costs. Called the American Health Care Act, the Republican bill would repeal most Obamacare taxes, including a penalty for not buying health insurance. It would slash funding for Medicaid, the program that provides insurance for the poor, and roll back much of Medicaids expansion.  The latest effort comes after earlier pushes by Trump for healthcare reform collapsed twice, underscoring the difficulty of rallying together the Republican partys divided factions. Earlier this week, prospects for the legislation appeared grim as several influential moderate Republicans said they could not support the bill, citing their concerns about protecting people with pre-existing conditions. Putting a spotlight on the concerns about pre-existing conditions, late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel made a tearful plea for keeping that provision in Obamacare as he recounted a medical emergency that arose with his newborn son.   Kimmels monologue about his sons congenital heart condition was viewed nearly 19 million times on his shows Facebook page and on Wednesday morning was the No. 1 trending story on YouTube. Republican Representatives Fred Upton and Billy Long, who were part of a group of moderate lawmakers who met at the White House with Trump, said the president endorsed their plan to add $8 billion over five years to help cover the cost for people with pre-existing illnesses who could otherwise be priced out of insurance markets. Describing Trumps efforts to secure his support, Long said Trump told him: Billy we really need you, man. Representative Mark Meadows, chairman of the conservative Freedom Caucus, said the new language on pre-existing conditions was a net plus for garnering the votes needed to pass the healthcare bill. Critics of the changes to the law, including several health policy experts, said the $8 billion could not be enough to cover the cost of coverage for the sickest patients. Republicans did not await a new score from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to see how many people would be insured under their revised plan and how much it would cost. Health insurers, such as Anthem Inc (ANTM.N), UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N), Aetna Inc (AET.N) and Cigna Corp (CI.N), have faced months of uncertainty over healthcares future. So have hospital companies, such as HCA Holdings Inc (HCA.N) and Tenet Healthcare Corp (THC.N). On Wednesday, Aetna said it will exit the Obamacare individual insurance market in Virginia next year, citing growing uncertainty and expected losses this year. House Democrats rejected the latest change to the Republican legislation on Wednesday, saying patients with pre-existing illnesses would be vulnerable to being pushed off their insurance in certain states and face higher costs.  This is deadly, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi told a news conference. No Band-Aid will fix it.  Democrats have long thought their best chance of stopping the repeal would be in the Senate, where only a few Republicans would need to defect to stop the law from moving forward. The difficulty in the House is now making Democrats optimistic that Republicans will face backlash from voters and face losing seats in the 2018 midterm elections.

The exemption, championed by states such as California but opposed by the mutual fund industry, had freed the state-run plans from the strict compliance requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA. Private-sector workers whose employers do not offer 401(k) or other retirement benefits, and who often have low incomes, are automatically enrolled in plans being launched in some states, such as Illinois. States say the exemption would have let employers pass workers money into plans without footing ERISA compliance costs. It stoked fights in Washington, however, over the reach of federal regulation, states rights and income inequality. The Republican-led Senate passed the resolution repealing the exemption by a vote of 50-49. The House of Representatives, also controlled by Republicans, previously approved the measure, which President Donald Trump is expected to sign into law.  It was the 14th Obama-era rule killed by Congress under the once-obscure Congressional Review Act, which allows lawmakers to repeal newly minted regulations and forbids agencies from enacting similar rules in the future. In mid-April, Trump signed a nearly identical resolution affecting city-run retirement plans, which are in the design stages. But the resolution for state-run plans was stuck in limbo for weeks, as Republicans struggled to gather votes and major lobby groups representing retirees and business interests turned up the heat on lawmakers. Senator Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, missed Wednesdays vote because of minor heart surgery, helping the Senate avoid a tie. Republican Senator Todd Young of Indiana broke party ranks to oppose the resolution, saying Americans were in a real and ongoing crisis to save enough money for retirement. While state-based retirement plans are not my first choice, if implemented carefully, they could help close the retirement savings gap, he said in a statement to Reuters. The California plans primary champion, Democratic state Senator Kevin de Leon, expressed outrage at the vote, saying taxpayers would ultimately foot the bills of people who retire without adequate savings. Wall Street investment firms fear their profits will take a hit ... even though the investment industry has historically ignored middle- and lower-income workers at medium- and small-sized businesses, he said in a statement. The mutual fund, insurance and securities industries said the exemption would have denied some workers protections that are guaranteed for others.  Denying ERISA protections to workers who are automatically enrolled would limit their legal remedies to fight against high fees or mismanagement of the plans, said Paul Schott Stevens, president of the Investment Company Institute, a trade group representing funds holding $19.3 trillion in assets and that are often used to save for retirement.

The Obama Presidential Center will be built in the 500-acre (200-hectare) Jackson Park on Chicagos South Side. The park was first developed as the site of the 1893 Worlds Fair.  The development will feature three buildings - a museum, forum and library - forming a campus around a plaza. The museum, the tallest of the three structures, will include public areas, offices and classrooms in addition to exhibition space, the Obama Foundation said in a statement.  What we want this to be is the worlds premier institution for training young people and leadership to make a difference in their communities, in their countries and in the world. That is our goal, Obama said at the design unveiling in Chicago.  Obama has slowly started to return to the public eye since leaving office in January. Last month he moderated an event at the University of Chicago during his first major appearance since leaving the White House. The project will take around four years to complete, Obama said, but educational programs will begin this year. Obama said Wednesday he would donate $2 million to a summer jobs programs in the community.   Obama grew up in Hawaii and went to college in New York and California, but owns a home and spent most of his pre-White House political career in Chicago, starting as a community activist before becoming an Illinois state senator and then a U.S. senator. Chicago beat out proposals by New York City and Hawaii to be the home of the library. Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects Partners of New York and Interactive Design Architects of Chicago were named last year as the firms that will lead the design of the center. Residents of Chicagos South Side, which includes many poor and crime-ridden neighborhoods, hope jobs and investment come with the library.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - After months of internal discord, Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday were still trying to craft a bill to overhaul the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, a law they have been attacking since it was enacted in 2010. Two attempts in recent weeks to pass an overhaul bill have collapsed in confusion, with conservatives pushing for a more complete repeal and moderates keen to avoid going too far for fear of angering their constituents. Obamacare brought health insurance coverage to millions of Americans. The first version of the Republican bill, known as the American Health Care Act, or AHCA, would have left 24 million more Americans without coverage, according to an estimate by nonpartisan congressional researchers. The House has recently added two amendments to the AHCA to try to appease both conservatives and moderates. Here are the latest versions of the bills main provisions:  The Republican plan would maintain some of Obamacares most popular provisions. It would allow young adults to stay on their parents health plan until age 26 and it would ban insurers from setting a lifetime dollar limit on coverage. An amendment introduced by moderate Republican Representative Tom MacArthur would let states opt out of Obamacares mandate that insurers charge sick and healthy people the same rates. It would also allow states to opt out of Obamacares requirement that insurers cover 10 essential health benefits, such as maternity care and mental health treatment.  The measure would provide states with $100 billion, largely to fund high-risk pools to provide insurance to the sickest patients. An amendment added Wednesday would provide another $8 billion over five years to help those with pre-existing conditions pay for health insurance. The bill would let insurers mark up premiums by 30 percent for those who have a lapse in insurance coverage of about two months or more. Insurers won another provision they had long sought: The ability to charge older Americans up to five times more than young people. Under Obamacare, they could only charge up to three times more. The Republicans want to end in 2018 Obamacares income-based tax credits that help low-income people buy insurance. These would be replaced with age-based tax credits ranging from $2,000 to $4,000 per year that would be capped at upper-income levels. While Obamacares credits gave more help to those with lower incomes, the Republican plan would be largely age-based. The Republican bill would abolish most Obamacare taxes, including on medical devices, health insurance premiums, indoor tanning salons, prescription medications and high-cost employer-provided insurance known as Cadillac plans. Those taxes paid for Obamacare. Republicans have not said how they would pay for the parts of the law they want to keep. The bill would also repeal the Obamacare financial penalty for the 2016 tax year for not purchasing insurance, as well as a surtax on investment income earned by upper-income Americans. It would repeal the mandate that larger employers must offer insurance to their employees.  Under Obamacare, more than 30 states, including about a dozen Republican states, expanded the Medicaid government health insurance program for the poor. About half of Obamacare enrollees obtained insurance through the expansion. The bill would allow the Medicaid expansion to continue until January 1, 2020, providing states chose not to expand. After that date, expansion would end and Medicaid funding would be capped on a per-person basis. State Medicaid plans would no longer have to cover some Obamacare-mandated essential health benefits, fulfilling a Republican promise to return more control to the states.

With the 309-118 vote in the Republican-controlled chamber, the legislation now goes to the Senate, which is expected to pass it before a midnight Friday deadline. The Pentagon is a big winner in the legislation, with defense spending rising significantly. While the bill cleared the House easily, dozens more Democrats voted for it than Republicans, many of whom oppose most spending measures. This was the first major legislation to pass the House this year with bipartisan support and marks Republican President Donald Trumps first legislative victory, even though he railed against some of its provisions. The legislation bulks up federal funding for border security but does not pay for starting construction on a U.S.-Mexico border wall that Trump promised to keep out illegal immigrants and drugs. Trump had said he would make Mexico pay for the wall, but the Mexican government refused, making it necessary for the new administration to ask Congress for the money. Democrats and many Republicans have argued that a wall is an ineffective and wasteful way of securing the southern border. Another battle over the barrier is expected when Congress tries to pass a spending bill for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1. Trump already has begun focusing on that upcoming fight. In a tweet on Tuesday, he taunted lawmakers, saying, Our country needs a good shutdown in September to fix mess! The legislation would add $12.5 billion this fiscal year for the Pentagon, with another $2.5 billion available after Trump gives details on his plans for defeating the Islamic State militant group. It ignores many of the spending cuts on domestic programs the White House had sought and adds $2 billion for the National Institutes of Health, $295 million for Puerto Ricos underfunded Medicaid healthcare for the poor and $407 million to fight fires in Western states. But the legislation is late in coming. The fiscal year began last Oct. 1 and for the last seven months federal agencies have been operating mainly on simple extensions of the previous years funding and the priorities that came with that.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Wednesday took its first step in replacing Obama-era banking regulators, naming a veteran financial lawyer as interim head of the watchdog for federally chartered banks. Keith Noreika, a partner at law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, will be first deputy comptroller at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and will run the OCC on an interim basis when Comptroller Thomas Curry leaves on May 5, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.  Former banker Joseph Otting, who worked with Mnuchin at Californian lender OneWest, is considered the lead contender to permanently replace Curry, several people familiar with the matter have said. That appointment requires Senate confirmation and analysts said they expected Noreika to be in charge for much of this year. U.S. President Donald Trump wants to overhaul regulation of the financial services system to make it easier for banks to lend and has asked Mnuchin to review the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law by June 3.  The OCC is one of several regulators that monitors the health of Wall Street banks but has a particularly influential role in scrutinizing lending practices. Under Curry, OCC bank examiners have clamped down on what they perceive as overly risky loans, particularly the type used to fund private equity buyouts. Curry used his position to warn banks when he thought they were talking on too much risk in loans to energy firms and property developers. Curry did use the bully pulpit to warn banks against risky activity and I think youre likely to see less of that going forward, said Ian Katz, financial policy analyst at research firm Capital Alpha.  The appointment of Noreika and the expected nomination of Otting meant limits on how much banks can lend to highly indebted companies may be loosened in the future, said Jaret Seiberg, analyst at Cowen Washington Research Group. This is the most bullish sign yet for the biggest banks that the Trump administration will pursue a traditional Republican approach of financial regulation rather than adopt a more populist tone that could include high leverage capital requirements, Seiberg said. Trumps plans to overhaul regulation are being held up by the governments current lean crew of regulators. While the Senate voted on Tuesday to confirm attorney Jay Clayton to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, the OCCs changing of the guard might not be so smooth. Democrats have criticized practices at OneWest, the lender created by Mnuchin after the 2008 housing crisis that foreclosed on 36,000 California families. Mnuchin hired Otting as chief executive of the bank in 2010 and he held that role until it was bought by CIT Group in 2014.  Noreikas background as a lawyer who has advised banks on M&A, including Ant Financials acquisition of Moneygram, as well as on the Volcker Rule, which prohibits banks from making speculative bets, is also controversial. It is disturbing that the President is rushing to replace Mr. Curry with an acting appointee who has clear conflicts of interest, and lacks any experience in running such an important agency, Ohio Democrat Sherrod Brown, the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, said in a statement. Noreikas appointment does not require Senate approval. Curry, a career regulator, was appointed by the Obama administration for a five-year term that expired last month and has since been serving under an extension.  While Curry took a tough line on risky lending, the agency did come under fire for its failure to tackle a sales practice abuse scandal at Wells Fargo & Co.  The OCC is also trying to establish itself as a regulator of online lenders and financial technology firms. State authorities have argued that is their job and are suing the OCC, arguing it lacks the legal authority to offer a banking charter for technology companies. There are also three vacant spots on the Federal Reserve Board, including the post of vice chair of supervision, which will play a key role in any overhaul of bank regulation. Earlier on Wednesday, Mnuchin told a conference of community bankers that Trump had signed off on a nominee to fill the vice chair role but did not name the person. Reuters had previously reported that Randal Quarles, who worked as under secretary for domestic finance at the Treasury under President George W. Bush, was a leading candidate. Mnuchin said the administration was also close to naming the two other Fed selections. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

(Reuters) - Russia succeeded in its goals of sowing discord in U.S. politics by meddling in the 2016 presidential election, which will likely inspire similar future efforts, two top former U.S. voices on intelligence said on Tuesday. Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers agreed at a panel at Harvard University that Russia likely believed it had achieved its goals and could attempt to repeat its performance in elections in other countries. Their purpose was to sew discontent and mistrust in our elections they wanted us to be at each others throat when it was over, Rogers said at the panel at Harvards Kennedy School of Government. Its influencing, I would say, legislative process today. Thats wildly successful. Congressional committees have been investigating the issue since U.S. intelligence agencies in January concluded Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered hacking of Democratic political groups to sway the election toward Republican Donald Trump. Moscow has denied any such meddling and Trump has been dismissive of the intelligence suggesting Russian involvement. Clapper said that Russia had long sought to influence U.S. voter behavior but discovered it could be far more effective at a lower cost by using social media to spread misinformation. This is the most assertive, most aggressive and most directly impactful of any engagement that they have had in our elections, Clapper said at the event, in Cambridge, Massachusetts just outside Boston. They have to regard what they did as a huge success. Theyve been doing it in France and theyll do it in Germany. Russia has also denied attempting to influence Frances presidential election. Rogers maintained that he did not believe that Russia had specifically attempted to boost Trumps chances of victory.  They saw the same polls that we did, Rogers said. Some notion that the Russians knew that Trump had an opportunity to win this thing more than U.S. public pollsters thought, I find ridiculous. The congressional probe on whether Russia attempted to influence the election in favor is not the only investigation into relations between Moscow and the Trump administration. The Pentagon has also launched an investigation into whether Michael Flynn, Trumps former national security adviser, accepted money from foreign entities without the required approval.

Iowa Governor Terry Branstad said he would use his decades of experience with China to press Beijing to do more to encourage North Korea to curb its nuclear ambitions. Theres other things they can do diplomatically and economically to send a clear signal that they, as well as the United States and other countries in the world, do not tolerate this expansion of nuclear technology and missiles, Branstad said at his confirmation hearing. Pressed, Branstad said there may well be a role for measures such as imposing secondary sanctions on Chinese banks or other entities that violated U.N. Security Council resolutions by doing business with North Korea. He offered few specifics. In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang reiterated that China was serious about enforcing U.N. resolutions and, referring to the possibility of secondary U.S. sanctions, said China opposed other countries using their law to sanction others or to harm Chinese interests. Chinese President Xi Jinping has called Branstad, 70, an old friend after decades of dealings on agricultural trade. But the Republican governor insisted he would take on difficult issues complicating Washingtons relationship with its largest trading partner and major creditor. That would contrast with Trumps recent warm words for Xi, which have caused some U.S. allies to wonder if Trumps focus on working with China on North Korea means Washington may not still have their backs. The fact that the leader of China calls us an old friend, doesnt mean that Im going to be at all reluctant or bashful of bringing up issues ... be it human rights or intellectual property rights, Branstad told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

He warned against focusing on short-term goals at the expense of long-term U.S. interests. Theres no country in the world that we have so many issues with, Corker said. Branstad took a hard line on the South China Sea, saying, China cannot be allowed to use its artificial islands to coerce its neighbors or limit freedom of navigation or overflight.

As he struggles to produce wins, some signs of frustration are starting to appear. Democrats gleeful declarations that they outsmarted Republicans in a battle over a spending bill that avoided a government shutdown drew the ire of the president. Democrats were happy that funding for Trumps Mexico border wall was not included.  Trump tweeted on Tuesday that maybe a government shutdown would not be so bad and that Republicans should consider changing Senate rules to make it easier to pass spending and other bills without any Democratic support.  Our country needs a good shutdown in September to fix mess! he wrote.  His comment frustrated some of his fellow Republicans in  Congress, who chafed at the suggestion that the White House could dictate Senate rules, or send a message that a shutdown, which costs the economy millions, was desirable. I think it would be a good thing at this point if the iPhone was put in a safe, locked away and maybe returned in four years, Republican Senator Bob Corker, who was once on the short list to be Trumps vice president, told reporters. Thats just not constructive. Those are the kinds of things that should never happen, and... its damaging to our credibility. Its damaging to trust here within the (Capitol) building, Corker said. Trump marked his 100th day in office on Saturday and used last week to argue that he has made major progress in rolling back federal regulations and improving the climate for job creation. But with his healthcare reform effort flagging, Trump has been unable to get a major piece of legislation through a Congress controlled by his own Republican Party, leaving him without a signature victory. With Democrats celebrating concessions they extracted in the spending bill, Trump used a Rose Garden ceremony honoring the Air Force Academys football team to declare he and Republicans got more from the legislation than might appear. After years of partisan bickering and gridlock, this bill is a clear win for the American people, Trump said. White House budget director Mick Mulvaney gave three news briefings to promote Trump gains from the bill, the first on Monday night and the second on Tuesday morning in a conference call for reporters. The conference call was marred by technical issues at times, with Mulvaney straining to be heard over orchestra music that mysteriously began playing. All right, Mulvaney told reporters at one point. Ill try to answer it one more time, and clearly were having a lot of background noise here. Later, in the White House briefing room, Mulvaney said he understood Trumps frustration, accusing Democrats of trying to spike the football by publicly celebrating the budget deal as a Democratic victory in an effort to make the president look bad after he negotiated in good faith. He said Democrats were thwarted by Republicans in their attempt to add bailout money for Puerto Rico. Weve got a lot to do between now and September. I dont anticipate a shutdown in September, but if the Democrats arent going to behave any better than they have in the last couple of days, it may be inevitable, Mulvaney said. Democrats quickly denounced Trumps musings about closing the federal government. Here we saw Democrats and Republicans working together in the best traditions of the Senate, and the president disparages it in a way thats destructive, Democratic Senate Leader Chuck Schumer said.   Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate would debate the funding bill this week and that most Republicans did not favor a change in the rules to make it easier to pass legislation without Democratic support. Trump said his fellow Republicans had to acquiesce to Democratic demands in spending bill because the partys majority was too slim to win the 60 Senate votes needed to advance the legislation without them. Republicans hold 52 of the Senates 100 seats. The reason for the plan negotiated between the Republicans and Democrats is that we need 60 votes in the Senate which are not there!

A senior House of Representatives Republican aide said on Tuesday night no decision had been made on bringing legislation to the floor this week before the House is due to start a week-long break late on Thursday. A bill would need to be filed by late Tuesday night or early Wednesday morning to hold the vote before the break.  Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, who heads the conservative House Freedom Caucus faction that helped block Trumps first attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, said earlier on Tuesday Republicans were still a handful of votes away. The lack of movement among Republicans puts Trump in danger of his second major legislative setback, raising questions about his ability to secure passage of other parts of his agenda, including a major tax reform plan. Most House Freedom Caucus Republicans have gotten on board with the new proposal, but Democrats are vowing to oppose any attempt to unravel Democratic former President Barack Obamas signature healthcare overhaul.  The latest Republican plan would allow states to opt out of Obamacare provisions that force insurers to charge sick and healthy people the same rates. That is seen as a concession to conservatives to attract their votes. Trump insisted in an interview with CBS News that aired on Sunday that the protections for those with pre-existing conditions would remain. I think its time now for a healthcare vote, the Republican president said at the White House on Tuesday.   Even if a plan passes the House, it is expected to face a tough fight in the Senate, where Republicans have a narrower majority. Republicans contend that Obamas signature 2010 healthcare law, which allowed some 20 million Americans to gain medical insurance, is too intrusive and expensive. The White House sent Vice President Mike Pence to the Capitol on Tuesday to meet Republican holdouts on the partys latest effort to pass a healthcare overhaul. Republicans remain divided over key aspects of the healthcare bill, with some lawmakers worrying about a potential spike in the number of people without coverage, or sharp increases in insurance premiums. Representative Daniel Webster, whose central Florida district is home to many retirees, said Pence told him he would try to work out problems caused by proposed Medicaid spending caps that would limit nursing-home beds. I just think its going to cost us a lot in Florida, Webster said. Another Florida Republican, Thomas Rooney, said confusion over the potential loss of coverage for pre-existing conditions had his constituents scared that theyre going to die because of a vote that we might be taking. Conservative groups such as the Club for Growth and Heritage Action started to increase pressure on moderate Republicans who were resisting the bill, such as Representative Billy Long of  Missouri. Billy is using liberal talking points to distort the truth, Club for Growth President David McIntosh said, adding that Long may want to keep Obamacare. Left-leaning groups, including the Center for American Progress (CAP), were pushing their members to call lawmakers to urge them to oppose the healthcare bill, including via 7,000 medicine bottles delivered to congressional districts. Emily Tisch Sussman, a CAP organizer, said those efforts had generated tens of thousands of phone calls. Patient advocacy groups, including the American Heart Association and the American Diabetes Association, also oppose the reworked bill, while the American Medical Association and others have expressed concerns.

The House Financial Services Committee was due to consider Representative Jeb Hensarlings sweeping bill to rework the 2010 law. In addition to eliminating large portions of Dodd-Frank - enacted in the wake of the global financial crisis - it would put new handcuffs on regulators charged with writing and enforcing its rules. The partisan maneuvering to slow work on the bill demonstrated how divided the two parties are regarding rules for the financial sector, casting doubt on Congresss ability to revisit them significantly despite Republican President Donald Trumps vow to do a number on existing regulations. First, Democrats ordered a vote on whether the committee even wanted to actually consider the bill. That amendment passed with support from only the Republican majority. Then, Democrats ordered that all 589 pages of the law be read out loud by the committee clerk. The reading of legislative language is almost always waived by committee members when considering a bill. After about 3-1/2 hours of the bill being read to a largely empty committee room, Democrats agreed to shelve that request and proceed to the amendments they wanted to offer. Democrats had drawn up roughly 140 amendments they wanted to offer to change the bill, according to a House aide. But that number is expected to shrink as the two parties work out a path forward. Hensarling announced on Tuesday that despite earlier plans to vote on amendments to the bill throughout the day, no votes would be held on the bill until Wednesday morning at the earliest. The procedural obstacles were all aimed at a bill that is not expected to actually become law, as the sweeping rewrite of Dodd-Frank is not expected to garner enough support in the Senate, which the Republicans hold by a slim majority.  But it is expected to pass the Republican-led House, and the skirmish over it was a clear indication of how much Democrats are willing to dig in on measures that would make life easier for the financial sector. This is one of the worst bills Ive seen in my time in Congress, said Representative Maxine Waters, the committees top Democrat, as the committee began debate on the measure. The bill is rotten to the core, and simply carries water for Trump and his buddies on Wall Street. Hensarlings bill would allow large banks to avoid most Dodd-Frank rules if they agree to establish a 10 percent capital ratio, and also scraps several powers given to regulators after the financial crisis to more closely scrutinize some of the nations largest institutions. It also makes several changes to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, severely limiting its power and giving Congress and the White House more direct control over its operations and funding.

The report from the office of Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats was the first measure of the effects of the 2015 USA Freedom Act, which limited the NSA to collecting phone records and contacts of people U.S. and allied intelligence agencies suspect may have ties to terrorism. It found that the NSA collected the 151 million records even though it had warrants from the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance court to spy on only 42 terrorism suspects in 2016, in addition to a handful identified the previous year.     The NSA has been gathering a vast quantity of telephone metadata, records of callers and recipients phone numbers and the times and durations of the calls - but not their content - since the September 11, 2001, attacks. The report came as Congress faced a decision on whether to reauthorize Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which permits the NSA to collect foreign intelligence information on non-U.S. persons outside the United States, and is scheduled to expire at the end of this year. Privacy advocates have argued that Section 702 permits the NSA to spy on Internet and telephone communications of Americans without warrants from the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, and that foreign intelligence could be used for domestic law enforcement purposes in a way that evades traditional legal requirements. The report said that on one occasion in 2016, the FBI obtained information about an American in response to a search of Section 702 data intended to produce evidence of a crime not related to foreign intelligence.  The report did not address how frequently the FBI obtained information about Americans while investigating a foreign intelligence matter, however. On Friday, the NSA said it had stopped a form of surveillance that allowed it to collect the digital communications of Americans who mentioned a foreign intelligence target in their messages without a warrant.     The new report also came amid allegations, recently repeated by U.S. President Donald Trump, that former President Barack Obama ordered warrantless surveillance of his communications and that former national security adviser Susan Rice asked the NSA to unmask the names of U.S. persons caught in the surveillance. Both Republican and Democratic members of the congressional intelligence committees have said that so far they have found no evidence to support either allegation. Officials on Tuesday argued that the 151 million records collected last year were tiny compared with the number collected under procedures that were stopped after former NSA contractor Edward Snowden revealed the surveillance program in 2013. Because the 151 million would include multiple calls made to or from the same phone numbers, the number of people whose records were collected also would be much smaller, the officials said. They said they had no breakdown of how many individuals phone records were among those collected.  In all, according to the report, U.S. officials unmasked the names of fewer Americans in NSA eavesdropping reports in 2016 than they did the previous year, the top U.S. intelligence officer reported on Tuesday. The report said the names of 1,934 U.S. persons were unmasked last year in response to specific requests, compared with 2,232 in 2015, but it did not identify who requested the names or on what grounds. Officials said in the report that U.S. intelligence agencies had gone out of their way to make public more information about U.S. electronic eavesdropping. This years report continues our trajectory toward greater transparency, providing additional statistics beyond what is required by law, said Office of the Director of National Intelligence spokesman Timothy Barrett.

Notice came shortly after the U.S. Department of Agriculture relaxed some school lunch rules that were part of former first lady Michelle Obamas signature effort to fight childhood obesity. The Food and Drug Administration late on Monday extended the compliance date for the calorie labeling rule from May 5, 2017, to May 7, 2018, to enable further consideration of ways to cut costs and make requirements more flexible. The rule was designed to help U.S. consumers, who eat and drink about one-third of their calories away from home, battle the bulge. It is part of the Affordable Care Act of 2010, also known as Obamacare, which the Trump administration has vowed to repeal and replace in a bid to slash regulations it considers harmful to business.  Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, who oversees the FDA, said in a statement his agency believed in promoting sound nutrition and applauded the delay. Imposing burdensome rules that leave business managers and owners worried about harsh potential penalties and less able to serve their customers is unwise and unhelpful, Price said. The rules opponents, including Dominos Pizza Inc, movie theater operators, and convenience and grocery stores, have pushed for delays over the years.   But even if the calorie disclosure rule is killed at the federal level, it is unlikely to go away. Chains like Panera Bread Co and McDonalds Corp, have been displaying such information for years in compliance with rules set by California, New York City and other jurisdictions. Panera in 2010 became the first national chain to post calorie counts for its salads, sandwiches and pastries.  Sara Burnett, Paneras director of food policy and wellness, said customers want to know what is in the food they eat, so the chain will continue to comply with the federal law as it was written. Its information that helps our guests make informed decisions, Burnett said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The two leaders spoke by phone for the first time since U.S. relations with Russian were strained by the U.S. attack on a Syrian airfield. They two leaders set the foundation for what could be their first face-to-face meeting in July. Statements from both the White House and the Kremlin suggested the two leaders had a productive conversation that included North Korea and fighting Islamist militants throughout the Middle East. A senior Trump administration official said Putin had requested the call and described it as an effort to present his ideas for Syria.  Trump ordered 59 cruise missiles launched in retaliation for a chemical weapons attack that the United States blamed on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The attacked prompted protests from Assad ally Russia, which blamed Syrian rebels for the use of outlawed nerve gas and said Assad was not at fault. The White House said the two leaders agreed that all parties must do all they can to end the violence in Syria. The conversation was a very good one, and included the discussion of safe, or de-escalation, zones to achieve lasting peace for humanitarian and many other reasons, a White House statement said. Trump during his presidential campaign last year frequently said he wanted safe zones established for Syrian refugees, paid for by Gulf states, to alleviate any need for the refugees to move elsewhere, including to the United States. Candidate Trump had also expressed a desire for a U.S. alliance with Russia to fight Islamist militants, a goal that has been elusive since he took office on Jan. 20. With a ceasefire ever elusive in Syria, the White House said Washington would send a representative to ceasefire talks in Astana, Kazakhstan, on Wednesday and Thursday. The State Department said acting Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs Stuart Jones will attend as an observer. The decision to send Jones to the talks, even as an observer, is an indication that the United States is taking the Astana talks more seriously. Previously, the U.S. ambassador to Kazakhstan George Krol had attended the talks as an observer. The Kremlin said Putin and Trump agreed to step up dialogue on finding ways to strengthen a ceasefire and give it stability. The aim is to create the conditions for the launch for a real resolution process in Syria. This means that the Russian foreign minister and U.S. secretary of state will effectively inform the leaders about progress in this direction. The White House statement said Trump and Putin also spoke about how best to resolve the very dangerous situation in North Korea. With North Koreas nuclear and ballistic missile programs posing a major global challenge, the two leaders also discussed how to go about resolving a crisis that has raised tensions throughout the Asia-Pacific. Trump told Reuters in an interview last week that a major, major conflict was possible with North Korea, amping up pressure on Pyongyang to stand down and for China to rein in the north. The dangerous situation on the Korean peninsula was discussed in detail. Vladimir Putin called for restraint and for the level of tension to be reduced, the Kremlin said.

A scathing statement from Thomas A. Saunders III, chairman of The Heritage Foundations Board of Trustees, did not go into specifics of any disagreement but did cite problems with internal communications and other management issues. After a comprehensive and independent review of the entire Heritage organization, the Board determined there were significant and worsening management issues that led to a breakdown of internal communications and cooperation, Saunders said in a statement. While the organization has seen many successes, Jim DeMint and a handful of his closest advisers failed to resolve these problems.  Two political operatives who work with the organization said DeMints opponents argued that he had grown too close to Trump and too far from the conservative principles on which the organization was founded. Ed Feulner, who previously served as the Heritage president, will return to the role in an interim capacity until a replacement is found, according to a statement from the Heritage board.  DeMint, a former senator from South Carolina, took over the organization in 2013 after he retired from public office. Since then, he has transformed the organization once known for research and white papers into a political behemoth. For instance, he created an arm of the organization devoted entirely to influencing elections and pushing lawmakers to side with the groups policy positions. But as DeMint transformed the organization, unease grew within its ranks, according to the sources.  After Trump was elected, more than a dozen staffers from the Heritage Foundation and its political arm Heritage Action were deployed as volunteers to help with the transition process. Heritage staffers worked on teams deployed to set up a Trump government at the EPA, the Office of Management and Budget and the departments of Defense, Energy, Health and Human Services, State and Treasury.

(Reuters) - A Republican, a Democrat and a lobbyist for leading businesses in Florida huddled this spring at the state Capitol, mapping out the next move in a campaign to enact the first statewide LGBT anti-discrimination law in the U.S. South. A record number of Republican lawmakers had thrown their support behind proposed protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, and hundreds of companies backed the cause. While the bill has so far fallen short with time running out on the legislative session, its lead backers were heartened by their progress and determined to retool for next year. We definitely need to ramp up the grassroots, said Joseph Salzverg, a lobbyist for Florida Competes, a group of more than 450 state businesses supporting LGBT protections. Theres a lot of Republicans that agree with the policy but are worried about the effect it has back home. A year after transgender bathroom access erupted as a U.S. culture wars flashpoint, Florida is among the conservative statehouses where LGBT activists see momentum building for affirmative legislation. The nations third most-populous state, Florida could offer the next breakthrough in a national movement to advance LGBT civil-rights protections, viewed by advocates as stepping stones to their ultimate goal of federal anti-discrimination law. Only 18 states, mostly concentrated in the U.S. West and Northeast, and the District of Columbia have laws that fully guard against LGBT people being fired from jobs, kicked out of housing or denied services in restaurants, hotels and other businesses. This fight continues even after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June 2015 that legalized same-sex marriage nationally. Floridas strategy, years in the making, aims to build bipartisan support with economic arguments and the passage of similar measures locally that show the LGBT protections can succeed. The bills backers must convince a Republican-controlled state legislature that all of Florida benefits from LGBT protections. Its really about the math of being based here in Florida, but competing on a global market, said John J.T. Tonnison, president of Florida Competes.  Tonnison is chief information officer of Tech Data Corp, a technology distributor. In the state capital of Tallahassee this spring, he told legislators about a prized recruit reluctant to relocate from California, concerned about a gay son visiting a state without strong protections.   It sets us apart in a less-than-positive light, Tonnison said. Local LGBT protections are now in place in communities representing 60 percent of Floridas more than 20 million residents. In conservative north Florida, the states largest city, Jacksonville, recently passed a nondiscrimination policy after a fight that lasted years. Local successes helped convince 19 Republican legislators to join 52 Democrats this year to cosponsor legislation that would add sexual orientation and gender identity to Floridas civil rights statutes, just shy of a majority in the 160-member legislature. Representative Joe Gruters, an anti-abortion activist who co-chaired President Donald Trumps state campaign, was among the first Republicans to sign on. Perhaps an unlikely LGBT ally, the first-term lawmaker said the case made by advocates, and a prominent conservative colleagues support, resonated with him. I will continue to fight for this, and for any type of right, that treats people fairly, Gruters said. Its going to happen.  By contrast, the Florida Family Policy Council, advocating for conservative social values, decried the legislation as an intrusion on religious freedoms and public safety by allowing men into womens bathrooms and private facilities. Such LGBT measures are weapons to punish Christians for simply acting out their faith in the marketplace, said its president, John Stemberger.  People are trying to force other people to do things, he added. Why cant we just disagree? But backers see Florida as a model for other states engaged in long-term legislative efforts, including Ohio and Pennsylvania. Attracting bipartisan support really proves this isnt an urban versus a rural issue, or a Republican versus Democratic issue, said Dan Rafter, a spokesman for the advocacy group Freedom for All Americans. Florida, and most other states, avoided fights this year over transgender bathroom access, possibly dissuaded by the national boycotts organized against North Carolina before its recent roll-back of restrictions enacted in 2016. Nonetheless, Floridas LGBT protection bill never got a hearing during this session, which will end within days. The legislatures leaders did not comment on what stalled the measure. Supporters are reorganizing for next year with a more pointed message. Inaction is not neutral, said Hannah Willard, public policy director for the advocacy group Equality Florida. During the strategy meeting last month at the state Capitol, Republican Representative Rene Plasencia proposed mobilizing business supporters to engage legislators in their hometowns. We are protecting peoples rights to live freely, to not be disadvantaged economically, because of the personal choice of who they love, he said. Looking over a list of lawmakers not yet on board, the lead Democrat behind the House bill agreed. We need to persuade people before they get to Tallahassee, Representative Ben Diamond said.

Mayor Bill de Blasio and Governor Andrew Cuomo, both Democrats, have said his stance on immigrants has put him at odds with a city where nearly a third of residents are foreign-born.  Protesters plan to gather Thursday near the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum, a decommissioned aircraft carrier where Trump and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull are to have their first in-person meeting. One of the pairs last exchanges was an acrimonious phone call in January. New York police declined to provide details of their preparations for Trumps tour and the protests planned around it. One lingering issue from the transition period, that of the costs of protecting the president-elects building was resolved earlier this week in a proposed federal budget including $61 million to reimburse New York and other local governments for providing Trump-related security.  Thats good news for our city and the hardworking police officers faced with this unprecedented security challenge, de Blasio said in a statement.

In an interview that aired on Sirius XM satellite radio on Monday, Trump suggested that if Jackson had governed a little later than his 1829-1837 presidency, the American Civil War might have been averted. Trump also questioned why the bloody conflict had to happen. Had Andrew Jackson been a little later, you wouldnt have had the Civil War. He was a very tough person, but he had a big heart, Trump told Sirius XM. He said that although Jackson was a swashbuckler, after his wife died, Jackson visited her grave every day. Jackson, a slave owner who was instrumental in the forced removal of Native American tribes from the U.S. Southeast in the so-called Trail of Tears, died nearly 16 years before the start of the Civil War. But Trump told Sirius XM that Jackson was really angry that he saw what was happening with regard to the Civil War.He said, Theres no reason for this, Trump said. People dont realize, you know, the Civil War  if you think about it, why? People dont ask that question, but why was there a Civil War? Why could that one not have been worked out? It was not clear what Trump believed Jackson would have done to avert the 1861-65 conflict, which cost 620,000 lives. In a tweet later on Monday, Trump acknowledged that Jackson had died 16 years before the start of the war but said he saw it coming and was angry. Would never have let it happen! The events leading to the Civil War have been extensively researched, with slavery being one of the root causes. Slavery and its legacy have been a source of division in the United States since. By the time of his death, Jackson owned about 150 slaves who lived and worked at his plantation, the Hermitage. During his time in office, Jackson denounced the growing activity of abolitionists seeking an end to slavery. Trump and his supporters have likened his election victory to Jacksons triumph in 1828, when Jackson became the first U.S. president from what was then the western frontier of Tennessee. The populist Democrat famously opened the White House to all comers after his inauguration, turning the normally dignified executive mansion into a mob scene.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House on Sunday defended President Donald Trumps decision to invite Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte to Washington, saying his cooperation was needed to counter North Korea, even as the administration faced human rights criticism for its overture to Manila. Trump issued the invitation on Saturday night in what the White House said was a very friendly phone conversation with Duterte, who is accused by international human rights groups of supporting a campaign of extrajudicial killings of drug suspects in the Philippines. There is nothing right now facing this country and facing the region that is a bigger threat than whats happening in North Korea,  White House chief of staff Reince Priebus told ABCs This Week during a weekend in which Trump sought to firm up support in Southeast Asia to help rein in North Koreas nuclear and missile programs. North Korea suggested on Monday it would continue its nuclear weapons tests, saying it will bolster its force to the maximum in a consecutive and successive way at any moment in the face of what it calls U.S. aggression and hysteria. Priebus insisted the outreach to Duterte doesnt mean that human rights dont matter, but what it does mean is that the issues facing us developing out of North Korea are so serious that we need cooperation at some level with as many partners in the area as we can get to make sure we have our ducks in a row. Since he came to power last year, Duterte has often sniped at Washington, his countrys longtime ally, has sought to mend relations with China and spoken of improving ties with Russia. Asked on Monday about his invitation from Trump, he was non-committal, telling reporters: Im tied up. I cannot make any definite promise. I am supposed to go to Russia and go to Israel, he said, referring to already scheduled visits. Foreign Ministry spokesman Robespierre Bolivar said that once a formal letter of invitation came it would be accepted.  The  invitation for Duterte to the visit White House at an unspecified date appeared to be the latest example of the affinity Trump has shown for some foreign leaders with shaky human rights or autocratic reputations. For instance, he expressed admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin during the 2016 presidential campaign, hosted Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi at the White House and has had warm words for Chinese President Xi Jinping, whom Trump is pressing to do more to rein in its ally and neighbor, North Korea. On Sunday, Trump also extended a White House invitation to Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former general who heads a military government that took power in a 2014 coup. Prayuths administration had strained relations with Trumps predecessor, Barack Obama. Celebrating a man who boasts of killing his own citizens and inviting him to the White House, while remaining silent on his disgusting human rights record, sends a terrifying message, said John Sifton, the Asia director of Human Rights Watch. By effectively endorsing Dutertes murderous war on drugs, Trump has made himself morally complicit in future killings, he said. A Trump administration official insisted, however, that the invitation was not a reward to Duterte or an endorsement of his policies but a decision that engagement with the Philippines was better than withdrawal which could intensify bad behavior by Duterte. Its not a thank you, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Its a meeting. The official denied a New York Times report citing administration officials saying the State Department and the National Security Council were caught off-guard by the invitation to Duterte and were expected to object internally. We were not surprised. The guys who prepared for the call were unified on this, the official said. Priebus made clear that North Korea was the top priority. If we dont have all of our folks together  whether theyre good folks, bad folks, people we wish would do better in their country, doesnt matter, weve got to be on the same page on North Korea, Priebus said. But taking a swipe at Trump for his invitation to Duterte,  Democratic U.S. Senator Chris Murphy tweeted: We are watching in real time as the American human rights bully pulpit disintegrates into ash. Thousands of Filipinos have been killed since Duterte unleashed his fierce anti-drugs campaign nearly 10 months ago. Police say they have killed only in self-defense, and the deaths of other drug dealers and users was down to vigilantes or narcotics gangs silencing potential witnesses. Human rights groups say official accounts are implausible and accuse Duterte of backing campaign of systematic extrajudicial killings by police. The government denies that. Duterte was infuriated by the Obama administrations expressions of concern about extrajudicial killings after he took office last year and threatened to sever the long-standing U.S. defense alliance. Duterte spoke positively about Trump, a fellow populist, after the U.S. presidential election in November, and the new administration has sought ways to mend the alliance. In a summary of Saturdays phone call between the two leaders, the White House said the two discussed the fact that the Philippine government is fighting very hard to rid its country of drugs, a scourge that affects many countries throughout the world. The White House statement included no criticism of Dutertes methods. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress, bitterly divided for years along party lines, may be mapping a bipartisan path forward that skirts around President Donald Trump when he refuses to engage constructively with lawmakers, Democrats and some lobbyists said on Monday. The path was discernible in a nearly $1.2 trillion federal spending deal carved out over the weekend to avert a government shutdown. It had Democratic fingerprints all over it, even though Republicans control Congress and the White House.  White House budget director Mick Mulvaney said Trump will sign the 2017 budget bill when he receives it from Congress on Thursday or Friday. Trump, in an interview with Bloomberg on Monday, said he was very happy with the deal announced late on Sunday. Democrats claimed victory on issue after issue in the agreement, which will keep the lights on in Washington through the end of  the federal fiscal year on Sept. 30, provided it holds up and wins final approval as expected. Trump scored a partial win, getting a commitment for up to $15 billion in additional funding for a military buildup. That was about half of what he originally asked for. No money was included for Trumps proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall. Democratic opposition to it was solid and support from Trumps fellow Republicans was soft. Mulvaney said Trump will seek wall funding in a budget proposal coming in late May. At a White House briefing, Mulvaney defended the concessions Trump made to reach an agreement, saying Democrats gave up on some items they had wanted as well in order to find a compromise. Everything we got in this deal ... lines up perfectly with the presidents priorities, he said. Democrats took an opposite view. Describing the work on Capitol Hill that went into the temporary spending pact, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told reporters: Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate were closer to one another than we were to the president on so many of the different issues. Schumer and Senator Patrick Leahy, the senior Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, said they were bolstered in negotiations by the fact that several Republican senators opposed funding for Trumps wall and his call for deep domestic spending cuts. Schumer and Leahy said the White House never tried to work with Democrats in the process. Trump treats engaging with lawmakers on legislation as an afterthought, said Doug Heye, a Republican strategist who worked in Congress as an aide to former House Republican leader Eric Cantor. The power of the Oval Office can provide a lot of leverage when trying to move something on Capitol Hill, Heye said. We just havent see that level of engagement from Trump, whether its healthcare, or building a wall, or tax reform. But John Feehery, a Republican strategist in Washington, said the spending bill may not be indicative of Trumps ability to negotiate with Congress because the legislative body should have dealt with this years funding months ago and never have been allowed to go into the current year.  He knows that this bill was probably not going to reflect his priorities because it was old business, Feehery said. When it comes to new business, he has a lot more leverage in getting his priorities accomplished. The spending deal preserved funding for healthcare provider Planned Parenthood, which has drawn Republican ire because it performs abortions; for the Obamacare healthcare law; and for an array of environmental and other domestic programs Trump wanted to slash. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said because the legislation needs to win a supermajority of 60 votes in the 100-member Senate that cannot be achieved without Democratic support, we couldnt have our entire way on the deal. Spicer said the presidents priorities will be reflected much more in spending yet to be worked out for the 2018 fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1. He said Trump was pleased to see the increase in military spending, a down payment on border security and money for scholarships to help low-income children in Washington attend private schools.     The fiscal 2017 funds, which should have been locked into place seven months ago, would pay for federal programs from airport and border security operations to soldiers pay, medical research, foreign aid, space exploration and education. The Pentagon would win a $12.5 billion increase in defense spending for the fiscal year, with the possibility of an additional $2.5 billion contingent on Trump delivering a plan to Congress for defeating the Islamic State militant group. Congressional negotiators settled on $1.5 billion more for border security, including money for new technology and repairing existing infrastructure.  Under the deal, Puerto Rico would get an emergency injection of $295 million for its Medicaid health insurance program for the poor. The impoverished U.S. territory faces a severe Medicaid funding shortfall. The U.S. government and coal companies would be required to pay out healthcare to retired coal miners, guaranteeing benefits to workers even as coal companies face bankruptcy, under the spending agreement. The deal also would reimburse New York City for money spent securing Trump and his family at Trump Tower in Manhattan. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

LePage, a fiery conservative now in his second term, challenged Attorney General Janet Mills for joining a legal brief opposing Trumps executive order banning immigration from a half-dozen majority Muslim countries. The governor said he supported Trumps order, which has been blocked by courts and which the White House says is necessary to protect national security. It is no secret that Attorney General Mills and I have differing political views, but that is not the issue, LePage said in a statement. The problem is she has publicly denounced court cases which the executive branch has requested to join and subsequently refuses to provide legal representation for the state. He said Mills had refused to represent the state in other cases where she disagreed with LePages political position and prevented his office from filing its own brief in support of Trump, a charge that Mills denied. Instead of signing onto another partys brief at no cost to the taxpayers, however, or hiring a lawyer to draft his own brief, the governor has wasted state resources by hiring a lawyer to file a frivolous lawsuit, complaining that he cannot do exactly what we have told him he can do, Mills said in a statement. Maine is the only one of the 50 U.S. states where the attorney general is elected by the state legislature, rather than elected by voters or appointed by the governor.      The nations 22 Democratic attorneys general emerged in the first months of the Trump administration as a major opposition force to his policies, successfully suing to block his executive orders on travel and also challenging environmental policy moves. Maine is one of eight U.S. states that have a Republican governor and a Democratic attorney general, setting the stage for the conflict that resulted in Mondays lawsuit, filed in Kennebec County Superior Court. LePage was first elected to office in 2010 on a wave of Tea Party support and was re-elected in 2014. Both victories came in three-way races.  He was an early supporter of Trump and came under intense public pressure last year after calling a Democratic lawmaker a little son-of-a-bitch, socialist cocksucker, in a voicemail message that was widely circulated.

The White House is eager to move forward on legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, commonly called Obamacare, to make good on a key campaign promise. Republicans tried but failed to pass a replacement bill in March in an embarrassing setback for the Trump Administration. Lawmakers are considering a bill that would allow states to opt out of Obamacare protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions - provisions that force insurers to charge sick people and healthy people the same rates. It was unclear when or if a vote would be scheduled. Trump told Fox News Channel that he would not set a deadline for the vote, and indicated he was open to improvements. Were either going to have a great plan or Im not signing it, he said in the interview. In a separate interview with Bloomberg News, Trump insisted that the new bill would maintain protections for pre-existing conditions. I want it to be good for sick people. Its not in its final form right now, he told Bloomberg. It will be every bit as good on pre-existing conditions as Obamacare. Ten major patient advocacy groups said they opposed the reworked healthcare bill, including the American Heart Association and American Diabetes Association. Other major medical groups such as the American Medical Association have also expressed concerns over coverage losses and unaffordable insurance for those with pre-existing conditions. Republican lawmakers have struggled to unite around legislation, with moderates and conservatives within the caucus divided over key provisions. Once a plan passes the Republican-controlled House, it is expected to face a tough fight in the Senate, where Republicans have a narrower majority and where some party senators have expressed misgivings about the House bill. White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House economic adviser Gary Cohn on Monday said in separate interviews with CBS This Morning that they thought there were enough votes to pass the bill this week. House Republican leaders were more cautious. As of Monday afternoon, no vote had been scheduled and backers of the healthcare proposal had not released legislative language. Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, chair of the House Republican conference, said Republican members needed time to understand new tweaks to the bill. We are having those member-to-members conversations right now, McMorris Rodgers told Fox News. Vice President Mike Pence made his way to Capitol Hill late on Monday to make the case to members who are on the fence, a Republican aide said on condition of anonymity, noting leaders are believed to be within five or six votes of having enough support to pass the bill. The Freedom Caucus, which brought down the previous effort to pass a healthcare bill, has endorsed the new measure. The Republican aide told Reuters all but one or two members of the group will support the reworked plan. This bill doesnt get all the way there but its a good step and is ... the best we can get out of the House right now, Representative Jim Jordan, chairman of the group, told CNN. But several moderate Republicans were either undecided or opposed the bill for fear that it would not protect those with pre-existing conditions and cause millions to lose health insurance. Representative Charlie Dent, a moderate Republican from Pennsylvania, said he still had problems with the latest plan and suspected there were not enough votes to pass it. Too many Americans are going to be without coverage, Dent told MSNBC, adding that the plan could make things even worse for vulnerable Americans.

Budget bills primarily lay out how government money can flow, but often also include riders - smaller measures attached to the budget so they can become law. During spending negotiations last week, Democrats said many of the riders would lead them to walk away from any budget deal, dubbing them poison pills. The proposal unveiled on Monday was hailed for its bipartisan support. It is a solid bill that reflects our common values and that will help move our nation forward, said Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen, the Republican chairman of the House appropriations committee. Overall, the Democrats were successful at keeping the omnibus funding bill from being hijacked by inappropriate policy additions, keeping out over 160 proposed poison pill riders, said Lisa Gilbert, vice president of legislative affairs at Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group. The House of Representatives and Senate are expected to pass the $1 trillion spending bill that was unveiled on Monday before Friday.  Many on Capitol Hill and off had anticipated the bill would include a rider on how the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is funded.  Currently, the agency receives its funding from the Federal Reserve, but Republicans have pushed to move the CFPB into the annual congressional budget, saying that would make it more accountable to voters. Instead, the deal was much lighter, only requiring the CFPB to report to Congress when it makes draws from the Fed. Democratic supporters of the CFPB, such as Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, say receiving funds from the Fed maintains the independence of the agency, created in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law to protect individuals from fraud. Warren was former President Barack Obamas first choice to lead the CFPB, and the partys Warren Wing, which includes the Banking Committees senior Democrat, Sherrod Brown, is committed to keeping it intact no matter the cost. Opponents of the CFPB seem to realize that attempts to weaken the agency through the budget process could potentially derail a deal, said Rohit Chopra, a senior fellow at Consumer Federation of America and former CFPB official. The deal also maintains a contentious rider from the last budget barring the Securities and Exchange Commission from requiring companies to disclose their political donations. Democrats want major corporations to show to which candidates and causes they give money, and last year worked to  block two SEC commissioner nominations when the nominees would not support donation disclosures.

The Democrat-controlled state legislature had passed the bill in March in response to Trumps refusal to make public his tax returns when he ran for president as a Republican last year. Under the law, any candidate for president or vice president could not appear on the ballot without releasing at least five years of returns. Before Trump, every major presidential candidate had done so voluntarily since the 1970s.

New Jersey was the first of at least 20 states considering similar legislation to send a bill to its governors desk for consideration.

Speaking at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California, almost a week after he helped unveil plans to cut taxes for many people and corporations to 15 percent, Mnuchin said tax reform and regulatory relief will help spur economic growth. Mnuchins comments also come days after government data showed tepid economic growth of 0.7 percent for the last three months. The tax plan is our version of a jobs bill, Mnuchin said in an onstage interview with journalist Maria Bartoromo. Although the stock market has reacted positively to Trumps election - with the S&P 500 index up 11 percent since November - critics of the tax plan have said it is ambitious and lacks details.  In a light-hearted moment, Mnuchin quipped that many at the conference had him to thank for the surge in bank stocks that have helped lift their portfolios, bringing laughter from the audience. But with few fresh details about Trumps plans and an uncertain time frame, some at the conference expressed concern that the generally optimistic atmosphere might begin to fade. Im concerned that if we dont see tax or healthcare reform by the end of the year, markets will start to doubt the administrations ability to deliver it, said Scott Minerd, global chief investment officer at Guggenheim Partners.  Mnuchin said he has been working with congressional leaders to push tax reform and he hopes for bi-partisan support.  Mnuchin told CNBC on the sidelines of the conference that the tax proposal was purposely vague so that the administration could work with legislators to craft something that will pass Congress. The Trump administration has invited many business leaders into the White House and is listening closely to their concerns and hopes on tax changes, he added.  David Solomon, president and co-chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs, said the great sense of optimism early in Trumps tenure may be fading some. This quarter it feels like conviction for tax and regulatory reform is more muted. Solomons predecessor at Goldman, Gary Cohn, joined the Trump administration as director of the National Economic Council and one of his primary goals has been to work on tax reform. One concern associated with the Trump tax plan is how the government plans to pay for it. Mnuchin said that there are plenty of other ways to off set the revenue that would be lost through reduced tax receipts. He did not offer many specifics. Indeed many at the conference, including investment managers whose businesses could benefit dramatically from the cut in taxes, were cheering the new administration and its can-do attitude which also includes plans to tackle health care reform. Prospects for growth look to be better around the world, several said. Yet there were also some rumblings of concern that ambitious projects would not be completed and that tensions around the world with other governments would increase. Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, said that optimism is off the charts according to the stock market but geopolitical issues are a real concern.

Lynch WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lawmakers, lobbyists and interest groups are making a final push in their fight over regulations enacted during former President Barack Obamas last months in office, with the financial services industry working hard to kill a rule on retirement plans run by states. Using an obscure 1996 law known as the Congressional Review Act, Republicans have passed 13 resolutions killing Obama-era regulations on energy, the environment, gun control, education, family-planning funding and corruption.  Once the rules are eliminated, agencies can never create substantially similar regulation. The deadline for introducing any new CRA resolutions on regulations enacted under Obama was nearly a month ago, and Republicans are working to complete resolutions already in the legislative pipeline before the third week of May. Currently, the resolutions only require simple majorities to pass both houses of Congress to reach President Donald Trump for signing. After May 11, they must win 60 votes in the Senate to pass, a steep hurdle, given voting margins on CRA resolutions have been tight and Vice President Mike Pence had to break a tie on one. A spokeswoman for Speaker Paul Ryan said the House of Representatives will probably not have any more CRA votes. A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said  McConnell has expressed interest in considering more resolutions. The resolution on state-run retirement plans has been caught in limbo for weeks. Obamas Labor Department had exempted both state and city-run retirement plans from the 1974 Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA, a law designed to protect workers savings with detailed compliance requirements. Private-sector workers whose employers do not offer 401(k) or other retirement benefits, and who often have low incomes, are automatically enrolled in plans being launched in some states, such as California and Illinois. States say the exemption lets employers pass workers money into plans without footing compliance costs. States are farther along than cities in establishing the programs, with cities still in the drafting stages. On March 30, the Senate approved a resolution already passed in the House killing the exemption for city programs. Trump signed it in mid-April. Voting on a near identical resolution on states programs was expected to follow immediately, but so far the measure has not come to the floor. Congressional aides say it has been hard to collect enough Republican votes to pass the measure. Republican Senator Bob Corker, of Tennessee, has stated that he will not vote for the resolution, and aides say Republican Senators Rand Paul, of Kentucky, and Todd Young, of Indiana, are also leaning to vote against it. The two senators offices did not respond to queries about their intentions. Lobbyists, though, are turning up the heat.  In an April 27 letter, groups including the Investment Company Institute and U.S. Chamber of Congress wrote to all 100 U.S. senators urging them to repeal the state retirement plan rule, saying workers could be left unprotected.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Congress has agreed to fund an additional 5,300 detention beds for illegal immigrants, the House of Representatives Appropriations Committee said on Monday, less than half the number requested by President Donald Trump. The additional detention space was negotiated by Republican leaders with Democrats as part of a spending package Congress will vote on later this week to fund the government through September, according to two congressional sources familiar with the agreement.  The new beds will be added despite a sharp decline last month in apprehensions of people crossing the southern border with Mexico illegally. Immigration detention centers at the U.S. border have been operating at below capacity in recent months. The agreement will increase the number of immigration detention beds to 39,324 from 34,000 currently, according to a summary provided by the House Appropriations Committee. The White House in March requested bringing the total number of beds up to 45,700, saying the additional capacity was necessary to achieve the presidents goal of enhancing interior enforcement efforts and ending catch and release for those apprehended at the border.   The budget summary did not break out the specific cost of the additional 5,300 beds, but said they would be included in an overall $1.5 billion increase in immigration enforcement funding.  The spending also includes more electronic monitoring and GPS tracking alternatives to detention, as well 100 additional officers to enforce immigration laws and funding for programs that increase coordination with local authorities on immigration enforcement.  A spokesman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which runs detention facilities, said the agency would not comment on the contents of the spending bill while the legislation is pending. The House Appropriations Committee did not respond to a request for comment.  From April 1-22, an average of 36,235 immigrants were in detention per day, according to the most recent statistics provided by ICE.  If border crossings and apprehensions continue to stay low, the administration could struggle to fill additional detention beds, unless it increases arrests of undocumented immigrants in the interior with no criminal convictions and cuts back on releases of asylum seekers found to have legitimate claims, said Kevin Landy, who served as assistant director at ICE during the Obama administration.  ICE is going to be under enormous pressure to fill those beds to prove to Congress that the funding was needed, said Landy, who left his post in January. Democrats raised similar concerns during budget negotiations, a Congressional aide with knowledge of the negotiations told Reuters.  Some Republicans as well as Democrats also expressed worries during the negotiations that the Department of Homeland Security might redirect money allotted for detention centers to use on border wall construction if Congress appropriated more money than needed, the aide said.  In October, the first month of the 2017 fiscal year, 66,710 people were apprehended crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally. Apprehensions have fallen steadily since then.   In March, 16,600 individuals were apprehended, down 64 percent from the year-earlier month, according to statistics from Customs and Border Patrol.

Rossello said in a statement in Spanish that he was grateful for the addition in the spending bill reached late Sunday night.  The full House of Representatives and Senate must approve the bipartisan pact, though prompt passage was expected this week. Puerto Ricos public health system is nearly insolvent, a key driver of emigration that has decimated the U.S. territorys population as it wrestles with $70 billion in debt, a 45 percent poverty rate and unemployment twice the U.S. average. The island faces a deadline at midnight Monday to negotiate a debt-cutting agreement with creditors, or open itself up to lawsuits over debt defaults. It could also file for a modified version of U.S. bankruptcy to protect itself from such litigation. One creditor, who owns insured Puerto Rican bonds, said the proposal was not even close to a good proposal. Not just lowball but also not a well constructed proposal, said Sean Burgess, portfolio manager and lead trader for Puerto Rico strategy at Sarasota, Florida-based Cumberland Advisors. The islands aggressive lobbying for federal healthcare funding in Washington is seen as a possible detractor to filing bankruptcy, which would not garner sympathy from Congressional Republicans who opposed the in-court restructuring provision in last years Puerto Rico rescue law, PROMESA. The $295 million will help fund the islands Medicaid budget for fiscal year 2018, which starts July 1, and enable Puerto Rico to contract with managed care health insurance companies that administer the Medicaid program.  Without the money, the island would have to run the Medicaid program on its own, a massive undertaking that Puerto Rico is not equipped to do, said island Health Secretary Dr. Rafael Rodrguez-Mercado. But Puerto Rico will still need an additional $300 million to fund its entire Medicaid budget for fiscal year 2018, Rodrguez-Mercado told Reuters in an interview on Monday. He hopes that money will come from the Childrens Health Insurance Program (CHIP) in September. Puerto Ricos $2.76 billion Medicaid budget has been funded in part by a one-time pool of money provided to U.S. territories under the Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as Obamacare.  That money is expected to run out by the end of 2017, triggering what island officials call the Medicaid cliff  the return to a federal funding cap of $321 million for Puerto Ricos Medicaid program. U.S. territories receive proportionately less federal Medicaid reimbursement than U.S. states. Prior to Obamacare, Puerto Rico partially funded its Medicaid budget through bonds, exacerbating the islands debt crisis.  In recent weeks, Governor Ricardo Rossello has been lobbying to boost Puerto Ricos healthcare funding, warning that Washingtons failure to do so would leave some 900,000 people without health coverage.

Her district has increasingly leaned Democratic, and Democrat Hillary Clinton, Trumps opponent, won it by 20 percentage points in the 2016 presidential election. Ros-Lehtinen, 64, declined to endorse Trump during the White House race and differed with him on issues such as immigration.

The spending deal agreed by congressional negotiators  continued the Afghan Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) program, which allows Afghans who worked for the U.S. government, often risking their lives, to move to the United States after a rigorous vetting process. A recent bi-partisan push by U.S. lawmakers for more SIV visas came against the backdrop of efforts by President Donald Trumps administration to clamp down on immigration from majority Muslim countries, an effort that has been blocked by the courts. In March, the U.S. embassy in Kabul said it had stopped scheduling interviews for SIV applicants because it had nearly run out of visas, even though 1,500 more were included in the National Defense Authorization Act passed in late 2016. That helped prompt a group of senators, including Republican Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain to seek more.  As of April 20, only 780 SIV visas remained available, while more than 14,000 Afghans had already begun the application progress, according to the U.S. State Department. Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a long-time advocate for the SIV program, said letting it lapse would have sent a message that the United States was willing to abandon its supporters. Its both a moral and practical imperative that Congress approve additional visas. Thousands of Afghans have put themselves, and their families, at risk to help our soldiers and diplomats accomplish the U.S. mission and return home safely, Shaheen said in an emailed statement.  Afghanistan is not one of the six countries whose citizens would have been barred under Trumps executive order, but some of the presidents fellow Republicans in Congress have resisted expanding the SIV program out of concern that militants could use it to enter the United States.

The provision to secure the United Mine Workers healthcare benefits was included in a deal that lawmakers reached late on Sunday for around $1 trillion in federal funding that would avert a government shutdown later this week. Around 22,600 coal miners and their families were on the brink of losing on April 30 their healthcare benefits, which were at risk of default as the industry struggled, with companies trying to recover from bankruptcies. This permanent solution to protect these benefits is a victory for our miners, their families, and their widows, said Congressman Evan Jenkins, a West Virginia Republican who represents the states coal-producing counties. Members of the UMWA have made several visits to Washington over the last few months to urge lawmakers to protect their benefits, which they say is a government obligation. President Harry Truman in 1946 brokered the Krug-Lewis agreement, which guaranteed health and pension benefits for coal miners. Sundays agreement did not address a long-term fix for miners pension funds, which are also set to be terminated.    Lawmakers from both parties still hope to pass the Miners Protection Act, which would transfer funds from the Abandoned Mine Land fund to the unions pension plan to prevent its insolvency. Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia has been working with the UMWA  and Democratic and Republican lawmakers to pass that bill. If Congress cannot transfer those funds, the financially-strained $5 billion federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp, an agency that backstops failed private-sector pension programs, would be responsible for covering the plans.

Asked if the need for Chinas help to contain threats from North Korea had made it more difficult to be tough with Beijing on trade issues, Ross said he did not think so. Weve been having some very constructive discussions on trade with the Chinese in parallel to discussions on North Korea, Ross told CNBC.

I dont think he meant to indicate at all that he intends to trade away American jobs just for help on North Korea, Ross said. Ross also reaffirmed that the administration intended to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, not withdraw from it.

A White House official confirmed Monday that about 20 technology chief executives will attend meetings at the White House in early June to talk about improving government information technology. Americans deserve better digital services from their Government. To effectuate this policy, the federal government must transform and modernize its information technology and how it uses and delivers digital services, Trumps executive order dated April 28 said. Trump has held a number of meetings with top tech chief executives since becoming president, including Apple Inc, Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc, IBM Corp, Microsoft Inc, and Tesla Inc. In March, Trump signed a separate order to overhaul the federal government. Trump tapped Jared Kushner in March to lead a White House Office of American Innovation to leverage business ideas and potentially privatize some government functions as the White House pushes to shrink government, cut federal employees and eliminate regulations. Officially called the American Technology Council, Chris Liddell will be its director. He is the White House director of strategic initiatives, and former Microsoft and General Motors co chief financial officer. A 2016 U.S. Government Accountability Office report publicly estimated the U.S. government spends more than $80 billion in IT annually, but said spending has fallen by $7.3 billion since 2010. In 2015, there were at least 7,000 separate IT investments by the U.S. government, the report said. The $80 billion figure does not include Defense Department classified IT systems; and 58 independent executive branch agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency, the report said.  The GAO report said U.S. government IT investments are becoming increasingly obsolete: many use outdated software languages and hardware parts that are unsupported. The report found some agencies are using systems that have components that are at least 50 years old. The Department of Defense uses 8-inch floppy disks in a legacy system that coordinates the operational functions of the nations nuclear forces, the report said. The report said the Defense Department plans to update the system by the end of September. The Treasury Departments business master file of tax data pertaining to individual business income taxpayers dates back to the 1950s and using an antiquated computer language and operates on an IBM mainframe.

U.S. President Donald Trumps flurry of calls at the weekend to the leaders of the Philippines, Thailand and Singapore might cheer those who fear his predecessor Barack Obamas pivot to Asia has been abandoned in favor of an America First agenda. But White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said the conversations were aimed at lining up Asian partners in case tensions over North Korea lead to nuclear and massive destruction in Asia, and mentioned no broader strategic goal. Southeast Asian nations will need more than that to convince them the United States still has their backs. In the meantime, some are leaning closer to China, soft-pedalling quarrels over the disputed South China Sea and angling for a slice of Beijings One Belt, One Road infrastructure investment program to compensate for the U.S. abandonment of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact. The unexpected bonhomie that has emerged between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping could give Asian countries further confidence to continue their swing toward Beijing. Before, most Southeast Asian states wanted to benefit from Chinese regional economic initiatives and from American pushback against China, said Malcolm Cook, a senior fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore. The second part of this balance is now in question. Hence, the pressure to acquiesce to China diplomatically and on security issues is stronger. Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, piqued by the Obama administrations criticism of his human rights record, last year announced his separation from longtime ally the United States while on a visit to Beijing. The White House described Trumps conversation with the firebrand Philippines leader as very friendly and - prompting criticism from Human Rights Watch for effectively endorsing Dutertes murderous war on drugs - invited him to Washington. But, underlining his new-found friendship with Beijing, Duterte on Monday inspected a Chinese naval ships docked at his hometown, the first visit of its kind to the Philippines in years. Duterte, who last year put aside a legal challenge to Beijings sweeping territorial claims in the South China Sea to start negotiating billions of dollars worth of loans and infrastructure investments, chaired the latest summit of the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Manila. Several ASEAN diplomats said China sent officials to lobby the Philippines ahead of the summit, and before the leaders had even gathered Duterte said it was pointless pressuring Beijing over its maritime activities. An early draft of the summit statement seen by Reuters made references to land reclamation and militarization in the disputed waterway, but they were subsequently dropped, as were references to tensions and escalation of activities.  Cook said it was clear that, with the Philippines steering the summit to this conclusion, it is no longer just Cambodia that is acting as an agent of Chinese influence in ASEAN over the South China Sea dispute. Thailand and Malaysia have also moved closer to China. Thailands relations with Washington came under strain during the Obama administration because of concerns about freedoms under its military-dominated government. Trump invited Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha to visit Washington during their call on Sunday, but the former generals government has its eyes elsewhere: last week it approved the first of three submarine purchases from China worth more than $1 billion. Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong says Washingtons new posture has shifted Asias political and economic balance. Lee, whose country, like Vietnam, has shown no signs of moving closer to Beijing, stressed to his ASEAN counterparts on Saturday that, despite Trumps radically different approach, they should balance their ties between the United States and China. Trump has said he will attend two summits in the region in November. But Southeast Asian nations are trying to gauge how far they can still rely on Washington as a shield against Chinese assertiveness. ASEAN foreign ministers will be seeking answers at a meeting with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in Washington this Thursday. Uncertainty over Washingtons commitment, analysts say, will only draw ASEAN countries further toward China, which can lure them with cheap loans, infrastructure investments and tariff cuts, but with a risk of diminished bargaining power. Thitinan Pongsudhirak, director of the Institute of Security and International Studies at Bangkoks Chulalongkorn University, said it was imperative for ASEAN to regain leverage by bringing Washington back into the equation and expanding the influence of Japan. ASEAN is in a precarious position now with the concessions, accommodation and even appeasement with China, Thitinan said.    If China continues to be shrewd and takes ASEAN on another ride, then ASEAN will be much worse off. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

He repeatedly attacked an incompetent, dishonest media, saying they were not telling the truth about his administrations accomplishments. My administration has been delivering every single day for the great citizens of our country, Trump said in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

The world is getting the message: if you try to illegally enter the United States, you will be caught, detained, deported or put in prison, Trump said. He shrugged off his failure to score major legislative victories on his core campaign promises, such as repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act and construction of a Mexican border wall. Trumps ban on visitors from some Muslim nations was blocked in court. He blamed Democrats for the legislative failures so far and said all of his promises would be kept eventually. Well build the wall, people, dont even worry about it, he said. Some supporters in the crowd said they were willing to give Trump more time. I voted for him and Ill give him a year. Thats enough time to whip Congress into shape and get some deals done, said Michael Casciaro, 54, a civilian contractor for the military. Trump said he reversed course on promises to name China a currency manipulator because he wanted its help in trying to rein in North Koreas nuclear and missile development. Trump has said all options are on the table if Pyongyang persists in its nuclear development. In an excerpt of an interview with Face the Nation of CBS, set to air on Sunday and Monday and conducted during the trip to Pennsylvania, Trump said he would not be happy if North Korea conducted a nuclear test. Asked if that would mean military action, Trump said I dont know, I mean well see. Reveling in the cheers in Harrisburg, Trump made reference again to his upset victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton in the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania, which he said carried us to a big, beautiful win on Nov. 8. Trump left Washington as another in a series of protests against his administration was winding up. Thousands of marchers made their way through Washingtons streets during the Peoples Climate March, a protest against Trumps moves to roll back environmental regulations. Asked by reporters accompanying him to Pennsylvania what he had to say to the climate change protesters, Trump said: Enjoy the day, enjoy the weather. After the rally, the White House said the president had signed two trade-related executive orders, one for top U.S. officials to review all U.S. trade pacts for potential abuses and another setting up an office in the White House to advise him on trade-related issues.

Without Trump, who scheduled a rally instead to mark his 100th day in office, the usually celebrity-filled soiree hosted by the White House Correspondents Association took a more sober turn, even as it pulled in top journalists and Washington insiders. Most of Trumps administration also skipped the event in solidarity with the president, who has repeatedly accused the press of mistreatment. The president used his campaign-style gathering to again lambaste the media.  I could not possibly be more thrilled than to be more than 100 miles away, he told a crowd in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, calling out The New York Times, CNN and MSNBC by name. In Washington, WHCA President Jeff Mason defended press freedom even as he acknowledged this years dinner had a different feel, saying attempts to undermine the media was dangerous for democracy. We are not fake news, we are not failing news organizations and we are not the enemy of the American people, said Mason, a Reuters correspondent. Instead of the typical roasts - presidents of both parties have delivered their own zingers for years - the event returned to its traditional roots of recognizing reporters work and handing out student scholarships as famed journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein presented awards. Thats not Donald Trumps style, NBC News Andrea Mitchell told MSNBC, referring to the self-deprecating jokes presidents in the past have made despite tensions with the press. Instead, the humor fell to headline comedian Hasan Minhaj. Welcome to the series finale of the White House correspondents dinner, Minhaj, who plays a correspondent on Comedy Centrals The Daily Show program, told the crowd. He also joked about Trump, despite organizers wishes, saying he did so to honor U.S. constitutional protection of free speech: Only in America can a first-generation, Indian-American Muslim kid get on this stage and make fun of the president. In a video message, actor Alec Baldwin, who has raised Trumps ire playing him on NBCs Saturday Night Live program also encouraged attendees. Few other celebrities graced the red carpet, although some well-known Washingtonians, such as former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Republican Representative Darrell Issa of California, appeared.  Trump attended in 2011, when then-President Barack Obama made jokes at the expense of the New York real estate developer and reality television show host. In an interview with Reuters this week, Trump said he decided against attending as president because he felt he had been treated unfairly by the media, adding: I would come next year, absolutely. In Pennsylvania, Trump told supporters the media dinner would be boring but was noncommittal on whether he would go in 2018 or hold another rally. Late night television show host Samantha Bee also hosted a competing event - Not the White House Correspondents Dinner - that she said would honor journalists, rather than skewer Trump.

President Donald Trump on Thursday reflected on his first 100 days in office with a wistful look at his life before the White House.  I loved my previous life. I had so many things going, Trump told Reuters in an interview. This is more work than in my previous life. I thought it would be easier.  A wealthy businessman from New York, Trump assumed public office for the first time when he entered the White House on Jan. 20 after he defeated former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in an upset.  REUTERS RECOMMENDSRacism on the rise: Reuters pollHow North Korea gets its oil from China More than five months after his victory and two days shy of the 100-day mark of his presidency, the election is still on Trumps mind. Midway through a discussion about Chinese President Xi Jinping, the president paused to hand out copies of what he said were the latest figures from the 2016 electoral map.  Here, you can take that, thats the final map of the numbers, the Republican president said from his desk in the Oval Office, handing out maps of the United States with areas he won marked in red. Its pretty good, right? The red is obviously us.  He had copies for each of the three Reuters reporters in the room.  Trump, who said he was accustomed to not having privacy in his old life, expressed surprise at how little he had now. And he made clear he was still getting used to having 24-hour Secret Service protection and its accompanying constraints.  Youre really into your own little cocoon, because you have such massive protection that you really cant go anywhere, he said.  When the president leaves the White House, it is usually in a limousine or an SUV.  He said he missed being behind the wheel himself.  I like to drive, he said. I cant drive any more.  Many things about Trump have not changed from the wheeler-dealer executive and former celebrity reality show host who ran his empire from the 26th floor of Trump Tower in New York and worked the phones incessantly.  He frequently turns to outside friends and former business colleagues for advice and positive reinforcement. Senior aides say they are resigned to it.  The president has been at loggerheads with many news organizations since his election campaign and decided not to attend the White House Correspondents Dinner in Washington on Saturday because he felt he had been treated unfairly by the media.  I would come next year, absolutely, Trump said when asked whether he would attend in the future.  The dinner is organized by the White House Correspondents Association.

As EPA renews its commitment to human health and clean air, land and water, our website needs to reflect the views of the leadership of the agency, it said in a statement. Trump, a climate change doubter, campaigned on a pledge to boost the U.S. oil and gas drilling and coal mining industries by slashing regulation. He also promised to pull Washington out of a global pact to fight climate change. The first page to be updated is one that reflects Trumps executive order on energy independence, which calls for a review of the Clean Power Plan put into place by his predecessor, President Barack Obama, the statement said. Language associated with the Clean Power Plan, written by the last administration, is out of date, it said. Similarly, content related to climate and regulation is also being reviewed. The Clean Power Plan aimed to sharply reduce carbon dioxide emissions from electrical power generation over 25 years, focusing on reductions from coal-burning power plants and increasing the use of renewable energy and energy conservation. We want to eliminate confusion by removing outdated language first and making room to discuss how were protecting the environment and human health by partnering with states and working within the law, J.P. Freire, associate administrator for public affairs at the agency, said in the statement. The website changes will comply with agency ethics and legal guidance, including proper archiving, so a snapshot of the Obama administrations website would remain available from the main page, the statement said. In January, EPA sources told Reuters that administration officials had asked the agency to take down the climate change page on its website, and that EPA staff had pushed back in an effort to convince the administration to preserve it. [L1N1FF00N] The page includes links to scientific research, emissions data from industrial plants and a multi-agency report that describes trends related to the causes and effects of climate change. Pruitt led 14 lawsuits against the agency when he was Oklahomas attorney general. Last month he said he was not convinced that carbon dioxide from human activity is the main driver of climate change, a position widely embraced by scientists.

Trump said on Thursday that he had been prepared to terminate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Canada and Mexico, but backed off after calls from the leaders of those two countries.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warns failure to curb North Koreas nuclear and missile development could lead to catastrophic consequences while China and Russia rebuke Washington for its threat of force. Trump signs a bill approved by the Republican-led Congress to avert a U.S. government shutdown and give lawmakers another week to work out federal spending through Sept. 30, with tricky issues like defense spending still unresolved.

Trump tells Reuters he will either renegotiate or terminate what he calls a horrible free trade deal with South Korea and says Seoul should pay for a U.S. anti-missile system he prices at $1 billion.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Friday to extend offshore oil and gas drilling to areas that have been off limits - a move meant to boost domestic production but which could fall flat due to weak industry demand for the acreage. The order could open up swathes of the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic oceans, as well as the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, that former President Barack Obama had sought to protect from development after a huge BP (BP.L) oil spill in 2010. Were opening it up....Today were unleashing American energy and clearing the way for thousands and thousands of high-paying American energy jobs, Trump said as he signed the order. Trump had campaigned on a promise to do away with Obama-era environmental protections that he said were hobbling energy development without providing tangible benefits, pleasing industry and enraging environmental advocates. But the executive order, called the America-First Offshore Energy Strategy, comes as low oil prices and soaring onshore production have pushed industry demand for offshore leases near their lowest level in years, raising questions over the impact. A Reuters review of government data showed the amount of money that oil companies spent in the central Gulf of Mexicos annual lease sale dropped more than 75 percent between 2012 and 2017. Dollars bid per acre and the percentage of acreage receiving bids both declined more than 50 percent. The figures were similar in the western Gulf of Mexico, the only other zone that got offers for leases during that period, according to the figures from the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. The Trump administrations hasty move today toward expanding offshore oil drilling ... defies market realities and is as reckless as it is unnecessary, said David Jenkins, president of Conservatives for Responsible Stewardship, a non-profit conservation group. Why on earth would someone choose to push drilling in the riskiest and most expensive places on the planet when the current oil glut will make such ventures unprofitable for the foreseeable future? he said.     The president of the American Petroleum Institute trade group welcomed the order in a statement, while an API official said the order could help the industry over the long term. The official did not respond to a request for comment directly about current offshore lease demand. In order to meet U.S. energy needs, it is important to keep options open for the long term, so industry can start planning for and determining where the best prospects are and then make those investments the global economy will require over time, the official said, asking not to be named.  The order directs the U.S. Department of Interior to review and replace the Obama administrations most recent five-year oil and gas development plan for the outer continental shelf, which includes federal waters off all U.S. coasts. Weeks before leaving office, Obama had banned new oil and gas drilling in federal waters in the Atlantic and Arctic oceans, protecting 115 million acres (46.5 million hectares) of waters off Alaska and 3.8 million acres in the Atlantic from New England to the Chesapeake Bay. In addition to requiring a new five-year drilling plan, the order reverses Obamas decision to place certain parts of the Arctic permanently off limits to drilling. It also requires Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to review previous presidents designations of marine national monuments and sanctuaries. Jill McLeod, a partner at international law firm Dorsey & Whitney, said Trumps order was a positive signal to the oil industry but was unlikely to trigger a surge in exploration in the near term given the costs. The lifting of the ban does not necessarily make drilling in the Arctic a compelling proposition, she said.  Environmental groups, including Oceana and the Center for Biological Diversity, criticized the order and promised to fight it in court. Democratic senators also opposed the order, saying it could threaten the fishing and tourism industries. Fridays order came on the heels of a separate decree by Trump this week triggering a review of federally managed land to determine if they were improperly designated as national monuments by former presidents. The move is intended to expand federal areas available for development. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"
