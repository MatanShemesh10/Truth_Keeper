Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican-led Congress averted a U.S. government shutdown on Friday and gave lawmakers another week to work out federal spending through Sept. 30, with tricky issues like defense spending still unresolved. The Senate passed a stopgap spending bill by voice vote without opposition after the House earlier approved it by a tally of 382-30. President Donald Trump later signed the legislation, preventing a shutdown of many parts of the federal government on Saturday, his 100th day in office. The bill provides federal funding through May 5, allowing lawmakers to hammer out legislation in the coming days to keep the government funded for the rest of the fiscal year ending Sept. 30. Congress for months has been tied in knots trying to untangle $1 trillion in spending priorities. Lawmakers were supposed to have taken care of the current fiscal year appropriations bills by last Oct. 1. Democrats backed the stopgap bill a day after House Republican leaders again put off a vote on major healthcare legislation sought by Trump and opposed by Democrats to dismantle the 2010 Affordable Care Act, dubbed Obamacare, after Republican moderates balked at provisions added to entice hard-line conservatives. Republicans, already facing accusations from the opposition Democrats that they are unable to govern even though they control Congress and the White House, are motivated to avert the first government shutdown since 2013, but contentious matters remain on a spending bill covering the final five months of the fiscal year. With Trump seeking $30 billion in new defense spending in the measure and Democrats arguing that other domestic programs also need more money, congressional negotiators are moving toward a compromise. Republican and Democratic negotiators have discussed a possible $15 billion defense spending hike, half of Trumps request, according to two congressional aides familiar with the matter. It was unclear whether Democrats will continue to insist other domestic programs get a similar funding increase. Such equal treatment was at the core of some previous funding deals. Unlike the simmering fights in Congress over healthcare and taxes, in which Republicans are pursuing purely partisan legislation, major spending bills generally need bipartisan support for passage, lending some optimism that the negotiations will end next week without a federal shutdown. House and Senate appropriators were expected to work through this weekend, but there were no guarantees they would be able to find common ground that would prevent parts of the government from shutting down on May 6. Congressional negotiators also have been struggling over funding to make a healthcare program for coal miners permanent and whether to plug a gap in Puerto Ricos Medicaid program, the government health insurance program for the poor. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the stopgap bill, which kept funding at current levels, will carry us through next week so that a bipartisan agreement can be reached. McConnell said he expected the House by the middle of next week to approve and send to the Senate the spending bill for the remaining five months of the fiscal year. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said there were still significant differences with Republicans over elements of the looming longer-term spending bill but were willing to extend things for a little bit more time in hope more progress can be made. The No. 2 House Democrat, Steny Hoyer of Maryland, said he would oppose any more temporary spending bills for this year. During debate in the House, lawmakers expressed frustration at the inability of Congress to take care of the basic functions of government in a timely manner. We are seven months into the fiscal year, said Representative Nita Lowey of New York, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. Federal departments and agencies have been operating on outdated funding levels and policies for more than half of the year. This is unacceptable and it cannot continue.  Lowey noted that this was the third stopgap spending measure passed since the fiscal year began last October. White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters aboard Air Force One the White House feels very good about getting the funding extension next week through the end of the fiscal year. Trump earlier bowed to Democratic demands that the spending legislation for the rest of the fiscal year not include money to start building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border he said is needed to fight illegal immigration and stop drug smugglers. The Trump administration also agreed to continue funding for a major component of Obamacare despite Republican vows to end the program. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"
"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - By U.S. President Donald Trumps math, renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement and other deals will largely pay for the massive tax cuts his cabinet laid out earlier in the week.  He is likely off by a factor of close to 10 - or more - according to trade and tax economists who say it does not make sense to think of the world in the two-dimensional, money-in-my-pocket or money-in-yours way that Trump did in a Thursday interview with Reuters.  The president, for example, said that given the current $61 billion annual trade deficit with Mexico, the United States would be better off if the two countries did not trade at all, saying Youll save yourself a hell of a lot of money. The former real estate developers economic assessment appeared to overlook the ways in which a total halt to trade between the two neighbors would ripple through both nations - changing prices, currency values, jobs and wages, arguably helping some industries but damaging others. The net impact of Trumps calculations, which run counter to most widely accepted views of the benefits of trade, are hard to predict, said Claude Barfield, a trade expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. These views about the trade deficit and its alleged negative impact...are nonsense, and are views he has held since the 1980s, said Barfield. It could happen, he said of a hypothetical severing of ties between the United States and Mexico, but the things you would do to make it happen would be hugely disruptive. Youd have to think what are the first- and second-order effects, as industries reorganize and consumers adapt.  In the case of Mexico, the American companies that exported a quarter of a trillion dollars of goods and services to that country last year would be out a customer, and likely cut jobs. Those American companies that tried to replace the $323 billion in Mexican imports would likely do so at a higher cost  assuming they are in the United States to begin with. There is no guarantee that if Trump were to seal the border with Mexico that it would save the United States any money, said Marcus Noland, a trade economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. It may simply reduce consumption through higher prices charged by domestic suppliers, or lead to increased imports from a different country.     Americans seem to really like guacamole, Noland said, but the idea that we are going to have giant greenhouses and lots of avocados and limes - the fact that we are purchasing them from the Mexicans rather than producing them at home tells you producing them at home is more expensive. We can stop trading with the Mexicans, and have $60 billion less in consumption. Since consumption accounts for a large part of the U.S. economy, that is not an outcome Trump would want, though it would be one way, economists note, to achieve the trade balance the president and his advisers regard as important.  Trump told Reuters: There is no such thing as a trade war when you have a deficit. Most economists disagree with the notion that the trade deficit matters much to a country as large and self-sufficient as the United States.  Trade at that scale in particular is shaped by global savings and investment patterns that in recent years have favored the United States.  By the statistics most widely accepted among economists, the U.S. position with the rest of the world has been steadily improving as investment flows into the country from abroad and supports millions of jobs.  The current account deficit  which includes trade flows, investment, and other financial transfers across borders   has been shrinking for more than a decade and is now less than 2 percent of gross domestic product. As far as the impact of trade on the federal deficit - a separate concept reflecting how much the government spends and how much it collects from businesses and households - Trump said that he was not worried that his plan to cut taxes will result in a sea of red ink because we will do trade deals that are going to make up for a tremendous amount of the deficits.  Economists, however, say any connection is circuitous, felt through channels like an increase in tax payments from new job holders or stronger corporate profits  but hard to estimate and likely small. Even if Trump achieved his wildest success, and eliminated the United States $500 billion trade deficit solely through increased exports that boosted gross domestic product on a dollar-for-dollar basis, it would do little to dent the estimated $7 trillion in government deficits his tax plan is projected to generate over the next decade.  Alan Cole, an economist at the Tax Foundation, said that every dollar of gross domestic product generates about 17.6 cents in federal government revenue, meaning the $500 billion trade shortfall would translate into just $88 billion in new taxes.  Even that, he said, is wildly generous. You have to say where is the new production coming from, which people, which places? Cole said. Will it be new factories being built, and if so why havent they been built already?  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Trump pledged his allegiance to the powerful National Rifle Association, the countrys leading gun-rights advocacy group, at a convention attended by thousands. Elected in part on a law-and-order platform, Trump was the first sitting president to address the NRA since fellow Republican Ronald Reagan in 1983. As your president, I will never, ever infringe on the right of the people to keep and bear arms, Trump told thousands of people attending the NRAs annual convention in Atlanta, Georgia. Trump, whose candidacy last year was endorsed by the NRA, marks his first 100 days in office on Saturday with no major legislative achievements but with a long litany of actions to loosen federal regulations and review free trade agreements. Stymied by his initial bid to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border when Congress balked at funding the initiative, Trump vowed he will sooner or later build the wall, which had been a signature campaign promise. We need a wall. Well build the wall. Dont even think about it, he said. Politics and his unexpected election victory on Nov. 8 over Democrat Hillary Clinton also featured prominently in his remarks. Speculating on who might run for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, Trump brought up the name of U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and used a derogatory nickname he had adopted for her last year. It may be Pochahontas, and she is not big on the NRA, Trump said of Warren, who had once said she had some Native American ancestry. Pocahontas is a legendary Native American figure from the 1600s. Trump later attended a fund-raiser for Republican candidate Karen Handel, who will face Democrat Jon Ossoff on June 20 to determine who will win a House of Representatives seat to replace Tom Price, who became Trumps health and human services secretary. Trump, at the NRA event, returned time and again to the theme of responsible gun ownership. You have a true friend and champion in the White House, he said. We want to assure you of the sacred right of self defense for all of our citizens. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"
"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump complained on Thursday that U.S. ally Saudi Arabia was not treating the United States fairly and Washington was losing a tremendous amount of money defending the kingdom. In an interview with Reuters, Trump confirmed his administration was in talks about possible visits to Saudi Arabia and Israel in the second half of May. He is due to make his first trip abroad as president for a May 25 NATO summit in Brussels and could add other stops. Frankly, Saudi Arabia has not treated us fairly, because we are losing a tremendous amount of money in defending Saudi Arabia, he said. Trumps criticism of Riyadh was a return to his 2016 election campaign rhetoric when he accused the kingdom of not pulling its weight in paying for the U.S. security umbrella. Nobodys going to mess with Saudi Arabia because were watching them, Trump told a campaign rally in Wisconsin a year ago. Theyre not paying us a fair price. Were losing our shirt. The United States is the main supplier for most Saudi military needs, from F-15 fighters to control and command systems worth tens of billions of dollars in recent years, while American contractors win major energy deals. The worlds top oil exporter and its biggest consumer have enjoyed close economic ties for decades, with U.S. firms building much of the infrastructure of the modern Saudi state after its oil boom in the 1970s. Saudi officials could not immediately be reached for comment on Trumps latest comments. But Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir rejected similar comments from Trump during his election campaign, telling CNN during a visit to Washington last July that the Islamic kingdom carries its own weight as an ally. Saudi Arabias powerful deputy crown prince Mohammed bin Salman met with Trump last month in a meeting that was hailed by a senior Saudi adviser as a historical turning point in relations. The talks appeared to signal a meeting of minds on many issues, including their shared view that Iran posed a regional security threat. Riyadh and other Gulf allies see in Trump a strong president who will shore up Washingtons role as their main strategic partner and help contain Riyadhs adversary Iran in a region central to U.S. security and energy interests, regional analysts said. Asked about the fight against Islamic State, which Saudi Arabia and other U.S. allies are confronting as a coalition, Trump said the militant group had to be defeated. I have to say, there is an end. And it has to be humiliation, Trump said, when asked about what the endgame was for defeating Islamist violent extremism. There is an end. Otherwise its really tough. But there is an end, without detailing a strategy. A visit to Israel would reciprocate a White House visit in February by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is due to meet Trump next Wednesday in Washington. Trump has set a more positive tone with Israel than his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, who often clashed with the right-wing Israeli leader, and has raised concerns among Palestinians that their leaders may not get equal treatment. Trump has also asked Israel to put unspecified limits on its building of Jewish settlements on land the Palestinians want for a state, and has promised to seek a Middle East peace deal that eluded his predecessors. However, he has offered no new diplomatic prescriptions. I want to see peace with Israel and the Palestinians, he said. There is no reason theres not peace between Israel and the Palestinians - none whatsoever. Trump brushed aside a question of whether he might use a possible trip to Israel to declare U.S. recognition of the entire city of Jerusalem as Israels capital, a reversal of longstanding U.S. foreign policy likely to draw international condemnation. Ask me in a month on that, he said, without elaborating. If Trump ties an Israel visit to next months Brussels trip, it would be around the time Israelis are celebrating the 50th anniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem, when Israel captured Arab East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war. Successive U.S. administrations as well as the international community have not recognized Israels annexation of the eastern part of the city, and the future status of Jerusalem remains one of the thorniest issues in the Israeli-Palestinian dispute. Israel claims all of Jerusalem, which contains sites sacred to the Jewish, Muslim and Christian faiths, as its capital. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state of their own.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump took office on Jan. 20 with a long list of promises for his first 100 days. His record has been mixed. Here are the main issues he has confronted and what he has achieved ahead of Saturdays 100th day.  A pledge to repeal and replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obamas signature domestic policy, was among Trumps central 2016 election campaign promises. It is also one of the biggest failures of his first 100 days.  A bill in the House of Representatives was withdrawn in late March when Republicans could not muster enough votes for passage even though they control the chamber.  A reworked plan this week has drawn support from the House Freedom Caucus, the conservative bloc that helped sink the original bill. That improves the chances of a deal in the House though it is unclear if it can win enough support from moderate Republicans, and it would face tougher challenges in the Senate.   Trump repeatedly promised the biggest tax reform since the 1980s. This week he proposed legislation to slash the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent, cut the top personal income tax rate to 35 percent, repeal the inheritance tax, and temporarily slash the rate on overseas profits repatriated to the United States. The plan, however, is vague and even senior Republican lawmakers described it as offering only guideposts for legislative changes.  Trumps foreign policy has been marked by major shifts. Russia: Trump spoke admiringly of Russian President Vladimir Putin during the campaign and indicated he wanted a rapprochement with Moscow. But the administration has not been able to fend off a controversy that has led to a congressional investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, including possible links between Trumps campaign and Moscow. Trumphas cooled considerably toward Putin. Putin condemned Trumps decision in early April to launch cruise missile strikes on Syria in punishment for a chemical weapons attack by the Syrian government, and Trump said the relationship with Russia may be at an all-time low.  North Korea: A growing nuclear and missile threat from North Korea is perhaps Trumps most serious security challenge. He has vowed to prevent North Korea from being able to hit the United States with a nuclear missile, a capability experts say Pyongyang could have some time after 2020. Trumps administration aims to push North Korea into dismantling its nuclear and missile programs through tougher international sanctions and diplomatic pressure. He has pressed China, North Koreas biggest trading partner, to do more to curb Pyongyangs nuclear program.  NATO: Trump alarmed U.S. allies during the election campaign by calling NATO obsolete. In mid-April he lavished praise on NATO and said it is not obsolete.  Syria: Trump had vowed to avoid entanglements in Middle East conflicts and, in his first days in office, said he did not want the United States dragged deeper into the Syrian conflict. But he responded to the chemical weapons attack, which killed dozens of people, by ordering strikes on a Syrian air base. That won praise from allies in Europe and from U.S. lawmakers.  Trump promised a crackdown on illegal immigrants entering the United States and the deportation of illegal immigrants living in the country, especially those with criminal records. He also pledged to build a wall along the border and to get Mexico to pay for it.  The approach and strong rhetoric have had an effect with the number of migrants caught trying to enter the country illegally hitting a 17-year low in March. The number of children traveling with a guardian and apprehended at the southern U.S. border plunged by more than 90 percent in March from December. Trump insists he will build the border wall, but in order to lift the threat of a government shutdown, he gave way on his demand this week that Congress include full funding for it in a spending bill.  Trump campaigned on a promise to bar the entry of Muslims into the United States, casting it as part of the fight against the Islamic State militant group. On Jan. 27, he ordered a temporary ban on the entry of nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Syria. He also indefinitely banned refugees from Syria and temporarily banned refugees from all other countries. A federal judge temporarily halted the ban, and a federal appeals court upheld that ruling. Trump issued a revised travel ban in early March, only to see it again blocked in federal court. Similarly, a federal judge this week blocked his order to withhold federal funding from so-called sanctuary cities, which offer safe harbor to illegal immigrants.  This is one of Trumps clearest wins. His promise to select a like-minded successor to Justice Antonin Scalia, who died early last year, was kept with the nomination of Neil Gorsuch. The Senate confirmed Gorsuch despite Democratic opposition, restoring a conservative majority on the court.  Trump withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal just days after his inauguration, keeping a campaign promise. Trump had both threatened to withdraw from or renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), blaming it for an exodus of U.S. jobs to Mexico. The threats of withdrawal had jolted financial markets at various times. On Thursday, Trump extended an olive branch, saying he would not terminate NAFTA after the leaders of Mexico and Canada asked him to work on a new trade deal.  Trump also ordered a review of the causes of U.S. trade deficits, such as dumping of products below cost; unfair subsidies; misaligned currencies; and non-reciprocal trade practices.  Trump had vowed to name China a currency manipulator, meaning the United States could then impose tariffs on Chinese goods. But in mid-April he changed course and said that China was not a currency manipulator. Trump has acted aggressively on his promise to eliminate regulations that he said were hurting the U.S. economy. He issued a permit for the controversial Keystone XL pipeline. He also rescinded Obama-era climate change regulations, including the Clean Power Plan; a ban on coal leasing on federal lands; and rules to curb methane emissions from oil and gas production.  As part of a push to open up more federal lands to drilling, mining and other development, Trump ordered a review to identify national monuments that can be rescinded or resized. Legal challenges are expected.  His administration has approved a dozen measures rolling back regulations passed in the final months of the Obama administration on the environment, energy, education and financial services. Trump has pledged to keep U.S. companies from shipping jobs overseas. Before taking office, Trump used the muscle of his election victory to threaten companies about moving jobs abroad. He claimed victories with the Carrier unit of United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) and with Ford Motor Co (F.N), though Carrier still cut hundreds of jobs in Indiana and Ford said it scrapped plans for a Mexican factory because of declining demand for small cars in North America. The jury is still out on how successful he can be in keeping jobs from going overseas. Trump ordered a review of the H-1B visa program, which brings highly skilled foreign workers into the United States. He says he wants to modify or replace the current lottery system with a merit-based system for highly skilled workers.  This was one of Trumps rallying cries during the campaign, saying he would change Washington by cracking down on the influence of special interests and political elites. He criticized Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton for her paid speeches to Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs but has named several former Goldman executives to his inner circle. He did ban appointees of any executive agency from lobbying for five years after leaving government employment and permanently banned future former appointees from activity on behalf of any government or political party abroad.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Friday granted a Trump administration request to put on hold a legal challenge by industry and a group of states to former President Barack Obamas regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse emissions mainly from coal-fired power plants, rules that the Republican president is moving to undo. A 10-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit granted the request to put the litigation involving the regulations, known as the Clean Power Plan, in abeyance for at least 60 days while the administration plans its next steps. The court also asked the administration and other parties to file briefs on whether the case should be sent back to the Environmental Protection Agency.     The Supreme Court last year put the regulations on hold pending the outcome of the case. In a separate order issued on Friday, the same court put on hold a case challenging another set of Obama climate regulations aimed at new power plants.  Twenty-seven states, led by coal-producer West Virginia and industry groups, challenged the Obama regulation. Other states and environmental groups backed the former administration. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who sided with the previous administrations EPA to defend the Clean Power Plan, brushed off the courts move, saying it simply puts the litigation on hold for 60 days. Todays temporary pause in the litigation does not relieve EPA of its legal obligation to limit carbon pollution from its largest source: fossil-fueled power plants, Schneiderman said. I will continue to fight in court to ensure EPA fulfills its legal responsibility.  West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, who led the challenge against the rule, said Fridays decision signaled that the court has acknowledged the change in the political landscape and that a decision on the merits is not appropriate at this time. An executive order by Trump was part of his effort to cut federal environmental regulations to revive the energy drilling and coal mining industries, a promise he made during the 2016 presidential campaign. Energy analysts and executives have questioned whether Trumps broad moves against environmental regulations will provide a big benefit for their industries, and environmentalists have called his actions reckless. The Clean Power Plan was designed to lower carbon emissions from existing U.S. power plants by 2030 to 32 percent below 2005 levels. It was seen as the main tool for the United States to meet the emissions-reduction target it promised to reach at U.N. climate talks in Paris in December 2015. Power plants are the largest source of U.S. carbon emissions.  David Cherney, an energy analyst for PA Consulting, said the D.C. Circuit ruling gives the Trump administration more time to come up with a replacement to the Clean Power Plan, which will inevitably be followed by more legal challenges. Any change to the Clean Power Plan by the Trump administration will be challenged in courts and would need to be sufficiently justified to survive legal challenge from the environmental lobby, Cherney said.

Trump told Reuters in an interview on Thursday he wants South Korea to pay for the $1 billion Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system.  Even if we purchase THAAD, its main operation would be in the hands of the United States, said Kim Ki-jung, a foreign policy adviser to Moon and professor at Seouls Yonsei University. So purchasing it would be an impossible option. That was our topic when we were considering the options, Kim said. Moon is leading polls by a wide margin ahead of a May 9 election to replace impeached former President Park Geun-hye, whose government agreed last year to deploy THAAD. Lee Ji-soo, a spokesman for Moon, said campaign officials were aware of the reported comments by Trump and deliberating his demand that South Korea pay for THAAD but added that there was no official comment from Moons camp yet. Trump, in the interview as he prepared to mark 100 days in office on Saturday, also accused another ally, Saudi Arabia, of not paying enough for the U.S. defense umbrella. Trumps comments harked back to his populist campaign rhetoric and Bonnie Glaser, an Asia expert at Washingtons Center for Strategic and International Studies, said they betrayed a lack of strategic thinking. Trumps remarks reflect his persistent desire for allies to pay more for their defense, she said. As far as their impact on South Koreas election, they will likely boost support for Moon, and if he wins, it will make it harder for the U.S. to sustain a hardline policy against North Korea. So Trumps remarks dont seem very strategic to me. Trumps comments provoked some consternation among Democrats and Republicans in the U.S. Congress. Congressional aides noted the THAAD deployment came after years of discussions, in which South Korea took a great deal of convincing and then suffered economic retaliation from China. It just seems completely tone deaf ... That system isnt just good for South Korea, its also good for us, one aide said, adding that it would also defend U.S. troops in South Korea and deter North Korea from targeting U.S. territory. The U.S. military started THAAD deployment in early March, despite strong opposition from China, which says the systems radar can be used to spy into its territory. The deployment has also prompted a North Korean warning of retaliation.  South Korea said on Wednesday major elements of the system were moved into the planned site in Seonjgu in the south of the country and would be fully operational by the end of this year. That system will have initial operational capability very soon, a Pentagon spokesman told reporters on Friday. The Pentagon has called THAAD a critical measure to defend South Koreans and U.S. forces and the top U.S. commander in the Pacific, Admiral Harry Harris, said the system would be operational in coming days. Seonjgu residents have protested, citing safety fears and its potential to be a wartime target. The United States currently has six THAAD batteries worldwide and a former U.S. State Department official, who estimated the cost of each at about $1.2 billion, said Washington would not want to sell THAAD to Seoul.  We want to retain THAAD in our arsenal, consistent with all other U.S. weapons systems deployed on the Korean peninsula. We own them. We retain them. We have the right to redeploy them, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Asked when he would announce his intention to renegotiate the pact, Trump said: Very soon. Im announcing it now.  Trump also said he was considering adding stops to Israel and Saudi Arabia to a Europe trip next month, emphasizing that he wanted to see an Israeli-Palestinian peace. He complained that Saudi Arabia was not paying its fair share for U.S. defense.  Asked about the fight against Islamic State, Trump said the militant group had to be defeated.  I have to say, there is an end. And it has to be humiliation, he said, when asked about what the endgame was for defeating Islamist violent extremism.  Trump said North Korea was his biggest global challenge. He lavished praise on Chinese President Xi Jinping for Chinese assistance in trying to rein in Pyongyang. The two leaders met in Florida earlier this month.  I believe he is trying very hard. He certainly doesnt want to see turmoil and death. He doesnt want to see it. He is a good man. He is a very good man and I got to know him very well.  With that being said, he loves China and he loves the people of China. I know he would like to be able to do something, perhaps its possible that he cant, Trump said.  Trump spoke just a day after he and his top national security advisers briefed U.S. lawmakers on the North Korean threat and one day before Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will press the United Nations Security Council on sanctions to further isolate Pyongyang over its nuclear and missile programs.  The Trump administration on Wednesday declared North Korea an urgent national security threat and top foreign policy priority. It said it was focusing on economic and diplomatic pressure, including Chinese cooperation in containing its defiant neighbor and ally, and remained open to negotiations.  U.S. officials said military strikes remained an option but played down the prospect, though the administration has sent an aircraft carrier and a nuclear-powered submarine to the region in a show of force.  Any direct U.S. military action would run the risk of massive North Korean retaliation and huge casualties in Japan and South Korea and among U.S. forces in both countries.  Trump, asked if he considered North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to be rational, said he was operating from the assumption that he is rational. He noted that Kim had taken over his country at an early age.  Hes 27 years old. His father dies, took over a regime. So say what you want but that is not easy, especially at that age.  Im not giving him credit or not giving him credit, Im just saying thats a very hard thing to do. As to whether or not hes rational, I have no opinion on it. I hope hes rational, he said.  Trump, sipping a Coke delivered by an aide after the president ordered it by pressing a button on his desk, rebuffed an overture from Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, who told Reuters a direct phone call with Trump could take place again after their first conversation in early December angered Beijing.  China considers neighboring Taiwan to be a renegade province.  My problem is that I have established a very good personal relationship with President Xi, said Trump. I really feel that he is doing everything in his power to help us with a big situation. So I wouldnt want to be causing difficulty right now for him.  So I would certainly want to speak to him first.  Trump also said he hoped to avoid a potential government shutdown amid a dispute between congressional Republicans and Democrats over a spending deal with a Saturday deadline looming.  But he said if a shutdown takes place, it will be the Democrats fault for trying to add money to the legislation to bail out Puerto Rico and other items.  He also defended the one-page tax plan he unveiled on Wednesday from criticism that it would increase the U.S. deficit, saying better trade deals and economic growth would offset the costs.  We will do trade deals that are going to make up for a tremendous amount of the deficit. We are going to be doing trade deals that are going to be much better trade deals, Trump said.

Well see what happens. If theres a shutdown, theres a shutdown, Trump told Reuters in an interview, adding that Democrats would be to blame if the federal government was left unfunded.  Congress has until 12:01 a.m. ET on Saturday to pass a bill to fund the government or face a shutdown, which would temporarily lay off hundreds of thousands of federal workers. Republicans introduced a bill on Wednesday to fund government operations at current levels for one more week, giving them time to finish negotiations with Democrats on the plan for the rest of the fiscal year ending Sept. 30. Trump said a shutdown would be a very negative thing but that his administration was prepared if it was necessary.

We will do trade deals that are going to make up for a tremendous amount of the deficit. We are going to be doing trade deals that are going to be much better trade deals, Trump said.  Trump also said it would be unfair to offer a debt bailout to Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, because it was unfair to people in U.S. states. As part of the budget negotiations, Democrats have called for financial support to prop up Puerto Ricos Medicaid program covering health insurance for the poor, but many Republicans are opposed to the idea.   I dont think thats fair to the people of Iowa, and I dont think its fair to the people of Wisconsin and Ohio and North Carolina and Pennsylvania that we should be bailing out Puerto Rico for billions and billions of dollars, Trump said.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": "" CLEARWATER, Fla. (Reuters) - Some of his supporters fret that President Donald Trump is backing himself into a corner with promises that cant be kept. Others lament he is not pulling America from international conflicts as he vowed  or say he should get off of Twitter.  Those grumbles are early warning signs for Trump as he marks his 100th day in office on Saturday.  They were heard in Reuters interviews with Trump supporters in swing counties that went for Democrat Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 but then flipped for Trump last year  a slice of the electorate dominated by white voters that is crucial to the Republicans re-election hopes and that Democrats want to win back.  Reuters visited the same four places - Pinellas County in Florida, Northampton County in eastern Pennsylvania, Macomb County outside of Detroit, Michigan, and Gates County in rural North Carolina - right after the Nov. 8 election.  What reporters found this time in more than two dozen interviews is that Trump voters are largely standing with their man but with signs of restlessness, mainly over foreign policy, concerns over getting legislation through Congress and some skepticism that he wont be able to follow through with promises  from building a wall along the Mexican border to repealing Obamas signature healthcare law.  But rather than bash Trump, many largely blamed Democrats and Republicans alike, a fractured Congress, the federal judiciary, and what they see as a hostile news media.  They showed a willingness to trust the president almost implicitly, saw him as a tireless worker, and appreciated his efforts to secure the border and curb immigration. They had little interest in the in-fighting between his senior aides in the White House.  Maybe sometimes I question whats going on, said Karen Mayer, 47, an attorney in Clearwater, a west coast Florida city in Pinellas County, where the majority of its 500,000 voters went for Obama in 2008 and 2012 but then flipped for Trump last year. He prevailed over Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton by slightly more than 1 percent of the vote there.  But at the same time, I have faith that he has a strong team, Mayer said.  In a statement touting Trumps record in the first 100 days, the White House highlighted, among other things, his attempts to streamline government by proposing a lean budget, and his aggressiveness in foreign affairs, particularly with regard to challenging Russia and Iran.  If Trump has reason to worry about his re-election prospects, it should be because of supporters like Brian McCann, 48, who owns a real estate firm in Northampton, Pennsylvania. I think hes finding out that he cant follow through on all his talk, he said. Internationally, I think hes creating more tensions than solutions.  That was the main reason that Holly Peseski, 46, a legal assistant in Mt. Clemens, Michigan, graded Trumps tenure as a B-minus so far. I dont like the recent bombings hes done, Peseski said, referring to U.S. missile strikes on a Syrian airfield and a huge bomb dropped on a militant hideout in Afghanistan. He was a little too quick to act.  Peseski had another complaint about Trump: I wish hed get off of Twitter.   The counties Reuters visited reflect the rural, suburban and largely white coalition that carried Trump to the White House.  Trump was able to flip these counties and dozens more like them powered by an enthusiastic voter base that included many people who had not cast ballots in years, as well as some Democrats who crossed over largely because of their dislike of Clinton.  An analysis of Reuters/Ipsos polling data shows slippage in Trump's approval ratings, with lower enthusiasm among white men without a college degree, the core of his political base.  In comparing Trumps approval rating in the first 20 days of his tenure to a 20-day period in April, Reuters also found a rise in disapproval among independents, college-educated adults, people with below-average incomes, white women and white Millennials.  Those women voters were important to Trumps victory. He beat Clinton 53 percent to 43 percent among white women, who comprise 37 percent of the electorate. In Pinellas County, for instance, white women are by far the largest demographic among its more than 275,000 registered voters. Trump beat Clinton there by a little more than 5,000 votes.  David Jolly, a former Republican congressman who lost his Pinellas-based seat in November in part, he said, because of his criticism of Trump, has seen few signs that the presidents support is fading, but at the same time, hes not picking up new supporters.  Trumps overall approval rating in Reuters/Ipsos polling has declined steadily over the past two weeks and is now at its lowest level since he took office, with 40 percent of Americans now approving of his performance in office.  Some voters interviewed in the swing counties identified the struggling effort to replace Obamas healthcare law as an early worry about Trump.  Walter Watson, 62, a retired art teacher in Gatesville, a town of about 320 people in rural Gates County, North Carolina, said he did not like the way Trump and Republicans tried to rush through a new healthcare plan without giving it what he thought was proper consideration.  You got to be careful, because this is a life and death issue for a lot of people, Watson said.  His sparsely populated county backed Obama with 52 percent of the vote in 2012, but Trump won it with 53 percent in 2016.  Congress is the biggest hindrance to Trumps success, many of those interviewed said.  I dont think hes going to be able to do even half of what he claimed, said Bob White, 71, a retired finance worker in Clinton Township in Michigan. I dont think Congress is going to go along with him.  But even as they express skepticism that Trump can achieve all of his campaign promises, his supporters are sticking with him for now.  I think hes trying, said Watson. But he probably overstated what he could do, because even a president has limits.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump told Reuters on Thursday he will either renegotiate or terminate what he called a horrible free trade deal with South Korea and said Seoul should pay for a U.S. anti-missile system that he priced at $1 billion. In an interview with Reuters, Trump called the five-year-old trade pact with South Korea unacceptable and said it would be targeted for renegotiation after his administration completes a revamp of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Canada and Mexico. He blamed the U.S.-Korean trade deal, known as KORUS, on his 2016 Democratic presidential election opponent, Hillary Clinton, who as secretary of state promoted the final version of the trade pact before its approval by Congress in 2011. It is unacceptable, it is a horrible deal made by Hillary, the Republican Trump said. Its a horrible deal, and we are going to renegotiate that deal or terminate it. Asked when he would announce his intention to renegotiate the deal, Trump said: Very soon. Im announcing it now. Trump's comments stunned South Korean financial markets, sending Seoul stocks .KS11 and the won currency KRW= into reverse even as the country's economic outlook has started to brighten. South Koreas foreign ministry said Seoul would continue to explain to the Trump administration the benefits of the free trade deal. Washington had not officially filed a request to Seoul to renegotiate the agreement, it said. Our government will keep monitoring the situation and continue our efforts to explain to the United States the mutually reciprocal outcome of the South Korea-U.S. FTA, while preparing for countermeasures, the ministry said. With global demand improving, exports of goods such as cars and electronics have been leading a recovery in South Korea and a number of other trade-reliant Asian economies such as Japan and Taiwan, boosting their manufacturing sectors. Talk and actual policy are different, a high-ranking official at South Koreas finance ministry, who declined to be identified as he is not authorized to speak to the media, told Reuters. KORUS was initially negotiated by the Republican administration of President George W. Bush in 2007, but that version was scrapped and renegotiated by President Barack Obamas Democratic administration three years later. The U.S. goods trade deficit with South Korea has more than doubled since KORUS took effect in March 2012, from $13.2 billion in 2011 to $27.7 billion in 2016, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. Trump said the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile system now being deployed in South Korea to defend against a potential missile attack from North Korea would cost about $1 billion and questioned why the United States was paying for it.  I informed South Korea it would be appropriate if they paid. Its a billion-dollar system, Trump said. Its phenomenal, shoots missiles right out of the sky. Asked about the remarks, South Koreas defense ministry said in a statement there was no change to the existing agreement that Seoul provides land for the deployment while Washington shoulders the cost of installing and operating the system.  Moon Jae-in, the South Korean presidential frontrunner, said the new government should given the choice to decide whether to agree to the deployment.  Ill decide after sufficient public consensus and parliamentary approval, he said at a televised presidential debate ahead of the May 9 election.  His top foreign policy adviser earlier told Reuters that Trumps suggestion would be an impossible option because the U.S. military operates the system. The U.S. military started the deployment of THAAD in early March, despite strong opposition from China, which worries the systems powerful radar can be used to spy into its territory. Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) is the prime contractor for the THAAD system.  A former U.S. State Department official estimated the cost of the system at about $1.2 billion but said the United States would not want to sell THAAD to Seoul. We want to retain THAAD in our arsenal, consistent with all other U.S. weapons systems deployed on the Korean peninsula. We own them. We retain them. We have the right to redeploy them, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

In a White House interview, Trump brushed aside the idea after Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen told Reuters on Thursday she would not rule out talking directly again to the U.S. president, an act certain to incense China. The status of self-ruled Taiwan is possibly the most sensitive issue between Washington and Beijing.  Look, my problem is I have established a very good personal relationship with President Xi. I really feel that he is doing everything in his power to help us with a big situation, Trump told Reuters, referring to signs that China may be working to head off any new missile or nuclear test by Pyongyang, Beijings neighbor and ally.  So I wouldnt want to be causing difficulty right now for him, Trump added. I think hes doing an amazing job as a leader and I wouldnt want to do anything that comes in the way of that. So I would certainly want to speak to him first.  REUTERS RECOMMENDS Racism on the rise: Reuters poll How North Korea gets its oil from China As president-elect in early December, Trump took a congratulatory phone call from Tsai. It was the first contact between a leader of Taiwan and an incumbent or incoming U.S. president in nearly four decades, and Trump cast doubt on Washingtons longstanding policy of acknowledging Beijings one China policy, which asserts that Taiwan is a part of China.  The call angered Beijing because it fears contacts between Taiwan and leaders of other countries would confer sovereignty on the island. Democratic Taiwan, self-ruled since 1949, has no interest in being ruled by autocratic China.  Trump agreed to honor the one China policy in February and then hosted Xi at his Florida resort earlier this month.  Trumps dismissal of Tsais suggestion underscored the importance he is placing on enlisting Chinas help in defusing tension with North Korea, which has become his biggest national security challenge since taking office in January, 100 days ago come Saturday.  On Friday, in response to Trumps remarks, Taiwans presidential office said it had no plans at this stage to hold a call, and that it understood the United States had priorities in handling regional affairs.  In a statement, Tsais spokesman, Alex Huang, said the government would not overly limit itself, but would pursue the islands best interest.  In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang urged Taiwan to pay attention to the United States reaction.  We consistently oppose countries which have diplomatic relations with China having any form of official exchanges with Taiwan, Geng told a daily news briefing on Friday.  This position is very clear and very firm.  F-35 REQUEST  Tsai told Reuters on Thursday Taiwans ties with the United States have been improving. She said Taiwan may need to buy from its sole arms supplier the F-35 fighter jet, the most advanced stealth warplane in the U.S. arsenal.  We have the opportunity to communicate more directly with the U.S. government, Tsai said. We dont exclude the opportunity to call President Trump himself, but it depends on the needs of the situation and the U.S. governments consideration of regional affairs.  Tsai said, We dont rule out any items that would be meaningful to our defense and our defense strategy and the F-35 is one such item.  But when told Taiwans president had said the island might want to buy F-35 aircraft, Trump said: Oh, I havent been informed. Id have to think about that. Id have to speak to my people about that. They (the Taiwanese government) do buy a lot of equipment from us.  Chinas Defence Ministry said on Thursday it was resolutely opposed to any country selling arms to Taiwan.  U.S. officials told Reuters last month that the Trump administration was crafting a big arms package for Taiwan that could include advanced rocket systems and anti-ship missiles to defend against China, a deal sure to anger Beijing.  But one of the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said at the time the administration was not considering selling the F-35 to Taiwan.  The package is expected to be significantly larger than one that was shelved at the end of the Obama administration  valued at around $1 billion  but completion of a new deal could take months and possibly into next year, the official said.  The Global Times, an influential Chinese Communist Party-backed tabloid, called Tsais government a naughty child in an editorial on Friday and said it would strongly counter any move to sell Taiwan advanced fighter jets.  Each time the Tsai Ing-wen authorities step out of line they will pay the price, like a naughty child in class getting a stern reprimand for shouting out or smashing the glass at school, it said.

White House officials had urged a floor vote on the legislation before President Donald Trumps 100th day in office on Saturday, hoping to follow through on a campaign promise to repeal and replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Advocates had hoped to raise enough support for the measure after a group of hard-line Republican conservatives endorsed an amended version on Wednesday. But by Thursday evening Republican leaders still had not collected enough votes from moderate Republicans whose backing was also needed for passage in the House, given united Democratic opposition. We wont vote this week, said one House Republican aide, who asked not to be named. Next week was not ruled out, another indicated. Well call a vote when we have the votes. Representative Pete Sessions, a senior House Republican, also left the door open to a vote next week. Possibly referring to Trump, Sessions said that a lot of people had tried to rush the legislation to the floor, but House Republican leaders want to allow the time to do it right. I said it will find its time and I am satisfied we are moving at a pace, keeping people engaged, he said at a late night session of the House Rules Committee he chairs. The Republican healthcare bill would replace Obamacares income-based tax credit with an age-based credit, roll back an expansion of the Medicaid government health insurance program for the poor and repeal most Obamacare taxes. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office had estimated 24 million fewer people would have insurance than under the original version.  House leaders brought the bill to the floor last month after Trump demanded a vote, but yanked it after a rebellion by Republican moderates and the partys most conservative lawmakers, in a major setback for Trump. An amendment drafted by Representative Tom MacArthur won over conservatives in the hardline Freedom Caucus this week, reviving some hopes that the bill could still pass. The amendment would allow states to seek waivers from some provisions. Among these are one mandating that insurers charge those with pre-existing conditions the same as healthy consumers, and that insurers cover so-called essential health benefits, such as maternity care.      But a number of centrist Republicans still opposed the measure. Protections for those with pre-existing conditions without contingency, and affordable access to coverage for every American, remain my priorities for advancing healthcare reform, and this bill does not satisfy those benchmarks for me, Representative Ryan Costello of Pennsylvania said in a statement posted on social network Twitter on Thursday. Some outside groups like the American Medical Association weighed in against the legislation, saying it would cost millions their health care coverage. The bills future is further clouded in the Senate. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The House Rules Committee, in a late-night meeting, voted 8-2 to send the legislation to the full House of Representatives for debate and votes on passage on Friday, just hours before expiry of a deadline for funding many federal agencies. If the measure passes the House, as expected, the Senate would be prepared to promptly take up the bill, in the hope of also passing it and sending it to President Donald Trump to be signed into law. The measure would give Republican and Democratic lawmakers an additional week to work out differences on about $1 trillion in funding for the government through Sept. 30, the end of the current fiscal year. Without the extension or a longer-term funding bill, federal agencies will run out of money by midnight Friday, likely triggering abrupt layoffs of hundreds of thousands of federal government workers until funding resumes.  The last government shutdown, in 2013, lasted for 17 days, and many lawmakers were nervous about the prospect of another. Im confident we will be able to pass a short-term extension of funding for programs for the fiscal year that began nearly seven months ago, House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters early on Thursday. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi warned that the purpose of the stopgap measure was to tie up loose ends of a deal to provide around $1 trillion in money for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30 and not for kicking the can down the road to have this same back-and-forth over funding disputes.   House Appropriations Committee Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen expressed optimism in a statement that a final funding package will be completed soon. In the midst of the delicate negotiations, Trump took to social network Twitter to blast Democrats. As families prepare for summer vacations in our National Parks - Democrats threaten to close them and shut down the government. Terrible! Trump tweeted in a series of tweets. Negotiators were racing against the clock to resolve remaining disputes in the massive spending bill amid talks that have already handed Democrats at least two major victories, despite Republican control of Congress.     Trump, a Republican, gave in to Democratic demands that the spending bill not include money to start building the wall he wants to erect on the U.S.-Mexico border. His administration also agreed to continue funding for a major component of Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, despite vows to end the program. It remained unclear whether Republicans would prevail in their effort to sharply hike defense spending without similar increases for other domestic programs. Trump has proposed a $30-billion spending boost for the Pentagon for the rest of this fiscal year. Such funding disputes could resurface later in spending bills for the next fiscal year. Disagreements remaining to be ironed out include funding to make a healthcare program for coal miners permanent and to plug a gap in Puerto Ricos Medicaid program, the government health insurance program for the poor.

The Republican Trump, elected in November, had vowed during his campaign to withdraw from the Paris accord within 100 days of becoming president, part of a broader plan to sweep away Obama administration environmental protections he said were hobbling the economy. He has since said he is open to staying in the pact if Washington gets better terms, and scores of large U.S. companies and several Republican lawmakers have urged him to stay in the deal as a way to protect American industry interests overseas. Trump, who will mark the 100th day of his presidency on Saturday, told Reuters in an interview he would announce his decision in about two weeks, but complained that China, India, Russia and other countries were paying too little to help poorer countries battle climate change under the agreements Green Climate Fund. Its not a fair situation because they are paying virtually nothing and we are paying massive amounts of money, he said.  Asked for a hint of what his decision might be, he said: I can say this, we want to be treated fairly. An administration source told Reuters earlier that Trump administration officials would likely meet in May to decide whether to keep the United States in the climate deal, having had an initial meeting on Thursday at the White House. The group of advisers, which includes Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and national security adviser H.R. McMaster, was on track to make the decision before a Group of Seven summit on May 26, the source said. Tillerson, the former head of Exxon Mobil Corp, and Perry have said the country should remain in the agreement. McMaster shares that view, a source outside the administration said. Opponents of the pact include Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt, the former attorney general of oil-producing state Oklahoma, and White House chief strategist Steve Bannon. Nearly 200 countries struck the Paris agreement to limit climate change by cutting carbon dioxide emissions and making investments in clean energy. Many companies such as BP Plc and Microsoft Corp have urged the United States to stay in the agreement to protect their competitiveness. A group of nine Republican lawmakers on Thursday urged Trump to stick to the pact, but to weaken the U.S. pledge to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Congressman Kevin Cramer of oil-producing state North Dakota and eight other Republicans in the House of Representatives sent a letter to Trump urging him to use the countrys seat at the Paris table to defend and promote our commercial interest, including our manufacturing and fossil fuel sectors. If the United States is to stay in the 2015 agreement, Washington should present a new emissions cutting pledge that does no harm to our economy, said the letter from Cramer, who advised Trump on energy and climate during his 2016 presidential campaign. Trumps Democratic predecessor, former President Barack Obama, had pledged a 26 percent to 28 percent cut in U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 levels, by 2025. Most scientists say the world needs to curb greenhouse gas emissions to limit the effects of climate change, including rising seas, deadly heatwaves, and severe storms and droughts. The Republican lawmakers also said Washington should retain its seat on the Green Climate Fund but not make additional transfers to it. Obama pledged $3 billion to the fund in 2014, and gave $1 billion to it, with the last $500 million payment coming in his last days as president.

Trump said in an interview with Reuters that he will not hesitate to change course again and pull the plug on the North American Free Trade Agreement if the negotiations become unserious. His comments came at the end of a long 24 hours during which Ottawa and Mexico City were whipsawed over the Trump administrations intentions over the 23-year-old trade pact. You know I was really ready and psyched to terminate NAFTA, Trump said. He decided that it would be better to terminate the trade deal after hearing about Wisconsin farmers struggles with new Canadian dairy rules that were shutting out their milk protein exports. You saw that, you wrote about it, Trump said. And I said Ive had it. Ive had it. But after administration officials said a withdrawal order was being prepared, Trump said he received phone calls from Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau asking to renegotiate the pact.   Im not looking to hurt Canada and Im not looking to hurt Mexico. Theyre two countries I really like, Trump said. So they asked to renegotiate, and I said yes. News of the possible U.S. pullout from NAFTA rattled financial markets on Wednesday. Relative calm returned on Thursday after Trumps comments, and the Mexican peso strengthened 0.86 percent against the U.S. dollar, while the Canadian dollar was flat versus the greenback. Mexico, Canada and the United States form one of the worlds biggest trading blocs, and trade disruptions among them could adversely affect farm, automotive, energy and other sectors in all three countries. NAFTA removed most trade and tariff barriers between the neighbors, but Trump and other critics have blamed it for deep U.S. job cuts. Trump campaigned for president last year on a pledge to pull out of NAFTA if he could not renegotiate better terms. The United States went from running a small goods trade surplus with Mexico in the early 1990s to a $63-billion deficit in 2016. Asked by Reuters what would make NAFTA a fair deal, Trump said: Open markets. Open borders for trade and Fairness, no government subsidies so that it makes it impossible for our people to compete. He added that if the NAFTA negotiations become unserious, I will terminate. As Trump spoke, a new trade irritant between the United States and Canada emerged, as Boeing Co asked the U.S. Commerce Department to investigate alleged price dumping and unfair Canadian government subsidies for Bombardier Incs  new Canadian-made CSeries jetliners.    Trudeau told a news conference in Saskatchewan he had urged Trump not to withdraw from the trade pact and warned that doing so would cause a lot of short- and medium-term pain. Thats not something that either one of us would want, so we agreed that we could sit down and get to work on looking at ways to improve NAFTA, Trudeau said. Canada sends 75 percent of its exports to the United States. On Tuesday, Trump said he did not fear a trade war with Canada, a day after his administration moved to impose tariffs on Canadian lumber. In Mexico City, Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said Pena Nieto had called Trump on Wednesday and spoken with him for about 20 minutes in a conversation focused exclusively on the looming talks over NAFTAs renegotiation and modernization. Trump has accused Mexico of luring away American factories and jobs with cheap labor and other advantages enabled by NAFTA. During the presidential campaign he accused Mexico of sending rapists and criminals into the United States, and as president plans a U.S.-Mexico border wall. One of Trumps first major acts after becoming president in January was to pull out of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, negotiated by his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama. Several agriculture lobby groups in Washington were told U.S Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, confirmed by the Senate on Monday, met with Trump on Wednesday evening to dissuade him from withdrawing from NAFTA. American Soybean Association President Ron Moore said, When youre talking about $3 billion in soybean exports a year, any threats to withdraw from agreements and walk away from markets makes farmers extremely nervous. Formal NAFTA talks likely will not get started until August. The U.S. Trade Representatives office must first send Congress a notice that starts a 90-day consultation period preceding any negotiations. A USTR spokeswoman said the notice would not be sent until the Senate confirmed Trumps nominee for trade representative, Robert Lighthizer. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": "" WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States issued about 40 percent fewer temporary visas in March to citizens of seven countries covered by President Donald Trumps temporary travel bans than it did in an average month last year, according to a Reuters analysis of preliminary government data released on Thursday.  At the same time, the data showed that the total of U.S. non-immigrant visas issued to people from all countries was up by nearly 5 percent in March compared to the 2016 monthly average.  Citizens of the seven Muslim-majority nations under the bans - Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen - received about 3,200 non-immigrant visas in March 2017, compared to about 5,700 on average per month during the 2016 fiscal year and more than 6,000 on average per month in 2015 and 2014. Trump's travel bans were later blocked by the courts.    The State Department released the data to comply with a directive from Trump asking it to publish monthly breakdowns of the number of visas issued around the world.  The department did not release data on the total number of all types of visa applications, so it is unclear whether the lower number of temporary visas for citizens of the seven countries is because of a higher rate of rejections or other factors, such as fewer applicants or slower processing times.  A State Department official noted that visa demand is cyclical, not uniform throughout the year, and affected by various factors at the local and international level. Visa issuance numbers tend to increase during peak travel seasons, such as during the summer and the winter holidays.  The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  March is neither a busy nor slow time for temporary visa issuances to people from the seven countries, several immigration lawyers said. Therefore, the significant drops are notable, they said.  The data is preliminary and numbers could be subject to minor revision, the State Department said.  Previously, such data was only available in aggregate by fiscal year, and the department declined to break out March visa data from previous years.  Nevertheless, some immigration attorneys said the numbers released on Thursday provide a glimpse into how Trumps policies are affecting visa decisions.  Either there are many fewer people applying because they believe they will be denied, or a much higher rate of denials is already happening even though the executive orders have been blocked, said William Stock, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.    Trump, who has said the travel bans were intended to make Americans safer from attacks by terrorists, signed an executive order on Jan. 27 barring people from the seven countries from entering the United States for 90 days.  The order was blocked by federal courts and the Trump administration replaced it with a revised, narrower travel ban effective March 16 which dropped Iraq from the list. Courts have also halted parts of the second order.  The number of non-immigrant visas issued to Iranians dropped to 1,572 in March from 2,450 per month on average in 2016 according to the data. Iraqis received 684 such visas in March, compared to nearly twice that number per month on average in 2016, the data showed.  Iranians also received fewer immigrant visas, which are granted to family members of U.S. citizens or those with jobs in the United States,than the average in previous years - 393 received immigrant visas in March, compared to 644 on average per month in 2016 and nearly 600 on average per month in 2015 and 2014.  Although visitor visas were down across the board for the seven targeted countries, two of them saw the number of immigrant visas issued tick up slightly. Forty-one Libyans received immigrant visas in March, compared to 32 per month on average in 2016. Somalians received 171 visas in March compared to 150 on average in 2016.  Immigration lawyers said that although the travel bans have been halted by courts for now, the administrations vow to put stricter controls on immigration is likely to have changed how U.S. consulates evaluate visa applicants.  Stephen Pattison, a former State Department consular official now working as an immigration attorney, said consulates are going to probably err more on the side of denying some people that theyd be on the fence about.  Anecdotally, several U.S.-based lawyers with Iranian clients say their visa applications are taking longer to process and are being rejected more often since Trump took office on Jan. 20.  They cite shortages of interview appointments for Iranians, interviews canceled at the last minute and longer administrative processing periods than they are accustomed to.  If you cant get an interview, you cant get a visa, said Babak Yousefzadeh, a San Francisco-based attorney and member of the board of directors of the Iranian American Bar Association.  Some Iranians have decided that for now, it is not worth it to risk the expense and time of making U.S. visa applications, said Kiyanoush Razaghi, a Maryland-based immigration attorney.  In addition to paying a standard $160 visa application fee, Iranians must typically travel to Turkey, Armenia or the United Arab Emirates for their interviews, since there is no U.S. diplomatic presence in Iran.  Thats a fundamental change that I am seeing, at least in the community and among the clients that I have, Razaghi said. They have a general feeling that now is not a good time to apply for a visa.

In the past month, three U.S. service members have been killed in operations against Islamic State militants near Afghanistans porous border with Pakistan, where armed groups still find sanctuary.Officially, the U.S.-led international force in Afghanistan ceasedcombat operations at the end of 2014, but the conflict has proved difficult to exit without risking the overthrow of the government in Kabul. Current and former officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the Trump administration is carrying out an inter-agency review, and while no decision has been made, the discussions revolve around adding 3,000 to 5,000 troops.  One of the officials said there is an emphasis on avoiding artificial deadlines. Former President Barack Obama wanted to reduce the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan before he left office. He had ordered in more troops in 2011 that peaked at about 100,000.         Nearly 9,000 U.S. troops remain in Afghanistan; some 7,000 of them train and assist Afghan forces, and about 1,500 are a part of a counter-terrorism unit that mostly targetspockets of al Qaeda and Islamic State fighters, but also engages the Taliban. In February, Army General John Nicholson, the U.S. commander in Afghanistan, said he needs several thousand more international troops to break a stalemate with the Taliban. Some U.S. officials question the benefit of sending more troops to Afghanistan. To date, more than 2,300 Americans have been killed and over 17,000 wounded since the U.S. invaded  after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. These officials, who agreed to discuss political deliberations only on the condition of anonymity, said the situation in Afghanistan is even worse than they had expected, and that any politically palatable number would not be enough to turn the tide, much less create stability and security. Before you can get to the question of how many troops is enough you have to have clarity on what is the goal, said Christine Wormuth, former undersecretary of defense in the Obama administration.  Is the goal to decisively defeat [the Taliban] and make Afghanistan into a viable state (or) is the goal to continue to prop up the government of Afghanistan? Wormuth said.

Alexander Acosta was confirmed on Thursday by the U.S. Senate to head the Labor Department, making him the first Hispanic member of President Donald Trumps cabinet. Acosta, a former member of the National Labor Relations Board and dean of the Florida International University College of Law in Miami, was nominated as labor secretary by Trump in mid-February. The Senate confirmed Acosta by a 60-38 vote. Acosta was expected to have a smooth confirmation process despite objections from some Democrats and workers groups that he is too friendly to business. Acosta has had a decades-long career in the public sector, including multiple Senate vettings for past appointments, making it unlikely any surprises in his background would derail his nomination. Acosta served on the NLRB under former Republican President George W. Bush, who also appointed him to be assistant attorney general in the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division. He was then appointed U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida, where he went after high-profile defendants such as Jack Abramoff and UBS (UBSG.S)(UBS.N), resulting in the Swiss bank paying more than $750 million in fines for a tax-avoidance scheme. Acosta had served as a law clerk to Samuel Alito from 1994 to 1995, when the conservative Supreme Court justice was a judge at the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Acosta told the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions during his confirmation hearing that he had reservations about key Obama-era labor regulations. Acosta supported the recent 60-day delay of the Labor Departments fiduciary rule, originally slated to take effect on April 10, which requires brokers offering retirement investment advice to put their clients interest first. Trump had directed the Labor Department to review the rule to determine whether it is burdensome and out of step with current White House policies. Also during the confirmation hearing, Acosta expressed reservations about another Obama administration rule issued last year that more than doubled the salary ceiling under which employees would be eligible for overtime pay, from $23,660 to $47,476 a year. The rule, which extended overtime pay to more than 4 million salaried workers, was blocked by a federal judge in November. Acosta said he had serious questions as to whether the secretary of labor had the power to enact this in the first place. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The legislation, approved by the House Foreign Affairs Committee last month, is intended to cut off supplies of cash that help fund North Koreas nuclear program, and increase pressure to stop human rights abuses such as the use of slave labor, the bills sponsor, Foreign Affairs Chairman Ed Royce, said. It also calls on President Donald Trumps administration to decide whether North Korea is a state sponsor of terrorism. Amid international concern over the escalation of North Koreas nuclear program, top Trump administration officials held briefings on the issue on Wednesday for the entire U.S. Congress, busing the 100 senators to the White House and meeting with members of the 435-person House at the Capitol complex. As he left the House briefing, Royce said he expected the legislation to move quickly, as part of what he hoped would be a strong international effort to use every method possible to pressure Pyongyang to curb its nuclear ambitions. In particular, it will focus on financial institutions as well as what you might call slave labor. These are cases where the North Koreans send out work crews to do work, and instead of being paid, the money comes back to the North Korean regime, and is spent on their nuclear program, Royce told reporters. The Trump administration said it wanted to push North Korea into dismantling its nuclear and missile programs through tougher international sanctions and diplomatic pressure, and remained open to negotiations to bring that about. Officials also said on Wednesday they wanted to return the country to the U.S. list of terrorism sponsors. A spokesman for Royce declined to comment on when there might be a vote, referring questions to House leadership, whose aides did not immediately respond to a request to confirm the timing.

The new probe compounds the legal problems Flynn faces for taking hundreds of thousands of dollars from the state-run Russia Today (RT) television network and a firm owned by a Turkish businessman after the former Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) director retired as an Army lieutenant general in 2014. Senior lawmakers said this week that Flynn likely broke the law by failing to request and receive permission to accept $45,000 to speak at a 2015 RT gala dinner at which he sat with Russian President Vladimir Putin. If substantiated, such a failure would violate regulations rooted in the Constitution that bar current and retired military officers from accepting emoluments from foreign powers, the letter said.   White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters on Thursday that the inspector generals probe was appropriate. If they think theres wrongdoing, then the departments inspector general should look into that, he said.    Spicer said Flynn did not undergo a security review before he was named Trumps first national security adviser. Why would you rerun a background check on someone who was the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency that had and did maintain a high-level security clearance? he said. However, a former senior White House official familiar with ethics and security clearance issues said that during the administration of former President Barack Obama, the White House Counsels office always conducted its own background investigations of candidates for senior White House jobs, even if they already held security clearances. These reviews included questionnaires and interviews, and would have included issues such as whether the candidate had drug problems, had hired prostitutes, or had personal or financial problems, the former official said.  Flynn is also the subject of congressional probes into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election that U.S. intelligence agencies have said was intended to sway the vote in favor of Trump, the Republican candidate, over his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. Russia denies the allegation. The Defense Department inspector general is investigating whether Flynn failed to obtain required approval prior to receiving any emolument from a foreign government, according to an April 11 letter released by Democrats on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. If substantiated, such a failure would violate military regulations that apply a constitutional provision that bars current and retired officers from accepting emoluments from foreign powers, the letter said. Representative Elijah Cummings, the House committees top Democrat, released other Defense Department documents on Thursday showing that the DIA found no evidence that Flynn requested permission to accept foreign funds, despite a 2014 warning against taking such payments. One document, a redacted version of a letter the DIA sent to the committee on April 7, said the agency had not found any records referring or relating to LTG (Lieutenant General) Flynns receipt of money from a foreign source. Flynns attorney, Robert Kelner, said in a statement that Cummings mischaracterized the DIA letter, saying a partially redacted section confirmed that Flynn gave the Pentagon information and documents on a thumb drive about the RT event. The materials included documents that Flynn used a speakers bureau for the event, said Kelner, adding that the former national security adviser also briefed the Pentagon before and after the Moscow visit. He called on the DIA to release the unredacted letter and details of the briefings. Kelners statement, however, did not address the issue of whether Flynn requested and received permission to accept foreign government payments. Separately, the committees Republican chairman, Representative Jason Chaffetz, asked the acting Army secretary for a final determination about whether Flynn violated the law by accepting foreign payments, according to a letter released by his office on Thursday. In addition to looking into the RT funds, the House committee is scrutinizing Flynns work last year as a foreign agent hired to promote Turkish government views by a Netherlands-based company owned by a Turkish businessman. The company paid Flynns now-defunct firm, Flynn Intel Group, a total of $530,000 beginning in August, when he was the Trump campaigns top foreign policy adviser. Flynn registered as a foreign agent with the Justice Department only in March, weeks after he resigned as Trumps national security adviser following his failure to disclose his contacts with Sergei Kislyak, Russias ambassador to the United States, before Trump took office.

I know that we have members frankly on both sides of the aisle who may be a little conflicted on the issue, said Hensarling. We are still listening carefully to both sides, so well see what happens as we progress through the process. Debit card fee limits, part of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law, are frequently referred to as the Durbin amendment, after the primary sponsor, Senator Dick Durbin, Democrat of Illinois. Proponents say the limits are needed checks on the banking industry, which had forced retailers to pay higher fees. But banks and other critics say the limits are improper government policy and have not lowered costs for consumers. Hensarling, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said he is fundamentally opposed to government price controls on private market operations, and will make the case for scrapping the fee limits. But he acknowledged that members in both parties were divided, and the provision could be stripped when his panel considers amendments to the bill. Alternatively, the provision could be removed from the bill before it is voted on by the full House. The banking panel is expected to consider amendments and vote on Hensarlings bill Tuesday. He said he expects the bill to be considered by the full House shortly thereafter. The House bill is not expected to become law because it will probably not garner enough support in the Senate, where the votes of at least eight Democrats would be needed for it to pass. The Senate is considering a more modest approach to revisiting existing financial rules. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warns failure to curb North Koreas nuclear and missile development could lead to catastrophic consequences while China and Russia rebuke Washington for its threat of force. Trump signs a bill approved by the Republican-led Congress to avert a U.S. government shutdown and give lawmakers another week to work out federal spending through Sept. 30, with tricky issues like defense spending still unresolved. Trump pledges to uphold Americans right to possess guns in a speech that he uses to revisit some 2016 election campaign themes from his vow to build a border wall to dismissing Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren as Pocahontas. Trump tells Reuters he will either renegotiate or terminate what he calls a horrible free trade deal with South Korea and says Seoul should pay for a U.S. anti-missile system he prices at $1 billion. A 5-year-old U.S.-South Korean trade deal could be improved to increase access for American vehicles and deter currency manipulation but changes will not necessarily shrink the U.S. trade deficit with the Asian export powerhouse.

FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, named by Trump in January, disclosed his intent Wednesday to repeal the Obama era rules that reclassified internet service and tightly regulated providers as if they were utilities. The FCC also plans to scrap the 2015 internet conduct standard and an ombudsman position created to hear complaints of net neutrality violations. The plan asks if network disclosure requirements should remain in force for internet providers. Pais plan faces an initial May 18 vote. He wants public comment on whether the FCC should keep its bright line rules, and said his decision on the rules would depend partly on the comments the agency receives. Websites such as Facebook Inc (FB.O), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and others back the rules, saying they guarantee equal access to the internet. Internet service providers such as AT&T Inc (T.N), Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) oppose the Obama order, saying they made it harder to manage internet traffic and discouraged investment in improving access. FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn and Federal Trade Commissioner Terrell McSweeny opposed Pais plan, saying it would allow broadband providers to erect barriers or charge tolls to any application, connected device, or website that the broadband providers customers want to reach. It would allow broadband providers to favor their own content over others, and pick winners and losers on the internet. Pai said the 2015 open internet rules were unnecessary because large internet providers did not block websites before they were imposed. We were not living in some digital dystopia before the partisan imposition of a massive plan hatched in Washington saved all of us, Pai said Wednesday. The FCC proposal seeks comment on whether a codified no-blocking rule is needed to protect such freedoms. The order also asks whether a legal bar on throttling is still necessary, particularly for smaller providers. The proposal also questions the ban on paid prioritization that the proposal argues was adopted to address an apparently nonexistent problem. AT&T said the question is not whether the internet will remain open - it undoubtedly will. The question is how, as a country, we will regulate the internet ecosystem.

Trumps original order, issued on Jan. 25, stated that cities and counties shielding illegal immigrants and refusing to cooperate with immigration officials would lose federal funding except for that deemed necessary for law enforcement purposes.  U.S. Justice Department attorneys defending the order in a San Francisco court presented a far narrower view of its reach, however, arguing before U.S. District Judge William Orrick III earlier this month that the only funds the government intended to withhold were certain grants tied to law enforcement programs. * COMMENTARY: Why Trump should mend ties with Russia reut.rs/2qiISqU * COMMENTARY: Russia investigation teeters, but Trumps strategy of stonewalling does not reut.rs/2oxuHll  That argument did not convince the judge on Tuesday, who noted in issuing a preliminary injunction that the text of the executive order threatened withdrawal of a much wider range of federal funds than the government attorneys asserted in court. [nL1N1HX23B]  Disavowing the plain language of the executive order itself was a potentially dangerous course for the Justice Department, said Edward Waters, a Washington lawyer who specializes in federal grants.  The governments strategy could restrict its ability to cut off funds going forward, some legal experts said, since the Justice Department now has said the order applies to a narrow range of funding.  Trump has promised to broadly defund sanctuary cities, saying they breed crime. The government could appeal the preliminary injunction to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals and the losing side at the appellate level could then appeal to the Supreme Court. One procedural case the federal government could make on appeal involves the timing of the challenge, some legal scholars suggested, but such an argument would have limitations. Since no federal funds actually have been withheld to date, the government could say there has been no harm and therefore the case is not yet ripe for litigation, said Brian Galle, an expert on government finance at Georgetown Law. To have standing to bring a case, San Francisco and Santa Clara County would have to have suffered actual harm, which could be difficult to establish in this case since they have so far lost no federal funding. [nL1N1FL1GW] The two municipalities successfully argued in the district court hearing that they had already been harmed by uncertainty and chaos in theirbudget planning but that might not convince an appellate court.  In the very short run its quite possible that the administration could win a reversal of this ruling on appeal because of these procedural reasons, Galle said. He predicted, however, the administration would be unable to successfully defend itself if it then began withholding funds without Congress authorizing such action.  The Justice Department declined to discuss its appeals strategy.  Tuesdays ruling left leeway for the administration to deny some kinds of funding to sanctuary cities, noting the government can use lawful means to enforce existing conditions of federal grants. A small amount of federal law enforcement money is tied to a statute requiring local jurisdictions to share information with federal immigration officials. Programs making such grants include the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program, Community Oriented Policing Services, and the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program. In San Francisco, such funding is a small fraction of federal monies that go to the city, said City Attorney Dennis Herrera. Tuesdays ruling was the latest legal blow to the Trump administration, which has had two previous executive orders stayed by the courts. In February, a Washington court blocked a Trump order temporarily banning all refugees and travelers from seven mostly Muslim nations. A subsequent order replaced that one, removing Iraq from the ban and creating more exemptions. Parts of that ban were also blocked, this time by judges in Maryland and Hawaii.[nL2N1GS0XF] Those cases are pending appeal. After Tuesdays district court ruling, a spokesman for the Department of Justice said that it will follow the law with respect to regulation of sanctuary jurisdictions.

The bill comes as Republican U.S. President Donald Trump has made combating illegal immigration a priority. Texas, which has an estimated 1.5 million undocumented immigrants and the longest border with Mexico of any U.S. state, has been at the forefront of the immigration debate. Texas Republican leaders have embraced Trumps calls to punish localities they believe are shielding immigrants in the country illegally. Any anti-sanctuary city measure may face a tough road after a federal judge this week blocked Trumps executive order seeking to withhold funds from local authorities that do not use their resources to advance federal immigration laws. On a party line vote after about 16 hours of emotional debate, the Texas House approved the bill that would punish local authorities who do not abide by requests to cooperate with federal immigration authorities. Police who do not cooperate with immigration authorities could be subject to fines and prosecution for a Class A misdemeanor, which can bring up to a year imprisonment.  The bill also allows police to ask people about their immigration status during a lawful detention, even for minor infractions like jay-walking. The bill will have to be reconciled with another bill approved by the Texas Senate. Republican Governor Greg Abbott has said he would sign such a measure into law. This bill has no effect on illegal immigrants if they have not committed a crime or are hanging out with someone who has, bill sponsor Republican Charlie Geren told the House. Under questioning, Geren told lawmakers there are no local authorities in Texas at present that he would consider a sanctuary city. Rene Oliveira, a Democratic representative from the border city of Brownsville, said the bill has sent a chill through immigrant communities worried that even people in the United States legally can be picked up by police for minor infractions and subject to a process aimed at deportation. As the Texas House debated the measure, Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo, who runs one of the nations largest police forces, criticized the bill.

Since inauguration day on Jan. 20, top executives from at least 186 companies have visited with Trump or senior advisers at the White House or on presidential trips, including those to Mar-a-Lago, the private, seaside Florida club where he spends many weekends. Some of the meetings have been reported in the press. But Reuters analyzed more than 900 White House press pool reports to give the first big picture view, albeit an incomplete one, of who has had the most and least success at bending the presidents ear. Such access can be crucial for companies, with Trump regularly passing judgment and making proposals on business issues such as trade, taxes, immigration and regulation. The review showed Trump listening closely to some segments of Corporate America, though perhaps neglecting the dynamic technology and entertainment sectors, both powerful U.S. export industries. Tim Cook, CEO of Apple Inc (AAPL.O), and other tech leaders met with Trump before his inauguration. Access sometimes means influence, but it was likely too soon to tell, after less than 100 days, whether Trumps actions have disproportionately favored big manufacturers and Wall Street. Industrial power-houses have led the way on access, including companies with the clout to make significant hiring decisions: Ford Motor Co (F.N) CEO Mark Fields has met with Trump at least four times; General Motors (GM.N) CEO Mary Barra, at least four times; and Boeing (BA.N) representatives, at least three times. The Reuters review helps fill a blank in the Trump record that opened in mid-April when he put the White House visitor logs off-limits to the public. They had been mostly public under Obama.  Transparency advocates have warned that Trumps decision will make it harder to hold him accountable. A public record of who has the presidents ear is more important than it has ever been, said John Wonderlich, executive director of the Sunlight Foundation, a nonprofit good-government advocacy group. The review showed about half of the companies that have made it into the Trump inner circle through April 21, day 92 of his presidency, were manufacturers or financial firms - asset managers, insurers and banks ranging from Wall Street giants such as Citigroup (C.N) to small community banks. Financier Stephen Schwarzman, who chairs a presidential advisory forum of business leaders, is CEO of the Blackstone Group (BX.N), the largest manager of private equity and real estate assets. He was spotted by the press pool aboard Air Force 1 on Feb. 3 when the president was traveling to Mar-a-Lago. Schwarzman also attended at least three meetings with Trump and other executives. Almost all of Trumps meetings were group encounters with 10 or more executives sitting down with the president and White House officials in events billed as listening sessions, roundtable discussions or town halls.  A few were more intimate encounters, such as on March 18, when Ike Perlmutter, CEO of Marvel Entertainment, a Walt Disney Corp. (DIS.N) subsidiary, met with the president in Mar-a-Lago before having dinner with the president, first lady Melania Trump and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. Perlmutter, however, was one of few executives from media companies seen by pool reporters in meetings with Trump. Information technology firms, which enjoyed significant access to former President Barack Obama, have had less access to Trump than legacy manufacturers such as auto and steel makers. IBM (IBM.N) CEO Ginni Rometty attended three meetings with Trump, but was one of only a few CEOs from big tech firms seen at the White House. Manufacturers and financiers also enjoyed access to the White House under Obama, according to a Reuters review in December 2015 of White House visitor logs.   The recent Reuters review is not comprehensive since the press pool, though dogged and alert, may have missed some of Trumps meetings with business leaders.  The pool is a rotation of journalists from several outlets, including Reuters, who follow Trump and get briefings from White House officials on some, but not all of his meetings.

Trump, who says NAFTA has been a disaster for American workers, has threatened several times to walk away from the three-nation pact unless major changes are made. Mexico is the third member. He (said on the call) he was very much thinking about canceling and I highlighted quite frankly ... that a disruption like canceling NAFTA, even if it theoretically eventually might lead to better outcomes, would cause a lot of short and medium-term pain, said Trudeau. Thats not something that either one of us would want so we agreed that we could sit down and get to work on looking at ways to improve NAFTA, Trudeau told a televised news conference in Gray, Saskatchewan. Any move to break up NAFTA would cause great economic damage to Canada, which sends 75 percent of all its exports to the United States. Trumps administration has yet to formally advise the U.S. Congress of its intention to open negotiations. A Canadian source familiar with the matter said Trudeau had added in his comments to Trump that pulling out of NAFTA would be counter-productive. Canadian officials have so far taken a largely restrained attitude to Trumps harsh language on NAFTA, describing it as a negotiating tactic ahead of the talks. That said, government ministers have made clear Canada could slap sanctions on the United States if it decided to impose protectionist measures such as a border tariff. Trudeau, asked about possible trade retaliation, said Canada preferred to work with the United States constructively but added: Theres no question theres a broad range of options and paths available to us that were looking at.

The group introduced an authorization, known as an AUMF, that would last three years and replace authorizations passed in 2001 and 2002 that have been used by both Republican and Democratic presidents for military action against the groups. Some members of Congress have contended for years that those measures, approved in 2001 to retaliate against al Qaeda for the Sept. 11 attacks and in 2002 to pave the way for the Iraq War, were outmoded. Those arguments intensified when President Donald Trump ordered air strikes against an airfield in Syria this month, although Republicans, who control Congress, and many Democrats said they did not feel that a single action like that required formal approval by Congress. But a small, mostly Democratic, group of lawmakers has argued for years that Congress should stop abdicating its responsibility to consider an AUMF that would govern U.S. military action, whether against Islamist militant groups or the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. As deployments to Iraq and Syria increase, and with complicating factors like the recent cruise missile strike against the Assad regime in response to the use of chemical weapons, Congress cannot stand on the sidelines any longer and must debate and vote on any new war, said Representative Adam Schiff, who introduced the bill with nine co-sponsors. The measure would authorize Trump to deploy combat ground troops against the three groups anywhere in the world, but also includes a mechanism to allow a motion to repeal or modify the authorization. It also would put in place new requirements for administration reports to Congress and the public on how force was being used.

While the proposed tax cuts would please those helped by them, such as multinational corporations and wealthy taxpayers, Trumps package fell far short of the kind of comprehensive tax reform that both parties in Washington have sought for years. As his milestone 100th day in office on Saturday nears, Trump has been scrambling to show progress on his agenda. The tax plan, though meager in detail, matched up closely with the promises he made during his victorious 2016 election campaign. Investors, who had been awaiting tax-plan details for months, largely shrugged off the news, with many saying it was still short on specifics and faced a long road to enactment. Wake me up when something actually gets signed into law,  said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com in West Palm Beach, Florida. Only Congress can make major tax law changes, and Democrats immediately attacked the Republican presidents plan as fiscally irresponsible. President Trumps tax plan is short on details and long on giveaways to big corporations and billionaires, said Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in the House of Representatives. House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the top Republicans on the congressional tax-writing committees welcomed the Trump proposals, while leaving space for details to change as legislation evolves. The principles outlined by the Trump administration today will serve as critical guideposts as Congress and the administration work on tax changes, they said in a statement. U.S. stocks pared gains on Wednesday after the plan was unveiled. While Wall Street has been optimistic about the prospect of corporate tax cuts since Trumps election in November, the stocks rally has stalled lately because of a lack of clarity about Trumps policies and concern over his failure to push through a healthcare bill.  The benchmark Dow Jones industrial average of blue-chip stocks .DJI on Wednesday closed down one-tenth of 1 percent. Some analysts said investors were aware of the long road ahead before any tax bill is passed. We have a pretty good idea that he (Trump) is targeting lower corporate taxes, lower individual taxes and a simplification of the process, but all that is in an ideal world, said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital in Bernardsville, New Jersey. In the plan, unveiled at the White House by Trump economic adviser Gary Cohn and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Trump proposed cutting to 15 percent both the income tax rate paid by public corporations and that paid by pass-through businesses, including partnerships, S corporations and sole proprietorships. The top corporate rate is now 35 percent, though few multinational companies pay it, thanks to loopholes that allow them to lower their effective tax rates. Despite this, corporations have pushed for a tax rate cut for many years, and Trump has obliged.  The top rate for pass-throughs, which account for most small businesses, is 39.6 percent, the same top rate paid by individuals. Unlike corporations, the profits of pass-through businesses flow directly onto their owners tax returns. In another concession to long-standing demands from corporate America, Trump called for bringing corporate profits being held offshore by multinationals into the country at a rate well below the current 35 percent rate now owed on repatriated earnings. He did not say what that rate would be, but said the administration was working with Congress on a low rate. About $2.6 trillion in profits are being held tax-exempt abroad by U.S. multinationals under a rule that says they are only taxable if brought into the United States. If enacted, the repatriation tax holiday would produce a one-time surge in government revenue. If it were dedicated to infrastructure spending, it could attract votes from Democrats. The plan also urged adoption of a territorial corporate tax system that would largely exempt foreign profits of U.S.-based corporations from federal taxation. Ryan expressed optimism about Trumps plan, even though it excluded a border adjustment tax on imports he has promoted. That idea was part of initiatives floated by House Republicans as a way to offset revenue losses resulting from steep tax cuts. For average U.S. taxpayers, Trump proposed help by doubling the standard deductions for individuals who do not itemize; simplifying tax returns by reducing the number of tax brackets to three from seven; and providing unspecified tax relief for families with child and dependent care expenses. He also called for repealing inheritance taxes on estates and the alternative minimum tax, both measures that would help a handful of wealthy taxpayers. Trumps laundry list of tax cuts would reduce revenues for the U.S. government, which is already running a deficit and deeply in debt. He offered few proposals to offset those losses. Democrats and fiscal-hawk Republicans will be concerned about how much Trumps proposals would expand the deficit. To minimize that, Republicans will rely heavily on dynamic scoring, an economic modeling method that attempts to predict economic growth and new tax revenues resulting from tax cuts. Mnuchin said the revenue losses would also be offset by killing many tax loopholes. He said at a briefing that Trumps plan would kill most tax deductions, except those for charitable giving, retirement savings and mortgage interest. Cohn said at the briefing that one deduction on Trumps chopping block is for state and local tax payments, which is estimated to cost the U.S. Treasury $96 billion this year. Ending it would raise about that much in revenue. Such a move would hurt high-tax states, which tend to vote Democratic, such as New York and California, where the state and local tax deduction is a major item, said some tax analysts. Like all of Trumps proposals, this one would face intense scrutiny in Congress.   The No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, Dick Durbin, attacked the tax proposal and the fact Trump, a wealthy New York real estate developer, had declined to make public his personal tax returns. President Trump should release his own tax returns if he wants to have any credibility in a debate about Americas tax code, Durbin said. Mnuchin said on Wednesday that Trump did not intend to release his tax returns. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Now, his dramatic tax cut plans give them even more reasons to cheer. Trump, looking to make good on pledges for sweeping tax reform, on Wednesday unveiled plans for a cut in the tax rate to 15 percent for so-called pass-through businesses. While the proposal is being billed as a boon for small businesses from pizzerias to investment management firms, one clear winner looks to be the hedge fund set, where owners can earn hundreds of millions in income a year, tax experts, managers, and their lawyers said on Wednesday. For hedge funds, this is an unmitigated benefit as their tax liabilities could drop significantly, said Robert Willens, an independent tax consultant. Obviously, they are quite enthusiastic and there may be a few fist bumps along the way. A manager whose hedge fund earns $50 million a year, for example, would be paying some $19.8 million in taxes, or 39.6 percent, under the current rules. That could drop to as little as $7.5 million if the rate were cut to 15 percent. To be sure, Trumps plan has a long, hard road to becoming reality, but that didnt stop fund managers from blitzing their tax lawyers with calls about how to play it. Most attorneys advised patience, saying they would need to wait at least until early June, when a bill with more specific language might be hammered out. If the goal is to get people talking, then it is working, said Jeffrey Parker, a partner at law firm EisnerAmper. A proposal is just a proposal. The final version often differs significantly from the final draft. Aside from the pass-through proposal, an open question is what kind of treatment will be given to so-called carried interest. That allows managers to pay a tax rate as low as 20 percent, a loophole that Trump has railed against in the past. Similarly, there is no clarity on whether businesses would be required to pay reasonable compensation to their managers, income that could be taxed at a higher rate, experts said. Including that could help Trump appeal to his base and mollify critics who say the plan is a giveaway for millionaires. Who needs to worry about carried-interest going away if you have a 15 percent pass-through tax rate, said hedge fund manager Jim Chanos, who runs Kynikos Associates. This should really be called the Put Rich Guys Back on Top Tax Act of 2017. Tax reform has been a signature goal for Trump since the campaign and his closest aides, including former Goldman Sachs (GS.N) president Gary Cohn who now directs the National Economic Council, are pushing to get it done this year. But in the wake of other stalled initiatives, plenty on Wall Street expect the plan to hit some roadblocks.  So the first draft - prepared quickly just like his failed travel ban and healthcare proposal before the 100 days runs out - will be push-backed and maybe dramatically changed by the Democrats and members of his own party, said Douglas Kass, who runs hedge fund Seabreeze Partners Management.

On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Trumps plan would pay for itself with growth and closing of some deductions and credits.  From the details released so far, Maya MacGuineas, who heads the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), said the plan could add $3 trillion to more than $5 trillion to the federal deficit over five years. No credible dynamic score is going to show that this bill is paid for, MacGuineas said. The growth effects, which are real and important, add decimals of percentage points to growth, not full percentage points. Her budget watchdog group estimates that to pay for the plan, U.S. growth would need to be sustained at 4.5 percent annually, a level not seen on a sustained basis since the late 1960s and early 1970s. Mnuchin has said that he expects the plan to boost sustained U.S. growth above 3 percent, but CRFB estimates that even this level would require massive increases in productivity and that a rapidly retiring baby-boom generation is working against high growth rates. Doug Elmendorf, former director of the Congressional Budget Office, one of the agencies that provides cost estimates for legislation, said he sees little chance of Congress finding politically acceptable offsets to pay for the plan, and the rise in borrowing could work against Trumps goals. The resulting increase of the deficit will have a dampening effect on the economic activity that will offset at least part of the stimulative effects of lower tax rates, said Elemendorf, now dean of Harvard Universitys John F. Kennedy School of Government. The higher federal debt load will crowd out capital for private use, dampening economic activity in the long run, Elmendorf said. Republicans in Congress are hoping to use budget procedural rules that allow a 51-vote threshold in the Senate to pass tax reform, which would limit the cuts to 10 years.  But if the plan creates deficits in the years beyond the first decade, it could also run afoul of another procedural rule that could require 60 votes in the Senate.    Tax cuts that expire in a decade could cause another U.S. fiscal crisis like the one in 2012, when tax cuts passed under George W. Bush expired. What the Trump Administration has proposed is not permanent tax reform, but a ten-year tax cut and the creation of the most phenomenal fiscal cliff ever in 2028, Chris Krueger, a political analyst at Cowen and Co in Washington, said in a note to clients.

Tuesdays ruling by U.S. District Judge William Orrick in San Francisco was the latest blow to Trumps efforts to toughen immigration enforcement. Federal courts have also blocked his two travel bans on citizens of mostly Muslim nations.  First the Ninth Circuit rules against the ban & now it hits again on sanctuary cities-both ridiculous rulings. See you in the Supreme Court! Trump said in a tweet on Wednesday, referring to the San Francisco-based federal appeals court and its judicial district. The Trump administration has targeted sanctuary cities, which generally offer safe harbor to illegal immigrants and often do not use municipal funds or resources to advance the enforcement of federal immigration laws.  Later on Wednesday, Trump, asked in an interview with the  Washington Examiner if he had considered proposals to break up the 9th Circuit Court, said: Absolutely, I have. There are many people that want to break up the 9th Circuit. Its outrageous, he told the newspaper. The latest ruling did not come from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to which Trump was referring. It came from the federal district court in San Francisco.   Critics have said local authorities endanger public safety when they decline to hand over for deportation illegal immigrants arrested for crimes, while supporters argue that enlisting police cooperation to round up immigrants for removal undermines trust in local police, particularly among Latinos. Dozens of local governments and cities, including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, have joined the sanctuary movement. In his ruling, Orrick said Trumps Jan. 25 order targeted broad categories of federal funding for the sanctuary cities and that plaintiffs challenging it were likely to succeed in proving it unconstitutional. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions blasted Orricks ruling, saying Trumps executive order was squarely within the powers of the President. The Department of Justice cannot accept such a result, and as the President has made clear, we will continue to litigate this case to vindicate the rule of law, Sessions said in a statement. An appeal is likely to be heard by the 9th Circuit before it goes to the Supreme Court. Republicans view the appeals court as biased toward liberals, and Trump was quick to attack its reputation in his tweets. It has a terrible record of being overturned (close to 80%). They used to call this judge shopping! Messy system, Trump said.  The appeals court raised Trumps ire earlier this year when it upheld a Seattle judges decision to block the Republican presidents first travel ban on citizens of seven predominantly Muslim nations. In May, the 9th Circuit will hear an appeal of a Hawaii judges order blocking Trumps revised travel ban, which placed restrictions on citizens from six mostly Muslim countries. A Maryland judge also blocked portions of the second ban. Trump has issued sweeping condemnations of courts and judges when they have ruled against him or his administration. In February, he called the federal judge in Seattle who ruled against his first travel ban a so-called judge. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump accused an Indiana-born judge overseeing lawsuits against the defunct Trump University of bias based on his Mexican ancestry.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration said on Wednesday it aimed to push North Korea into dismantling its nuclear and missile programs through tougher international sanctions and diplomatic pressure, and remained open to negotiations to bring that about. The U.S. stance, which appeared to signal a willingness to exhaust non-military avenues despite repeated warnings that all options are on the table, came in a statement following an unusual White House-hosted briefing for the entire U.S. Senate followed by a briefing to the House of Representatives. Graphic - Carl Vinson strike group: tmsnrt.rs/2pqOMWA Graphic - North Korea's nuclear program: tmsnrt.rs/2n0gd92 The statement from Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats described North Korea as an urgent national security threat and top foreign policy priority. North Koreas growing nuclear and missile threat is perhaps the most serious security challenge confronting President Donald Trump, who has vowed to prevent North Korea from being able to hit the United States with a nuclear missile - a capability experts say Pyongyang could have some time after 2020. The Presidentsapproachaimsto pressure North Korea into dismantling its nuclear,ballistic missile, and proliferation programs by tightening economic sanctionsand pursuing diplomatic measureswith ourallies andregionalpartners, the statement said. The United States seeks stability andthe peaceful denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.We remain open to negotiations towards thatgoal.However, we remainpreparedto defend ourselves and ourallies. U.S. lawmakers have been seeking a clear White House strategy following repeated North Korean missile tests and fears it could conduct a sixth nuclear bomb test. But some lawmakers on both sides went away dissatisfied.  While the administration has said military strikes remain an option, officials have stressed tougher sanctions as the key strategy given the risks of massive North Korean retaliation - essentially representing a continuation of the policy of former President Barack Obamas administration, which failed to slow Pyongyangs weapons programs. Democratic Senator Christopher Coons told reporters after the White House briefing that military options were discussed. It was a sobering briefing in which it was clear just how much thought and planning was going into preparing military options, if called for, and a diplomatic strategy that strikes me as clear-eyed and well proportioned, Coons said. Tillerson will chair a ministerial meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Friday that is expected to discuss tougher sanctions, which U.S. officials say could include an oil embargo, banning North Koreas airline, intercepting cargo ships and punishing Chinese and other foreign banks doing business with Pyongyang. U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said another means of diplomatic pressure would be for nations to close North Korean missions and to ostracize North Korea in international organizations. China objects to North Koreas weapons development and has called for a return to international negotiations, but U.S. officials have said Washington sees no value in talks until Pyongyang shows it is serious about denuclearization. Earlier on Wednesday, North Koreas Foreign Ministry called U.S. attempts to make Pyongyang give up its nuclear weapons through military threats and sanctions a wild dream and like sweeping the sea with a broom. The administration is hoping for greater Chinese cooperation after a summit between President Xi Jinping and Trump last month, and a senior White House official said Beijing now appeared to acknowledge North Korea as a threat to China too. You have seen some early indications of China doing a better job enforcing existing U.N. sanctions on North Korea, the official said, adding there had also been a clear effort to communicate to North Korea in the Chinese press that its nuclear tests, missile tests, the existence of these programs cant be tolerated. China has been angered, however, by U.S. deployment of  the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, missile defense system in South Korea, complaining that its radar can see deep into China and undermines its security. The top U.S. commander in the Pacific, Admiral Harry Harris, told Congress on Wednesday the system would be operational in coming days and suggested Beijing should focus on influencing North Korea rather than worrying about a purely defensive system. The front-runner in South Koreas May 9 presidential election has called for a delay in THAAD deployment, saying the new Seoul administration should make a decision after gathering public opinion and more talks with Washington. Harris said he believed Pyongyangs threats needed to be taken seriously and that the United States may also need to strengthen missile defenses in Hawaii. He said these were sufficient for now but could one day be overwhelmed, and suggested studying stationing new radar there as well as interceptors to knock out any incoming North Korean missiles. I dont share your confidence that North Korea is not going to attack either South Korea, or Japan, or the United States ... once they have the capability, Harris told one lawmaker. U.S. officials have warned that a conflict with North Korea could have a devastating effect on ally South Korea and U.S. troops based there, a point Pyongyang underscored by a big live-fire exercise on Tuesday to mark the foundation of its military.Harris conceded that North Korean retaliation to any U.S. strikes could cause many casualties, but added that there was the risk of a lot more Koreans and Japanese and Americans dying if North Korea achieves its nuclear aims and does what (North Korean leader Kim Jong Un) has said its going to do. North Korea has vowed to strike the United States and its Asian allies at the first sign of any attack on its territory. In a show of force, the United States is sending the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier group to waters off the Korean peninsula, where it will join the USS Michigan, a nuclear submarine that docked in South Korea on Tuesday. South Koreas navy has said it will hold drills with the U.S. strike group. Harris said the carrier was in the Philippine Sea, within two hours striking distance of North Korea if need be.

The Pentagon, which confirmed the move on Wednesday, said no change has yet been made to U.S. troop limits. It also stressed the U.S. strategy in Iraq and Syria still was focused on backing local forces to fight Islamic State - a tactic that has averted the need for a major U.S. ground force. But the shift on troop limits was another sign of the greater authority Trump appears comfortable giving his military commanders to make battlefield decisions and could allow for more rapid increases in troop levels in the future. The Force Management Level system was introduced in Iraq and Syria during Barack Obamas administration as a way to exert control over the military. Obama periodically raised FML limits to allow more troops in Iraq and Syria as the campaign against Islamic State advanced. But the numbers did not reflect the extent of the U.S. commitment on the ground since commanders found often less-than-ideal ways to work around the limits - sometimes bringing in forces temporarily or hiring more contractors. The force management levels, which are officially at 5,262 in Iraq and 503 in Syria, are believed to be more than a couple of thousands troops shy of the actual number of U.S. forces in both countries. Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White said Trump delegated authority to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to determine force management levels for Iraq and Syria going forward. We want our reporting to Congress and to the public to be more easily and clearly understood, White said in a statement, which was reported earlier on Wednesday by BuzzFeed News. We will conduct a review to ensure that the numbers we provide to Congress and to the public accurately reflect the facts on the ground. This is about transparency. Proponents within the U.S. military of changing the system also argue that bringing that decision-making authority to the Pentagon from the White House will allow more flexibility in responding to unforeseen developments on the battlefield. Replacing the force management level system with something more transparent could be a tricky task, not least because of political sensitivities about U.S. forces in Iraq. Influential Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr already has called on Iraqs government to order the withdrawal of U.S. and allied forces after the battle to retake the city of Mosul from Islamic State is complete. The Iraqi and U.S. governments, however, have signaled the need for a continued U.S. military presence. How large that would be has yet to be determined. Too much information about the comings and goings of U.S. troops, particularly if announced in advance, could give information to enemy, experts say.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts took issue on Wednesday with the Trump administrations stance in an immigration case, saying it could make it too easy for the government to strip people of citizenship for lying about minor infractions. Roberts and other Supreme Court justices indicated support for a deported ethnic Serb immigrant named Divna Maslenjak over her bid to regain her U.S. citizenship after it was stripped because she falsely stated her husband had not served in the Bosnian Serb army in the 1990s after Yugoslavias collapse. Roberts seemed particularly concerned that the government was asserting it could revoke citizenship through criminal prosecution for trivial lies or omissions. He noted that in the past he has exceeded the speed limit while driving. If immigrants failed to disclose that on a citizenship application form asking them to list any instances of breaking the law, they could later lose their citizenship, the conservative chief justice said. Now you say that if I answer that question no, 20 years after I was naturalized as a citizen, you can knock on my door and say, Guess what, youre not an American citizen after all? Roberts asked Justice Department lawyer Robert Parker. Roberts described the administrations interpretation as inviting prosecutorial abuse because the government could likely find a reason for stripping citizenship from most naturalized citizens. That to me is troublesome to give that extraordinary power, which, essentially, is unlimited power, at least in most cases, to the government, Roberts added. President Donald Trump has sought to restrict immigration and deport people who have entered the United States illegally. Maslenjak entered the United States with her husband and two children in 2000, granted refugee status over a claimed fear of ethnic persecution in Bosnia at the hands of Muslims. They settled in Ohio. She became a U.S. citizen in 2007. At issue is her concealment of her husband Ratkos service in a Bosnian Serb Army brigade that participated in the notorious 1995 massacre of 8,000 Muslims in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica. Maslenjaks citizenship was revoked. She and her husband were deported to Serbia last October. Liberal Justice Stephen Breyer shared Roberts concern, noting he had once walked into a government building with a pocketknife on his key chain in violation of the law. Its, to me, rather surprising that the government of the United States thinks that Congress is interpreting this statute and wanted it interpreted in a way that would throw into doubt the citizenship of vast percentages of all naturalized citizens, Breyer said. Conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy also rebuked Parker, saying, It seems to me that your argument is demeaning the priceless value of citizenship. There are around 20 million naturalized U.S. citizens, according to the Migration Policy Institute. The legal question is whether Maslenjaks false statements had a material effect on the U.S. decision to grant her refugee status. The government argued it only matters that she made a false statement, not whether it had any impact on its decision to grant refugee status. At a 2009 hearing to help her husband avoid deportation after he was convicted of making a false statement by concealing his military service, she admitted that when she had applied to be a refugee she had not revealed that from 1992 to 1997 the family lived in Bosnia and her husband served in the military. She was later convicted of lying on her citizenship application. This was the last oral argument of the courts current term. A ruling is due by the end of June.

The briefings came as Trump tries to put the best face on his first 100 days in office. He has signed executive orders to roll back Democratic policies but the period has been defined by an absence of any major legislative achievements. A few Democrats dismissed the Senate White House field trip as little more than a photo opportunity.  Some Republicans were a little more enthusiastic. It was an OK briefing, Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters as he arrived back at the Senate. Im not certain I would have had the briefing today, he said. Asked if the administration had a firm strategy, Senator John McCain, who chairs the Armed Services Committee, said, Theyre developing one. This week, Trump has discussed North Korea with U.N. ambassadors, increased the U.S. military presence in the region, and leaned on China to pressure Pyongyang. Tillerson will chair a U.N. Security Council meeting on Friday to discuss tougher sanctions. After their briefing, members of the House expressed confidence in the administration officials who spoke, but some said they had real concerns. Representative Brad Sherman, a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said he was not convinced that the administration would do enough to control Pyongyang. I regard that level of resolve as very modest, weak and maybe even phony. The only way to put enough pressure on North Korea is to get China to do it, Sherman told reporters. Mac Thornberry, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said the administration wants to use a variety of tactics to push North Korea to give up its nuclear ambitions and said he agreed that all options must be on the table.

Republicans have said they deem lightening federal regulation, which they consider costly and burdensome, as much a priority as overhauling healthcare and rewriting the tax code.  For most of President Donald Trumps first 100 days, the Republican-led Congress attacked regulation by passing resolutions to wipe some of former Democratic President Barack Obamas rules off the books under the Congressional Review Act. Trump also ordered agencies to scrap two existing rules every time they enact a new one. Just before Trumps January inauguration, the House of Representatives passed the Regulatory Accountability Act, combining a half dozen bills to radically change government regulation. On Wednesday, Senator Rob Portman, a Ohio Republican, and Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a North Dakota Democrat, introduced a version of the act for that chamber. If it passes, the bill will be combined with the House version for Trump to sign into law. The bill would bring our outdated federal regulatory process into the 21st Century by requiring agencies to use the best scientific and economic data available, strengthening checks and balances, and giving the public a voice in the process, Portman said in a statement. It requires stricter cost-benefit analysis, use of the best available science to craft rules, and reviews of regulations, according to a summary. The bill diverges from the House version on what is known as the Chevron Deference, based on a Supreme Court ruling that courts should defer to agencies interpretations of statutes governing their rulemaking. The House legislation eliminates the Chevron Deference, while the Senate one creates a judicial review process where courts can decide if agencies comply with the law and then remand non-compliant rules to agencies. Courts would also review factual determinations used in drafting rules costing more than $1 billion annually. Environmental and labor groups said the Senate bill could block needed new regulations and weaken existing ones.  This bill would tilt the scales in favor of polluters at the publics expense, said Scott Slesinger, legislative director of the Natural Resources Defense Council.

The group last month helped sink an effort to pass a Republican healthcare overhaul, called the American Health Care Act. But it remained unclear whether the amended bill could win enough support from moderate Republicans to get the 216 votes needed to pass the U.S. House of Representatives given unanimous Democratic opposition. While the revised version still does not fully repeal Obamacare, we are prepared to support it to keep our promise to the American people to lower healthcare costs, the House Freedom Caucus said in a statement posted on the website of its chairman, Republican Representative Mark Meadows. Republicans in Congress have made repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, a central campaign promise for seven years. Republican President Donald Trump also made it a top campaign promise.  The Republican healthcare bill would replace Obamacares income-based tax credit with a flat age-based credit, roll back an expansion of the Medicaid government health insurance program for the poor and repeal most Obamacare taxes. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated 24 million fewer people would have insurance under the bill.   In its statement, the House Freedom Caucus said it welcomed an amendment that would let states seek waivers from some Obamacare requirements, including the highly popular provision mandating that insurers charge those with pre-existing conditions the same as healthy consumers and that insurers cover so-called essential health benefits, such as maternity care.  The amendment was hammered out between Meadows and Representative Tom MacArthur, a leader of the so-called Tuesday Group of Republican moderates in the House.  Yet several moderates said on Wednesday they had not yet made a decision on whether to support the bill while others remained opposed. Some complained that they had not been part of discussions drafting the amendment, saying they had only seen it after it was released. It doesnt address any of the concerns Ive been raising for weeks, said Republican Representative Charlie Dent, including how to reform Medicaid.  Republican Representative Chris Collins, another member of the Tuesday Group, said pressure to follow through on Republicans top campaign promise for the past seven years had shifted from the partys conservative wing to the moderates. We need to get this passed to fulfill our campaign promise, and this is the compromise that looks like it will make it happen, he said. Republican leaders have not scheduled a vote on the bill.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""NEW YORK/HOUSTON (Reuters) - The Trump administrations proposal to slash tax rates on so-called pass-through businesses would deliver a windfall to investors in master limited partnerships and could offer a much-needed lift to this niche segment of the energy market. The tax plan outline released on Wednesday by U.S. President Donald Trump would sharply slash business taxes and discount the rate on overseas corporate profits brought back into the United States. The proposed changes include a cut to the top tax rate on pass-through businesses to 15 percent from the current rate of up to 36.9 percent. Pass-throughs get that name because taxes are not paid by the business itself but pass through to their owners individual taxes, at that rate. The change would largely benefit owners of private businesses, but U.S. stock market investors holding shares of master limited partnerships, or MLPs, would receive the same treatment. MLPs build the pipelines and storage tanks and are a common corporate structure in the oil and gas infrastructure sector.  If the average rate (for MLP investors) is in the 30s, reducing it to 15 percent would be tremendously attractive, Robert Willens, president of tax and accounting advisory firm Robert Willens LLC, said on Wednesday.  He said if the cuts come through they would make MLPs the most attractive investment from a tax point of view. Mike Bresson, a tax partner with the law firm Baker Botts in Houston said Trumps proposed change would enhance an already-superior tax structure enjoyed by MLPs. Theyre talking about giving MLPs the same 15 percent tax rate that corporations get, so that would actually expand the benefits of MLPs over corporations, Bresson said.  The devil is in the details and we havent seen them. MLPs have broadly underperformed the wider stock market over the past several years, largely due to the weakness in oil prices. The energy sector was pummeled as crude prices tumbled from above $100 per barrel in mid 2014 to below $30 early last year. They only recently stabilized at around $50 for U.S. oil. There has been a gradual improvement in MLPs now that energy prices have stabilized. Its still a decent place to invest even without the tax cut, said Bryant Evans, portfolio manager at Cozad Asset Management in Champaign, Illinois. There should be an almost immediate bounce (in price) once the proposal is solid. It should create more demand for MLP stock in general. But beyond an immediate bounce, it all goes back to how their businesses are doing. Even with their above-average dividend yields, MLPs have lagged the S&P 500s total return in the last year by around 240 basis points.  MLP stocks - more specifically, units - are up as a group so far this year, with the Alerian MLP ETF up 1 percent, though they have fallen 2.1 percent since Trump took office - even as his administration has been more friendly to sector projects like the Keystone XL Pipeline and the Dakota Access Pipeline. The ETF rose 0.8 percent Tuesday as details of the tax proposal were reported first by the Wall Street Journal. It was the largest gain for the fund in six weeks. Among the best performers in the sector this year are Shell Midstream Partners and Tallgrass Energy Partners, both up by more than 11 percent in 2017, while Plains All American Pipeline and Genesis Energy are down 5 percent and 9 percent year to date, respectively.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress inched toward a deal to fund the government through September but was preparing to possibly extend a midnight Friday deadline in order to wrap up negotiations and avoid an imminent government shutdown. The one-week extension would give leading Republicans and Democrats a little breathing room to finish negotiations and present their plan for spending around $1 trillion through the rest of the fiscal year to rank-and-file lawmakers, according to a House of Representatives source familiar with the talks. Negotiators were racing against the clock to clear away remaining disputes in the massive spending bill. The arduous talks have produced at least two major victories for Democrats so far, even though they are the minority party in Congress. President Donald Trump gave in to Democratic demands that the spending bill not include money to start building the wall he wants to erect on the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump has said the big, beautiful, powerful wall is needed to block illegal immigrants and drugs from coming into the country. Mexico has adamantly rejected Trumps assertion that it would pay for the wall. Democrats have also gotten the administration to agree to continue funding, at least for now, for a major component of the Affordable Care Act, even though Trump campaigned on a vow to end the program, commonly known as Obamacare. Administration officials had threatened in recent days to pull the plug on subsidies for low-income people enrolled in the 2010 healthcare law, former Democratic President Barack Obamas signature domestic achievement. While we agreed to go ahead and make the ... payments for now, we havent made a final decision about future commitments, a White House official said. Anthem Inc, one of the largest insurers on the Obamacare exchanges, said on Wednesday that without the government payments, premiums would increase 20 percent next year and that it might have to withdraw from some regions and states. Both concessions robbed Trump from claiming some major legislative successes he had hoped to achieve in his first 100 days in office, which will be marked on Saturday. If Congress cannot agree to either a short stopgap funding bill or a longer-term one by midnight Friday, federal agencies will run out of money and likely have to abruptly lay off hundreds of thousands of federal government workers until an appropriations bill is enacted. Many policymakers are nervous about a repeat of 2013, when the government was shuttered for 17 days. It was unclear whether Republicans might prevail on their demand for a significant increase in defense spending without similar increases to other domestic programs. Trump has proposed a $30 billion spending boost for the Pentagon for the rest of this fiscal year. Our major concerns in these negotiations have been about funding for the wall and uncertainty about ... payments crucial to the stability of the marketplaces under the Affordable Care Act. Weve now made progress on both of these fronts, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement. She added that other disagreements must be ironed out. Were getting really close, House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, told reporters earlier on Wednesday, adding that negotiators were getting down to the last, final areas of disagreement. Trumps push for a border wall, a signature campaign proposal, is seen by most Democrats and many Republicans as an ineffective way of securing U.S. borders. The Trump administration likely will seek money for the wall in legislation funding the government for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1, but lawmakers are likely to balk again. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from the coal-mining state of Kentucky, threw his weight behind a plan Democrats were insisting on to make a healthcare program for coal miners permanent. It was unclear if Ryan would go along. Even though Trumps fellow Republicans control both chambers of Congress, they only have 52 seats in the Senate. To amass the 60 votes needed there to pass a spending bill, Republicans will have to win the support of at least some Democratic lawmakers. Democrats have been seeking immediate assistance for a funding gap in Puerto Ricos Medicaid program, the federal health insurance program for the poor, saying it is in such bad shape that 1 million people are set to lose healthcare. Also unclear is what riders that set new policy might be tucked into the legislation. Past riders have touched on areas such as banning the Securities and Exchange Commission from requiring corporations to disclose political donations. Democrats said they were worried Republicans could try to attach language limiting family-planning funds or undo Wall Street reforms enacted after the 2007-09 financial crisis.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to allow national monument designations to be rescinded or reduce the size of sites as the administration pushes to open up more federal land to drilling, mining and other development. Trumps order is part of an effort to reverse many of the  environmental protections implemented by his predecessor, Democratic President Barack Obama that Trump said were hobbling economic growth. Trumps agenda is being cheered by industry but enraging conservationists. Legal challenges are expected because no president has ever rescinded a monument designation. In announcing the order on Wednesday Republican Trump said Obamas use of the 1906 Antiquities Act to create monuments was an egregious abuse of federal power that allowed the federal government to lock up millions of acres of land and water. The Antiquities Act gives a president the authority to create national monuments from federal lands to protect significant natural, cultural, or scientific features. Today were putting the states back in charge, Trump said, adding that they should decide which land is protected and which is open for development.   Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke told reporters late Tuesday the order requires him to review about 30 national monuments created over the past two decades, and recommend which designations should be lifted or altered. The monuments covered under the review will range from the Grand Staircase created by President Bill Clinton in 1996 to the Bears Ears created by Obama in December 2016, both in Utah.   Zinke said he will seek local feedback before making  recommendations, adding that reversing a monument designation could be tricky. It is untested, as you know, whether the president can do that, Zinke said.     President Woodrow Wilson reduced the size of Washington states Mount Olympus National Monument in 1915, arguing there was an urgent need for timber at the time. Zinke said he will review the Bears Ears monument first and make a recommendation to the president in 45 days. He has 120 days to issue a full report on all monuments to the president. Bears Ears protects Native American cultural heritage and sacred sites. Obama created the Bears Ears monument in the final days of his administration. Utahs governor and the states congressional delegation opposed the designation, saying it was done against the wishes of citizens eager for development. Utah Governor Gary Herbert, and Senators Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, all Republicans, stood beside Trump as he signed the order. Trump said the lawmakers lobbied him for the order. Bears Ears is near where Texas-based EOG Resources Inc has been approved to drill. Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan praised the order. I commend the Trump administration for stopping this cycle of executive abuse and beginning a review of past designations, he said.  Conservation and tribal groups were critical. With this review, the Trump Administration is walking into a legal, political and moral mine field, said Kate Kelly, public lands director for the Center for American Progress.  Democratic Congressman Raul Grijalva of Arizona, ranking member of the House Natural Resources Committee, warned Zinke not to make an ideological decision. He said previous monuments were decided after years of close federal consultation with multiple local stakeholders. The five Native American tribes that pushed to create the Bears Ears monument to protect ancestral land said they will fight to protect it. The Outdoor Industry Association, the trade group of the recreation industry, also attacked the order.  The group has estimated the outdoor recreation economy generates over $887 billion in consumer spending and creates 7.6 million jobs. Less than 24 hours after joining with our industry to celebrate the economic power of outdoor recreation, in a hypocritical move, the Trump administration took unprecedented steps that could result in the removal of protections for treasured public lands, said Rose Marcario, chief executive of outdoor gear retailer Patagonia.   On Friday, before the close of Trumps first 100 days in office, he is expected to sign an executive order that would review offshore areas available for offshore oil and gas exploration that have been restricted by previous presidents.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday debated resurrecting the stalled Yucca Mountain spent nuclear fuel dump in Nevada, a project critics say is hindered by the lack of an easy transport route. Representative John Shimkus, an Illinois Republican, has proposed draft legislation to restart the licensing of Yucca Mountain. The government has already spent billions of dollars for initial construction of the project, which has been pending since Ronald Reagan was president. Former President Barack Obama opposed Yucca and stopped its licensing process in 2010. But President Donald Trumps proposed 2018 budget provides $120 million to restart licensing and for development of interim nuclear waste sites until Yucca can be completed. More details about the Trump administrations support of Yucca could come when a broader budget is released in May. Currently, spent nuclear fuel, which can be deadly if left unshielded, is stored at reactors across the country, first in cooling ponds and then in thick casks.  The Yucca site itself, about 100 miles (160 km) northwest of Las Vegas, faces a cumbersome and costly licensing process that could take years to complete and questions from critics about how long spent fuel can remain without radiation leaking into an aquifer. Yucca supporters say there is little groundwater at the desert site and what is there is contained by barriers and does not flow to any river or drinking water supply. An even trickier problem will be getting the spent fuel to Yucca Mountain safely by train and truck from nuclear reactors sites all across the country. Transportation is the Achilles heel of the Yucca Mountain repository site, said Bob Halstead, the head of Nevadas agency for nuclear projects.  One train route studied by the Department of Energy, known as Caliente, has been at least partially blocked by Obamas 2015 designation of a national monument called Basin and Range. Another route, known as Mina, is opposed by the Walker River tribe, which withdrew permission in 2007 for the government to ship waste through its reservation. Many casino owners and gaming associations also oppose the transport of spent nuclear fuel near the city of Las Vegas, saying publicity about the shipments could harm property values and tourism. The federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission has pointed out that nuclear waste has been transported safely in the country for more than 40 years, which Yucca backers are quick to cite. Shimkus, whose state of Illinois has more reactors than any other, says Yucca is ideal because of its remoteness. There are no nuclear power reactors in Nevada, and the states entire Congressional delegation, which includes members of both parties, opposes Yucca.  Representative Jacky Rosen, a Nevada Democrat, said a major accident would harm human health, cost hundreds of millions of dollars in cleanup costs, and damage the Las Vegas economy.   Do you honestly believe that shipping over 5,000 truck casks of high-level nuclear waste over a span of 50 years wont result in at least one radiological accident? Rosen said at the hearing.  The bill contains a measure directing the energy secretary to consider routes avoiding Las Vegas. But the provision is unenforceable under existing laws, Halstead said. Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval, a Republican, met with Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Washington on Wednesday. Sandoval said he reiterated his opposition to Yucca and urged Perry to explore a realistic, safe alternative, to the U.S. nuclear waste problem.

EDT (1730 GMT) after being postponed earlier this month. The administration is expected to make a decision on whether to remain a party to the deal by the time leaders of the Group of Seven wealthy nations meet in late May, but members of President Donald Trumps inner circle are divided on whether to stay or go. The accord, agreed by nearly 200 countries in Paris in 2015, would limit planetary warming in part by slashing carbon dioxide and other emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. As part of the deal, the United States under Trumps predecessor President Barack Obama committed to reducing its emissions by between 26 and 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. During the 2016 presidential election campaign Trump described climate change as a hoax that was stifling policies to improve economic growth and said he would consider cancelling the Paris agreement. He later said he was open to staying if the U.S. got better terms. Trumps advisers have taken different positions on the decision.  Pruitt joins Trump adviser Steve Bannon in opposing the Paris agreement. Trumps other close advisers, daughter Ivanka Trump and husband Jared Kushner have sided with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who said the U.S. should remain part of the agreement.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": "" WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Public pension funds in at least seven U.S. states have invested millions of dollars in an investment fund that owns a New York hotel and pays one of President Donald Trumps companies to run it, according to a Reuters review of public records. That arrangement could put Trump at risk of violating an obscure constitutional clause, some legal experts say.  The Trump SoHo Hotel and Condominium in Manhattan is an upscale 46-story property owned by a Los Angeles investment group, the CIM Group, through one of its real estate funds. (Read the most recent amendment to the Trump SoHos offering plan: tmsnrt.rs/2q3HJH8)  The possible problem for Trump lies in the fact that state- and city-run pension funds have invested in the CIM fund and pay it a few million dollars in quarterly fees to manage their investments in its portfolio, which includes the Trump SoHo, according to state investment records.  In return for marketing and managing the hotel-condo, CIM pays Trump International Hotels Management LLC 5.75 percent of the SoHos operating revenues annually.  That payment chain merits closer scrutiny because it could put Trump at risk of falling foul of a little-known constitutional rule prohibiting the flow of money from states to the pockets of a sitting president, five ethics and constitutional law experts interviewed by Reuters said. (Graphic on Trump SoHo payment chain: tmsnrt.rs/2pfkZ40)  No other public pension fund investments in Trump-affiliated businesses have been reported.  The White House referred comment to the Trump Organization, the parent conglomerate for Trumps businesses, which did not respond to repeated calls and emails for comment.  While Trump turned over management of the Trump Organization in January to a trust controlled by his two elder sons, he still earns revenue from the SoHo. Thats because he still owns the businesses in the Trump Organization, including Trump International Hotels Management LLC.  Article II of the U.S. Constitution bars the president from receiving additional payments beyond his salary from state governments. This so-called domestic emoluments clause prohibits any other emolument from the United States, or any of them.  This clause and a foreign emoluments clause prohibiting similar payments from foreign governments have been thrust to the fore because of Trumps vast, complicated network of businesses, which ethics experts say has created unprecedented conflicts of interest.  A group of constitutional and ethics experts have filed a lawsuit alleging Trump was violating both clauses by letting his hotels and other businesses accept payments from public officials. Trump said the suit was without merit. The lawsuit does not refer to the CIM fund.  The groups April complaint cited dozens of violations, including foreign government leases and purchases at Trumps properties in the United States, which have resulted in unknown amounts being paid to Trump since he was inaugurated.  The SoHo hotel-condo management contract is a significant revenue generator for Trump through his hotel management company. In 2015 and the first five months of 2016, Trump International Hotels Management LLC drew at least $3.1 million from the SoHo, and Trump received $3.3 million in income from the hotel management company, hotel records and campaign filings show. (Read the 2014 and 2015 financial statements for the Trump SoHo: tmsnrt.rs/2q3VNjP)  CIM said its policy is not to comment on its private funds, agreements, or the operations of its funds investments.  The state- or city-run pension funds are in California, New York, Texas, Arizona, Montana, Michigan and Missouri. They have more than 5 million members - from state lawmakers in California to teachers in Texas and police officers in New York. They include the California Public Employees Retirement System, the nations largest public pension fund.  The pension funds money accounts for about half of the total capital CIM raised from its investors to invest in the properties in the fund, including the Trump SoHo, according to the pension funds financial records and SEC filings. CIM declined to disclose how many properties are in the fund.  Some of the 11 pension funds contacted by Reuters declined to comment on the payment chain between them and Trump. Others referred the question to CIM, saying their investment in the CIM fund does not give them control over its asset acquisitions.  Reuters presented its findings to six lawyers with expertise in constitutional law and emoluments issues.  One of the lawyers, David Rivkin Jr., associate White House counsel during the George H. W. Bush administration, said the public investments do not put Trump at risk of violating the Constitution.  Payments clearly related to non-official activities that have nothing to do with the discharge of duties in office are not emoluments, Rivkin said.  Three, however, said if Trump financially benefited from a business whose owner drew millions of dollars in fees from U.S. states - in this case CIM - this presented a serious argument for a domestic emoluments violation.  If you take a step back and look at this transaction, its a payment chain from state pension funds to President Trump, said Jed Shugerman, a law professor at Fordham University. This looks like an emolument to me.  Two other lawyers said the arrangement raised significant questions, but all depended on how broadly a court interpreted the constitutional clause.  Were in largely uncharted territory on that front given that past presidents have gone to great lengths to avoid the kinds of issues were now confronting, said Brianne Gorod, chief counsel at the Constitutional Accountability Center, a Washington research organization and public advocacy law firm.  None of the 11 pension funds contacted by Reuters said they were prepared to divest from the CIM fund. For instance, the Teacher Retirement System of Texas, which has invested $225 million in the CIM fund, said it was not our practice to comment on questions of this nature.  One member of the Texas teachers pension fund, Byron Hildebrand, 61, state secretary for the Association of Texas Professional Educators, however, said he would alert teachers across his state to the pension funds exposure to the Trump hotel and call on the state to consider divesting.  Divesting from the CIM fund would likely force the public pension funds to sell their CIM shares at a loss, said Tom Lopez, the chief investment officer of the Los Angeles Fire and Police Pensions, one of the pension funds in the CIM fund, which is also known as a real estate partnership.  Even though the partnerships returns on investment are overall quite strong, trying to sell interest in a 10-year-old partnership is like trying to sell a used car, he said.  Lopez noted that all the public funds invested in the CIM fund long before it acquired the SoHo  and long before anybody thought Trump would become president.

The ruling from U.S. District Judge William Orrick III in San Francisco said Trumps Jan. 25 order targeted broad categories of federal funding for sanctuary governments and that plaintiffs challenging the order were likely to succeed in proving it unconstitutional. The Republican presidents moves on immigration have galvanized legal advocacy groups, along with Democratic city and state governments, to oppose them in court. The administration suffered an earlier defeat when two federal judges suspended executive orders restricting travel from several Muslim-majority countries. The government has appealed those decisions. Reince Priebus, Trumps White House chief of staff, told reporters the administration was taking action to appeal the ruling, adding: The idea that an agency cant put in some reasonable restrictions on how some of these monies are spent is something that will be overturned eventually. Its the 9th Circuit going bananas, Priebus said, referring to the West Coast judicial district where the judge ruled. Well win at the Supreme Court level at some point. A formal White House statement on the ruling was withering in its criticism of Orrick, saying an unelected judge unilaterally rewrote immigration policy for our nation and handed a gift to the criminal gang and cartel element in our country. This case is yet one more example of egregious overreach by a single, unelected district judge, the White House said. The U.S. Justice Department said in a statement it would  follow existing federal law with respect to sanctuary jurisdictions, as well as enforce conditions tied to federal grants. Sanctuary cities generally offer safe harbor to illegal immigrants and often do not use municipal funds or resources to advance the enforcement of federal immigration laws. Dozens of local governments and cities, including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, have joined the growing sanctuary movement. Supporters of the sanctuary policy argue that enlisting police cooperation in rounding up immigrants for removal undermines communities trust in local police, particularly among Latinos. The Trump administration contends that local authorities endanger public safety when they decline to hand over for deportation illegal immigrants arrested for crimes. The executive order by Trump, who made cracking down on illegal immigration a cornerstone of his 2016 presidential campaign, directed such funding to be restricted once the Homeland Security Department determines what constitutes a sanctuary city. Santa Clara County, which includes the city of San Jose and several smaller Silicon Valley communities, sued in February, saying Trumps order was unconstitutional. San Francisco filed a similar lawsuit. The Justice Department threatened last week to cut some funding to California as well as eight cities and counties across the United States. The department singled out Chicago and New York as two cities crumbling under the weight of illegal immigration and violent crime, even though New York City is experiencing its lowest crime levels in decades and experts say Chicagos recent spike in violent crime has little to do with illegal immigration. Santa Clara County receives about $1.7 billion in federal and federally dependent funds annually, about 35 percent of its total revenues. The county argued it was owed millions of dollars of federal funding every day and that its budgetary planning process had been thrown into disarray by the order. The Justice Department said the counties had taken an overly broad interpretation of the presidents order, which it said would affect only Justice Department and Homeland Security funds, a fraction of the grant money received by the counties. In his ruling, Orrick said the language of the order made it clear it sought to withhold funds beyond law enforcement.  And if there was doubt about the scope of the Order, the President and Attorney General have erased it with their public comments, Orrick wrote. The judge cited comments from Trump calling the order a weapon to use against jurisdictions that disagree with his immigration policies. Federal funding that bears no meaningful relationship to immigration enforcement cannot be threatened merely because a jurisdiction chooses an immigration enforcement strategy of which the President disapproves, Orrick wrote. Dave Cortese, president of the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors, said in a statement: The politics of fear emanating from the Trump White House has just suffered a major setback.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is proposing to slash the corporate income tax rate and offer multinational businesses a steep tax break on overseas profits brought into the United States, officials said late on Tuesday. With financial markets eagerly anticipating a White House tax plan, Trump will also call for a sharp cut in the top rate on pass-through businesses, including many small business partnerships and sole proprietorships, to 15 percent from 39.6 percent, an administration official said. He will propose cutting the income tax rate paid by public corporations to 15 percent from 35 percent, and allowing multinationals to bring in overseas profits at a tax rate of 10 percent versus 35 percent now, the official said. Trumps proposal will not include a controversial border-adjustment tax on imports that was in earlier proposals floated by Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives as a way to offset revenue losses resulting from tax cuts. Trumps tax blueprint will fall short of the kind of comprehensive tax reform that Republicans have long discussed, and serve chiefly as a guidepost for lawmakers in the House and Senate. Were driving this a little bit more, a senior White House official told a group of reporters late on Tuesday. The plan is not expected by analysts to include any proposals for raising new revenue to offset that lost by the tax cuts, and so, if enacted, it would potentially add billions of dollars to the federal deficit. Trump sent Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to brief lawmakers on the plan to be unveiled on Wednesday afternoon, likely by Mnuchin. Mnuchin has been leading the administrations effort to craft a tax package that can win support in Congress, although the proposals would have a long way to go before becoming law, even with Republicans in control of both the House and Senate. Mnuchin has said the cuts will pay for themselves by generating more economic growth but fiscal hawks, potentially some in Trumps own Republican Party, along with Democrats, are certain to question these claims. Trump also may cap the individual top tax rate at 33 percent, repeal the estate and alternative minimum taxes and cut taxes for the middle class, analysts said. Whether Trump will include provisions that could attract Democratic votes, such as a proposal to fund infrastructure spending or a child-care tax credit as proposed by his daughter Ivanka, is still the subject of speculation. Mnuchin and Cohn, both veterans of investment bank Goldman Sachs (GS.N), went to Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnells office on Tuesday evening, where they all met with House Speaker Paul Ryan, and the chairmen of the House and Senate tax committees, Orrin Hatch and Kevin Brady, respectively. Hatch called it a preliminary 30-minute meeting and participants described it as positive and productive. As Mnuchin left the Capitol he told reporters there is no question the Trump administration and Republicans in the Senate and House agree on the fundamental principles of tax reform. The senior White House official said Trump would like to see Congress pass tax reform by the middle of autumn. Trump has struggled to advance his domestic agenda, including taxes. With his 100th day as president approaching on Saturday, he has yet to offer formal legislation to Congress or win passage of a major bill he favors. Some Washington policy analysts said the White House plan could clash in some ways with a broader tax plan shaped months ago by House Republicans, and complicate the consensus-building needed for full tax reform, a political feat not accomplished since 1986 when President Ronald Reagan pulled it off. The House Republican plan, championed by Ryan and Brady, proposed a 20 percent corporate tax rate. Many U.S. corporations, especially large multinationals, already pay well below the statutory 35 percent tax rate but have been campaigning for a formal rate cut for many years. The Ryan-Brady plan did include pay-fors, including a proposed border adjustment tax that would favor exports and discourage imports. When asked after Tuesdays briefing if Republicans had ruled out including a border adjustment tax in a tax overhaul, Hatch said: I wouldnt say that. The House hasnt given up on that but theyve acknowledged it needs some work. Separately cutting the top tax rate for pass-through businesses, which account for most U.S. companies, could benefit Trump himself, said Frank Clemente, executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness, a Democratic activist group. In trying to slash taxes for pass-through business entities, Trump is seeking to dramatically reduce his own tax bill, he said in a statement. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The meeting will be the first between the two leaders. Relations were strained after an acrimonious telephone call shortly after Trumps inauguration, during which Trump labeled the Australia-U.S. resettlement swap agree to with former U.S. President Barack Obama as a dumb deal. Turnbull said the 75th anniversary of the World War Two Battle of the Coral Sea celebrations in New York City offered a chance for the two nations to reaffirm our alliance. The bilateral meeting will follow a speech by Trump aboard the USS Intrepid, an aircraft carrier turned museum on the Hudson River, to mark the anniversary of the Coral Sea battle,  during which U.S. and Australian troops fought the Japanese, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said. Australia is one of Washingtons staunchest allies and troops from the two nations have fought alongside each other in all major conflicts, most recently Iraq and Afghanistan. Late last year, Obama agreed to resettle up to 1,250 asylum seekers held in Australian-funded camps in the South Pacific, in exchange for Australia resettling refugees from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. But in February, Trump criticized the deal, accusing Australia of trying to export the next Boston bombers under the agreement, the Washington Post reported. Eager to repair the relationship, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence last week visited Australia and confirmed Washington would begrudgingly honor the refugee deal with Canberra, only out of respect for the alliance between the two countries.

Even if the fight over wall funding is over, Republicans and Democrats still have difficult issues to resolve as they face a Friday night deadline when existing money expires for many federal agencies.  There was growing sentiment among lawmakers that they would need to pass a short-term extension of current spending, possibly of one weeks duration, in order to finish negotiating longer-term legislation for funding the government through the end of September. Yeah, it looks like it, said Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski, an Appropriations Committee member, when asked about the likelihood of a short-term extension. But on Tuesday night, some leading Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate expressed optimism that Congress could pass the longer-term bill and avoid having to rely on another temporary extension of last years funding levels. Were really close, said Republican Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee.  He added that leadership would make the final decision on which course Congress takes this week. Trump removed a crucial sticking point when he said on Monday he may wait until Republicans begin drafting the budget blueprint for the fiscal year that starts on Oct. 1 to seek wall funding. The presidents fellow Republicans control both chambers of Congress, but the current spending bill will need 60 votes to clear the 100-member Senate, where Republicans hold only 52 seats. Democratic leaders had said they would not support a bill that included funds for the wall. The border wall was one of Trumps signature election pledges last year, with the Republican touting it as best way to stop illegal immigrants and drugs from coming into the country. If no spending measure covering April 29 to Sept. 30 is in place before 12:01 a.m. (0401 GMT) on Saturday, government funds will halt and hundreds of thousands of the countrys several million federal employees will be temporarily laid off. Trump had run the risk of being blamed by Democrats for a shutdown, which would start on his 100th day in office. Representative Steny Hoyer, the second most powerful Democrat in the House, said he would advise colleagues to support a short-term funding proposal only if a longer-term fix was imminent. Short-term funding measures, known as continuing resolutions and covering periods of days or weeks, have been used to avert shutdowns in the past. But in 2013, conservative Republicans forced a 17-day shutdown in a failed attempt to repeal then-President Barack Obamas healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer welcomed Trumps Monday night comments and noted there were Republican opponents of the wall too. Its really good news that the president seems to be taking the wall off the table, Schumer said on the Senate floor on Tuesday. It would remove the prospect of a needless fight over a poison pill proposal that members of both parties dont support. Late on Tuesday, however, White House budget director Mick Mulvaney told CNN that Trump would not agree to other concessions that Democrats had sought - cost-sharing healthcare subsidies for 6 million Americans. The subsidies are part of the Affordable Care Act health insurance law, commonly called Obamacare.  Mulvaney said the White House had offered Democrats to include the Obamacare subsidies in exchange for funding the wall.   But they said no to that and we agreed to put that off for another day, he said. By dropping his call for immediate funding for the wall, Trump may clear a path to a spending bill. But he will lose an opportunity to display serious progress on accomplishing his agenda since taking office on Jan. 20.  There is also no guarantee that Congress will want to fund the wall later on, given skepticism running through the Republican Party.   Republican Senator Jeff Flake, who represents the border state of Arizona, told reporters on Tuesday there was a need for a wall in some border locations and alternative deterrents in others. A lot of us have been pushing for additional border security funding for a while, but a solitary 2,000-mile wall has never been a must-have for anybody in a border state, he said.  Trump said he had not changed his stance, tweeting on Tuesday: It will get built and help stop drugs, human trafficking etc. Trump has said Mexico will eventually repay the United States for wall construction, but the Mexican government has been adamant it will not do so, and Trump has not laid out  plans to compel repayment. Internal Department of Homeland Security estimates have put the cost at $21.6 billion. Republican Senator Roger Wicker said there was a substantial figure in the spending bill dedicated to border security. Such spending, not explicitly for a wall, would likely be acceptable to both parties. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

He said those industries could qualify for protection under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which lets the president impose restrictions on imports for reasons of national security and was used to launch a probe of steel imports, the Journal reported.  Last week, President Donald Trump launched a trade probe against China and other exporters of cheap steel into the U.S. market, raising the possibility of new tariffs.  Ross said the Trump administration might intercede to aid Toshiba Corps U.S. unit Westinghouse Electric Co, which filed for bankruptcy last month. The company filed for bankruptcy protection after it incurred billions of dollars of cost overruns at four nuclear reactors under construction in the U.S. Southeast. The bankruptcy cast doubt on the future of the first new U.S. nuclear power plants in three decades. Ross said renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement should be completed by the end of 2017, the Journal reported. Ross told the newspaper that if the talks with Mexico and Canada go much beyond December, it would be difficult to get the pact ratified by Mexico. Mexico is due to hold its presidential election in July 2018. Ross said the Trump administration was considering restarting talks on bilateral trade deals with the European Union and China that the Obama administration had begun but never finished, the Journal reported, adding that he said the United States might reopen a bilateral deal with South Korea. Earlier this month, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence told business leaders in Seoul that the Trump administration would review and reform the five-year-old free trade agreement between the two countries.

The move comes as Trump seeks to reverse a slew of environmental protections ushered in by former President Barack Obama that he said were hobbling economic growth - an agenda that is cheering industry but enraging conservationists. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke told reporters on Tuesday Trumps executive order would require him to conduct the review of around 30 national monuments and recommend which designations should be lifted or resized over the coming months. He said he would seek feedback from Congressional delegations, governors and local stakeholders before making his recommendations. I am not going to predispose what the outcome is going to be, Zinke said. Rescinding or altering a national monument designation would be new ground for the government, he said. It is untested, as you know, whether the president can do that, Zinke said. The monuments covered by the review will range from the Grand Staircase in Utah created by President Bill Clinton in 1996 to the Bears Ears monuments created by President Barack Obama in December 2016 in the same state, covering millions of acres of land overlying minerals, oil and gas.  Obamas administration created the Bears Ears monument arguing that it would protect the cultural legacy of the Navajo and four other tribes and preserve scenic and historic landscapes. But Utahs governor opposed the designation, saying it went against the wishes of citizens eager for development. The area lies near where EOG Resources (EOG.N) - a Texas-based company - had been approved to drill. Zinke said the broader aim of the order is to give states more input in the monument designation process, and restore trust between local communities and Washington. While he acknowledged that national monuments could bring tourism, he said he thinks federal land should be managed for multiple uses.  Conservation groups and Native American tribal representatives slammed the looming order, suggesting it would be fought in court. With this review, the Trump Administration is walking into a legal, political and moral minefield, said Kate Kelly, public lands director for the Center for American Progress.  A summary of the forthcoming order, seen by Reuters, said past administrations overused the Antiquities Act that allows presidents to create monuments.

Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau discuss bilateral trade in their second conversation in as many days  amid strains over softwood lumber and dairy. The Trump administration says it aims to push North Korea into dismantling its nuclear and missile programs through tougher international sanctions and diplomatic pressure, and remains open to negotiations to bring that about.

During the visit, Flynn, a retired lieutenant general who advised Donald Trumps presidential campaign, dined with Russian President Vladimir Putin. General Flynn had a duty and an obligation to seek and obtain permission to receive money from foreign governments, Jason Chaffetz, the Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee, told reporters. It does not appear to us that that was ever sought, nor did he ever get that permission. The oversight panel is looking into whether Flynn fully disclosed payments from Russian, Turkish or other foreign sources. As a former military officer, you simply cannot take money from Russia, Turkey or anybody else. And it appears as if he did take that money. It was inappropriate and there are repercussions for the violation of law, Chaffetz said. Flynn was forced to resign on Feb. 13 for failing to disclose talks with Sergei Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States, about U.S. sanctions on Moscow and misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations, which occurred in December before Trump took office. He is a subject in investigations by intelligence committees in the House and Senate, as well as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, into allegations Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. election. Russia has denied the allegations, which have cast a shadow over the first 100 days of Trumps presidency. Representative Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the oversight panel, said it also appeared as if Flynn had not fully disclosed the payments after the fact as required, saying a failure to do so would be a felony. An attorney for Flynn did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters, but he told ABC News the retired general had briefed the Defense Intelligence Agency, which is part of the Defense Department, before and after the Russia trip. He answered any questions that were posed by DIA concerning the trip during those briefings, attorney Robert Kelner said, according to a statement ABC News posted on Twitter.

Climate change, if left unchecked, will lead to global environmental dislocation and disaster on a scale we likely cannot imagine, the prosecutors wrote, urging the president to maintain and reconfirm the United States commitment to this groundbreaking agreement. The Paris accord, reached by nearly 200 countries in 2015, seeks to limit global warming by slashing carbon dioxide and other emissions from burning fossil fuels. As part of the deal, the United States committed to reducing its emissions by between 26 percent and 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025.

The nomination earlier passed the Senate Agriculture Committee with only one vote in opposition, although some Midwestern senators raised concerns that Perdue was not from a major agricultural production state. Trump nominated Perdue, 70, in January but progress on his confirmation was slow, with media reports suggesting that undoing his various business entanglements caused delays in the ethics filings.  Perdue did not file his disclosure forms until mid-March, and the Senate panel backed him later that month. Trade is seen as critical to reviving a moribund farm economy, where incomes have been falling with lower grain prices. Farm incomes in 2016 are expected to have hit their lowest levels since 2009. Agriculture relies heavily on seasonal and casual labor, and farmers are concerned tough immigration rules could make it harder to find workers while raising costs. Trump has raised tensions on immigration with his pledge to build a wall at the Mexican-U.S. border.  Perdue, who holds a doctorate in veterinary medicine and was raised on a dairy farm, is the first agriculture secretary from a southern state since Mike Espy of Mississippi, who served from January 1993 to December 1994.

U.S. intelligence agencies said in January that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered hacking of the Democratic National Committee and the chairman of Hillary Clintons Democratic campaign to influence the election on behalf of Trump, a Republican. Russia has denied this. The Central Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Justice Department all launched investigations under President Barack Obama. Following are some ways Congress is looking into the matter: HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE - The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence began its investigation of potential Russian influence on the 2016 presidential race before Trump took office on Jan. 20. The panels chairman, Republican Representative Devin Nunes, a close Trump ally, recused himself from the investigation last month. Before he stepped aside, Democrats had questioned whether the committee could conduct a credible investigation after Nunes received information at the White House about surveillance and discussed it with Trump before briefing Democrats on the committee. Nunes was replaced as leader of the House investigation by Republican Representative Mike Conaway, an intelligence panel member. The committee held a high-profile public hearing on March 20 with testimony by FBI Director James Comey and NSA director Admiral Mike Rogers. But Nunes canceled another planned public hearing with former Obama administration officials James Clapper, who was director of national intelligence, former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates and ex-CIA Director James Brennan, causing committee Democrats to accuse him of political motivations. The two parties reached a solution last week, announcing a closed hearing with Comey and Rogers for May 2, and a public one with the Obama administration officials for an as-yet-to-be-determined date. SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE - The U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence is conducting its own investigation, which also started before Trump took office. Staffers have begun interviewing intelligence analysts involved in the report announced in January that charged Russia with seeking to influence the election on Trumps behalf. Its chairman, Senator Richard Burr, was re-elected in November in the Republican sweep that carried Trump into office and preserved Republican control of Congress. He and Senator Mark Warner, the committees Democratic vice chairman, have pledged that their investigation would be bipartisan despite questions over Burrs close ties to the White House. But far fewer staff members have been assigned to the panels investigation than previous high-profile intelligence probes in Congress, according to sources and a Reuters review of public records. SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE - Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, chairman of the panels subcommittee on crime and terrorism, and Sheldon Whitehouse, the subcommittees ranking Democrat, are looking into Russian attempts to influence the election. The subcommittee announced on Tuesday that it would hold a public hearing on May 8 with testimony by Yates and Clapper. Its chairman of the full Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley, and top Democrat Dianne Feinstein also have had officials brief panel members.     SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE - The Appropriations subcommittee that oversees U.S. government spending for the State Department, which is also chaired by Senator Graham, has also held hearings on Russian attempts to influence elections. HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE - Representative Jason Chaffetz, the committees Republican chairman, has resisted calls to investigate the Trump administration. But he and Representative Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the committee, said on Tuesday Trumps former national security adviser Michael Flynn likely broke the law by failing to get permission to be paid for a trip to Russia in 2015. Chaffetz announced last week that he would not run for re-election in 2018, and said he might leave office even before the end of his term. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The letter urged Congress to avoid drastically cutting U.N. funding and to give current U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley and U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres time and space to reform the world body to make it more efficient, effective and responsive.  The United States is the biggest U.N. contributor, paying 22 percent of the $5.4 billion core budget and 28.5 percent of the $7.9 billion peacekeeping budget. These assessed contributions are agreed by the 193-member U.N. General Assembly.  Trump said the U.S. share of those budgets was unfair and has proposed an unspecified reduction in funding for the United Nations and its agencies, as well as enforcement of a 25 percent cap on U.S. funding for peacekeeping operations.  Some U.N diplomats have also voiced concern about who could fill a U.S. cash void.  There is an argument to be made about the U.S. inadvertently creating a China first policy, rather than U.S. first policy if they walk away and leave space, said a senior U.N. diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.  Trump told U.N. Security Council ambassadors on Monday - over lunch at the White House - that if the world body reforms how it operates, then the U.S. investment would be worth it.  If we do a great job, I care much less about the budget because youre talking about peanuts compared to the important work youre doing, Trump told the 15 council envoys.  U.N. Secretary-General Guterres met briefly with Trump at the White House on Friday for the first time since both took office earlier this year.  The State Department said this month it was ending funding for the U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA), the U.N. agency focused on family planning as well as maternal and child health in more than 150 countries. Guterres warned that the cut could have devastating effects.

Trump, 35, who is seen as an increasingly important influence on her father, told a womens summit organised by the Group of 20 major economies in the German capital that she wanted to use her influence to help empower women. Asked whether she represented the president, the American people or her business as first daughter, she replied: Well certainly not the latter, and I am rather unfamiliar with this role ... it has been a little under 100 days but it has just been a remarkable and incredible journey. Ivanka Trumps appointment as an adviser, with access to classified information, was highly unusual for the daughter of a president. Seeking to allay ethics concerns, she said last month she would serve in the White House in an unpaid, informal role.     In Berlin, she discussed support for women entrepreneurs with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde among others. Im listening, Im learning, Im defining the ways in which I think that Ill be able to have impact, she told the panel discussion.  Im seeking the counsel .. . of informed and thoughtful women and men and Im really striving to think about how best to empower women in the economy, both domestically and across the globe. But the audience was unsympathetic when she called her father a tremendous champion of supporting families and enabling them to thrive, with the moderator moving the discussion on amid a chorus of boos. Donald Trump found himself at the centre of a furious controversy during the presidential campaign when a video surfaced in which he boasted about grabbing womens genitals. Asked whether some of the attitudes expressed by her father raised questions over his commitment to empowering women, Ivanka Trump said her experience and that of thousands of women who had worked for him showed he believed in womens potential. I grew up in a house where there were no barriers to what I could accomplish ... there was no difference for me and my brothers and I think as a business leader you saw that and as a president youll absolutely see that, she said.  During the Berlin discussion, Donald Trump tweeted a link to a Financial Times editorial Ivanka co-authored with World Bank President Jim Yong Kim on investment in women and said he was proud of his daughter for her leadership on these important issues. Ivanka Trumps visit has received a mixed response in German media. The newspaper Berliner Zeitung, which has described her as the presidents whisperer, said German officials would certainly be hoping that the presidents daughter will convey a positive image of Germany to her father.  Another paper, Tagesspiegel, was more sniffy about her credentials, opining that Trumps dependence on family members -  also including her husband Jared Kushner, a chief presidential adviser - was like a vote of no confidence in everyone else he was surrounded by.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": "" WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Senates main investigation into allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election is equipped with a much smaller staff than previous high-profile intelligence and scandal probes in Congress, which could potentially affect its progress, according to sources and a Reuters review of public records.  With only seven staff members initially assigned to the Senate Intelligence Committees three-month-old investigation, progress has been sluggish and minimal, said two sources with direct knowledge of the matter, who requested anonymity.  A committee aide, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said two more staff members were being added and a few others were involved less formally.  We need to pick up the pace, Senator Martin Heinrich, a committee Democrat, told Reuters on Monday. It is incumbent on us to have the resources to do this right and expeditiously, and I think we need additional staff.  While some directly involved in the investigation disputed characterizations of the probe as off track, the appearance of a weak Senate investigation could renew calls by some Democrats and other Trump critics for a commission independent of the Republican-led Congress to investigate the allegations.  The intelligence committees of the Senate and House of Representatives have taken the lead in Congress in examining whether Russia tried to influence the election in Republican Trump's favor, mostly by hacking Democratic operatives' emails and releasing embarrassing information, or possibly by colluding with Trump associates. Russia has denied such meddling.  With the House intelligence panels investigation for weeks stymied by partisan squabbles, the Senate committees parallel probe had appeared to be the more serious of the two, with Republican Chairman Richard Burr and top Democrat Mark Warner promising a thorough and bipartisan effort.  Burr, a member of Congress since 1995, last month called the Russia probe one of the biggest investigations undertaken in Congress during his tenure.  Previous investigations of national security matters have been much larger in terms of staffing than the one Burr is overseeing, according to a review of official reports produced by those inquiries, which traditionally name every staff member involved.  A House committee formed to investigate the 2012 attacks on a U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans had 46 staffers and eight interns.  The Senate Intelligence Committees years-long study of the CIAs enhanced interrogation techniques during President George W. Bushs administration had 20 staff members, according to the panels official report.  A special commission separate from Congress that reviewed the intelligence that wrongly concluded former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction ahead of the 2003 invasion of Iraq involved 88 staffers.  A special Senate committees 1970s investigation into Watergate-era surveillance practices tapped 133 staffers.  A joint House-Senate probe of the 1980s Iran-Contra affair during Ronald Reagans presidency involving secret sales of arms to Iran to try to win the release of American hostages, with proceeds going to Nicaraguan rebels, had 181 staffers.  Spokeswomen for Burr and for Warner declined to comment on the staffing levels.  The listed sizes of various investigations may be an imperfect comparison because not all staffers listed may have actually had a substantial role, congressional sources said. Investigations often grow in size over time, and a committee aide said the panel had secured $1.2 million in additional funding for the Russia election investigation.  But the numbers are still broadly relevant as indicators of a commitment to an investigation, said Steven Aftergood, a secrecy expert with the Federation of American Scientists.  For this investigation to be successful, the committee must recognize the enormity of the job and provide the resources to tackle it, Senator Ron Wyden, another committee Democrat, said in a statement.  Wyden sent a letter last month to Burr and Warner requesting that the probe include a thorough review of any financial ties between Russia and Trump and his associates.  None of the staffers possess substantial investigative experience or a background in Russian affairs, two of the sources said.  The investigation has not yet conducted interviews with Trump associates suspected of having links to Russian intelligence services, two sources and the aide said.  The investigators have focused on reviewing thousands of pages of documents supporting a previous U.S. intelligence agency finding that Russia interfered to help Trump, and have spoken with intelligence officials in preparation for interviewing key witnesses, they said.  The House intelligence panels chairman, Republican Devin Nunes, who was a member of Trumps presidential transition team, on April 6 stepped aside from leading that probe because he was under investigation by the House ethics committee for allegedly disclosing classified information.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation is also conducting a wide ranging counter-intelligence investigation into alleged Russian interference and potential collusion with Trump associates, though its findings may never become public.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump indicated an openness on Monday to delaying his push to secure funds for his promised border wall with Mexico, potentially eliminating a sticking point as lawmakers worked to avoid a looming shutdown of the federal government. Trump, in a private meeting with conservative media outlets, said he may wait until Republicans begin drafting the budget blueprint for the fiscal year that starts on Oct. 1 to seek government funds for building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, the White House confirmed. Trump, whose approval ratings have slid since he took office, is facing a Friday deadline for Congress to pass a spending bill funding the government through September or risk marking his 100th day in office on Saturday with a government shutdown. Now the bipartisan and bicameral negotiators can continue working on the outstanding issues, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement on Monday night. Earlier on Monday, Schumer reiterated an assertion made last week that bipartisan negotiations in Congress were going well until the White House began demanding money for the wall as a condition for accepting a funding bill. Although Republicans control both chambers of Congress, a funding bill will need 60 votes to clear the 100-member Senate, where Republicans hold 52 seats, meaning at least some Democrats will have to get behind it. If no spending measure covering April 29 to Sept. 30 is in place before 12:01 a.m. (0401 GMT) on Saturday, government funds will halt and hundreds of thousands of the countrys several million federal employees will be temporarily laid off. Those in jobs deemed essential such as law enforcement are expected to keep working in the hope they will receive back pay. Non-essential sectors such as national parks are liable to be closed and programs such as federally funded medical research will grind to a halt. Failure to approve a government funding bill could also throw new doubts over Republicans ability to fashion a budget blueprint for the next fiscal year or to succeed in a major effort to cut corporate and individual taxes that Trump has touted. Congressional leaders will likely have to decide by late on Tuesday whether negotiations are progressing enough to try to pass a spending bill funding the government through September, Senator Roy Blunt, a member of the Republican leadership and Senate Appropriations Committee, told reporters on Monday. If negotiations have slowed or stalled, Congress could pursue a short-term extension of existing spending levels to avoid a government shutdown, giving lawmakers more time to reach a deal. Leading Democrats have said they would support such a measure only if talks are progressing. Short-term funding measures, known as continuing resolutions that cover periods of days, have been used to avert government shutdowns in the past. But in 2013, conservative Republicans forced a 17-day shutdown in a failed attempt to repeal former President Barack Obamas Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. A Republican effort to repeal and replace Obamacare imploded in Congress last month and the White House said on Monday that another vote could not come for weeks. But Trump has dangled the prospect of funding some elements of the law, which enabled millions more Americans to secure healthcare coverage, in exchange for Democrats support in the spending talks. The White House had offered to include $7 billion in Obamacare subsidies that allow low-income people to pay for healthcare insurance in exchange for Democratic backing of $1.5 billion in funding to begin construction of a barrier on the U.S.-Mexico border. It was unclear on Monday whether delaying wall funding until later spending negotiations would invalidate the White House pledge to include Obamacare subsidy funding for low-income people in the current proposal funding the government through September. Trump has argued that a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border is needed to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs into the United States. In a Twitter message on Monday, Trump wrote: If... the wall is not built, which it will be, the drug situation will NEVER be fixed the way it should be! Earlier on Monday, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Trumps demand that Congress include funds for the construction of the wall remained a White House priority. The president has made very clear that hes got two priorities in this continuing resolution: No. 1, the increase in funding for the military and No. 2, for our homeland security and the wall, Spicer told reporters. The White House is confident in the direction of the talks and an announcement is expected soon, Spicer said, although he declined to say specifically whether Trump would sign a bill that did not contain money for border security and the wall. Trump has said Mexico will repay the United States for the wall if Congress funds it first. But the Mexican government is adamant it will not provide any financing and Trump has not laid out a plan to compel Mexico to pay. Department of Homeland Security internal estimates have placed the total cost of a border barrier at about $21.6 billion.  Aside from inflaming relations with a major trading partner, the planned wall has angered Democrats. They showed no sign of softening their opposition on Monday and sought to place responsibility for any shutdown squarely on Trump and congressional Republicans.

An Iranian court sentenced 46-year-old Siamak Namazi and his 80-year-old father Baquer Namazi to 10 years in prison each in October on charges of spying and cooperating with the United States. The Namazis lawyer, Jared Genser, said he had traveled to the nuclear talks venue in Vienna with Siamaks brother, Babak, to encourage Washingtons delegation to press the case, adding that he was worried about the detained mens health. The lawyer said a senior administration official in the U.S. delegation had told him on Monday that the case would be raised directly during the talks on the implementation of a deal reached in 2015 to shrink Irans nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief. A State Department spokeswoman did not comment directly on the case, but said: We continue to use all the means at our disposal to advocate for U.S. citizens who need our assistance overseas. Iran has not commented on the Namazis prison conditions but has repeatedly said that political prisoners are kept under standard condition in Evin prison with full access to medical care.  In our view, something happening to the Namazis would be devastating not just to one side but to both sides, Genser told reporters in a hotel near the venue.  For either or both of the Namazis to die on (Trumps) watch would be a public and catastrophic failure of his negotiating skills,     Irans Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps detained Siamak Namazi, a businessman, in October 2015 while he was visiting family in Tehran, relatives said.

The payments amount to about $7 billion in fiscal year 2017 and help cover out-of-pocket medical costs for low-income Americans who purchase insurance on the individual insurance exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare.  Trump has threatened to withhold the payments to force Democrats to the negotiating table on a healthcare bill to replace Obamacare.  He has also said he will fund the subsidies if Democrats agree to funding for his proposed border wall with Mexico as part of efforts to pass a government funding bill this week and avert a shutdown. Democrats have rejected the conditional offer.  If no deal is made, parts of the federal government will shut down at 12:01 am on Saturday. The payments are the subject of a pending Republican lawsuit that was appealed by the Obama administration and put on hold when Trump took office.  The government could save $10 billion by revoking the payments, Kaiser said. But insurers that remain in the market would have to hike premiums nearly 20 percent to cover their losses, Kaiser found, so the government would have to spend $12.3 billion on tax credits to help pay for Americans premium costs - a net increase of 23 percent on federal spending on marketplace subsidies. The projection assumes that insurers remain in the marketplace next year. Health policy experts have said without the payments, many insurers could not afford to stay in the market and will likely exit, which would leave some U.S. counties without an insurer.  Aetna (AET.N), UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N) and Humana (HUM.N) have already exited most state exchanges for 2017 and said they will do so next year as well.

Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau discuss bilateral trade in their second conversation in as many days  amid strains over softwood lumber and dairy. The Trump administration says it aims to push North Korea into dismantling its nuclear and missile programs through tougher international sanctions and diplomatic pressure, and remains open to negotiations to bring that about. Trump gives the military the authority to reset a confusing system of troop limits in Iraq and Syria that critics say allows the White House to micro-manage battlefield decisions and ultimately obscures the real number of U.S. forces. Trump signs an executive order to allow national monument designations to be rescinded or reduce the size of sites as the administration pushes to open more federal land to drilling, mining and other development. Trump orders Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to review the government role in school policy, which supporters cheer as a step in creating more local control in education and critics worry it could lead to lower quality schools in poorer neighborhoods.

Whats been going on since Ive been gone? joked the former Democratic president as he moderated an event at the University of Chicago in the city where he began his political career and which will be the site of his presidential library. Obama, who once taught constitutional law at the school, recalled starting out as a young community organizer in the city and told a panel of six current and former students that he decided to focus his post-presidency on encouraging young people to engage with their communities. The single most important thing I can do is to help in any way prepare the next generation of leadership to take up the baton and to take their own crack at changing the world,he told an audience of several hundred people. Obama has largely stayed out of the public eye since leaving office in January despite efforts by Trump and the Republican-led Congress to undo much of his legacy, including on healthcare and the environment. Trump, a Republican, has said he inherited a mess and accused Obama in March, without providing evidence, of wiretapping his 2016 presidential campaign. Obama has denied the charge and FBI Director James Comey told a congressional hearing he had seen no evidence to support the allegation. Obama was not asked about Trump by the students and he took no questions from reporters.  Saying it had long been his goal to bridge the countrys deep political divide, Obama said: Its harder and harder to find common ground because of the money in politics. Special interests dominate the debates in Washington in ways that dont match up with what the broad majority of Americans feel, he said.  Obama added that changes in the way people use media allow them to converse just with those who agree with their own points of view.

Ajit Pai, who was named chair of the FCC by President Donald Trump in January, will deliver a speech titled The Future of Internet Regulation on Wednesday in Washington, the FCC said. Sources said Pai is expected to announce that he will begin the process of taking public comment to repeal the rules approved by the FCC under President Barack Obama in early 2015. The FCC could hold an initial vote on his proposal at the FCCs May 18 meeting, the sources said. Pais office declined to comment. The rules approved by the FCC in 2015 prohibit broadband providers from giving or selling access to speedy internet, essentially a fast lane, to certain internet services over others. The 2015 FCC rules reclassified internet service providers much like utilities. A federal appeals court upheld the rules last year. Internet providers like AT&T Inc (T.N), Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) have argued net neutrality rules make it harder to manage internet traffic and investment in additional capacity less likely. Advocacy group Free Press Chief Executive Craig Aaron said Monday Pai wants to hand over control of the internet to providers no matter the cost to our economy and democracy. Pai, who opposed the net neutrality reclassification in 2015, has repeatedly said he backs a free and open internet but under a different regulatory scheme. Some analysts have said FCC action to roll back net neutrality rules could put pressure Congress to adopt legislation that clarifies the extent of FCC authority to regulate internet service. FCC Commissioner Mike ORielly said on Thursday that Congress should adopt legislation to resolve the issue and determine whether there should be rules.      Websites worry that without the rules they might lose access to customers. Democrats and privacy advocates have said net neutrality is crucial to keeping the internet open.    Reuters and other news outlets reported in early April that Pai was moving quickly to replace neutrality rules. Pai told reporters Thursday he has been meeting with major internet companies and trade groups to discuss ways of protecting an open internet.  Theres common ground here and theres room for an agreement here, Pai said. Going forward we want to make sure that we have a light touch regulatory framework. It is not clear what alternative legal framework Pai may endorse to guarantee an open internet. The Internet Association, a group representing Facebook Inc (FB.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and others, met with Pai this month and said the internet industry is uniform in its belief that net neutrality preserves the consumer experience, competition, and innovation online, according to a letter filed with the FCC.

The original article was posted on April 4 on the Share America website, overseen by the State Departments Bureau of International Information Programs. It was also shared on the websites and social media pages of several U.S. embassies, including those in the United Kingdom, Portugal and Albania, as well as the State Departments Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs. Although it was posted weeks ago, the article surfaced on Monday when it was shared widely on social media. The State Department removed the articles content around 7 p.m. on Monday, replacing it with a short statement saying its intention was to inform the public about where the President has been hosting world leaders. We regret any misperception and have removed the post.     The article described the history of Trumps Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, and its size, status as a registered historic site, interior decoration and oceanfront location. By visiting this winter White House, Trump is belatedly fulfilling the dream of Mar-a-Lagos original owner and designer, socialite and cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post, the article said. Posts dream of a winter White House came true with Trumps election in 2016. A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the White House did not know about the article in advance, and declined to comment further. Norman Eisen, ethics chief under Trumps predecessor, Democratic President Barack Obama, said on Twitter that the article violated a federal statute barring the use of public office for private gain. Richard Painter, a former ethics lawyer for Republican President George W. Bush, said on Twitter that the post constituted use of public office for private gain pure and simple. Scott Amey, an attorney with the nonpartisan Project on Government Oversight, said the post may not be an outright endorsement of Mar-a-Lago, but that someone inside of the government should have said no to the story and further helping Trump make money while serving in the White House. The Share America article said that in 1973, Post willed the estate to the U.S. government, intending it to be used as a winter White House for the president to entertain foreign dignitaries. But Presidents Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter never used the property, and in 1981 the government returned the estate to the Post Foundation because it was costing too much to maintain, according to the article. Trump, a businessman turned politician, bought the property in 1985, and turned it into a club open to dues-paying members 10 years later, it said.  The club has a $200,000 membership fee, and Trump has hosted Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the resort. Trumps frequent visits there have come under scrutiny due to their expense and questions of how he has handled sensitive national security information while there. Trump maintains ownership of his global business empire, though he has handed off control to his two oldest sons, an arrangement that ethics watchdogs said would not prevent conflicts of interest.

On Monday, 21 state attorneys general, all Democrats, wrote to Republican DeVos decrying her decision to end the Education Departments work on reforming loan servicing, steps intended to ensure that borrowers understand their outstanding debt and repayment options. We should be looking for ways to ease the burden of student debt, not enabling the student loan servicing industry to manipulate and exploit students, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement. Under Democrat Obama, much of the $1.3 trillion business of student lending was moved from banks and other companies to the federal government. Four companies still handle servicing the loans. Last year the department began working on restrictions as well as incentives to ensure those servicers follow the law. In March, the Consumer Federation of America reported that $137 billion in student loans were in default. In an April 11 memo announcing she was stopping reform efforts, DeVos, appointed by President Donald Trump, wrote the process had been riddled with moving deadlines, changing requirements and a lack of consistent objectives. We now find ourselves in a situation where we must promptly address not only these shortcomings but also any other issues that may impede our ability to ensure borrowers do not experience deficiencies in service, DeVos wrote, according to a version published on the department website. The department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter from the attorneys general. The head of the Democratic National Committee, former Labor Secretary Tom Perez, said DeVos decision was intended to boost the profits of big corporations and counteract Obamas reforms. Republicans say the U.S. government should get out of the business of making student loans. In January, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau sued the largest loan servicer, Navient Corp, over allegations it cheated borrowers by deceiving them about repayment options and their rights. Illinois and Washington also sued the company, which was spun off of Sallie Mae in 2014.  Navient said the bureau, created under Obama to protect people from fraud, sued because it would not settle a CFPB investigation right before Trump took office.

The annual cost to build, crew and operate a 355-ship fleet would be about $102 billion, or 13 percent more than the $90 billion needed for the currently planned Navy, according to the study by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The $102 billion cost of the 355-ship fleet is 33 percent more than Congress appropriated in 2016 for the current 275-ship Navy, the CBO said. To achieve the larger force, the Navy would need $26.6 billion annually for ship construction, which is 60 percent more than the average amount that Congress has appropriated for shipbuilding in the past 30 years, the CBO study said. The Navys 2017 shipbuilding plan called for boosting the size of the fleet to 308 ships, which was expected to cost $21.2 billion per year to implement over 30 years. With Trump pressing for an expansion of the fleet to 350 ships during the presidential campaign last year, the Navy released a new force structure assessment in December seeking a 355-ship Navy. Taking into consideration older ships being retired, creating a 355-ship fleet would require the Navy to buy about 329 new ships over 30 years, compared with 254 under its previous plan for a 308-ship fleet, the CBO study found. The Navy would have to buy about 12 ships per year under the larger fleet plan, versus about eight per year under the earlier plan. The larger fleet would require more civilian and uniformed personnel and more aircraft, pushing up overall operating costs, the CBO said. The increase in shipbuilding would force all seven U.S. shipyards to expand their work forces and improve their infrastructure in order to meet the demand for vessels, the CBO said. The greatest challenge would be building submarines to meet the force structure requirements, the report said. The study said the earliest the Navy could achieve a 355-ship fleet would be the year 2035, or 18 years from now. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trumps zeal to unveil a tax plan before his 100th day in office is raising questions about just how thorough his tax reform plans will be, amid signals that his focus for now is on slashing tax rates. Trump has directed aides to move quickly on a plan to cut the corporate income tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent, a Trump administration official said on Monday. With his 100th day nearing on April 29, Trump has been ordering studies and signing executive orders. But he has yet to introduce a major bill to the Republican-controlled Congress on any topic or win passage of someone elses that he supports. He has promised a big tax reform and tax reduction announcement on Wednesday. Some analysts said this may consist of a proposal to cut the corporate rate to 15 percent, cap the individual tax rate at 33 percent, repeal the estate and alternative minimum taxes and cut taxes for the middle class. In earlier days, Trump vowed to oversee the biggest tax reform since President Ronald Reagans in 1986, a legislative feat that has since defied every president. Wall Street analysts say Trump may instead offer a package of rate reductions, like those backed by Reagan in 1981 and President George W. Bush in 2001, which left the tax system intact.  If that is the case, it is not tax reform. It is a tax cut, Chris Krueger, analyst at financial firm Cowen & Co, said in a research note. On Wednesday, Krueger said, We will get some vague benchmarks about rate levels... with likely no detail on how to finance those reductions except for the assurance that the growth projections will take care of it. The announcement could also show whether Trump is turning away from a Republican plan backed by House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan that would pay for tax cuts with an import tax and by killing a business interest deduction. Ryan and other Republicans will get a preview of Trumps plan on Tuesday at a Capitol Hill meeting with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Gary Cohn, director of Trumps National Economic Council, aides said. Trumps announcement, however, could be a disappointment for investors seeking clarity.  I dont know that it will shed a great deal of light beyond what the administration has already said, noted Peter Cohn, analyst at financial firm Height Securities.

After stalling over the committee chairmans ties to President Donald Trumps White House and disagreements over who should testify, the bipartisan committee said it sent a letter inviting James Comey, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Admiral Mike Rogers, director of the National Security Agency, to appear behind closed doors on May 2. A second letter invited three officials who left the government as President Barack Obamas administration ended -  former CIA Director John Brennan, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates - to appear at a public hearing to be scheduled after May 2. The planned hearings are the first the committee has announced since its chairman, Republican Representative Devin Nunes, recused himself from the Russia investigation on April 6 after receiving information at the White House about surveillance that swept up some information about members of Trumps transition team. Echoing Trump, Nunes suggested that Obamas administration had handled that information incorrectly. Nunes remains the committees chairman. Comey and Rogers testified in a public hearing on March 20. At that hearing, Comey confirmed for the first time that the FBI was investigating possible ties between Trumps presidential campaign and Russia as Moscow sought to influence the election. Nunes was a supporter of Trumps campaign and a member of his transition team. His decision two days after the public hearing to hold a press conference about the information and discuss it with Trump before disclosing it to Democrats raised questions about whether he could lead a credible investigation. Committee Democrats also were angered when Nunes scrapped a scheduled public hearing with Brennan, Yates and Clapper. A planned closed hearing with Comey and Rogers also was put off. The House panel is examining whether Russia tried to influence the election in Trumps favor, mostly by hacking Democratic operatives emails and releasing embarrassing information, or possibly by colluding with Trump associates. Russia denies the allegations, which Trump also dismisses. The Senate Intelligence Committee is conducting a separate, similar investigation. Senate investigators currently are interviewing analysts and intelligence agents who prepared public and classified reports in January that concluded that Russia had interfered in last years election on Trumps behalf, an official familiar with the congressional activity said. At this point they are a long way from scheduling interviews or hearings with any principal witnesses from either the Obama or Trump administrations, the official said.

Trump, who has frequently criticized the cost to the United States of supporting the NATO alliance, took his concerns directly to the ambassadors of the U.N. Security Council, who joined him at the White House for a lunch. If we do a great job, I care much less about the budget because youre talking about peanuts compared to the important work youre doing, Trump told the 15 council envoys.  The United States is the biggest U.N. contributor, paying 22 percent of the $5.4 billion core budget and 28.5 percent of the $7.9 billion peacekeeping budget. These assessed contributions are agreed by the 193-member U.N. General Assembly. Trump said the U.S. share of those budgets was unfair.  He has proposed a 28 percent budget cut for diplomacy and foreign aid, which includes an unspecified reduction in funding for the United Nations and its agencies, as well as enforcement of a 25 percent cap on U.S. funding for peacekeeping operations.  We need the member states to come together to eliminate inefficiency and bloat and make sure that no one nation shoulders a disproportionate share of the burden, he said.  Trumps remarks came as the General Assembly prepares to negotiate in the coming months the U.N. regular budget for both 2018 and 2019 and the peacekeeping budget from July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres met briefly with Trump at the White House on Friday for the first time since both took office earlier this year. The United States currently owes the United Nations $896 million for its core budget, U.N. officials said. The United States is also reviewing 16 U.N. peacekeeping missions as the annual mandates come up for renewal by the Security Council in a bid to cut costs. U.N. agencies such as the U.N. Development Program (UNDP), the childrens agency UNICEF, and the U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA), are funded by governments voluntarily. The State Department said this month it was ending funding for UNFPA, the international bodys agency focused on family planning, as well as maternal and child health in more than 150 countries. Guterres warned that the cut could have devastating effects on vulnerable women and girls. In 2016, the United States was the top contributor to the UNDPs core budget, with an $83 million donation; the leading donor to UNICEFs core budget in 2015 with $132 million; and the fourth-largest donor to the UNFPA, giving $75 million.

This builds on previous executive actions thathave cleared the way for job-creating pipelines, innovations in energy production, and reduced unnecessary burden on energy producers, the official said on condition of anonymity.   On Wednesday, Trump is expected to sign an executive order related to the 1906 Antiquities Act, which enables the president to designate federal areas of land and water as national monuments to protect them from drilling, mining and development, the source said. On Friday, Trump is expected to sign an order to review areas available for offshore oil and gas exploration, as well as rules governing offshore drilling. The new measures would build on a number of energy- and environment-related executive orders signed by Trump seeking to gut most of the climate change regulations put in place by predecessor President Barack Obama. A summary of the forthcoming orders, seen by Reuters, say past administrations overused the Antiquities Act, putting more federal areas under protection than necessary. Obama had used the Antiquities Act more than any other president, his White House said in December, when he designated over 1.6 million acres of land in Utah and Nevada as national monuments, protecting two areas rich in Native American artifacts from mining, oil and gas drilling. The summary also says previous administrations have been overly restrictive of offshore drilling. Late in Obamas second term, he banned new drilling in federal waters in parts of the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans using a 1950s-era law that environmental groups say would require a drawn out court challenge to reverse. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said during his January confirmation hearing that Trump could amend Obamas monument designations but any move to rescind a designation would immediately be challenged. Last month, Trump signed an order calling for a review of Obamas Clean Power Plan, and reversed a ban on coal leasing on federal lands. In addition to the energy-related orders, Trump is also expected this week to sign an order to create an office of accountability in the Veterans Affairs department.

The mind cannot fathom the pain, the horror and the loss. Six million Jews, two-thirds of the Jews in Europe, murdered by the Nazi genocide. They were murdered by an evil that words cannot describe, and that the human heart cannot bear, Trump said in a speech to the World Jewish Congress Plenary Assembly in New York on Yom HaShoah, Israels Holocaust Remembrance Day.  On Yom HaShoah, we look back at the darkest chapter of human history, Trump added. We mourn, we remember, we pray, and we pledge: Never again. In January, on international Holocaust Remembrance Day, a Trump administration statement failed to mention Jews, the overwhelming majority of those who were killed in concentration camps under Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler. Earlier this month, White House spokesman Sean Spicer triggered an uproar when he said Hitler did not sink to the level of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad by using chemical weapons. [nL1N1HJ1YK] Spicer later apologized after his comments aroused criticism on social media and elsewhere for overlooking the fact that millions of Jews were killed in Nazi gas chambers.

The escalated push to get Trumps priorities, which Democrats reject, into spending legislation could jeopardize prospects for an agreement to keep the government open. If talks fail, the government would shut down on Saturday, Trumps 100th day in office. Obamacare is in serious trouble. The Dems need big money to keep it going - otherwise it dies far sooner than anyone would have thought, the Republican president said in a Twitter post. In a second tweet, he added: The Democrats dont want money from budget going to border wall despite the fact that it will stop drugs and very bad MS 13 gang members.  MS-13 is a criminal gang with members of Central American origin.  The presidents tweets appeared after White House budget director Mick Mulvaney accused Democrats of holding hostage national security by opposing $1.5 billion to help build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, one of Trumps top campaign pledges.  Democrats have said they would not support legislation that ends federal subsidies to help low-income people buy health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. The healthcare law was former Democratic President Barack Obamas signature domestic policy achievement, which Republicans are trying to repeal and replace. On Sunday, Democrats called for Trump to stop making poison pill demands.     Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said negotiations between Democrats and Republicans in both the House of Representatives and the Senate were going quite well and that he was hopeful a deal could be reached. The only fly in the ointment is that the president is being a little heavy handed, and mixing in and asking for things such as the wall, Schumer told reporters. Wed ask him to let us do our work, not throw in some last-minute poison pills that could undo it, and we could get this done, he said. Trump wants money for the wall included in spending legislation that Congress must pass by Friday to keep the federal government operating through Sept. 30, when the 2017 fiscal year expires. Mulvaney and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus played down the danger of a shutdown. Mulvaney said talks between Republicans and Democrats could produce an agreement as early as Sunday. Im pretty confident were going to get something thats satisfactory to the president in regard to border security within the current negotiations, Priebus said on NBCs Meet the Press. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said Trump had been clear about his desire for a wall. I would suspect he will be insistent on the funding, he told CNNs State of the Union. The White House is expected to address another Trump campaign promise this week with a Wednesday announcement on tax reform that Mulvaney said would offer governing principles, some guidance, also some indication of what the rates will be. But he said basic elements of the plan remained undecided, including whether to have deficit-funded tax cuts that would not be permanent. You can either have a small tax cut thats permanent, or a large tax cut that is short term, he said. In a tweet on Saturday, Trump promised that a Big TAX REFORM AND TAX REDUCTION will be announced next Wednesday. Legislative text on tax reform is not expected until June, Mulvaney said.    Spending legislation will require Democratic support to clear the Senate, and the White House says it has offered to include $7 billion in Obamacare subsidies to help low-income Americans pay for health insurance, if Democrats accept funding for the wall. Democrats showed no sign of softening their opposition to wall funding on Sunday and sought to place responsibility for any shutdown squarely on Trump and Republicans who control the House of Representatives and the Senate.   The Democrats do not support the wall, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi told NBCs Meet the Press. The wall is, in my view, immoral, expensive, unwise.

The rise in piracy attacks has at least partially been driven by famine and drought in the region, the top U.S. military commander overseeing troops in Africa said during Mattis visit as part of a week-long trip to the Middle East and Africa.  The United States uses the base in Djibouti, a tiny country the size of Wales at the southern entrance to the Red Sea, as a launch pad for operations in Yemen and Somalia. The sudden string of attacks by Somali pirates comes after years without a reported incident. Attacks peaked with 237 in 2011 but then declined steeply after ship owners improved security measures and international naval forces stepped up patrols. This month has seen a new rash of attacks, with two ships captured and a third rescued by Indian and Chinese forces after the crew radioed for help and locked themselves in a safe room. The bottom line is there have been a half dozen or so(incidents), Marine General Thomas Waldhauser said at a press conference standing alongside Mattis. Were not ready to say there is a trend there yet but well continue to watch, he said, adding one reason for the increase was famine and droughts in the region since some vessels targeted were carrying food and oil. According to the U.N. World Food Programme more than 20 million people from Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen are at risk of dying from starvation within the next six months.  In South Sudan alone, more than 100,000 people are suffering from famine with a further million on the brink of starvation. Mattis added that while the situation was being watched, he did not expect a U.S. military response to the surge in piracy. A U.S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said international shipping companies had started to become complacent about their security, which could also help explain the rise in piracy incidents. Djibouti is strategically important as it is on the route to the Suez Canal. The barren nation, sandwiched between Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia, also hosts Japanese and French bases. The U.S. base, which has about 4,000 personnel, is located just miles from a Chinese one, still under construction, which has caused concern to some U.S. officials.  Mattis visit to the base comes as the United States has been increasing pressure on militant groups such as al Shabaab in the region. The White House recently granted the U.S. military broader authority to strike al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab militants in Somalia. Waldhauser told reporters that he had not yet used the new authorities given to him by the White House. Al Shabaab has been able to carry out deadly bombings despite losing most of its territory to African Union peacekeepers supporting the Somali government. On Sunday, a military vehicle hit a roadside bomb in Somalias semi autonomous Puntland region on Sunday, killing at least six soldiers and injuring another eight. The United States recently sent a few dozen troops to Somalia to help train members of the Somali National Army. It is also carrying out strikes in Yemen against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). AQAP boasts one of the worlds most feared bomb makers, Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri, and it has been a persistent concern to the U.S. government ever since a 2009 attempt to blow up a Detroit-bound airliner on Christmas Day.

The eight-minute film allows viewers to experience what it is like to work as a park ranger trying to save elephants in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

The unexpected public appearance on Earth Day was one of several Clinton has made recently, following a period of silence after the former Democratic presidential candidate lost the November election to President Donald Trump.

More than 30,000 elephants are killed by poachers every year in Africa. In addition to endangering vulnerable elephant populations, trafficking also provides financial support to extremist militant groups, Clinton said. When we were looking at this, we thought there were three overriding goals: stop the killing, stop the trafficking and stop the demand, she said. While China is the worlds biggest market for illegal ivory, the United States ranks No. 2, Clinton said, requiring Americans to take a leading role in fighting elephant poaching. Clinton also mentioned the March for Science, which took place in Washington and other cities around the world earlier on Saturday. The Earth Day event was in effect a protest against what critics say has been the Trump administrations disregard for evidence-based knowledge and research. Here it is, Earth Day, and we are marching on behalf of science, Clinton said to applause in the theater. In early April, Clinton granted her first interview since her defeat by Trump, breaking her silence at the Women in the World Summit in New York. In front of a live audience, she voiced support for U.S. bombing raids on Syrian airfields and said Russian interference in the presidential election was a theft more damaging than Watergate.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""CHICAGO (Reuters) - Former U.S. President Barack Obama on Monday makes his first major appearance since leaving office, having chosen Chicago, the city where his political career started, to emerge from a three-month hiatus from the public eye. Obama will meet youth leaders and promote community organizing near the same South Side neighborhoods where his own activism blossomed and propelled him to two terms in the White House that ended with Donald Trumps inauguration on January 20.  Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who served as Obamas first White House chief of staff, said that he was proud that Obama picked Chicago to make his last speech as president and the first in his post-presidency. I think it reflects his emotional, as well as his intellectual, commitment to this city and seeing this city as his home, he said. Obamas continued connection to Chicago is important to the city, which has global aspirations as well as a palpable insecurity about its place in the world. During the last year of Obamas second term, Chicago laid claim to its share of his legacy by beating out Hawaii and New York as the site of his presidential library.  Obama, who still owns a home in Chicago, was raised in Hawaii. The former president and his wife Michelle are expected to move from Washington to New York once their younger daughter, Sasha, graduates from high school. David Axelrod, a former top political adviser to Obama, said the decision to house the library in Chicago should have eased any concerns that its residents may have had about the former Democratic presidents commitment to the city.  But Mondays event, he said, is another important sign of the former presidents strong links to Chicago. Hes going to be more visible moving forward, he said. I think this is clearly a coming-out. Reverend Michael Pfleger, a social justice activist who heads a large South Side Roman Catholic church, said a prominent Obama presence could help the nations third-largest city confront some of the thorny problems it faces.  Chief among them is a spike in gun violence, an issue that  Trump has highlighted as a sign of lawlessness and the failure of the Democratic politicians who have long run Chicago. Its his life, and hes not in elected office right now, so he can do what he wants, Pfleger said. But Id love to see him engage in his home of Chicago. He could make a huge difference. Civil Rights activist Jesse Jackson said Obama could use his powerful platform to address stark inequalities in Chicago schools, housing and employment, and to advocate for reinvestment in blighted neighborhoods. Mondays event takes place on the South Side campus of the University of Chicago, where Obama once taught constitutional law. It is intended to encourage and support the next generation of leaders driven by strengthening communities, according to a statement. Since leaving office, Obama has kept a relatively low public profile, taking vacations in Palm Springs, California and the British Virgin Islands, where he indulged in the sport of kite-boarding while vacationing with British billionaire Sir Richard Branson.  Together with his wife, who grew up on Chicagos South Side, the former president recently struck a two-book, $65 million memoir deal. He is expected to travel to Berlin to meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel next month. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump reassured manufacturers gathered in the White House Roosevelt room on March 31 that a massive infrastructure program was coming soon. Were going to make it happen this year, he said, according to Drew Greenblatt, the president of Marlin Steel in Baltimore, who was present. That was actually the first thing that he talked about behind closed doors with us, Greenblatt added. But putting a trillion-dollar infrastructure program to work could be easier said than done, as some of the projects suggested to the administration underscore. Project lists submitted by the North Americas Building Trades Unions and by an outside developer who helped with the transition both contain projects that infrastructure builders call shovel ready. But, for a range of reasons, shovel ready does not always mean ready for shovels to break ground. That means any effort to jump-start projects, put people to work and inject economic stimulus could drag on Trumps promise for a 10-year, $1 trillion infrastructure project After North Americas Building Trades Unions (NABTU) president Sean McGarvey met with Trump on January 23, the group submitted a total of 26 bridge, pipeline and water projects. A second list of 51 projects was assembled by Ohio developer Dan Slane, who assisted with the transition, including everything from inland waterways to ports to a new FBI headquarters. While details on Trumps plans are scant, a senior administration official said theyre looking for ways to shorten the lengthy permitting process. The current system has just lost its way, he said. Nine projects have garnered the support of both Slane and the NABTU, appearing on both lists; of those, seven have yet to start construction, and one has only done preliminary construction, highlighting how hard it is to launch infrastructure projects as quickly as Trump wants to do. The shovel ready moniker that they put on projects, its just rarely applicable, said Bill Miller, president and chief executive of two companies that overlap the two lists. The Power Company of Wyoming LLC is building the Chokecherry and Sierra Madre Wind Energy Project, and TransWest Express LLCis developing the TransWest Express Transmission Project, crossing Wyoming, Colorado, Utah and Nevada.  The Chokecherry and Sierra Madre wind project, which is being built in part on federal land, took eight years and tens of millions of dollars before it could recently start construction. The TransWest Express transmission project is still waiting for several state-level permits, Miller said. To be shovel ready is incredibly expensive and time consuming, Miller added. The administration says it wants to get ground broken fast. But some of that just might be out of the presidents hands, such as state-level permitting. A significant part of the presidents infrastructure plan will focus on streamlining regulating and permitting so that it is easier for all viable projects to move forward in a timely manner. These reforms might not be driven by the hurdles facing a single project, but rather will create more certainty in the process overall, a White House spokesperson told Reuters. The delays that have beset a desalination plant proposed by Poseidon Water, a developer of water-related infrastructure, in Huntington Beach, California illustrate how clashing interests and regulations can hold up projects. Poseidon first proposed the idea of a plant to turn salt water into drinking water for Orange County in the late 1990s and started permitting in the early 2000s, said Scott Maloni, a vice president at Poseidon and the Huntington Beach project manager. The city of Huntington Beach originally approved the project in February 2006. But Poseidon still needed to secure 24 permits from state agencies, such as approval from the Santa Ana Regional Water Quality Control Board for the plants national pollutant discharge elimination system, which is required by the Environmental Protection Agency.  After the city issued the necessary local approvals in 2006, project builder Poseidon was able to apply to the California Coastal Commission. That application was amended several times over the years as the project evolved. For example, the plant had to alter its design after the state began phasing out power plants that use seawater for cooling purposes. Poseidon had planned to desalinate that wastewater, and changed its design to instead take in water directly from the ocean instead. In 2013, Poseidon shelved the permit application after the states coastal commission directed the company to look into concerns about the effects of the operation on fish larva in the area. The application was resubmitted in 2015, and then withdrawn yet again in September 2016, because the commission wanted proof the plans complied with new, 2015-passed rules from the State Water Board on desalination plants.  That compelled Poseidon to redesign the plants seawater intake and discharge technologies. The project still needs three more approvals, from the State Lands Commission, the Santa Ana Regional Water Quality Control Board and the California Coastal Commission. Poseidon says theyre confident theyll secure the last approvals soon. But even then, construction might not start until the second quarter of 2018, Maloni said. And the objections from environmentalists havent stopped. The plant is far from a done deal, said Mandy Sackett, the California policy coordinator for the Surfrider Foundation. The foundation argues that the plant is unnecessary, expensive and energy-intensive, putting marine life at risk. Sackett said the foundation will continue to fight the project.  Theres still several opportunities for public input and important regulatory review that is yet to be completed, she said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Barrientos was injured in Afghanistan on March 17 when an Afghan soldier opened fire inside a base in Helmand province, wounding three U.S. soldiers. Barrientoss right leg was amputated, according to a White House official. The president put his hand on the sergeants shoulder and kissed the sergeants wife, Tammy, on the cheek.

In a Twitter message on Saturday, he wrote: Big TAX REFORM AND TAX REDUCTION will be announced next Wednesday. Asked for details, the administration official, who asked not to be identified, said, We will outline our broad principles and priorities on Wednesday. Trump has struggled as president to advance his domestic policy agenda, including on taxes, even though his Republican Party controls both chambers of Congress. With his 100th day in office only a week away, he has yet to offer any formal legislation or win passage of a major bill he favors. Most recent presidents had legislative wins under their belts by this time in their administrations. Under U.S. law, only Congress can make significant tax law changes, though the president often drives the tax agenda by offering legislation. The administration official said, We are moving forward on comprehensive tax reform that cuts tax rates for individuals, simplifies our overly complicated system and creates jobs by making American businesses competitive. As a candidate, Trump raised high expectations in financial markets and the business community for changes in the complex, loophole-riddled tax system. In his Contract with the American Voter, he vowed to work with Congress on tax legislation within the first 100 days of my administration. The action plan promised large tax cuts for the middle class and businesses, a reduction of tax brackets to three from seven, simplified tax forms and an offshore profits repatriation tax holiday. Since then, no legislation or formal tax plan has been presented by Trump. He has at times expressed support for a plan drawn up by House of Representatives Republicans, but his views are unclear on a section that deals with taxing imports. In February, Trump promised a phenomenal tax plan within a few weeks, without offering details. No plan followed. Last month when an attempt supported by Trump to repeal the healthcare law known as Obamacare collapsed in Congress, Trump said he would refocus on taxes.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice threatened on Friday to cut some funding to California as well as eight cities and counties across the United States, escalating a Trump administration crackdown on so-called sanctuary cities that do not cooperate with federal immigration authorities. President Donald Trump has vowed to strip federal funds from dozens of state and local governments that do not fully cooperate with U.S. immigration agents, arguing they endanger public safety when they decline to hand over for deportation illegal immigrants who are arrested for crimes.  Sanctuary cities in general offer safe harbor to illegal immigrants and often do not use municipal funds or resources to advance the enforcement of federal immigration laws.  Many of these localities say they do not have the funding or space to hold immigrants until federal agents can take custody of them.   Those threatened were: the state of California; New York City; Chicago; Philadelphia; Clark County, Nevada; New Orleans; Miami-Dade County, Florida; and Milwaukee County, Wisconsin. Cook County, Illinois, also received a warning, even though it did not get money from the Justice Department last year. The jurisdictions have until June 30 to provide evidence to the federal government that they are not violating any laws. At stake is roughly $29 million in law enforcement aid under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program, which helps local governments pay for everything from forensics labs to drug courts. The grants in question are among the largest handed out under the program, collectively amounting to 11 percent of the $256 million distributed in the last fiscal year.  In a statement, the Justice Department singled out Chicago and New York as two cities that are crumbling under the weight of illegal immigration and violent crime, even though New York City is experiencing its lowest crime levels in decades and experts say Chicagos recent spike in violent crime has little to do with illegal immigration.     Several state and local officials responded with defiance to the threat. New York is the safest big city in the country, with crime at record lows in large part because we have policies in place to encourage cooperation between NYPD and immigrant communities, said Seth Stein, a spokesman for New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.  In California, the state Senate approved a bill earlier this month to curb cooperation between police agencies and federal agents seeking to deport illegal immigrants. The measure is now in the state Assembly. It has become abundantly clear that Attorney General (Jeff) Sessions and the Trump administration are basing their law enforcement policies on principles of white supremacy - not American values, California Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin de Len, a Democrat, said in a statement on Friday.  A spokeswoman for the California Board of State and Community Corrections said some of the federal funding in question went to local communities after emergencies, including San Bernardino after a mass shooting there in 2015. Officials in Philadelphia, Milwaukee County and Cook County said they believed they were complying with immigration laws. Milwaukee County has its challenges but they are not caused by illegal immigration. My far greater concern is the proactive dissemination of misinformation, fear, and intolerance, said Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele. The Fraternal Order of Police, the largest police union, told Trump in a meeting last month that they were concerned the cuts could threaten public safety.

Some legal experts say the states realignment could signal that the changes made last month to Trumps original executive order have strengthened the governments case. Sixteen Democratic state attorneys general and the District of Colombia on Thursday filed a friend of the court brief backing Hawaii in its bid to block the March 6 executive order, which two federal judges put on hold before it could be implemented. Hawaii and other states argue the ban violates the U.S. Constitution because it discriminates against Muslims. But Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, who opposed the original ban that Trump signed on Jan. 27, did not join Thursdays brief, which was filed in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. Shapiro declined to comment.  On the other side, Texas, which had been alone in its support for the original January order, has gained the support of 14 Republican states urging that the ban go forward in a legal brief filed on April 10. Those states back the governments argument that the president has wide authority to implement immigration policy and that the ban is needed to prevent terrorist attacks. Trumps original ban, which the president said was needed for national security to head off attacks by Islamist militants, applied to seven Muslim-majority nations and indefinitely banned the entry of all refugees from Syria. It was revised and narrowed after a flurry of legal challenges. The second executive order was much more carefully written than the first. Maybe when various states analyzed it they werent as interested as joining, said Stephen Yale-Loehr an immigration expert at Cornell University Law School. However, he said, amicus briefs sometimes are filed for political reasons.  Some judges pay close attention to amicus briefs, while others disregard them. The U.S. Department of Justice declined to comment. Trumps January order was hastily implemented just days after his inauguration, leading to chaos and protests at airports and more than two dozen lawsuits. A federal judge in Seattle halted the order and the 9th circuit upheld that ruling. The White House re-crafted the order to exclude legal permanent residents and removed Iraq from the list of targeted countries. Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen are still included in the new order. The new ban also dropped language giving preference to refugees who are part of a persecuted religious minority in their country of citizenship. The changes were meant to chip away at the plaintiffs standing to sue, which requires that anyone bringing a lawsuit show they have been directly harmed by the action they are contesting.  But as soon as the second order was signed, states and civil rights groups went back to court, saying that it was still discriminatory.  Federal district judges in Maryland and Hawaii put the second order on hold before it could take effect on March 16.  The judge in Hawaii blocked the two central sections of the ban, on travel and refugees, while the Maryland judge only halted the travel portion.  Most of the focus is now on the Hawaii case, which is being heard by the 9th Circuit on May 15.  The 4th Circuit appeals court in Virginia is slated to hear arguments in the Maryland case on May 8.  Not all states have staked out a side in the fight. Pennsylvania now is among 18 states, including Michigan, Ohio, and New Jersey that have not taken sides on the issue, opting not to file any legal briefs.

He had grown up in Chennai, India, and had a solid job offer with a large oil company after getting his undergraduate degree. He came to America instead, got the Stanford degree and now works as an engineer at a data science startup in Silicon Valley. But for the past five years, he has been waiting for a green card that would give him full legal rights as a permanent resident. In the meantime, he is in a holding pattern on an H1-B visa, which permits him to live and work in the United States but does not allow him easily to switch jobs or start his own company. It was a no-brainer when I came to this country, but now Im kind of regretting taking that scholarship, said Gunasekaran, 29, who is also vice president with a non-profit group called Immigration Voice that represents immigrants waiting for green cards.  Immigration Voice estimates there are some 1.5 million H1-B visa holders in the country waiting for green cards, many of whom are from India and have been waiting for more than a decade. Many of these immigrants welcomed President Donald Trumps executive order this week to the federal departments overseeing the program to review it, a move that may lead to H1-B visas being awarded to the highest-paying, highest-skilled jobs rather than through a random lottery. Their hope is that merit-based H1-Bs might then lead to merit-based green cards. I think less random is great, said Guru Hariharan, the CEO and founder of Boomerang Commerce, an e-commerce startup. Hariharan, who was previously an executive at Amazon.com Inc and eBay Inc, spent 10 years waiting for his green card and started his own company as soon as he got it. Green cards can be a path to naturalization and Hariharan expects to become a U.S. citizen soon. H1-B visas are aimed at foreign nationals in occupations that generally require specialized knowledge, such as science, engineering or computer programming. The U.S. government uses a lottery to award 65,000 such visas yearly and randomly distributes another 20,000 to graduate student workers. The H1-B and the green card system are technically separate, but many immigrants from India see them as intimately connected. The number of green cards that can go to people born in each country is capped at a few percent of the total, without regard to how large or small the countrys population is. There is a big backlog of Indian-born people in the line, given the size of Indias population - 1.3 billion - and the number of its natives in the United States waiting for green cards. That leaves many of those immigrants stuck on H1-B visas while they wait, which they say makes them almost like indentured servants, said Gaurav Mehta, an H1-B holder who works in the financial industry.  Mehta has a U.S.-born son, but he could be forced to take his family back to India at any time if he loses his job and cannot find another quickly. Hes never been to my country, Mehta said of his son. But well have no choice if we have to go. Nobody likes to live in constant fear.  The H1-B visa is tied to a specific employer, who must apply for the visa and sponsor the employee for a specific job laid out in the visa application. To switch employers, the visa holder must secure their paperwork from their current employer and find another employer willing to take over their visa. Some H1-B holders suspect that employers purposely seek out Indian immigrants because they know they will end up waiting for green cards and will be afraid to leave their employers. But changing the green card system away from country caps to a merit-based system would require an act of Congress. Some  executives also worry that allocating H1-Bs and green cards based on salary - while it would be done to counter the argument that immigrants undercut American workers - would hurt startups that cannot afford high wages. In the meantime, H1-B holders like Nitin Pachisia, founding partner of a venture capital firm called Unshackled Ventures, are taking more practical measures. His firm specializes in taking care of the legal paperwork so that H1-B holders can start their own companies, a process that is possible but tricky. Pachisia is hopeful that changes to the H1-B visa program could revive interest in making the entire system, from H1-B visas to green cards and eventual citizenship, more merit-based and focused on immigrants who are likely to start companies and create jobs. If the purpose of our high-skilled immigration program is to bring in the most talented people, lets use that as a lens. From that perspective, its a good thing we can focus on the most talented, and Id say most entrepreneurial, people, he said.

(Reuters) - The United States will not make an exception for American companies, including oil major Exxon Mobil Corp, seeking to drill in areas prohibited by U.S. sanctions on Russia, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Friday. The unusually direct statement served to clarify that the United States would maintain a tough stance on sanctions against Moscow.  In consultation with President Donald J. Trump, the Treasury Department will not be issuing waivers to U.S. companies, including Exxon, authorizing drilling prohibited by current Russian sanctions, Mnuchin said in a statement. The United States and European Union imposed economic sanctions on Russia over its annexation of the Crimea region in 2014 and its role in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. The sanctions forced Exxon, the worlds largest publicly traded oil producer, to wind down drilling in Russias Arctic in 2014. We understand the statement today by Secretary Mnuchin in consultation with President Trump, Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers said. Exxon had asked for and received in 2015 and 2016 waivers to operate a joint venture with Russian oil producer Rosneft in Russia. European Union sanctions do not keep European oil companies from operating in Russia, a point of annoyance for Exxon. The Wall Street Journal reported this week that Exxon had in recent months applied for a Treasury Department waiver to drill with Rosneft. Jeffers said Exxon had not applied for waivers from Treasury since Trump took office. Any such request would have drawn attention because Exxons former chief executive, Rex Tillerson, is now U.S. secretary of state. Under his leadership, Exxon lobbied Congress on Russia sanctions, and Tillerson opposed sanctions against Russia in 2014, saying they would be ineffective. U.S. lawmakers are investigating possible ties between some Trump campaign aides and Moscow. Republicans in Congress as well as U.S. allies in Europe are anxious about any sign that the Trump administration might ease some of the sanctions imposed on Russia. During his confirmation hearing in January, Tillerson said he never personally lobbied against sanctions and that he was not aware of Exxon Mobil directly doing so, later acknowledging that he spoke to former U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew regarding gaps between American and European sanctions on Russia. Tillerson has pledged to recuse himself until the end of this year from any matter involving Exxon Mobil unless he is authorized to participate. He also has until early May to sell his Exxon Mobil stock. U.S. companies frequently file license applications to the Treasury Department asking permission to undertake activities that would otherwise be barred by sanctions. The U.S. government weighs each application based on national security interests, the law and other factors. The refusal is unlikely to affect Exxon Mobils bottom line, as it has not been able to operate in Russia for several years, but it does hinder its growth potential. Treasury almost never comments publicly on license applications. Mnuchins statement will likely serve to clarify the U.S. stance on sanctions against Russia at a time when American allies are looking for clues to U.S. policy, observers said. Its good from a regulatory perspective as it provides clarity to U.S. companies, but its also great from a foreign policy perspective, Edward Fishman, a fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank and former State Department official during the Obama administration, said of Mnuchins statement. Any uncertainty about the future of sanctions scares our allies and encourages Russia to prolong its aggression in Ukraine. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the Treasury Department on Friday to examine two powers given to regulators to police large financial companies following the 2008 financial crisis, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said. In his first visit to the Treasury building, Trump signed two memos that analysts view as largely affirming existing priorities he has outlined. One temporarily bars regulators from identifying new non-bank financial institutions as systemically important financial institutions, or SIFIs, while also ordering a review of this process, Mnuchin said in a briefing with reporters. SIFIs face added regulatory oversight and must hold more capital as a buffer against losses to safeguard against risk to the financial system. The other memo directs regulators to temporarily halt the use of orderly liquidation authority to dissolve troubled financial institutions unless the president directs it in an emergency. Trump will order a review of this as well, Mnuchin said. Still, the government has never attempted to use its orderly liquidation authority. The memo directs the Treasury to review the authority for 180 days, focusing on whether it exposes taxpayers to losses and encourages companies to take on more risk, or whether a revamped bankruptcy process would be preferable.  Critics, including Republicans in Congress, argue the authority effectively gives some firms too big to fail status, which could encourage them to take on more risk and necessitate government intervention if they fail. Trump has long said financial sector oversight could curb economic growth. While the two memos indicate that revisiting the rules remains a priority, they overlap with an earlier executive order the president signed in February directing a review of all financial rules. The impact of the memos may be limited. Mnuchin had previously said his team was already looking into both the SIFI designation process and the use of orderly liquidation. The Trump administration has been expected to reduce the number of companies subject to SIFI-level policing. Only two insurers, American International Group Inc (AIG.N) and Prudential Financial Inc (PRU.N), are designated as SIFIs because they pose a systemic threat to the financial system. Banks with more than $50 billion in assets such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) and Bank of America (BAC.N) are automatically designated as SIFIs by law.  Republicans, who have criticized the SIFI process as opaque and arbitrary, have introduced legislation to curb it. The Financial Stability Oversight Council, a panel of top regulators that Mnuchin now chairs, oversees the process.  The president will be instructing me to put a hold on that for designations until we do a thorough review and make sure that its a fair and transparent process, said Mnuchin.

The Department of Justice threatens to cut off funding to California as well as eight cities and counties across the United States, escalating a Trump administration crackdown on so-called sanctuary cities that do not cooperate with federal immigration authorities. The United States will not make an exception for American companies, including oil major Exxon Mobil Corp, seeking to drill in areas prohibited by U.S. sanctions on Russia, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says.  Trump and his fellow Republicans who control Congress face their first major budget test next week, with the threat of a government shutdown potentially hinging on his proposed Mexican border wall as well as Obamacare funding.

Trump is looking for his first major legislative victory since taking office in January. House of Representatives Republicans are exploring compromises aimed at satisfying the partys most conservative members without antagonizing its moderates, but it remained unclear on Friday whether a viable bill would emerge. Trump on Friday played down the need for Congress to act on the legislation before he reaches his 100th day in office next weekend, telling reporters, Well see what happens - no particular rush. Trump on Thursday had predicted a good chance of getting it soon, either next week or shortly thereafter. On Friday, he said it doesnt matter if its next week. Congress, returning from a recess next week, also will be working against the clock to pass legislation to keep the government funded past April 28 and avert a federal shutdown. Healthcare legislation did not appear on the schedule released on Friday by House Republican leaders of bills to be considered next week. Were going to get it done when its appropriate in terms of getting to that 216, White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters, referring to the vote total needed for House passage before the bill goes to the Senate. Trumps party cannot afford defections because Democrats remain unified against the Republican quest to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, Democratic former President Barack Obamas signature domestic policy achievement, dubbed Obamacare. Trump campaigned on a pledge to discard Obamacare. In a stinging setback for Trump, Speaker Paul Ryan pulled the legislation from the House floor on March 24 before allowing it to come to a vote amid a revolt by conservatives in a faction called the House Freedom Caucus and moderates unhappy with concessions to the conservatives. Republicans have called Obamacare a government overreach. The law enabled 20 million Americans to obtain insurance, many through an expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor. A senior House Republican aide said it was not clear whether a revamped Republican plan can attract 216 votes, adding that without a legislative text it was impossible to do a vote count to assess its chances. Moderate Republican Representative Tom MacArthur is pushing a proposal to allow states to waive some Obamacare provisions. MacArthurs office said he has discussed it with other Republican lawmakers, the House leadership and the White House. No text has emerged, but an outline of his proposal said states could seek to relax essential benefits that Obamacare requires insurance plans to cover, such as emergency room trips, maternity and newborn care, and mental health services. States also could request waivers to Obamacares ban on insurers charging sick customers higher premiums than healthy customers. But states would have to establish high-risk pools using government funds to help pay for insurance for people with costly medical conditions. Representative Rodney Davis told CNN on Friday he did not know what was in the deal, but added, Im not going to be for a plan that is going to allow for pre-existing conditions to not be covered. MacArthur and Davis are members of the centrist House Republican Tuesday Group. Freedom Caucus member Representative Dave Brat told CNN the new proposal gives states more say healthcare but was the same fundamental bill that collapsed last month. The Republican plan, as written last month, would end the Medicaid expansion, let states impose work requirements on some Medicaid recipients, rescind a range of Obamacare taxes, get rid of a penalty on people who refuse to obtain insurance, and ditch Obamacares income-based subsidies to help people buy insurance while creating less-generous age-based tax credits. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office forecast the earlier version of the plan would increase by 24 million the number of Americans without medical insurance by 2026. During a Thursday conference call with House Democrats, their leader, Nancy Pelosi, urged them to remain united against the Republican legislation, saying it would increase healthcare costs and provide less insurance coverage, an aide who was on the telephone call said.

(Reuters) - A Florida state senator resigned on Friday after coming under pressure for yelling obscenities and racial slurs inside a lounge frequented by lawmakers at the state capital in Tallahassee. Senator Frank Artiles, a Republican from Miami-Dade County, made the comments on Monday night to two Democratic senators, both of whom are black, at the members-only Governors Club, the Miami Herald reported on Tuesday. I am responsible and I am accountable and effective immediately, I am resigning from the Florida State Senate, Artiles wrote in a resignation letter delivered to the state Senate Majority Leader Joe Negron on Friday. Artiles yelled at Democratic Senator Audrey Gibson, who earlier that day had questioned some bills Artiles sponsored, according to the Miami Herald. He called the Jacksonville senator a bitch and a girl. Artiles also called Democrat Perry Thurston, a black senator from Fort Lauderdale, an asshole. He also said Negron had risen to majority leader because of the support of six Republican senators he called niggas, the newspaper reported. Artiles on Wednesday apologized on the state Senate floor. He did not directly mention the comments he made on Monday night, but admitted he made offensive comments. Thurston on Thursday filed a formal complaint to have Artiles expelled from the legislative body. He could not be reached for comment on Friday. Gibson issued a statement on Friday, saying, This has been an ordeal that no one should have to endure. On Tuesday, Negron said in a statement that he has been informed of Artiles comments by the senates minority leader, Democrat Oscar Braynon. Racial slurs and profane, sexist insults have no place in conversation between senators and will not be tolerated, Negrons statement said. Public protests followed, including one at Artiles Miami-area headquarters where signs were posted on his office windows demanding that he resign. Artiles, a former Marine, was elected in November to the senate after serving six years in the Florida House of Representatives. My actions and my presence in government is now a distraction to my colleagues, the legislative process and the citizens of our great state, he said in his resignation letter.

Trump and his aides had engaged in behind-the-scenes diplomatic efforts to gain her freedom after attempts by the previous Obama administration failed. She was released from jail on Tuesday after nearly three years of detention on human trafficking charges. Aides said Trump had personally requested her release in a meeting April 3 with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi but had done so privately and made no public mention of her case. Hijazi, 30, sat next to Trump in the Oval Office for a meeting that also included Trumps daughter, Ivanka Trump, her husband, Jared Kushner, and Dina Powell, the top White House aide who accompanied her home on a U.S. military jet on Thursday. Ivanka Trump and Kushner are top advisers to the president. We are very happy to have Aya back home and its a great honor to have her in the Oval Office, with her brother, Trump said, declining to answer questions about her case.  Hijazi was accompanied by her brother, Basel. Hijazi, an Egyptian who holds U.S. citizenship, was acquitted by a Cairo court on Sunday along with seven others who had worked with street children. Hijazi, 30, was flown to Joint Base Andrews, the U.S. military airfield near Washington. She founded Belady, a non-governmental organization that promotes a better life for street children. She had been in custody for 33 months in violation of Egyptian law, which states that the maximum period for pretrial detention is 24 months.  U.S. officials had raised Hijazis case with Egypt soon after Trump took office on Jan. 20, aides said. Pressed on how Trump managed to gain her release when President Barack Obama had not, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said he would leave it to others to look at the different strategies to see why the president was successful and Obama was not. Critics had accused the Obama administration of indifference to her case. Since toppling President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood in mid-2013, Sisis government has cracked down on the opposition, killing hundreds of Brotherhood supporters and jailing thousands. The net has widened to include liberal and secular activists.  Two Republican U.S. senators, John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, called on the Egyptian government to take more steps to improve human rights. We urge the Government of Egypt to build on this important first step by releasing all those who have been wrongly imprisoned, upholding its international human rights obligations, and respecting the Egyptian peoples right to freedom of expression and rule of law, they said in a statement.

The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago dismissed arguments that Blagojevich deserved a lesser punishment because he had been a model prisoner in the five years he has already spent in prison and because some counts in his original 2011 conviction had been thrown out. Fridays 3-0 decision came three days after oral arguments, suggesting little or no disagreement. It likely ends Blagojevichs chances at shortening his sentence. The one-time contestant on Donald Trumps Celebrity Apprentice could ask the entire 7th Circuit or the U.S. Supreme Court to review his case, but both are long shots. Leonard Goodman, a lawyer for Blagojevich, did not respond to requests for comment. He told the Chicago Tribune the decision was incredibly sad and disappointing. The office of acting U.S. Attorney Joel Levin in Chicago declined to comment. Blagojevich, 60, was convicted on charges including wire fraud, extortion and soliciting bribes while governor. He served from January 2003 to January 2009, when the Illinois Senate removed him from office. Prosecutors said Blagojevich solicited campaign contributions in exchange for raising pediatric reimbursement rates and legislation supporting Illinois horse racing industry. Blagojevich also tried to sell or trade the Senate seat that Obama vacated after winning the 2008 U.S. presidential election, prosecutors said. The appeals court in 2015 voided five of Blagojevichs 18 convictions and ordered a resentencing, but U.S. District Judge James Zagel in Chicago reimposed the 14-year term last August. Zagel acknowledged the pain Blagojevichs family was suffering but said the punishment reflected federal guidelines and that the fault lies with the governor. In Fridays decision, Circuit Judge Frank Easterbrook said Zagel acted within his discretion. Blagojevichs treatment of fellow inmates may show that outside of office he is an admirable person, but the court was entitled to impose punishment that reflects how Blagojevich behaved when he had a different menu of opportunities and to deter those who hold office today, Easterbrook wrote. Easterbrook also said the Supreme Courts voiding last June of former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnells bribery convictions did not undermine Blagojevichs conviction. Blagojevich is housed in a low-security prison in Littleton, Colorado, and eligible for release in May 2024. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will order the Treasury on Friday to find and reduce tax burdens and review post-financial crisis reforms that banks and insurance companies have said hinder their ability to do business. A White House official said on Thursday that Trump will issue an executive order directing the Treasury on the tax issues. He will also issue two memoranda asking for reviews of two parts of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law -  the Orderly Liquidation Authority that sets out how big banks can wind down during a crisis and the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), which is made up of the countrys top regulators. The orders, which Trump will sign at the Treasury Department, next door to the White House, comes as the president works toward making good on a major campaign promise to lower taxes.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will review significant tax regulations issued in 2016 to determine if any impose an undue financial burden on American taxpayers, add undue complexity or exceed statutory authority, the officials statement said. Mnuchin said earlier on Thursday that Treasury is working on tax reform day and night and will soon create a sweeping overhaul. Congress recently failed in efforts to make good another Trump campaign promise to reform healthcare. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said this week that the countrys first tax overhaul in decades may not be done until well into 2017. The review that Trump is ordering gives the administration a way to approach the issue independent of Congress. The liquidation authority and the FSOC were both created as part of the Dodd-Frank law intended to prevent a repeat of the 2007-09 financial crisis, when the U.S. government injected billions of dollars in aid into failing banks to keep them from destroying the countrys economy. In February Trump ordered a review of the law, saying he wanted to cut out much of it, and Mnuchin has said he would like to look into how the council, which he chairs, works.  House Republicans are also working to loosen Dodd-Frank regulations. Banks say the regulations have hurt their liquidity and created burdensome processes. Trump will order an assessment of how the FSOC designates a financial institution as systemically important, which triggers requirements to hold more capital in case it comes into crisis. Republican lawmakers say the FSOC uses a flawed process lacking transparency to designate non-bank institutions. Only two insurers, American International Group Inc and Prudential Financial Inc, currently carry the label, and a judge last year struck down the councils designation of MetLife Inc. Mnuchin will have 180 days to report to Trump on the liquidation authority, a tool for federal banking regulators to use if they need to step in during a financial emergency and help a failing bank unwind. The report will offer views on using bankruptcy as an alternative, the impact of failing companies on financial stability, and whether the authority could drive up taxpayer costs or encourage excessive risk-taking.

They described two confidential documents from the think tank as providing the framework and rationale for what U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded was an intensive effort by Russia to interfere with the Nov. 8 election. U.S. intelligence officials acquired the documents, which were prepared by the Moscow-based Russian Institute for Strategic Studies [en.riss.ru/], after the election. The institute is run by retired senior Russian foreign intelligence officials appointed by Putins office.  The first Russian institute document was a strategy paper written last June that circulated at the highest levels of the Russian government but was not addressed to any specific individuals. It recommended the Kremlin launch a propaganda campaign on social media and Russian state-backed global news outlets to encourage U.S. voters to elect a president who would take a softer line toward Russia than the administration of then-President Barack Obama, the seven officials said.  A secondinstitute document, drafted in October and distributed in the same way, warned that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was likely to win the election. For that reason, it argued, it was better for Russia to end its pro-Trump propaganda and instead intensify its messaging about voter fraud to undermine the U.S. electoral systems legitimacy and damage Clintons reputation in an effort to undermine her presidency, the seven officials said. The current and former U.S. officials spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the Russian documents classified status. They declined to discuss how the United States obtained them. U.S. intelligence agencies also declined to comment on them. Putin has denied interfering in the U.S. election. Putins spokesman and the Russian institute did not respond to requests for comment.  The documents were central to the Obama administrations conclusion that Russia mounted a fake news campaign and launched cyber attacks against Democratic Party groups and Clintons campaign, the current and former officials said. Putin had the objective in mind all along, and he asked the institute to draw him a road map, said one of the sources, a former senior U.S. intelligence official.  Trump has said Russias activities had no impact on the outcome of the race. Ongoing congressional and FBI investigations into Russian interference have so far produced no public evidence that Trump associates colluded with the Russian effort to change the outcome of the election. Four of the officials said the approach outlined in the June strategy paper was a broadening of an effort the Putin administration launched in March 2016. That month the Kremlin instructed state-backed media outlets, including international platforms Russia Today and Sputnik news agency, to start producing positive reports on Trumps quest for the U.S. presidency, the officials said.  Russia Today did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Sputnik dismissed the assertions by the U.S. officialsthat it participated in a Kremlin campaign as an absolute pack of lies. And by the way, its not the first pack of lies were hearing from sources in U.S. official circles, the spokesperson said in an email. PRO-KREMLIN BLOGGERS Russia Today and Sputnik published anti-Clinton stories while pro-Kremlin bloggers prepared a Twitter campaign calling into question the fairness of an anticipated Clinton victory, according to a report by U.S. intelligence agencies on Russian interference in the election made public in January.

[bit.ly/2os8wIt] The report said Russia Today and Sputnik consistently cast president elect-Trump as the target of unfair coverage from traditional media outlets.  The report said the agencies did not assess whether Moscows effort had swung the outcome of the race in Trumps favor, because American intelligence agencies do not analyze U.S. political processes or U.S. public opinion. [bit.ly/2kMiKSA] Neither of the Russian institute documents mentioned the release of hacked Democratic Party emails to interfere with the U.S. election, according to four of the officials. The officials said the hacking was a covert intelligence operation run separately out of the Kremlin. The overt propaganda and covert hacking efforts reinforced each other, according to the officials. Both Russia Today and Sputnik heavily promoted the release of the hacked Democratic Party emails, which often contained embarrassing details. Five of the U.S. officials described the institute as the Kremlins in-house foreign policy think tank.  The institutes director when the documents were written, Leonid Reshetnikov, rose to the rank of lieutenant general during a 33-year-career in Russias foreign intelligence service, according to the institutes website [bit.ly/2oVhiCF]. After Reshetnikov retired from the institute in January, Putin named as his replacement Mikhail Fradkov. The institute says he served as the director of Russias foreign intelligence service from 2007 to 2016. [bit.ly/2os4tvz] Reuters was unable to determine if either man was directly involved in the drafting of the documents. Reshetnikovs office referred questions to the Russian institute.

Fresh from gaining a masters degree in Europe, and with an offer of employment from a well-known U.S. design firm, she was well on her way to fulfilling the ambition of many young Indian IT workers - a dream job in America. But as she waits in the H-1B visa queue for the green light, she is caught in a bind. Its a weird time to be applying, with all the scrutiny, said Grishma, who gave only her first name for fear of jeopardizing her chances of getting a visa. The United States has already suspended the expedited processing option for applicants, under which she may have received a visa in weeks. More broadly, uncertainty over the review announced this week has unsettled Grishma and many others like her. She will have to wait until at least around August to learn her fate, but having accepted the U.S. job offer she is not in a position to apply for positions elsewhere, including in Europe. Its pretty debilitating, Grishma told Reuters. Id like to start work to mitigate the financial damage. Trumps decision was not a huge surprise, given his election campaign pledge to put American jobs first. But the executive order he signed, though vague in many areas, has prompted thousands of foreign workers already in the United States or applying for visas to work there to re-think their plans. Companies who send them also face huge uncertainty. The concerns are particularly acute in India, where IT firms like Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd are top beneficiaries of the H-1B visa programme, using it to send computer engineers to service clients in the United States, their largest overseas market. Experts say Trumps order to review visa processes is aimed at firms like TCS, Infosys and Wipro, which from 2005-14 snagged around 86,000 H-1B visas, roughly equivalent to the number of H-1B visas the United States issues in total each year. Two industry sources said Infosys, Indias No. 2 information technology (IT) services company, is applying for just under 1,000 H-1B visas this year, which one of the sources said was down from 6,500 applications in 2016 and some 9,000 in 2015. It was not clear whether the sharp reduction in 2017 was in direct response to Trumps presidency, although the company has said for some time it wanted to cut dependence on fly-in staff. TCS, Infosys and Wipro said they would not share data on the number of H-1B visas they had applied for this year. With fewer visas going to Infosys, more might become available for smaller IT companies and big U.S. tech companies, like Facebook and Microsoft Corp, that typically send in fewer H-1B applications each year. U.S.-based immigration lawyer Murali Bashyam, managing partner of Bashyam Spiro LLP which advises and works with small to mid-sized Indian IT firms, said clients had been in contact seeking clarity, while the number of visa applicants had fallen. I think the reason for that is they get the sense that its going to get so much tougher to comply with all of the changes ... that it might not be worth their money, he said. There is a fear that radical immigration changes are coming, and if those radical immigration changes come then it could completely change the way IT staffing companies do business. Bashyam said the number of people on H-1B visas already working in the United States who were considering returning to their home country had risen. An engineer working at Cisco, who has been in the United States since 2011, said that three months ago he would not have considered returning to India. But the review of the visa system, and any rule change that revoked the right for his wife to work in the United States on a dependent visa, could force him to change his mind. If that happens, then I would definitely be interested in going back to India. Even though Im secure, I dont want to be in a situation where my wife cannot work, said the engineer, who declined to be named. Those who have heavily invested here, whove bought houses, property and are still on visas, are afraid. According to Bashyam, some Indians on H-1B visas were cancelling plans to return home to visit their families in case they had problems getting back into the United States. With everything thats going on, traveling outside the U.S. is the biggest fear for a lot of the H-1B workers working in the IT staffing industry, he said. And the uncertainty is not limited to IT. Trumps campaign rhetoric around tighter visa rules has led some Indian students considering studying abroad to look beyond the United States, which typically draws in over 100,000 Indian students annually. One Canadian official said the number of student visa applications for certain courses in Canada had spiked over 250 percent since Trumps election win in November. Akshay Baliga, a management consultant with a H-1B visa that is valid until 2018, said he was not considering returning to the United States for work any time soon. As a professional Im looking eastward, said Baliga, now based in India but who earlier studied and lived for years in America. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When Raj, a Sri Lankan fisherman, sought refuge in the United States in 2005, he had precisely the kind of fear of returning home that U.S. asylum laws require. In 2004, he was kidnapped by the separatist rebel group the Tamil Tigers and had to pay $500 to secure his release, according to Raj, his lawyer and court records reviewed by Reuters. The group then demanded more money, which he could not pay after a tsunami destroyed his house and fishing boat.  Raj, 42, who asked that only his first name be used because of the sensitive nature of his situation, decided to flee. He boarded a plane using a false Canadian passport and requested asylum upon arriving in the United States.  There was a catch, however. U.S. laws ban immigration by anyone who has provided \""material support\"" to terrorists, and the Tamil Tigers are designated as a terrorist group by the United States. A judge ruled that Raj's ransom payment to them constituted material support. (Read an excerpt of the letter petitioning the U.S. government for a waiver in this case: tmsnrt.rs/2oPsqQM) Ultimately, Raj was granted asylum in 2011 because of rules that allow for waivers for people who provided aid to terrorists under duress. He now lives in San Diego, California, works in an Indian restaurant and hopes to become a citizen. (Read an excerpt of the letter from the U.S. government granting the waiver: tmsnrt.rs/2oPy7yx) Raj said it was a big relief when he finally received his green card around a year after receiving asylum. I am not a terrorist, he said.  Now the Trump administration is debating whether to rescind the waivers that have allowed Raj, and tens of thousands of others, to immigrate to the United States in the past decade (See graphic on waivers: tmsnrt.rs/2oPssIo). Some immigration hardliners are concerned the exemptions could allow terrorists to slip into the country. U.S. President Donald Trump directed the secretaries of State and Homeland Security, in consultation with the attorney general, to consider abolishing the waivers in an executive order in March. That directive was overshadowed by the same orders temporary ban on all refugees and on travelers from six mostly Muslim nations.   The bans on refugees and travel were challenged in lawsuits, and their implementation has been suspended pending full hearings in court. But the waiver review was not included in the court rulings, so that part of the order remains in effect. Rules governing the waivers have been hammered out over the last decade with both Democratic and Republican support. But in recent years they have drawn fire from some conservative lawmakers, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions when he was a senator. A State Department official said this week the department is working with DHS to review the waivers and is looking at actually pulling them back in accordance with the executive order.  The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, declined to give details on the timing of the review or its likely outcome. The Department of Justice declined to comment. Following the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, Congress expanded the definition of who could be considered a terrorist and what constituted material support to terrorism in rules now known as the Terrorism Related Inadmissibility Grounds.  Those changes ensnared people like Raj who were coerced or inadvertently provided support to terrorists, as well as members of persecuted ethnic groups that supported rebel organizations, and even U.S.-allied groups fighting against authoritarian regimes.  Without an exemption, members of Kurdish groups that battled Saddam Husseins forces in Iraq, Hmong groups who fought alongside U.S. troops in Vietnam, or some Cubans who fought Fidel Castros regime would not be allowed to immigrate to the United States.  Under the exemptions, U.S. authorities have the discretion to grant people residency in the United States after they have passed background checks and are found to pose no threat to national security. Congress initially passed waivers to the terrorism bars in 2007 with bipartisan support, and in the years that followed both the Bush and Obama administrations added additional groups and circumstances to the exemptions. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has granted nearly 22,000 TRIG exemptions in total over the last decade, according to the latest data available, which goes through September 2016. The State Department also grants TRIG exemptions, but a spokesman could not provide data on how many. Refugees from Myanmar are the largest single group of beneficiaries to date of TRIG exemptions granted by USCIS, with more than 6,700 waivers. The wave of Myanmar refugees dates to 2006, when U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice ruled that thousands of members of the Karen ethnic group, then living in a camp in Thailand, could resettle in the United States, even if they had supported the political wing of an armed group that had fought the countrys military regime.  One high-profile supporter of scrapping the waivers is  House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, a Republican from Virginia whose staffers were instrumental in drafting Trumps travel ban. Goodlatte told Reuters he was pleased that the Trump Administration is reviewing the dangerous policy. Groups favoring stricter immigration laws have also applauded the review. Rosemary Jenks, director of government relations at NumbersUSA, called the waivers a potential security risk.  I personally dont think that a bureaucrat should be deciding how much support for terrorism is enough to be barred, she said. A USCIS spokeswoman, when asked if a recipient of an exemption had ever been involved in a terrorism-related case after arriving in the United States, referred Reuters to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which said it was a question for the State Department to answer. I dont know of any cases where beneficiaries of exemptions have gotten into trouble after arriving, the State Department official said, noting that the department does not typically track people after they arrive in the United States. Trumps order to review the waivers is another example of an attempt to address a non-existent phantom problem, said Eric Schwartz, who served in the State Department during the Obama administration. Schwartz and immigration advocates say the waivers are granted after lengthy review and are extremely difficult to get.  These are case-by-case exemptions for people who represent no threat to the United States but rather have been caught in the most unfortunate of circumstances, said Schwartz. For Raj, the initial ruling that his ransom payment supported a terrorist group led to more than two years in U.S. immigration detention, followed by more years of electronic monitoring. His waiver allowed him to bring his wife to the United States after nine years apart. She now studies nursing.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""CHICAGO (Reuters) - Target Corp (TGT.N), Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and other retailers are shelving considerations to move supply bases closer to the United States in the face of a possible border tax, banking instead on killing support for the tax idea in Congress. President Donald Trumps push to impose a tax on imports, such as the 20 percent levy initiated by House Republicans, could raise U.S. consumer prices by as much as 25 percent, industry officials said. Last week, the President said he favored an import tax that could be adjusted to reflect the country of origins tax rate for U.S. products.  The decision by retailers to forestall supply chain investment in countries such as Bolivia and Romania to focus on lobbying Congress shows how Trumps ambitious agenda has instilled a new level of risk operating outside U.S. borders. But the vagueness around the tax proposals and whether they may ever be implemented means retail industry executives are still not willing to change their operating infrastructure. The Retail Industry Leaders Association, which is leading the industry lobbying effort, has conducted 140 meetings with lawmakers since December, focusing on the costs of a new tax and encouraging lawmakers who oppose the tax. Prospects for a quick passage of a tax bill took a hit last month when the Republican attempt to overhaul the national healthcare law failed to get a vote in the U.S. House of Representatives. Trump and Republican leaders have said they still intend to pass a healthcare reform law first, casting further doubt on when Congress may consider tax reform. The border tax proposal likely will be as messy as the healthcare bill, according to Brian Dodge, senior executive vice-president of public affairs for the retail lobby group. Target, for one, thinks the industrys lobbying efforts are succeeding.  We are working on educating lawmakers and President Trump hasnt embraced it yet, so we definitely think we are making progress, a senior company official at Target said on condition of anonymity.  There is good reason for retailers to fight the tax idea. RBC Capital Markets forecast such a levy could reduce profits of six large U.S. retailers by as much as $13 billion in its first year, with Wal-Mart alone seeing its federal tax bill jump to $16.6 billion from $6.6 billion. For a graphic please click tmsnrt.rs/2oVlOPB Best Buy Co Inc (BBY.N), which relies heavily on electronics imports, could see its earnings completely wiped out, RBC warned. Best Buy declined to comment. Firms with less exposure to overseas suppliers - ranging from off-price chains like TJX Cos (TJX.N) and Ross Stores (ROST.O) to cosmetics seller Ulta Beauty (ULTA.O) - would feel less impact than heavy importers like Wal-Mart, Target and Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O), analysts and consultants said. TJX Companies and Ulta Beauty declined comment. Ross Stores and Costco did not respond to requests seeking comment.     Steve Osburn, director of supply chain for retail consultancy Kurt Salmon, said it is more cost effective to spend on lobbying than on supply chain relocation at this point. Retailers also have other investment needs, especially around winning consumers who want to shop from home. They are putting a lot of money in e-commerce initiatives to compete online so there are not a lot of funds to spare, he said. One outlier is luxury handbag maker Rebecca Minkoff, which sells its own products and supplies other retailers, like Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O).  The prospect of a U.S. border tax factored into its recent decision to supply U.S. customers from Europe as it mitigates logistics costs to supply to the United States, according to Uri Minkoff, the firms founder and CEO.    The process has intensified in the past six months, said Minkoff.  The decision to bank more on the lobby effort to kill support for the tax idea comes after retailers spent the last few months considering whether to move some of their production to supply bases like Bolivia, Brazil and other South American countries with low wage rates, as well as European countries like Hungary, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic, industry sources told Reuters.  A return to the United States was also a consideration, the sources said.  Shifting production from existing supply bases like China is costly, may involve intellectual property issues and disrupts long-term supply contracts, making it hard to plan and execute such moves, two industry sources said. Consultants have told retailers they could mitigate shipping costs enough to offset any border tax, while avoiding the cost of moving production into the U.S, the sources said.  But so far they are not proceeding with major supply chain changes, according to retailers and industry consultants. Wal-Mart is not ready to spend money to deal with this, said a supply chain consultant who works with the retailer but requested anonymity for fear of disrupting the firms relationship with Wal-Mart.     Wal-Mart has reviewed its options with supply chain consultants, but has not yet commissioned a concrete contingency plan, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.        Wal-Mart declined comment. Executives at smaller retailers and brands like Samsonite, Crate and Barrel and Steve Madden said there is little competitive impetus for action because they believe a border tax would hurt them and competitors equally. Samsonite was studying reviving its U.S. manufacturing base, but is not close to taking action. Setting plans (based) on policy proposals that are yet to be implemented is not right, Samsonite Chief Executive Officer Ramesh Tainwala told Reuters.          Minneapolis-based Target is limiting itself to conducting feasibility studies. We just dont want to get ahead of ourselves and invest capital, the Target official said.    Target declined comment.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans who control Congress face their first major budget test next week, with the threat of a U.S. government shutdown potentially hinging on his proposed Mexican border wall as well as Obamacare funding. With Republicans controlling the White House and both chambers of Congress, keeping the federal government operating is a basic test of their ability to govern, but their task could become even more complicated if they insist on using the spending legislation to bring about contentious policy changes. Not only must Republicans overcome intraparty ideological divisions that stopped major healthcare legislation last month, but they will have to win over some opposition Democrats with provisions that could be distasteful to conservatives. With the Senate reconvening on Monday and the House of Representatives on Tuesday after a two-week recess, lawmakers will have only four days to pass a spending package to keep the government open beyond April 28, when funding expires for numerous federal programs. I think we want to keep the government open, Trump said on Thursday, adding he thinks Congress can pass the funding legislation and perhaps also a revamped healthcare bill. Democratic support depends on what provisions Republicans demand in the bill. Democrats have signaled they would not cooperate if it contains money for one of Trumps top priorities, a southwestern border wall intended to combat illegal immigration, or if it ends federal subsidies to help low-income people buy health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, which Republicans want to repeal. Democrats also want federal funds maintained for Planned Parenthood, which many Republicans oppose because the womens healthcare provider performs abortions. Another obstacle would be if Trump demands large defense spending increases coupled with deep cuts to domestic programs Democrats want to protect. Late on Thursday, leading House Democrats were voicing skepticism a deal could be reached by the deadline. In a telephone call for House Democrats, Representative Nita Lowey, the senior Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, said: I dont see how we can meet that deadline and avoid having to pass a short-term extension, according to an aide on the call. The second-ranking House Democrat, Representative Steny Hoyer, told his fellow Democrats that they should only support such a short-term measure if a deal on long-term bill is reached and only finishing touches remained, the aide said. Republican leaders face a familiar balancing act: satisfying the partys most conservative members while not alienating its moderates. Rules in the 100-seat Senate mean Trumps party also would need the support of at least eight Democrats even if the Republicans remain unified, giving the opposition party leverage. House Republican leaders would need some Democratic votes if the most conservative lawmakers object to the bill, as they did to the healthcare plan championed by Speaker Paul Ryan. With congressional elections looming next year, Republicans acknowledge the stakes are high. Even our most recalcitrant members understand that if you shut down the government while youre running it and you control the House and the Senate, you cant blame anybody but yourself, said Representative Tom Cole, a senior House Appropriations Committee Republican. White House budget director Mick Mulvaney said the Trump administration was willing to talk to Democrats about funding for Obamacare subsidies in exchange for their agreement to include some Trump priorities such as the wall, the defense hike and more money for immigration enforcement. It is ripe for some type of negotiated agreement that gives the president some of his priorities and Democrats some of their priorities. So we think weve opened the door for that, Mulvaney said. Democrats reacted negatively. Everything had been moving smoothly until the administration moved in with a heavy hand. Not only are Democrats opposed to the wall, there is significant Republican opposition as well, said Matt House, a spokesman for Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. The government was last forced to close in October 2013, when Republican Senator Ted Cruz and some of the most conservative House Republicans engineered a 17-day shutdown in an unsuccessful quest to kill Democratic former President Barack Obamas healthcare law. These kind of bills cant pass without a reasonable number of the party of the minority in the Senate, and we are optimistic we will be able to work all that out, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said at the start of the spring recess. A deal is needed because Congress was unable to approve funding for the entire 2017 fiscal year that ends in September and has relied on stop-gap spending legislation. Congress has passed no major legislation since Trump took office in January, and he has ambitious hopes for major tax-cut legislation, infrastructure spending and other bills. With the difficulty passing a bill with so many divisive elements, lawmakers next week might need to buy time by passing a short-term bill lasting possibly one to three weeks, maintaining current spending levels. That would be a setback: not catastrophic, but not a good thing, and a sign that you cant govern, Cole said. A federal closure would shutter National Park Service destinations like the Statue of Liberty, Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon. Government medical research would be suspended. Thousands of federal workers would be furloughed with thousands more working without pay until the shutdown ends, including homeland security personnel. Some veterans benefits could be suspended. Time would stand still in the U.S. Capitol with nobody on duty to wind the 200-year-old Ohio Clock just outside the Senate chamber. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

(XOM.N) violated consumer protection laws when selling fossil fuel products, according to a court filing.  Top prosecutors for Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, Utah and Wisconsin, all of whom are Republicans, filed a brief in U.S. District Court in Manhattan supporting a lawsuit by Exxon to halt a probe by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey. Schneiderman and Healey, both Democrats, are looking at whether the company violated consumer protection laws by selling fossil fuels while failing to reveal information about the effects of burning them on the global climate. In their brief, the attorneys general said Healey and Schneiderman were abusing their power and violating Exxons rights to free speech by using law enforcement authority to resolve a public policy debate over whether carbon emissions cause climate change, a debate they claim is not settled. The brief cites a May 17, 2016, article in the conservative magazine the National Review by Scott Pruitt, who at the time was attorney general for Oklahoma and earlier this year was appointed by President Donald Trump to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, claiming scientists continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its connection to the actions of mankind.  An overwhelming majority of scientists believe that carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels is a major contributor to global climate change, triggering sea level rise, droughts and more frequent violent storms. Pruitt said in a CNBC interview on March 9 that he did not agree carbon dioxide emissions were a primary contributor to climate change. The attorneys general have raised important constitutional and legal issues in support of our position that the investigations by New York and Massachusetts are politically based and in bad faith, said Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri, adding that the probes were an attempt to silence political opponents who disagree on the appropriate policies to address climate change. In 2015, Schneiderman reached a settlement with Peabody Energy (BTU.N) after a similar probe of whether the coal company appropriately conveyed its financial risks associated with climate change. The company agreed to change language in its public statements as part of the settlement.

Some of Trumps policy advisers named allies like Germany and Japan as possible targets for economic retaliation. Fast-forward almost 100 days into Trumps presidency and the worlds most powerful finance officials, gathered in Washington for the International Monetary Fund spring meetings, have found an administration that is far from the disruptive force Trump promised. Although Trump did act on his campaign promise to tear up a 12-nation Pacific trade pact that had been the cornerstone of President Barack Obamas Asian pivot, he has taken a much softer stance on other issues. He has refrained from pulling out of the North American Free Trade Agreement, did not carry out a pledge to label China a currency cheat, and his administration has signaled the United States may stay in the Paris climate accord. Constraints being put on Trump by Congress and the courts on issues ranging from healthcare to immigration that would have filtered into the economy and the slow pace with which he is filling key administration jobs have played a role. And some foreign policy makers say they are still not sure who their counterparts are in the Trump administration. But these policy makers said that important initial decisions have been far more centrist than might have been expected. The European Unions commissioner for economic and financial affairs, Pierre Moscovici, summed up a widely shared sentiment as he highlighted how two people at the top of Trumps economic team - Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Gary Cohn, director of the National Economic Council - have curbed the worst fears over the young U.S. presidency. We have the feeling that Mnuchin and Cohn are sensible people with whom we can discuss things, who are conscious of what an open economy requires, Moscovici told Reuters in an interview. The European Unions view of a more pragmatic administration was shared by Mexico, which attracted some of Trumps greatest ire. Trumps threat to impose punitive tariffs on Mexican exports sent the peso currency tumbling, but it has since recovered. Mexicos finance undersecretary, Vanessa Rubio Marquez, said  discussions with the Trump administration so far have become anchored around a handful of issues that Mexico would be able to deal with.  There is still a lot of uncertainty, she said in a seminar on Wednesday. But dialogue has been more structured, more constant. What Trump might mean for the U.S. and world economies has preoccupied central bankers, investors and analysts since the new president took office promising a virtual revolution in the way the United States relates to the rest of the world. Though much about Trumps policies remain unformed as the administration approaches the 100-day mark, the more extreme risks - such as a trade war or a budget-busting fiscal program that unhinges inflation - seem to have receded. My belief is that a multilateral framework promoting free trade will continue. There wont be huge changes to that, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda told reporters on Thursday. In remarks on Thursday, Mnuchin said tax reform remained a priority as are other steps to boost U.S. growth. But he said the hope for faster growth would mean a stronger world economy, and that it was constructive to coordinate policies through international organizations like the Group of 20. This administration is willing to reach out and get ideas from the outside, Mnuchin told top-level bankers at a conference organized in parallel with the IMF meeting. There are still risks. The Trump administration said on Thursday it would embark on a study of whether cheap steel imports from China and other countries were damaging national security. And there are still huge gaps in personnel at key bodies like Treasury and Commerce. Many of the top jobs are still vacant, said one European diplomat who was attending the IMF meetings and spoke on condition of anonymity.

A divided three-judge panel found that the boundaries of several state legislative districts were reshaped with the intention of illegally diluting the strength of the Democratic-leaning Hispanic electorate for the benefit of the Republican Party. The panel ruled that the redrawn boundaries were designed to either fragment cohesive Latino communities among multiple districts, or to lump Hispanics into a single jurisdiction and thus limit their overall sway. Similar gerrymandering tactics of cracking and packing were found last month by the same panel in redrawn boundaries for three of the states 36 congressional districts. It was not immediately clear whether Texas would appeal the latest decision, which pertained to state legislative districts encompassing some of the states largest cities, including Dallas, San Antonio and Houston. As in last months 2-1 decision, Thursdays ruling was agreed upon by U.S. District Judges Xavier Rodriguez and Orlando Garcia of San Antonio, appointees of former Republican President George W. Bush and former Democratic President Bill Clinton, respectively.  The third member of the panel, 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Jerry Smith, appointed by former Republican President Ronald Reagan, dissented in both opinions.  He blasted the latest decision as clearly erroneous, writing that partisan advantage, not race itself, was the rationale for drawing the districts as they were.  Generally courts have ruled that shaping districts based on race or ethnicity is illegal, but drawing boundaries to gain political advantage for the majority party is not.  Texas Democratic Party chair Gilberto Hinojosa welcomed the findings of Thursdays 153-page majority opinion. The Republicans have dealt Texas a deep moral wound, he said. They havent just been cheating to gain an edge in the political game. They have been deliberately holding back Texans from having a voice in their own government. Republicans have dominated all statewide non judicial offices in Texas for more than 20 years, and have frequently used that advantage to redraw political maps to benefit their  party.

Speaking to bankers just hours after the formal start of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank spring meetings, White House National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn said Washington was prepared to get tougher in the trade arena. If you want to insist on having a tariff on a product - which we prefer you not - the president believes that we should treat you in a reciprocal fashion and that we should tax your product coming into the United States, Cohn said. That is free, that is open, and that is fair. Asked at the Institute of International Finance about his message for his international counterparts, Cohn said the United States doesnt want to be taken advantage of any more.   The message is simple. We care about the United States of America, we care about economic prosperity, we care about economic growth, we care about trade, we care about being treated fairly, he said. Earlier at the White House, President Donald Trump signed a directive to study whether steel imports into the United States should be restricted for national security reasons under a law passed in 1962. Such moves, including a review of Buy American rules launched earlier this week, have raised concerns that the Trump administration is looking outside the World Trade Organization for remedies to restrict U.S. imports. IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde told reporters on Thursday that more needed to be done to make the global trading system fairer and expressed a willingness to work with Trump to do just that. In a news conference, Lagarde said there was a need to improve the WTO dispute settlement rules as well as reduce government subsidies for industry and tackle other trade distortions. She said the IMF would do its part in working to cut government subsidies for industry and other trade practices that limit competition, but said protectionist measures needed to be avoided. From the various contacts that Ive had with the (Trump)  administration so far, I have every reason to believe that we will make progress, that we will cooperate all together in order to support and indeed improve the system as we have it, Lagarde said. The IMF also has expressed concerns about the Trump administrations plan to cut taxes, releasing reports on Wednesday that said such a move could fuel financial risk-taking and increase public debt. Appearing alongside Cohn, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he would unveil the tax plan soon, very soon, and predicted it would be passed by Congress this year.  But he gave few details and shed no light on whether the plan would include a controversial border-tax component. It will be sweeping, it will be significant and it will create a lot of economic growth, Mnuchin said. The plan will pay for itself with growth. Separately, World Bank President Jim Yong Kim also put in a plug for free trade and said he was encouraged by his engagement so far with Trump. But he added that he would not reduce the multilateral lenders commitment to trade or to financing alternative energy projects.  The science of climate change didnt change with any particular election, and I dont see that it will, Kim said at a news conference. We have to be an evidence-based organization.    The IMF and World Bank meetings come about a month after Mnuchin insisted that an anti-protectionism pledge be dropped from a Group of 20 communique issued in Baden-Baden, Germany. Eswar Prasad, former head of the IMFs China department, said the Trump administration may choose to simply ignore the advice of the IMF and other institutions.  The IMF has little leverage since its limited toolkit of analysis-based advice, persuasion, and peer pressure is unlikely to have much of an impact on this administrations policies, said Prasad, now an international trade professor at Cornell University.

His comments came as world financial leaders gathered in Washington with pledges to work with U.S. President Donald Trump to fix lingering trade problems while vowing to keep their commitments to free trade and global integration. Kuroda, formerly head of the Asian Development Bank, said that while policymakers must deal with poverty and income disparities widening in some countries, that did not mean they should abandon global free trade. Unwinding the more than 70-year postwar history of free trade and globalism isnt the appropriate approach, he said. Trumps protectionist approach to trade and European political risks have overshadowed brightening prospects for the global economy, driven by a rebound in manufacturing activity. Japan has benefitted from global tailwinds that boosted exports and factory output, Kuroda said, describing its economy as expanding steadily as a trend - a more upbeat view than last month. But he offered a bleaker view on Japans inflation, saying it lacked momentum with no clear sign yet it was shifting up. Thats why the BOJ will continue its ultra-easy monetary policy to achieve its 2 percent inflation target at the earliest date possible, he said. Japans economy has shown signs of life as exports and output rebounded thanks to a pick-up in global demand. But core consumer prices for February rose just 0.2 percent from a year earlier, far from the BOJs 2 percent target, as weak household spending discourages companies from raising prices and wages. After three years of heavy money printing failed to drive up inflation, the BOJ reverted its policy framework last September to one better suited for a long-term war against deflation.

And he said U.S. President Donald Trump likes the idea. Kim told Reuters in an interview on Thursday that he is looking to mobilize hundreds of billions of dollars now parked in low-yield government bonds for development finance, earning higher returns for investors. The World Bank would pave the way to reduce risk. Speaking with President Trump directly, I told him about the need to make this shift, to work more effectively with the private sector. He was very enthusiastic about that, Kim said.     Id love to see President Trump champion this approach to development finance. The potential new business model is part of Kims pitch to promote the multilateral lenders role as a facilitator in developing new markets - and attract political support and new capital along the way. Trumps initial budget plan in March floated a $650 million funding cut multilateral development banks over three years. However, it is Congress, not the White House, that ultimately decides spending levels. What Im trying to convince everyone of is, if we get this right, we can actually spur global growth, create markets for American products, create opportunities for American companies, Kim said of his pitch to Congress, the White House and other stakeholders. The new business model would aim to use the World Bank Groups technical expertise and guarantees to prepare and de-risk projects and markets to make them bankable for risk-averse investors such as pension funds and insurance companies, Kim said. Work by the lenders International Finance Corp arm in Zambia last year to set up auctions for private firms to build solar generating plants provides a model for his proposed approach. The bank estimates that some two-thirds of current manual labor jobs in developing countries will be eliminated by automation in future years so Kim said massive investments are needed now to help develop new jobs.   Our job should be to use our money to prepare the country to bring in lots more money thats ready to go but is not moving because of the perception of risk or because the projects are not, Kim said. Kim said he is encouraged by his engagement so far with the Trump administration, including interest from Ivanka Trump in the banks work on womens issues. Were interacting with them quite a lot and theyre asking us very specific questions about how we think about solving certain problems, he said.

In February, the Republican-controlled Congress used the Congressional Review Act, or CRA, to dismantle a rule that the administration of former Democratic President Barack Obama finalized in August to limit hunting on federal lands in Alaska. The rule had exempted wolves and bears from Alaskas plans to control predators, which included killing wolves and their pups in their dens and shooting bears from planes.  The CRA only requires simple majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate and the presidents signature to wipe newly minted regulations off the books.   In the federal court lawsuit, which likely has little chance of success, the Center for Biological Diversity said the CRA violated the U.S. Constitution because it barred regulators in the future from enacting substantially similar rules to the ones repealed.   The Congressional Review Act throws the balance of power out of whack and opens the door for politicians in Congress to meddle in decisions that ought to be made by experts at federal agencies, said Collette Adkins, a biologist and attorney at the center. By law the Fish and Wildlife Service must protect biological diversity on Alaskan wildlife refuges. But the act makes it more difficult for agency officials to carry out their legal duty, she said in a statement. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The CRA, drafted in 1996, has a structure and language that abide by what the U.S. Supreme Court said in the case INS v. Chadha, likely making it constitutional, said Karl Manheim, professor of law at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. Since Feb. 1, Trump has signed 13 congressional resolutions repealing rules on the environment, education, gun control, corruption and family planning. Most advocacy groups that had tried to block the resolutions said this week they were not intending to file similar suits.  Unfortunately I dont think theres an avenue for courts to overturn a CRA resolution, said Alison Zieve who works in litigation for the liberal Public Citizen group.

It wouldnt be a bad idea, if the European Central bank and others were to start following this example, he said.

Trump told a news conference some very unusual moves have been made over the last two or three hours, and that he was confident Chinese President Xi Jinping would try very hard to pressure Beijings ally and neighbor North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs. While Trump gave no indication of what the moves might be, U.S. officials told Reuters that the United States was aware of a higher-than-usual level of activity by Chinese bombers, signaling a possible heightened state of readiness. The officials played down concerns and left open a range of possible reasons. * COMMENTARY: The next super weapon could be biological reut.rs/2oVooHc * COMMENTARY: The worrying lessons of the Syria chemical attack reut.rs/2o6r55r Those possibilities included defensive exercises or Chinese concerns over North Korea. None of the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, suggested alarm or signaled that they knew the precise reason for such Chinese activity.      U.S. officials have been saying for weeks that North Korea could soon stage another nuclear bomb test, something both the United States and China have both warned against. Trump has taken a hard line with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who has proceeded with nuclear and missile programs in defiance of U.N. Security Council sanctions. The United States and South Korea are technically still at war with North Korea because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. Tensions have risen sharply in recent months after North Korea conducted two nuclear weapons tests last year and carried out a steady stream of ballistic missile tests. Trump, who took office in January, has vowed to prevent North Korea from being able to hit the United States with a nuclear missile. Trump has focused his efforts on North Korea on trying to persuade China to put more pressure on its ally and could view any unusual Chinese military movements as supportive of this. He told a news conference with the visiting prime minister of Italy on Thursday that the United States was in very good shape on North Korea and that Chinas Xi, whom he met this month for a summit in Florida, was working hard to help. We dont know whether or not theyre able to do that, but I have absolute confidence that he will be trying very very hard. Trump repeated a past comment that he had told Xi in Florida that China would make much better deal on trade with the United States if you get rid of this menace or do something about this menace of North Korea. SUPER-MIGHTY PREEMPTIVE STRIKE  The Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of North Koreas ruling Workers Party, struck an aggressive tone earlier on Thursday.  In the case of our super-mighty preemptive strike being launched, it will completely and immediately wipe out not only U.S. imperialists invasion forces in South Korea and its surrounding areas but the U.S. mainland and reduce them to ashes, it said. Reclusive North Korea regularly threatens to destroy Japan, South Korea and the United States and has shown no let-up in its belligerence after a failed missile test on Sunday, which followed a huge display of missiles at a parade in Pyongyang. South Korean news agency Yonhap quoted an unnamed South Korean government source as saying that the U.S. Air Force had dispatched a nuclear sniffer aircraft on Thursday to the east of the Korean Peninsula in anticipation of a possible nuclear test. The U.S. Defense Department does not comment on deployments of the WC-135 Constant Phoenix aircraft used to collect samples from the atmosphere to detect and analyze nuclear explosions.    The U.N. Security Council on Thursday condemned North Koreas latest failed missile test and demanded it not conduct any more nuclear tests. South Koreas acting president, Hwang Kyo-ahn, at a meeting with top officials on Thursday, repeatedly called for the military and security ministries to maintain vigilance. The South Korean defense ministry said U.S. and South Korean air forces were conducting an annual training exercise, codenamed Max Thunder, until April 28. North Korea routinely labels such exercises preparations for invasion. We are conducting a practical and more intensive exercise than ever, South Korean pilot Colonel Lee Bum-chul told reporters. Through this exercise, I am sure we can deter war and remove our enemys intention to provoke us.     William Perry, who served as U.S. defense secretary from 1994 to 1997 and negotiated with North Korea, said he did not believe Pyongyang was planning a surprise attack, despite the fiery rhetoric. But he warned: They are doing a lot of bluster and a lot of threats, and they might misplay that hand and blunder into a war.

Tillerson told reporters the review, which he announced on Tuesday, would not only look at Tehrans compliance with a 2015 nuclear deal but also its behavior in the region which he said undermined U.S. interests in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Lebanon.   His tough words matched those of U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who said in a visit to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday that Irans destabilizing influence would have to be overcome to end the conflict in Yemen.  President Donald Trump ordered the review to evaluate whether suspension of sanctions related to the nuclear deal was vital to the national security interests of the United States, Tillerson said     Though there was no sign the Trump administration intended to walk away from the deal, Tillerson twice cautioned that if left unchecked Tehran could become a threat like North Korea, which is also under pressure over its nuclear ambitions.  In a letter to U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan released late on Tuesday, Tillerson declared that Iran was meeting its commitments under the 2015 nuclear deal but there were concerns about Tehrans role as a state sponsor of terrorism. A comprehensive Iran policy requires we address all of the threats posed by Iran and it is clear there are many, Tillerson told reporters at the State Department. Tillerson said the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers failed to achieve the objective of a non-nuclear Iran and only delays their goal of becoming a nuclear state. Iran has yet to comment on the Trump administrations review, but Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei warned in November that Tehran would retaliate if the United States breached the nuclear agreement. Tillerson said one of the mistakes in the way the agreement was put together was that it ignored all the other serious threats Iran posed outside of its nuclear program. That is why we have to look at Iran in a very comprehensive way in terms of the threat it poses in all areas of the region and the world, he added. This deal represents the same failed approach of the past that brought us to the current imminent threat we face from North Korea, Tillerson said of the nuclear deal. The nuclear agreement, negotiated during Barack Obamas presidency, placed limitations on Irans nuclear program in exchange for lifting economic sanctions against Iran. Tillersons notice to Congress was part of a 90-day process in which the president has to certify that Iran is complying with the nuclear accord. It is the first update under the Trump administration. The next test of Trumps attitude toward the nuclear deal will be in May when he must decide whether to extend sanctions waivers for Iran first signed by President Barack Obama. During his presidential campaign, Trump called the agreement the worst deal ever negotiated and said he would review it once he reached office.  The European Unions foreign policy chief, Frederica Mogherini, said last month after meetings with senior Trump administration officials she was reassured in the talks that the U.S. was committed to fully implementing the deal.

The exchange came a day after U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson sent a letter to Congress saying Iran was in compliance with the nuclear deal but raising questions about Tehrans role in sponsoring terrorism in the region. Tillerson accused Iran of alarming ongoing provocations to destabilize countries in the Middle East and said the Trump administration had launched a review of its policy toward Tehran that will include the 2015 nuclear deal. In the first reaction to Tillersons remarks from a senior Iranian official, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, who tweeted that the United States should fulfill its own commitments.

Iran has not lived up to the spirit of the agreement and they have to do that, Trump said, adding that the administration was analyzing it very, very carefully and would have more to say about it soon. Under the nuclear deal, the State Department must notify Congress every 90 days on Irans compliance under the so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Tillersons letter on Wednesday was the first such notification since Trump took office. In his tweet, Zarif also addressed Tillersons terrorism charge: Worn-out US accusations cant mask its admission of Irans compliance w/ JCPOA.

Both Iran and Hezbollah are currently fighting in support of Syrian President Bashar al Assads forces. Iran has also sent military advisers and fighters to neighboring Iraq, where they are taking part in the Baghdad governments operations against Islamic State.

The new version, which is even worse than Chairman Hensarlings first draft, cannot be allowed to become law. There is too much at stake for consumers and for our economy at large, she said in a statement earlier this month. The 2010 Dodd-Frank law established strict rules on the financial sector to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. Republicans like Hensarling, as well as President Donald Trump, believe the regulations put an undue burden on businesses and have held back the economy by restricting lending. But Hensarlings ambitious approach, which would eliminate huge portions of Dodd-Frank, faces an uncertain political future beyond the House. At least eight Democrats would need to support a financial reform bill in the Senate for it to pass, and the major changes proposed by Hensarling are not expected by industry experts to garner that type of support. Instead, the Senate is expected to take a slower, piecemeal approach to revisiting financial rules, with a focus on changes that could garner bipartisan support. Hensarlings bill would make a host of changes to financial rules in the United States. For example, banks could significantly increase the amount of capital they hold, and in turn no longer have to adhere to a host of existing Dodd-Frank rules. Hensarlings bill also severely restricts the power of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, while bringing it under much stricter oversight by Congress. The measure is likely to be met with strict opposition by Democrats in Congress. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Democrat Jon Ossoff drew 48.1 percent of the vote in Tuesdays special election, just shy of the 50 percent needed to win the most closely watched U.S. congressional race since Trump took office in January. Some saw the election, held to replace new Health Secretary Tom Price, as a test of the Republican presidents political strength. Ossoff, 30, was the top vote getter in a field of 18 candidates, 11 of them Republicans, in a suburban Atlanta district that has sent Republicans to Congress since the 1970s. Republican Karen Handel, 55, a former Georgia secretary of state, won 19.8 percent, and will face Ossoff in the June 20  runoff. The runoff presents a stiffer challenge. If Ossoff gets the support of the other Democratic candidates, he would have 49 percent, said Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez. However, Perez said the party would target up to 35,000 Democrats who voted in Novembers presidential election but not on Tuesday.  We have an army of volunteers, he told CNN. Handel, who said Trump called to congratulate her on Wednesday morning, dismissed Ossoff as a well-funded novice who would flounder as Republicans consolidated support behind a single candidate. We know that this is an important race, and its going to stay in the hands of a Republican, Handel told CNN. It is all Republicans, all hands on deck.  Demographic changes have made Georgias affluent 6th Congressional District more competitive for Democrats.  Trump won the district by only 1.5 percentage points in November against Democrat Hillary Clinton, who drew support from its many college graduates. Republican U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said the race showed how the South was changing. This should be a wake-up call for the Republican Party in the South, he told NBCs Today show. Ossoff, a former congressional staffer and documentary filmmaker, ran on a pledge to Make Trump Furious. Trump jumped into the race in its final days with attacks on Twitter poking fun at Ossoff for not living in his own district and for attracting support from Hollywood celebrities.  The president weighed in again on Wednesday with a tweet saying, It is now Hollywood vs. Georgia on June 20th. In response, Ossoff portrayed Trump, a New York businessman who had never held public office, as the Washington insider.  Folks in Washington tend to overstate their influence in local races like this, he told MSNBC. This comes down to grassroots intensity.     White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Trump would campaign in Georgia for Handel if needed but dismissed the race as overhyped. The Democrats went all-in on this race, Spicer told reporters.

The reason Im here is because it is important that we restore confidence to the people here in this community that we are going to get it right going forward, Pruitt told the media after meeting with residents and lawmakers.  Pruitt did not address the report of the possible office closure or how drastic budget cuts would impact the EPAs operations. He toured a housing complex built on the Superfund site where around 1,000 residents had to leave their homes earlier this year due to lead contamination. Dozens of people held signs on Wednesday urging the EPA to continue clean-up efforts.     The Superfund program was started in 1980 to clean up hazardous waste sites, which now number just over 1,300 around the country.  The White House budget proposal submitted to Congress last month includes a 31 percent cut in spending for the EPA, including a similar reduction of the agencys Hazardous Substance Superfund Account by $330 million to $762 million.

In a letter to Chao, four Democratic senators, two each from New York and New Jersey, asked Chao to visit before Republican President Donald Trumps administration finalizes any federal infrastructure package. They also urged Chao to support Amtraks Gateway Program, which includes building a passenger rail tunnel underneath the Hudson River in partnership with NJ Transit, the two states, and their bi-state port authority.  That project, which had been fast-tracked by Chaos predecessor in the administration of former President Barack Obama, is considered one of the most important infrastructure projects in the nation. Were teetering every single day on the brink of truly a traffic Armageddon, U.S. Senator Corey Booker said at a news conference in Newarks Penn Station about the invitation to Chao he issued with New York senators Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand and fellow New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez.  The new administration has to come to the table with a commitment to what is not just a New Jersey problem, not just a regional problem, but really an American problem, Booker said. The area is also a chokepoint on Amtraks Northeast Corridor, a key section of rail that connects Washington to Boston. The Transportation Department said in a statement that Chao intends to tour a number of the countrys infrastructure projects, including the Gateway site. An important source of funding for Gateway and some other U.S. projects is uncertain because Trump proposed cutting the federal New Starts grant program in his initial budget plan.  Two NJ Transit train derailments in recent weeks, both the fault of Amtrak, badly snarled commutes. They also prompted New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a Republican, to say he would halt state payments to the national rail operator, from which NJ Transit leases tracks. At the news conference, a handful of protesters criticized Christie for underfunding New Jersey transportation and cancelling a previous rail tunnel project.

House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi warned that the changes could be harmful to consumers, hitting their wallets and their access to an independent media voice, as she cited press reports of a possible acquisition by Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc (SBGI.O) of Tribune Media Co stations (TRCO.N). Under rules adopted in 1985, stations with weaker over-the-air signals could be partially counted against a broadcasters ownership cap. But last year, the FCC under Democratic President Barack Obama said those rules were outdated after the 2009 conversion to digital broadcasting - which eliminated the differences in station signal strength - and revoked them in September. Federal law limits companies to owning stations serving no more than 39 percent of U.S. television households; there is a dispute over whether the FCC has the authority to amend the ownership limits. The 2016 decision did not require any company to sell existing stations, but could bar new acquisitions. Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O) in September challenged the FCC rule in federal court. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said in March that he wanted to repeal the Obama FCC decision and launch a comprehensive review of the national ownership cap later this year. In a letter, Pelosi and Representative Frank Pallone, who is the ranking Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, urged Pai to drop the plan, which could allow the Sinclair-Tribune tie-up. That would be bad news for consumers in Tribunes markets in two ways: First, consumers would lose an independent voice in their media market; and second, consumers could see their cable bills go up because Sinclair charges cable operators more than Tribune for retransmission consent, they wrote. Another Democrat, Representative Anna Eshoo, wrote Pai asking him to drop the plan, saying that further consolidation will ensure there are fewer independent news outlets serving as a counter-balance to misleading or inaccurate information.  Tribune and a spokesman for Pai both declined comment.    Reuters reported in March that Sinclair had approached Tribune to discuss a potential combination, in a deal that would hinge on regulations being relaxed. Pais broad FCC ownership review could launch a new wave of consolidation in the broadcast television industry, analysts and companies said. CBS Corp (CBS.N) lobbyist John Orlando urged the FCC in January to reverse the Obama decision and reinstate the prior rule, citing increased competition. Time is of the essence in providing broadcasters the ownership breathing room they so desperately need to compete with other video services, he said, according to a CBS FCC filing. Our industry has been frozen in time for more than three years.... Since then, our video competitors have marched on unfettered by ownership limits, he said, referring to online outlets and cable companies. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

He referred further queries about the deployment timetable to the Pentagon. The U.S. military initially said in a statement dated April 10 that Admiral Harry Harris, the commander of Pacific Command, directed the Vinson strike group to sail north and report on station in the Western Pacific. But the strike group first headed elsewhere, On April 15, the U.S. Navy even published a photo showing the Vinson transiting the Sunda Strait on its way to drills with Australia. here Reuters and other news outlets reported on April 11 that the movement would take more than a week. But the Navy, for security reasons, says it does not report future operational locations of its ships. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis looked to address confusion over the issue on Wednesday, telling reporters traveling with him in the Middle East that the alteration in the Vinsons schedule had been disclosed in the interest of transparency. We are doing exactly what we said we were going to do. She will be on her way, he said.

He gave $5 million, according to the 58th Presidential Inaugural Committees filing with the Federal Election Commission. Adelson declined comment.  Many of the companies that donated to Trump, a Republican, have significant matters pending before the U.S. government or have been invited to White House events. Many of the companies which made donations to the 2017 event also donated to Obamas prior inauguration. For example, aerospace and defense groups Boeing Co (BA.N) and Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) each donated $1 million to Trumps inauguration fund, the filing said.  Boeing had donated $1 million to the 2013 Obama inauguration, according to the OpenSecrets website run by the Center for Responsive Politics, a campaign finance watchdog. Money donated to the Trump inaugural committee falls into two categories, said Larry Sabato, political analyst at the University of Virginia. Its either make-up money or its a continuation of support by people who are invested in Trump. You dont give this kind of money to get a few tickets to inaugural balls, he said. Trump publicly criticized both Boeing and Lockheed Martin before his inauguration.

Allowing this dictator to have that kind of power is not something that civilized nations can allow to happen ... of course we dont want to have military options employed, but we must keep all options on the table, he said when asked if the U.S. administration would be willing to drop bombs on North Korea.

In a wide ranging question and answer session at an event organized by the policy Exchange think tank, Ryan also said he wanted to ratchet up sanctions on Iran but believed a nuclear deal struck in 2015, and previously criticized by Trump, would remain in place. There are lots of things that Iran is doing outside of this deal: proliferation of terrorism, weapons, violating missile tests - those things we should apply sanctions to, he said.

Trump signed a law extending the pilot Veterans Choice program, which allows some veterans to receive healthcare from local doctors and hospitals closer to their homes than the VAs 150 hospitals and nearly 1,000 outpatient clinics. The law eases procedures for reimbursing private providers and creates a system for sharing medical records with them. This new law is a good start, but there is still much work to do, Trump said at a signing ceremony attended by VA Secretary David Shulkin and Florida Governor Rick Scott. We will fight each and every day to deliver the long-awaited reforms our veterans deserve. Trump pledged to hold a news conference next week on all of the tremendous things that are happening at the VA and what weve done in terms of progress and achievement. Reforming the agency, rocked by a waiting-time scandal in 2014, was one of Trumps most-repeated campaign trail promises. He has frequently suggested having the government pay outside physicians to provide veteran healthcare. During his confirmation hearings, Shulkin said he supported overhauling the agency but did not believe in privatizing it. Still, on Tuesday the VA announced it was seeking cutting-edge treatments from the healthcare industry for brain injuries, mental health problems and chronic pain. Extension of the Veterans Choice program could worry Democrats and other critics that Trump and Shulkin are inching toward sending some of the $65.6 billion the department spends annually on medical care to corporations and private businesses. Conservatives calling for privatization say the VA provides medical services to only about 45 percent of veterans, and they point to delays and inefficiencies dogging the current system.  Some veterans groups and Democrats have warned against moving funds away from healthcare providers with expertise in injuries and illnesses unique to serving in the armed forces. In a March report, the Government Accountability Office said veterans in the Choice program still face long wait times, mostly because cases must be referred to private contractors for scheduling.  Last year a congressionally mandated panel of experts found the Choice program was inefficient, but recommended establishing a community-based healthcare system that would include private doctors.

It was even farther away over the weekend, moving through the Sunda Strait and then into the Indian Ocean, as North Korea displayed what appeared to be new missiles at a parade and staged a failed missile test.  The U.S. militarys Pacific Command explained on Tuesday that the strike group first had to complete a shorter-than-initially planned period of training with Australia. But it was now proceeding to the Western Pacific as ordered, it said.  The perceived communications mix-up has raised eyebrows among Korea experts, who wonder whether it erodes the Trump administrations credibility at a time when U.S. rhetoric about the Norths advancing nuclear and missile capabilities are raising concerns about a potential conflict.  If you threaten them and your threat is not credible, its only going to undermine whatever your policy toward them is.And that could be a logical conclusion from whats just happened, said North Korea expert Joel Wit at the 38 North monitoring group, run by Johns Hopkins Universitys School of Advanced International Studies.  The U.S. military initially said in a statement dated April 10 that Admiral Harry Harris, the commander of Pacific Command, directed the Carl Vinson strike group to sail north and report on station in the Western Pacific.  Reuters and other news outlets reported on April 11 that the movement would take more than a week. The Navy, for security reasons, says it does not report future operational locations of its ships.  Defense Secretary Jim Mattis initially appeared to play down the deployment on April 11, saying the Vinson was just on her way up there because thats where we thought it was most prudent to have her at this time.  Theres not a specific demand signal or specific reason why were sending her up there, he said.  But even Mattis initially misspoke about the strike groups itinerary, telling a news conference that the Vinson had pulled out of an exercise with Australia.  The Pentagon has since corrected the record, saying the ships planned port visit to Fremantle, Australia, was canceled - not the exercise with Australias navy.  On April 15, the U.S. Navy even published a photo showing the Vinson transiting the Sunda Strait. here From April 16-18, the website www.gonavy.jp/CVLocation.html reported that the Vinson was in the Indian Ocean.  A U.S. military official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Vinson carried out the exercises after passing through the Sunda Strait and wrapped them up this week.

Oil interest groups, including the American Petroleum Institute and the Texas Oil and Gas Association, had petitioned the EPA a year ago to reconsider the rule limiting emissions of   methane and other pollutants from new and revamped oil and gas wells and systems.  The EPA said in a statement that it would delay the rules June 3 compliance date by 90 days and take public comments during that period. Under Democratic President Barack Obama, the EPA released the first methane limits on the facilities in May 2016, saying it would cost energy companies $530 million, but would lead to $690 million in benefits, including lowering medical bills.  Scott Pruitt, the EPA chief in the administration of Republican President Donald Trump, joined dozens of other states  in challenging the rule when he was attorney general of oil-producing Oklahoma. Pruitt has said he does not believe that greenhouse gas emissions are the main driver of climate change.  Energy companies had complained that the methane rule would add costs to wells that were not producing much oil and gas, and that it was duplicative as the sector had already reduced the emissions. Environmentalists believe limiting methane, a gas about 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide in trapping heat, is a low-hanging fruit in efforts to curb climate change.  Michelle Robinson, director of the clean vehicles program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said EPA was favoring industry over science. Instead of looking backwards to review well-reasoned rules based on clear science, the administration should be moving forward, and extend methane limits, she said.  Wednesdays move signaled another retreat from climate change action after the Trump administration in March halted an effort to gather methane data from existing oil and gas operations to rein in leaks of the powerful greenhouse gas. In late March, Trump signed an order to undo climate regulations, following up on a campaign promise.  Pruitt said the EPA is continuing to follow through with Trumps order. American businesses should have the opportunity to review new requirements, assess economic impacts and report back, before those new requirements are finalized, he said.

I have the full support of Speaker (Paul) Ryan to continue as Chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. That said, I have made a personal decision to return to the private sector, Chaffetz said in a statement on Facebook.  The conservative Republican, who was first elected to the House in 2008 and represents a district in eastern Utah, gained prominence as head of the committee that was investigating Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clintons use of a private email server. During the raucous 2016 presidential campaign that pitted Clinton against Trump, Chaffetz distanced himself from the Republican candidate following the public airing of a video last year in which Trump made lewd comments about women. But as Trump appeared to weather that storm and was competitive with Clinton in the homestretch to the Nov. 8 election, Chaffetz moderated his criticism of the New York real estate developer. With Trump in the White  House, Chaffetz early this year said he would use his committee chairmanship to continue investigating Clinton. But he refused to look into contacts that Trumps national security adviser, Michael Flynn, had with a Russian official amid suspicions that Moscow played a role in influencing the U.S. elections. Flynn has since left his high-level White House job.

Pence arrived in Tokyo on Tuesday from South Korea and reassured Japan of U.S. commitment to reining in North Koreas nuclear and missile ambitions in a series of meetings with Japanese leaders, including Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Speaking aboard the USS Ronald Reagan, a Nimitz class aircraft carrier undergoing scheduled maintenance at its home port of Yokosuka, Pence said U.S. intentions remained unwavering in the face of the threat posed by the reclusive North, which has conducted a series of missile and nuclear tests in defiance of U.N. sanctions, most recently with a failed missile launch on Sunday.  Those who would challenge our resolve or readiness should know, we will defeat any attack and beat any use of conventional or nuclear weapons with an overwhelming and effective American response, Pence said to loud applause, reiterating that all options are on the table in dealing with Pyongyang. Pence made his remarks as the White House grappled with controversy over the location of the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier strike group that U.S. President Donald Trump said last week had been sent to near the Korean peninsula as a warning to North Korea, but which headed towards Australia instead. Pence did not mention the Carl Vinson or the controversy. Pence said he had spoken with Trump and by 2020 some 60 percent of the U.S. naval fleet would be in the region and Japans role would grow. The United States will strengthen its presence in the Asia Pacific, he said. Japan will assume a larger role and responsibility in our alliance in the years ahead. Defence officials from the United States, South Korea and Japan, who were in Tokyo for trilateral security talks, said in a statement North Korea should give up its weapons development irrevocably. The officials call on North Korea to abandon its nuclear and ballistic missile programs in a complete, verifiable, and irrevocably manner, to cease its provocative actions that only increase tensions in the region, they said.        A senior North Korean official said in an interview with the BBC this week that North Korea would conduct missile tests on a weekly, monthly and yearly basis, and any military action against it by the United States would prompt all-out war. North Koreas deputy representative to the United Nations, Kim In Ryong, accused the United States on Monday of creating a situation where nuclear war could break out an any time and said the Norths next nuclear test would take place at a time and at a place where our headquarters deems necessary. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said all parties should make efforts to resolve the situation. China expresses serious concern with recent trends about North Koreas nuclear and missile development, he said.  The situation was tense and China was resolutely opposed to any words or actions that could further raise tension, he added.   North Korea regularly threatens to destroy Japan, South Korea and the United States and it showed no let-up in its belligerence after the failed missile test on Sunday, a day after putting on a huge display of missiles at a parade in Pyongyang.

The United States, Japan and South Korea have also issued sanctions on North Korea, but they are not binding on other countries. The United Nations has blacklisted 39 North Korean individuals and 42 entities, which are subject to a travel ban and asset freeze. U.N. member states are obliged to enforce the sanctions, which are far-reaching and comprehensive. However, many include gray areas and exceptions which are subject to interpretation. The following U.N. sanctions are currently in force: North Korea is under a total U.N. arms embargo. The sale of all arms and related materiel is banned. Any financial transactions related to the procurement of North Korean arms are also included under the sanctions.  The embargo has been in place since 2006 and was expanded in 2009 to include small arms and light weapons. North Korea is also prohibited from selling helicopters under U.N. sanctions. Under U.N. sanctions, North Korea is banned or partially banned from selling coal, iron, iron ore, gold, titanium ore, vanadium ore, copper, nickel, silver, zinc and rare earth minerals. Coal exports are allowed up to a maximum of $400.87 million or 7,500,000 metric tonnes a year, whichever is lower, provided U.N. member states do not purchase the coal from a sanctioned entity, and can prove that the coal is for livelihood purposes. China, North Koreas biggest trade partner, said in February it would suspend all imports of coal from North Korea for the rest of the year as part of its efforts to implement the sanctions.   Externally-sourced coal which transits through the North Korean city of Rason, where Russia maintains a warm-water port, is exempt from the ban. Sales of North Korean copper, nickel, silver and zinc are completely banned under U.N. sanctions. Only sales of aviation fuel, jet fuel and rocket fuel to North Korea are banned under U.N. sanctions. The ban does not apply to North Korean civilian aircraft, including state airline Air Koryo. There are no restrictions on crude oil or other oil products. Any financial services which contribute to North Koreas banned missile and nuclear programs, or help Pyongyang evade sanctions, are banned by the United Nations. Member states are prohibited from opening branches, subsidiaries or offices of North Korean banks. Joint ventures, ownership, or correspondent banking relationships with North Korean banks is banned.  Member states are required to expel and repatriate any individuals working for a North Korean bank or institution on their territory, and limit the number of bank accounts for North Korean diplomatic missions. U.N. member states are required to de-register any vessel which is owned, operated or crewed by North Korea, meaning North Korean-owned ships cannot fly the flag of another country, which has been one way of evading detection. Member states are also not allowed to provide insurance services to North Korean ships. North Korea is prohibited from selling its ships under U.N. sanctions. It also cannot provide North Korean crews to ships from other countries. The U.N. has not sanctioned North Koreas state-owned airline, Air Koryo. It has, however, banned the sale of aviation fuel, jet fuel and rocket fuel to North Korea, but Air Koryo and any North Korean civilian aircraft refueling overseas are exempt from this. U.N. member states are required to prohibit, inspect or deny landing of any North Korean aircraft within their territory they suspect to be carrying banned items, or taking part in any prohibited activities.  Separately, the United States has unilaterally sanctioned Air Koryo, banning its citizens from doing business with the airline. It is unclear, however, if the sanctions cover U.S. citizens using the airline to travel to North Korea for tourism. U.N. member states are required to inspect any cargo destined for, coming from or brokered by North Korea, whether by air, sea, road or rail. This includes the inspection of checked or carry-on baggage of people traveling to or from North Korea. It is illegal under U.N. sanctions to directly or indirectly supply luxury goods to North Korea. In the case of North Korea, the U.N. defines luxury goods as: Jewellery and precious stones, yachts, luxury cars, racing cars, luxury watches, snowmobiles, jet skis, recreational sports equipment, tableware worth more than $100 and rugs or tapestries worth more than $500. The resolutions require member states to reduce the number of staff at North Korean diplomatic missions. North Korean diplomats or consular officials are only allowed one bank account each. The use of real estate for any non-diplomatic or consular activities in member states territories is banned. The training of or by North Koreans in military, police and paramilitary techniques is banned.  With the exception of medical exchanges, U.N. member states are not allowed to provide training or cooperation in the fields of nuclear science, aerospace, advanced manufacturing and advanced aeronautical, chemical, mechanical, electrical or industrial engineering.

(Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Tuesday ordered a review of the U.S. visa program for bringing high-skilled foreign workers into the country, putting technology firms and the outsourcing companies that serve them on notice that possible changes may be ahead. Seeking to carry out a campaign pledge to put America First, Trump signed an executive order on the H-1B visa program. It was vague on many fronts, and did not change existing rules, but one objective, said Trump aides, is to modify or replace the current lottery for H-1B visas with a merit-based system that would restrict the visas to highly skilled workers. Indian nationals are the largest group of H-1B recipients annually. Such a change could affect companies, such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Cognizant Tech Solutions Corp and Infosys Ltd, that connect U.S. technology companies with thousands of foreign engineers and programmers. None responded to requests for comment. Trump announced the order and made remarks at a visit to the headquarters of Snap-On Inc, a tool maker in Wisconsin. In addition to addressing the visas issue, he also ordered a review of government procurement rules favoring American companies to see if they are actually benefiting, especially the U.S. steel industry. With this action, we are sending a powerful signal to the world: Were going to defend our workers, protect our jobs and finally put America first, Trump said. Trump was a businessman before he was elected president last year, and his companies have been criticized for using visa programs to fill positions at Trump properties with foreign workers. Trump-branded products are also made overseas. 100-DAY BENCHMARK As he nears the 100-day benchmark of his presidency, Trump still has no major legislative achievements. With his attempts to overhaul healthcare and tax law stalled in Congress, Trump has leaned heavily on executive orders to change policy. It was unclear whether the latest such order would yield immediate results. The H-1B visas section included no definite timeline. The government procurement section did. We hope the goal of President Trumps executive order on the H-1B program is mend it, dont end it, said Robert Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a technology industry group. Going to a more merit-based H-1B system could attract more people with advanced science and technology skills, Atkinson said in a statement. But he said some ideas could make the system ineffective, such as requiring advertisement of job openings for long periods to prove the unavailability of U.S. workers. Democrats said Trumps order was not strong enough, and too late, after thousands of visas were awarded this month in this years lottery. For a president who has prided himself on his swift action when it comes to immigration, an interagency review of the program is a guarded and timid approach. Its too little, too late, said U.S. Senator Dick Durbin, the No.2 Democrat in the Senate. Critics of the program say most H-1B visas are awarded for lower-paid jobs at outsourcing firms, many based in India. That takes work away from Americans, lowers wages and keeps Americans from being trained in tech-related fields, they say.   Right now, widespread abuse in our immigration system is allowing American workers of all backgrounds to be replaced by workers brought in from other countries, Trump said. Tech companies have been bracing for Trump to make changes to the H-1B program. The visas are intended to go to foreign nationals in occupations that generally require specialized knowledge, such as science, engineering or computer programming. The government uses a lottery to award 65,000 visas yearly and randomly distributes another 20,000 to graduate student workers. Critics say the lottery benefits outsourcing firms that flood the system with mass applications for visas for lower-paid information technology workers.     Right now H-1B visas are awarded in a totally random lottery and thats wrong. Instead, they should be given to the most skilled and highest paid applicants and they should never, ever be used to replace Americans, Trump said. More than 15 percent of Facebook Incs U.S. employees in 2016 used a temporary work visa, according to a Reuters analysis of U.S. Labor Department filings. Facebook did not respond to requests for comment. Infosys, Indias No. 2 IT services firm, has said previously that it is ramping up work on on-site development centers in the United States to train local talent in an effort to address the visa regulation changes under consideration. It warned last week that onerous changes to U.S. visa rules could affect its earnings.   NASSCOM, the Indian IT service industrys main lobbying group, said it backs efforts to root out H-1B abuses, but said the idea that H-1B visa holders are cheap labor is inaccurate. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged Washington in February to be open minded on admitting skilled Indian workers. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

President Donald Trump recently ordered a review of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law that created the CFPB after the 2007-09 financial crisis to protect individuals from fraud and bad lending, with an eye to cutting it down. Meanwhile, Congress is considering legislation to radically reorganize the CFPB in a way that many bureau supporters say would defang it.  That could be a blow for thousands of mortgage borrowers who have used the CFPBs dispute resolution to act as an intermediary in their cases, the managing editor of Trulias economics research team, David Weidner, wrote in an analysis released on Wednesday.  Using complaint data from the CFPB spanning Dec. 1, 2011 through April 10, 2017, Trulia found that borrowers in housing markets hardest hit by the mortgage crisis and those in expensive areas rely heavily on the CFPB for help in dealing with their loans. The complaint rate was highest in Miami, Florida - with 1.6 percent of mortgage holders turning to the bureau compared to 0.46 percent nationally. Even though members of the armed services only represent 1.2 percent of the working age population, they made up 5 percent of all mortgage complaints. In the same vein, people 62 or older represented 10 percent of complaints. That was a high proportion given that roughly 80 percent of Americans own their own homes by the time they turn 65, Trulia said. The researchers also found that since 2012 complaints for Veterans Affairs, Federal Housing Administration and reverse mortgages have spiked.  The first two are part of federal programs intended to make housing more affordable for veterans and low-income workers.  Reverse mortgages are payments financial services firms make to people who own their homes, with the principal, interest and fees deducted from the future sale of the house. They are increasingly popular among retirees who may own real estate but are short on cash. For all three types of loans, complaints more than doubled in just four years, according to Trulia, which said the high rate was caused by the lack of expertise lenders and servicers may have in the specialized products.

North Koreas Vice Foreign Minister Han Song-Ryol told the BBC that missiles would be tested on a weekly, monthly and yearly basis.  The North has warned of a nuclear strike against the United States if provoked. It has said it has developed a missile that can strike the mainland United States, but officials and experts believe it is some time away from mastering the necessary technology, including miniaturizing a nuclear warhead. Pence said on Monday the world had seen Trumps resolve in the past two weeks, with a U.S. missile attack on a Syrian airfield and the dropping of a powerful non-nuclear bomb on Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan. The Trump administration has said military action remains an option for dealing with North Korea. But, mindful that this would likely trigger massive retaliation and casualties in South Korea and Japan, U.S. officials say Trumps main focus is on tougher economic sanctions. U.S. officials say tougher sanctions could include an oil embargo, a global ban on North Koreas airline, intercepting cargo ships and punishing Chinese banks doing business with Pyongyang. They also say greater Chinese cooperation is vital. Susan Thornton, acting U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asia, said Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Chinas top diplomat, State Councillor Yang Jiechi, agreed in a phone call on Sunday on the need for strict enforcement of U.N. resolutions. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi repeated Chinas line that the crisis could only be resolved by diplomacy. Ive seen that the United States has reiterated it is willing to use political and diplomatic means to resolve this, as this is their first choice, he told reporters in Beijing. Of course I think that any country will feel that political diplomatic means are of course the first choice, Wang said.  Pences economic discussions in Tokyo will be closely watched to see how hard a line Washington is prepared to take on trade. Trump campaigned on an America first platform, and has vowed to narrow big trade deficits with nations such as China and Japan. However, Trump has also shown willingness to link trade to other issues, saying he would cut a better trade deal with China if it exerts influence on North Korea. China banned imports of North Korean coal, its most important export, in February, and Chinese media have raised the possibility of restricting oil shipments to the North. But North Korea used Chinese-made trucks to display missiles at the military parade on Saturday, according to photographs, underlining the difficulty in enforcing U.N. sanctions. China and North Korea maintain normal contacts, including normal business contacts, said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang, when asked about the trucks. At the same time, as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, China strictly adheres to its international responsibilities, including those from Security Council resolutions, Lu told a daily briefing. Impoverished North Korea and the rich, democratic South are technically still at war because their 1950-1953 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. South Korea hosts 28,500 U.S. troops to counter the threat from the North. Trumps decision to launch a missile strike against Syria, a Russian ally, drop a giant bomb on Afghanistan and stick with Obama-era policies on Crimea mean Russian hopes of him befriending the Kremlin have been on the slide. Russian state media, which hailed his election win, have made a U-turn. On Sunday, media said he was scarier than North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump promised on Tuesday to defend American dairy farmers who have been hurt by Canadas protectionist trade practices, during a visit to the cheese-making state of Wisconsin. Canadas dairy sector is protected by high tariffs on imported products and controls on domestic production as a means of supporting prices that farmers receive. It is frequently criticized by other dairy-producing countries.  Were also going to stand up for our dairy farmers, Trump said in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Because in Canada some very unfair things have happened to our dairy farmers and others. Trump did not detail his concerns, but promised his administration would call the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and demand an explanation. Its another typical one-sided deal against the United States and its not going to be happening for long, Trump said. Trump also reiterated his threat to eliminate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Canada and Mexico if it cannot be changed.  U.S. dairy industry groups want Trump to urge Trudeau to halt a pricing policy that has disrupted some U.S. dairy exports and prioritize dairy market access in NAFTA renegotiation talks. A WTO complaint would be a last resort because it would take five or six years to come to any resolution, said Jaime Castaneda, senior vice president for the U.S. Dairy Export Council. Canadas dairy farmers agreed last year to sell milk ingredients used for cheese-making to Canadian processors, which include Saputo Inc and Parmalat Canada Inc [PLTPRC.UL] at prices competitive with international rates. The pricing agreement was a response to growing U.S. exports of milk proteins that were not subject to Canadas high tariffs. Canadas envoy to Washington on Tuesday sent a letter to the governors of New York and Wisconsin - both major dairy states - saying U.S. producers problems stemmed from overproduction rather than Canadian policy. In the letter, released by Ottawa, ambassador David MacNaughton said Canadas dairy industry was less protectionist than its U.S. counterpart. Industry groups in New Zealand, Australia, the European Union, Mexico and the United States complained the new prices for Canadian milk ingredients under-cut exports to Canada.     President Trumps reaction is not surprising. He is defending his domestic dairy industry, said Jacques Lefebvre, CEO of Dairy Processors Association of Canada. Further communications with the Canadian government will broaden his perspective.  The Dairy Farmers of Canada said it was confident Ottawa would continue to protect and defend the dairy industry.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""DETROIT/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trumps Buy American, Hire American executive order on Tuesday left questions about how the government would enforce the order and whether it would make a real difference in output and employment, according to steel executives and analysts.     Buy American provisions already exist in U.S. law but policing them has been difficult because of waivers granted to foreign companies that undercut their U.S. counterparts on pricing. Earlier on Tuesday, Trump ordered a review of government procurement rules favoring American companies to see if they are actually benefiting, especially the U.S. steel industry. Trumps executive order promises to properly police those provisions, but avoided detail about how that will happen.       Bill Hickey, president of Chicago-based Lapham-Hickey Steel, which has seven steel mills in the Midwest and Northeast, said he has heard talk of Buy American for decades, but American or foreign contractors frequently find loopholes to use imported steel.      Politicians all talk the same, but at the end of the day it just doesnt work, Hickey said, citing waivers to existing provisions.      Charles Bradford of Bradford Research said focusing on Buy American for U.S. steel does not take into account that some steel products - including tin plate and semi-finished products - are not made in the United States. So if enforced improperly, it could cause supply problems in a U.S. market in which up to 25 percent of steel was imported in the first quarter of this year.      The people who have pushed for this dont have a clue and they dont know math, said Bradford. Cutting off the supply of goods not made in the United States would create fresh problems for U.S. companies, he said. In the construction industry, there also are concerns over too strict a definition of what constitutes U.S.-made steel products, said Kenneth Simonson, chief economist of the Associated General Contractors of America.  Simonson cited concerns with steel that might have been melted down from scrap metal that could have come from outside the United States, for example, and tracing its origins before that point. Trumps White House track record so far also helps fuel skepticism inside the industry. Instead of bold action promised last year by then-candidate Trump on the North American Free Trade Agreement, on China, and free trade agreements, the new administration has not shown much evidence of doing so, said KeyBanc Capital Markets steel analyst Philip Gibbs.     Im a lot less optimistic than I was three-and-a-half months ago because so far what Ive seen coming out of the Trump administration is the same as the prior administration, he added. As a result, Gibbs said investors should dial back expectations that Trump will do anything meaningful on trade, or on infrastructure which is where such an order could make a difference.  Investors seemed to shrug off Tuesdays executive order.   Nucor Corp shares closed up 0.2 percent at $57.33, AK Steel Holding Corp gained a penny to end at $6.32 and United States Steel Corp closed down 0.5 percent at $28.73.      AK Steel did not respond to requests for comment. Nucor and U.S. Steel both welcomed the presidents executive order.     The move was welcomed by labor unions. The United Steelworkers said that under current practice, contractors often try to avoid the law through loopholes to buy cheap and often substandard foreign products like many from China. Thomas Gibson, chief executive of lobby group the American Iron and Steel Institute, said in a statement that Buy American provisions are vital to the health of the domestic steel industry, and have helped create manufacturing jobs and build American infrastructure.      Veteran steel industry analyst Michelle Applebaum said while it remains to be seen how thoroughly the Trump administration will police the steel industry, the executive order sends a clear message to steel importers.    Trump has just created more risk for anyone who wants to import steel, she said. If he puts money behind enforcement that will force people to play by the rules and that will be a good thing.

Trump tells the Treasury Department to examine two powers given to regulators to police large financial companies following the 2008 financial crisis. South Korea says it is on heightened alert ahead of another important anniversary in North Korea, with a large concentration of military hardware amassed on both sides of the border amid concerns about a new nuclear test by Pyongyang. Trump, striving to make good on a top campaign promise, is pushing fellow Republicans who control Congress to pass revamped healthcare legislation but the same intraparty squabbling that torpedoed it last month could do it again. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis says Syria has dispersed its warplanes in recent days and that it retains chemical weapons, an issue he says will have to be taken up diplomatically. The Department of Justice threatens to cut off funding to California as well as eight cities and counties across the United States, escalating a Trump administration crackdown on so-called sanctuary cities that do not cooperate with federal immigration authorities. The United States will not make an exception for American companies, including oil major Exxon Mobil Corp, seeking to drill in areas prohibited by U.S. sanctions on Russia, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says.  Trump and his fellow Republicans who control Congress face their first major budget test next week, with the threat of a government shutdown potentially hinging on his proposed Mexican border wall as well as Obamacare funding.

Ivey last week replaced fellow Republican Robert Bentley as governor after he resigned amid impeachment proceedings in the legislature. Bentley had appointed Republican Luther Strange in February to fill the seat Sessions held before joining President Donald Trumps cabinet. Citing concerns about the cost of a special election, Bentley opted to wait until the 2018 general election for voters to elect Sessions replacement. The states new governor said Alabama law required a speedier timetable. The primary election will now be held on Aug. 15 and the general vote will be on Dec. 12, Iveys office said. I promised to steady our ship of state. This means following the law, which clearly states the people should vote for a replacement U.S. senator as soon as possible, Ivey said in an emailed statement. Following the law trumps the expense of a special election, she said. Strange, who was previously Alabamas attorney general, said he would have run for the Senate seat even if he had not been appointed by Bentley. As Ive said for months, Im a candidate and Im ready to run whether the election is next month or next year, Strange said in an emailed statement. The new date pleased Alabama Auditor Jim Zeigler, a Republican who filed suit against Bentley last month seeking to force a quicker special election. Zeigler told Reuters he considered Bentleys appointment of Strange questionable. As Alabamas attorney general, Strange in November had put a hold on the state legislatures impeachment proceedings against Bentley. We need a people-elected senator, not a senator appointed by a failed, disgraced former governor, Zeigler said. In his statement, Strange said he agreed that the people of Alabama should decide who represents them in the U.S. Senate. In an interview with local media last week, after Bentley resigned, Strange said he had asked the legislature to put the impeachment process on hold last November before the presidential election because his office was conducting an investigation of Bentley similar to the legislators efforts.

House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady told Fox News he would soon announce a hearing schedule to examine his House tax reform blueprint with its proposal to tax imports, a plan that appears to have lost ground as the White House works to unveil its own approach. The investment consulting firm Veda Partners advised clients on Tuesday to expect an April 27 hearing on the import tax proposal known as the border adjustment tax, or BAT. Bradys committee could not confirm the date or topic, but he told Fox News the committee will soon be announcing congressional hearings on our blueprint starting next week.  He also acknowledged that the tax reform timeline could slip as House Republicans try to reach agreement to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, following their failed attempt to pass healthcare legislation in March. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said this week that tax reform may not get done before an August deadline.  We probably ought not be focused on the month but the year that it happens, which is this year, Brady said. If it moves a little past August and still lands in this year, its going to be an incredible achievement. Much of the debate has focused on the House Republican BAT proposal, which would impose a 20 percent tax on imports, while exempting exports from taxation. The proposal is opposed by import-dependent industries and Republicans who worry it could lead to higher consumer prices. Tax experts say the proposals future depends on whether the White House backs it. President Donald Trump, who dislikes the term border adjustment, said on Tuesday his tax reform plan would create a level playing field for U.S. industry - a phrase widely viewed as referring to some kind of border tax. Brady identified the critical elements of legislation as significant rate reduction, full and immediate expensing for capital investments and a simplified tax code.   He cautioned against straightforward rate reductions of the kind that some in Congress have begun to consider. A rate cut alone would have worked in the 1980s.

U.S. President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe arranged the economic dialogue between their deputies at a Washington summit in February, soon after Trump took office. Today we are beginning a process of economic dialogue, the end of which may result in bilateral trade negotiations in the future, Pence told a news conference with Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso, his counterpart at Tuesdays talks. At some point in the future, there may be a decision made between our nations to take what we have learned in this dialogue and commence formal negotiations for a free trade agreement, he said. But I leave that for the future. The comments dash the hopes of Japanese policymakers, who have said they want to avoid use of the economic dialogue as a forum to discuss a bilateral FTA that may put them under U.S. pressure to open up highly-protected areas like agriculture. They also echo those of U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who told reporters that Washington was eager to increase trade ties with Tokyo through a two-way pact. Trump campaigned for office on an America First platform, saying he would boost U.S. manufacturing jobs and shrink the countrys trade deficit with countries like Japan. Trump also abandoned the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) backed by predecessor Barack Obama and Abe, and vowed to revisit regional trade deals to focus on two-way agreements. Pence said the TPP was a thing of the past and Washington would not wait forever for results from the talks. When President Trump agreed to this dialogue, he envisioned this as a mechanism for enhancing bilateral commercial relations between the United States and Japan, and achieving results in the near future. And I share that vision and impatience, Pence told Aso at the start of the talks. Aso in turn said U.S.-Japan trade friction, which soured ties in the 1980s and 1990s, was in the distant past and the allies were now entering an era of cooperation. In the past, U.S.-Japan economic relations have started from friction, but were entering a new area where we start from cooperation, he told the news conference. Instead of one side telling the other what to do, I want to start debate on a relationship that is mutual and strategic. In a statement after the talks, the two sides said they had agreed the dialogue should produce concrete results in the near term. They agreed to hold a second round of talks before the end of the year. Ross, seen as more hardline on trade, was also visiting Tokyo and met Japans trade minister Hiroshige Seko, a sign a bilateral trade deal was among Washingtons top priorities. Its a little bit early to say just what forms things will take, but we are certainly eager to increase our trade relationships with Japan, and to do so in the form of an agreement, Ross said when asked about a possible free trade pact. Pence arrived in Tokyo from South Korea, where he visited the heavily fortified border separating the North and South. He described the U.S.-Japan alliance as the cornerstone of regional security. Pences 10-day tour of Asia aims at emphasising that U.S. President Donald Trump wants to boost U.S. trade in the region, despite scrapping the TPP. Japan had a $69-billion trade surplus with the United States last year, the U.S. Treasury Department has said, expressing concern over what it called the persistence of the imbalance.  Japanese officials counter that Tokyo accounts for a much smaller chunk of Americas deficit than in the past, while Chinas imbalance is much bigger. Trump has complained Japan keeps its currency artificially low, although a Treasury Department report last week did not label Japan a currency manipulator. However, currencies did not figure in Tuesdays talks, a Japanese government official said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

U.S. President Donald Trump has taken a hard line with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who has rebuffed admonitions from China and proceeded with nuclear and missile programmes seen by Washington and others as a direct threat. On Saturday North Korea carried out a missile launch which the Pentagon said failed, blowing up almost immediately . Speaking with reporters on his way to the Middle East, Mattis said the most recent test was not an intercontinental ballistic missile but still a reckless move. It shows why we are working so closely right now with the Chinese... to try to get this under control and aim for the denuclearized Korean peninsula, Mattis said. Trump acknowledged on Sunday that the softer line he had taken on Chinas management of its currency was linked to its help on North Korea. The United States, its allies and China are working on a range of responses to North Koreas missile test, U.S. officials have said. China itself has spoken out against the Norths weapons tests and has supported U.N. sanctions.  It banned imports of North Korean coal on Feb. 26, cutting off its most important export and Chinese media has raised the possibility of restricting oil shipments to North Korea if it unleashed more provocations. On Monday U.S. Vice President Mike Pence put North Korea on notice, warning that recent U.S. strikes in Syria and Afghanistan showed that the Trump administrations resolve should not be tested. The Trump administration is focusing its strategy on tougher economic sanctions, possibly including an oil embargo, a global ban on its airline, intercepting cargo ships and punishing Chinese banks doing business with Pyongyang.

It has gone on for a long time, we see Iranian supplied missiles being fired by the Houthis into Saudi Arabia and this is something, with the number of innocent people dying inside Yemen, it has simply got to be brought to an end, Mattis told reporters on his way to Riyadh. Seven ceasefires brokered between government and rebel forces by the United Nations have failed while U.N.-backed peace talks have repeatedly broken down. We will work with our allies, with our partners to try to get it to the U.N.-brokered negotiating table, Mattis said. He gave no details on what additional support, if any, the United States would provide to the Saudi-led coalition. But he said he was looking to deepen and broaden the relationship between the two countries on the trip. Mattis is expected to meet senior Saudi officials including King Salman and Deputy Crown Prince and Defence Minister Mohammed bin Salman. Jon Alterman, head of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Saudi Arabia was concerned strategically about Iran, its main rival in a regional power struggle. The near-term Saudi concern is how they send a message to the Iranians in Yemen, and they would like full-throated American support, Alterman said. The review of possible U.S. assistance, which already includes intelligence support, would come amid evidence that Iran is sending advanced weapons and military advisers to the Houthis.  Congressional sources say the Trump administration is on the verge of notifying Congress of the proposed sale of precision-guided munitions to Saudi Arabia. Increased military support for the Saudi-led coalition could fuel controvesy over the air campaign, which has killed a number of civilians and destroyed infrastructure, including hospitals. The United States involvement in Yemen has also focused on battling al-Qaeda, whose affiliate there has taken advantage of the chaos caused by the war. Mattis will also be visiting Egypt, Qatar and Israel on a trip which may give clarity on the Trump administrations tactics in the fight against Islamic State militants and its willingness to use more military power than former President Barack Obama did. One of the main questions from allies about Syria is whether Washington has formulated a strategy to prevent areas seized from militants from collapsing into ethnic and sectarian feuds or succumbing to a new generation of extremism, as parts of Iraq and Afghanistan have done since the United States invaded them. U.S.-backed forces are fighting to retake the Islamic State strongholds of Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria, and questions remain about what will happen after that and what role other allies such as Saudi Arabia, can play.  Administration officials said the U.S. strategy in Syria  to defeat Islamic State while still calling for the removal of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad  is unchanged, a message Mattis is expected to reinforce.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""CHICAGO (Reuters) - An Illinois lawmaker on Monday introduced a bill to ban the forcible removal of travelers from flights by state or local government employees after a United Airlines passenger was dragged from an aircraft last week. The Airline Passenger Protection Act, sponsored by  Republican state Representative Peter Breen, came after Dr. David Dao, 69, was pulled from a United flight at Chicagos OHare International Airport to make space for four crew members.  The treatment of Dao sparked international outrage, as well as multiple apologies from the carrier, and raised questions about the overbooking policies of airlines. Under Breens measure, passengers could not be removed from flights unless they were presenting a danger to themselves or others, an emergency was taking place or the passenger had caused a serious disturbance, according to a copy of the bill introduced in the state capital, Springfield.    A commercial airline that removes validly seated customers without serious cause breaches the sacred trust between passengers and their airlines, the bill said.  The legislation would also bar the state of Illinois from making travel arrangements, doing business with or having investments in any commercial airline that maintained a policy of removing paying passengers to make room for employees traveling on non-revenue tickets.  Dao, who was traveling to Louisville, Kentucky, on April 9, suffered a broken nose, a concussion and lost two teeth when he was pulled from his seat by officers from the Chicago Department of Aviation to make room for four employees on the overbooked flight.  The three officers, who have not been named, were put on paid leave last week, the department said.  The treatment of the passenger in last weeks incident at OHare is inexcusable and must be stopped, Breen said in a statement. It reflected badly on the airline, the City of Chicago, and the State of Illinois. United Chief Executive Oscar Munoz on Monday again apologized for the incident. [nL1N1HP1HM] United said on Friday it was changing its policy on booking its flight crews onto its own planes. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Illinois bill. Lawyers for Dao have moved to preserve evidence from the flight, filing a motion to keep surveillance videos and other materials related to United Flight 3411 in preparation for a possible lawsuit.  The city and United agreed to preserve the evidence, Daos attorney said on Saturday. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"
"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court is set this week to hear a closely watched case testing the limits of religious rights, and new Justice Neil Gorsuchs judicial record indicates he could tip the court toward siding with a church challenging Missouris ban on state funding of religious entities. Trinity Lutheran Church, which is located in Columbia, Missouri and runs a preschool and daycare center, said Missouri unlawfully excluded it from a grant program providing state funds to nonprofit groups to buy rubber playground surfaces. Missouris constitution prohibits any church, sect or denomination of religion from receiving state taxpayer money. Gorsuch, who embraced an expansive view of religious rights as a Colorado-based federal appeals court judge, on Monday hears his first arguments since becoming a justice last week. He will be on the bench on Wednesday when the justices hear the Trinity Lutheran case, one of the most important of their current term. Gorsuch, appointed by President Donald Trump, restored the Supreme Courts 5-4 conservative majority. Trinity Lutheran wanted public funds to replace its playgrounds gravel with a rubber surface made from recycled tires that would be safer for children to play on. The U.S. Constitution calls for a separation of church and state and guarantees the free exercise of religion. At the very least, a victory for Trinity Lutheran would help religious organizations nationwide win public dollars for certain purposes, such as health and safety. But it also could bolster the case for using public money for vouchers to help pay for children to attend religious schools rather than public schools in school choice programs backed by many conservatives. For example, Colorados top court in 2015 found that a Douglas County voucher program violated a state constitutional provision similar to Missouris. Trinity Lutherans legal effort is being spearheaded by the Alliance Defending Freedom conservative Christian legal activist group, which argues Missouris policy violates the U.S. Constitutions guarantees of free exercise of religion and equal protection under the law. If the church wins, religious organizations cannot be excluded from general public welfare benefits that apply to everybody, said Erik Stanley, an alliance lawyer representing the church. Referring to Gorsuch, Stanley said, He has definitely been a friend of religious liberty. So we are hopeful that will continue when hes on the court, and were grateful he gets to participate on this important case.  In 2013, Gorsuch sided with the evangelical Christian owners of arts-and-crafts retailer Hobby Lobby and allowed owners of private companies to object on religious grounds to a provision in federal healthcare law requiring employers to provide medical insurance that pays for womens birth control. Gorsuch wrote in a concurring opinion that Hobby Lobbys owners faced a choice between exercising their faith or saving their business. The Supreme Court later affirmed the ruling. Missouri said there is nothing unconstitutional about its grant program. Trinity Lutheran remains free, without any public subsidy, to worship, teach, pray and practice any other aspect of its faith however it wishes. The state merely declines to offer financial support, the state said in legal papers. The church has drawn support from the religious community including the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, the Mormon Church and Jewish groups. Groups filing legal papers opposing Trinity Lutheran, including the American Civil Liberties Union, said government funding of churches is precisely what the Constitution forbids. Forcing states to provide cash to build church property could open the floodgates to programs that coerce taxpayers to underwrite religion, said Daniel Mach, director of the ACLUs program on freedom of religion and belief. Mach said three-quarters of the U.S. states have provisions like Missouris. Alliance Defending Freedom, which also opposes gay marriage, transgender protections and abortion, has another major case involving religion that the Supreme Court could take up in its term beginning in October. It represents a Colorado bakerys Christian owner who argues the Constitutions promise of religious freedom means he should not have to make a wedding cake for a gay couple. Trinity Lutheran sued in federal court in 2012. The St. Louis-based 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2015 upheld a trial courts dismissal of the suit. The appeals court said accepting the churchs arguments would be unprecedented, noting the Supreme Courts 2004 decision in the case Locke v. Davey that upheld a bar on Washington state scholarships for students preparing for the ministry. The justice who Gorsuch replaced, the late fellow conservative Antonin Scalia, was one of two dissenters in the Locke ruling. When a state withholds a generally available benefit solely on religious grounds, it is like an unconstitutional special tax on religion, Scalia said. Judicial observers have described Gorsuch as very much in the mold of Scalia. Missouris grant program was meant to keep tires out of landfills while also fostering childrens safety. The churchs brief to the high court stated, A rubber playground surface accomplishes the states purposes whether it cushions the fall of the pious or the profane.

Pence said the U.S. trade deficit has more than doubled in the five years since the U.S.-South Korea free trade agreement began and there are too many barriers for U.S. businesses in the country.  Pences meeting in Seoul with business leaders comes before he heads to Tokyo later on Tuesday, where he will meet Japans Finance Minister Taro Aso and kick off talks that Washington hopes will open doors for U.S.-made products.          U.S. President Donald Trump has vowed to narrow big trade deficits with nations like China and Japan, saying he would boost U.S. manufacturing jobs.  Thats the hard truth, Pence told an American Chamber of Commerce meeting in Seoul. We have to be honest about where our trade relationship is falling short, said Pence, adding the Trump administration would work with businesses on reforms. Trump campaigned on an America First pledge, promising to overhaul trade agreements that he said hurt U.S. jobs. Before the free trade agreement between the two countries took effect in 2012, South Koreas trade surplus against the United States stood at $11.6 billion at end-2011. In 2016, the surplus measured at $23.2 billion, according to official data. James Kim, CEO of GM Korea, said there are opportunities to improve the free trade deal between Washington and Seoul.

Gorsuch, whose confirmation to the lifetime job restored the courts conservative majority, exhibited composure and confidence, sitting on the far right of the bench in the ornate courtroom, alongside liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor. He appeared relaxed, gingerly sipping from a disposable coffee cup.  The justices, with the exception of the usually silent Clarence Thomas, are known for their aggressive questioning, and Gorsuch showed no qualms about jumping right in. Eight times during the course of three one-hour arguments Gorsuch peppered attorneys with a series of pointed questions. The court had its full complement of nine justices, five conservatives and four liberals, for arguments for the first time since Justice Antonin Scalias death in February 2016. Gorsuch formally joined the Supreme Court on April 10 after being confirmed three days earlier by the Republican-led Senate over broad Democratic opposition. The Coloradoan came across as temperamentally different from the sometimes hard-edged New Yorker Scalia, offering respectful but firm questioning even when the lawyer facing his queries seemed evasive. Im sorry for interrupting, counselor, Gorsuch told one of the lawyers in the second case, a property dispute from New York state. If you would just answer my question, I would be grateful. In the first case, an employment dispute, Gorsuch grilled lawyer Christopher Landau, who represented a man claiming he was discriminated against by the U.S. Census Bureau, over the fine points of a law governing civil service employees. Im sorry for taking up so much time, I apologize, Gorsuch said after his first lengthy exchange, sitting back in his high-backed chair and smiling. Chief Justice John Roberts welcomed Gorsuch to the court before oral arguments began. Justice Gorsuch, we wish you a long and happy career in our common calling, Roberts said. Gorsuch responded by thanking his new colleagues for their warm welcome. Gorsuch asked a string of questions about complicated federal law. As he indicated during his Senate confirmation hearing last month, his line of inquiry focused on the text of a statute, an approach also embraced by Scalia and other conservative jurists. Wouldnt it be a lot easier if we followed the plain text of the statute? What am I missing? Gorsuch asked government lawyer Brian Fletcher in the employment case. When Fletcher responded that he could give reasons for his interpretation, Gorsuch appeared unsatisfied. Not reasons. Where in the language? he asked, referring to the statute. The second case involved whether a developer can intervene in a lawsuit brought by a property owner against the town of Chester, New York over its refusal to give him permission to build on his land. One of the lawyers in the case, Neal Katyal, was a familiar face to Gorsuch, having heartily endorsed his nomination, even testifying at his Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing. Katyal, who served as acting solicitor general in Democratic former President Barack Obamas Justice Department, represented the town. Gorsuch sparred with a lawyer for a developer hoping to build on the land but did not directly engage with Katyal. The third case involved a dispute over whether certain securities class-action lawsuits can be barred because they were filed too late. Gorsuch, who at 49 could remain on the court for decades, served for a decade on the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals before Trump nominated him in January. Trump was able to fill Scalias vacancy only because Senate Republicans last year refused to consider Obamas nominee Merrick Garland. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

At Saturdays parade to mark the 105th birth anniversary of founder president Kim Il Sung, North Korea displayed six Pukkuksong submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM) for the first time, towed behind trucks painted in North Korean navy camouflage. In the photographs, the logo of Chinese firm Sinotruk can be seen on the vehicles.  Last year, Reuters reported that North Korea was using  Sinotruk HOWO trucks to display a new mobile artillery system.  A Sinotruk sales official said on Tuesday he was not aware the companys trucks had been used in this years parade. From my understanding, we havent had any business with the North Korean market since last year; North Korea has never been a major focus of ours, said the official, who gave only his last name, Gu. It may have been from before then and they refitted it themselves. China and North Korea maintain normal contacts, including normal business contacts, said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang, when asked about the trucks. At the same time, as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, China strictly adheres to its international responsibilities, including those from Security Council resolutions, Lu told a daily news briefing.  Since 2006, it has been against United Nations sanctions to ship military hardware into North Korea but control of equipment and vehicles that have dual-use military and civilian  applications has been far less stringent. It is also much harder to track. North Korean state media has in the past released images of Sinotruk chassis and cabins in propaganda related to construction or mining. A U.N. report which noted the use of the trucks in the display of mobile artillery last year did not name Sinotruk, but said that the Chinese seller had included a clear clause in its deal with the North Korean buyer that the trucks were to be for civilian use only. North Korea also appeared to reveal two new types of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) during Saturdays parade. One was mounted on a large off-road truck which was identified in an earlier U.N. report as being of Chinese origin. In a 2010 statement sent to China, North Koreas forestry ministry said the trucks were bought to transport timber, according to the U.N. report. The second of the two ICBMs was mounted on a North Korean-branded Taekpaeksan military truck which used tyres made by China-based Triangle Group, according to photos of the parade seen by Reuters. Triangle Group, a major tyre manufacturer headquartered in Weihai, a port city in eastern Shandong province, said it was not aware its tyres had been used in the military parade.  Its possible they were resold from somewhere else, an official from Triangles export department said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Trump tells the Treasury Department to examine two powers given to regulators to police large financial companies following the 2008 financial crisis. South Korea says it is on heightened alert ahead of another important anniversary in North Korea, with a large concentration of military hardware amassed on both sides of the border amid concerns about a new nuclear test by Pyongyang. Trump, striving to make good on a top campaign promise, is pushing fellow Republicans who control Congress to pass revamped healthcare legislation but the same intraparty squabbling that torpedoed it last month could do it again. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis says Syria has dispersed its warplanes in recent days and that it retains chemical weapons, an issue he says will have to be taken up diplomatically. The Department of Justice threatens to cut off funding to California as well as eight cities and counties across the United States, escalating a Trump administration crackdown on so-called sanctuary cities that do not cooperate with federal immigration authorities. The United States will not make an exception for American companies, including oil major Exxon Mobil Corp, seeking to drill in areas prohibited by U.S. sanctions on Russia, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says.

The accord, agreed on by nearly 200 countries in Paris in 2015, aims to limit planetary warming in part by slashing carbon dioxide and other emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. Under the pact, the United States committed to reducing its emissions by 26 to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025. Trump has said the United States should cancel the deal, but he has been mostly quiet on the issue since he was elected last November. Environmental groups want Washington to remain in the Paris agreement, even if the new administration weakens U.S. pledges. A White House official said Trumps aides would discuss the options, with the goal of providing a recommendation to the president about the path forward. The meeting comes before a summit of the Group of Seven wealthy nations in late May, the deadline for the White House to take a position. White House officials, led by the National Economic Council, have recently been asking publicly traded energy companies for advice on whether to stay in the agreement. Peabody Energy has consulted with White House officials, and Cloud Peak Energy Inc confirmed to Reuters it had told White House advisers it was in its interests for the United States to remain in the agreement to ensure there was a global role for high-efficiency coal plants. On Monday, liquified natural gas exporter Cheniere Energy sent a letter to George David Banks, who handles international energy issues at the NEC, to recommend remaining in the Paris agreement so the United States can leverage competitive advantages in natural gas and energy technology.

Perry, a former Texas governor, at his confirmation hearings in January softened a previous position that the science behind climate change was phony.  Last week, Pruitt, a former Oklahoma attorney general, said the United States should exit the agreement because it was a bad deal for the country.

After a huge display of missiles in Pyongyang and a failed North Korean missile test during the weekend, U.S. officials praised China for stepping up efforts to rein in North Korea, Beijings neighbor and ally. But Pence and South Koreas acting president, Hwang Kyo-ahn, said they would proceed with the early deployment to South Korea of the U.S. THAAD missile-defense system, in spite of Chinese objections. At a White House Easter celebration on Monday, Trump was asked if he had a message for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, and replied: Gotta behave. But senior North Korean officials remained defiant. North Koreas deputy representative to the United Nations, Kim In Ryong, accused Washington of creating a situation where nuclear war could break out an any time and said Pyongyangs next nuclear test would take place at a time and at a place where our headquarters deems necessary. (Graphic - Carl Vinson strike group: tmsnrt.rs/2pqOMWA) (Graphic - North Korea's nuclear program: tmsnrt.rs/2n0gd92) North Koreas Vice Foreign Minister Han Song-Ryol told the BBC that missiles would continue to be tested on a weekly, monthly and yearly basis.  Kim Song Gyong, director general of the European Department of North Koreas Foreign Ministry, told Reuters in Pyongyang that if Washington made the slightest movement to make a nuclear strike on North Korea, Pyongyang would strike first and destroy the aggressors without any mercy. He went on to clarify that the approach of a U.S. naval strike force led by the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Carl Vinson to Korean waters would not be considered enough to constitute the slightest movement. Korean tensions have escalated following repeated North Korean missile tests and concerns that Pyongyang may soon conduct a sixth nuclear bomb test in defiance of U.N. sanctions. Washington is increasingly worried about North Korean efforts to develop a nuclear-tipped missile that could hit the U.S. mainland. Speaking alongside Hwang, Pence said the world had witnessed Trumps resolve in the past two weeks, which saw a U.S. missile attack on a Syrian airfield and the dropping of a powerful non-nuclear bomb on Islamic State in Afghanistan. North Korea would do well not to test his resolve or the strength of the armed forces of the United States in this region, Pence said on what was his first stop of a four-nation Asia tour intended to show that Trump is not turning his back on the increasingly volatile part of the world. Pence, whose father served in the 1950-53 Korean War, visited the North-South border on Monday and said Washington would stand by its ironclad alliance with South Korea. All options are on the table to achieve the objectives and ensure the stability of the people of this country, he told reporters as tinny propaganda music floated across from the North Korean side of the so-called demilitarized zone (DMZ). The Trump administration has said that military action remains an option for dealing with North Korea. But mindful that this would likely trigger massive retaliation and casualties in South Korea and Japan and among U.S. troops there, U.S. officials say the Trump administrations main focus is on tougher economic sanctions to try to get Pyongyang to abandon its weapons programs.    Trump himself, when asked on Monday if he was considering military action, told Fox News Channel he didnt want to telegraph his plans like the previous administration. Well see what happens. I hope things work out well, he said but added that the United States had tried to engage the North Koreans in talks for a long time.  On Sunday, Trumps national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, said that the United States, its allies and China were working on a range of responses to North Koreas latest missile test, citing what he called an international consensus to act. He indicated Trump was not considering military action for now, despite the dispatch the carrier group. U.S. officials say tougher sanctions could include an oil embargo, a global ban on North Koreas airline, intercepting cargo ships and punishing Chinese banks doing business with Pyongyang. They say greater Chinese cooperation is vital.  White House spokesman Sean Spicer said China had taken some very helpful steps, although it remained to be seen how effective these would be. Asked if Trump had a red line on North Korea, Spicer said the president did not believe these worked.  Susan Thornton, acting U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asia, said Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Chinas top diplomat, State Councilor Yang Jiechi, agreed in a phone call on Sunday on the need for strict enforcement of U.N. resolutions and for international action to press Pyongyang to cease provocative actions and recommit to peaceful denuclearization. Thornton said any new North Korean nuclear test would draw a pretty significant international response. Were definitely not seeking conflict or regime change, she said. But we are committed to defending our people and our allies should it be necessary. Pence is expected to discuss Korean tensions with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Tuesday when he travels to Tokyo for economic talks with Finance Minister Taro Aso. He will also visit Jakarta and Sydney. His economic discussions will be closely watched to see how hard a line Washington is prepared to take on trade. Trump campaigned on an America First platform, and has vowed to narrow big trade deficits with nations like China and Japan. But Trump has also shown willingness to link trade to other issues, saying he would cut a better trade deal with China if it exerts influence on North Korea. China has appeared increasingly frustrated with Pyongyang, speaking out against its weapons tests and supporting United Nations sanctions, while repeatedly calling for talks. China banned imports of North Korean coal, the countrys most important export, in February, and Chinese media have raised the possibility of restricting oil shipments to the North. However, Beijing says the crisis is one between the United States and North Korea.  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said the situation was highly sensitive, complicated and high risk and all sides should avoid taking provocative actions  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON/BOSTON (Reuters) - In a White House marked by infighting, top economic aide Gary Cohn, a Democrat and former Goldman Sachs banker, is muscling aside some of President Donald Trumps hard-right advisers to push more moderate, business-friendly economic policies. Cohn, 56, did not work on Republican Trumps campaign and only got to know him after the November election, but he has emerged as one of the administrations most powerful players in an ascent that rankles conservatives. Trump refers to his director of the National Economic Council (NEC), as one of my geniuses, according to one source close to Cohn. More than half a dozen sources on Wall Street and in the  White House said Cohn has gained the upper hand over Trumps chief strategist, Steve Bannon, the former head of the right-wing website Breitbart News and a champion of protectionist trade opposed by moderate Republicans and many big companies. Cohn is a key administration link to business executives and White House sources say he will lead the charge for Trump on top domestic priorities such as tax reform, infrastructure and deregulation.  Garys singular focus is tax reform and hes working to try and get that done in 2017, said Orin Snyder, a partner at law firm Gibson Dunn and a long-time friend of Cohn.  He is working to implement the presidents twin goals of economic growth and job creation. The tax plan will also include a reduction in the corporate rate, but also tax relief for middle- and low-income Americans. Some conservatives fear Cohn may push through a tax plan that is unnecessarily complicated and argue that including tax relief for middle- and low-income Americans would not spur economic growth as much as cuts focused entirely or mostly on businesses and entrepreneurs. Adam Brandon, president of the conservative group FreedomWorks, is disappointed Trump is not charging ahead with a plan unveiled last year during his campaign that would slash taxes on businesses and wealthy individuals.  That plan was shaped heavily by Stephen Moore, an economic policy expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank, who advised Trumps campaign. But it has since been shelved. I dont like the idea of scrapping it and starting over again, Brandon said. A senior administration official said the White House has started from scratch on the tax plan and, while setting business tax cuts as the highest priority, is consulting with lawmakers, economists and business leaders before taking it to the Republican-led Congress. Two administration officials said reports that the White House was considering a carbon tax and a value-added tax were incorrect, but that other ideas were on the table. We are considering a multitude of options for tax reform, a White House official said on Sunday. Associates of both Trump and Cohn say the two have developed a bond. People who have worked with Cohn say he is loyal, direct and assertive, traits that Trump likes.  Crucially, Cohn also has the trust of Jared Kushner, Trumps adviser and son-in-law, and his wife Ivanka, Trumps daughter. Cohn hired his staff more quickly than other top officials, building a reputation for competence in an administration hurt by early missteps over healthcare reform and a travel ban, the sources said. Gary is a huge asset to the Trump administration. Hell be of great help in eliminating unnecessary regulation, stimulating growth and reforming the tax code, said billionaire hedge fund manager John Paulson, an early backer of Trump who knows Cohn through Wall Street circles. The son of middle-class parents in Cleveland, Ohio, Cohn overcame dyslexia and worked in sales before elbowing his way into a position as a Wall Street trader and rising to become president and chief operating officer at Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N).  Kushner was a Goldman Sachs intern when he first crossed paths with Cohn. After Trumps election victory, Kushner paved the way for Cohn to meet the president-elect, who had spent much of the campaign blasting investment banks as modern-day robber barons. Trump soon named Cohn his NEC director. Apparently paying more heed to Cohn and other moderates on his team, Trump last week said he was open to reappointing Janet Yellen as Federal Reserve chairman when her term is up and he also held back from naming China a currency manipulator.  Both stances marked a reversal from his campaign when Trump criticized Yellen and vowed to label China a currency manipulator on day one of his administration, a move that could lead to punitive duties on Chinese goods. Sources close to Cohn and inside the White House said there are sharp policy differences between Cohn and both Bannon and Reince Priebus, White House chief of staff. A White House spokesperson denied there was a power struggle inside the West Wing.  Cohn has already put his stamp on regulatory policy by working with Kushner to successfully push Wall Street lawyer Jay Clayton for head of the Securities and Exchange Commission after billionaire investor Carl Icahn, an early Trump supporter, had vetted other candidates. Claytons nomination has been advanced to the Senate for a vote. The vacant Federal Reserve vice chairmans seat is a key regulatory role Cohn and his colleagues on the economic team want to fill soon. Cohn has interviewed nearly two dozen candidates and has whittled the list down. Randal Quarles, a veteran of the George W. Bush administration is one of several candidates left, a source familiar with the process said. Cohn will also take a leading role in developing Trumps infrastructure plan to rebuild airports, roads and bridges. The biggest challenge may be figuring out how to pay for the initiative, which Trump has estimated at $1 trillion. While conservatives are concerned by Cohn, they note that Bannon is still part of Trumps mercurial administration and that Cohn could fall out of favor as quickly as he has risen.  Whoever is up today, Brandon said, could be gone tomorrow. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Organizers of Tax March in more than 150 cities across the country and beyond wanted to call attention to Trumps refusal to disclose his tax history, as his White House predecessors have done for more than 40 years.  The marches coincide with the traditional April 15 deadline for U.S. federal tax returns, though the filing date was pushed backed two days this year. There were no reports of violence or arrests, in contrast to a clash between Trump supporters and opponents that erupted at a rally in Berkeley, California, where nine people were arrested. Two of the biggest tax marches took place in New York and Los Angeles, with each drawing about 5,000 people, according to estimates by Reuters reporters. No official estimates were immediately available.  In Manhattan, a good-natured crowd rallied at Bryant Park before marching up Sixth Avenue to Central Park. Among the marchers was an oversized inflatable rooster, sporting an angry expression and a sweeping metallic orange hairdo meant to resemble Trumps signature style. Thanks to Trump, I think that releasing your taxes when you run for president now has to be a law, said New Yorker Marni Halasa, 51, who arrived in a tutu and leggings made of fake dollar bills and holding a sign that read Show Me The Money! In Washington, more than 1,500 protesters gathered on the front lawn of the U.S. Capitol, where members of Congress addressed the crowd before it marched to the Lincoln Memorial.  We are taking the gloves off to say knock off the secrecy Mr. President, said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, which would play a leading role in tax reform measures being considered in Congress. He described Trumps refusal to release his taxes as being like a teenager trying to hide a lousy report card. Among the marchers was Melinda Colwell, 34, a stay-at-home-mother from Ledyard, Connecticut. She said she was concerned that conflicts of interest in Trumps tax returns might foreshadow selfish interests in his tax reform policies. I think its important to know how that could influence his decisions and how he could benefit from the decisions being made, she said. As a candidate and as president, Trump has refused to release his tax returns, citing an ongoing audit by the Internal Revenue Service. The IRS has said that Trump can release his tax returns even while under audit. The White House could not be reached immediately for comment on the marches. Events were also planned in cities in Europe, Japan and New Zealand. The marches were launched by a single tweet, organizers said. A day after the massive Jan. 21 womens march in Washington and other cities, comedy writer Frank Lesser tapped out on Twitter, Trump claims no one cares about his taxes. The next mass protest should be on Tax Day to prove him wrong. It has been retweeted more than 21,000 times.     In Los Angeles, television director Mike Stutz turned up at the march dressed in costume as a Russian general and said he was called General Bullshitski. He carried a sign that read: What Tax Returns? Putin paid cash. Trust your oligarchs, referring to allegations of contacts between Trumps campaign and Russia, led by President Vladimir Putin. Joe Dinkin, spokesman for the Working Families Party, one of the groups organizing the marches, said investigations into the Trump campaigns alleged connections to Russia underscore the need to disclose his returns. Without seeing his taxes, well never really know who hes working for, said Dinkin, who expects the marches to draw at least 100,000 protesters. There have been some glimpses into Trumps tax history. Last month, MSNBC host Rachel Maddow reported on two pages of Trumps 2005 return that were obtained by investigative reporter David Cay Johnston and released by DCReport.org. They showed Trump paid $38 million in taxes on more than $150 million in income.  And in October, The New York Times reported that Trump had declared a $916 million loss on his 1995 federal tax return, citing three pages of documents from the return.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trumps administration declined to name any major trading partner as a currency manipulator in a highly anticipated report on Friday, backing away from a key Trump campaign promise to slap such a label on China. The semi-annual U.S. Treasury currency report did, however, keep China on a currency monitoring list despite a lower global current account surplus, citing Chinas unusually large, bilateral trade surplus with the United States. Five other trading partners who were on last Octobers monitoring list - Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Germany and Switzerland - also remain on the list, ensuring that the Treasury would apply extra scrutiny to their foreign exchange and economic policies. The Treasury report recognized what many analysts have said over the past year, namely that China has recently intervened in foreign exchange markets to prop up the value of its yuan currency, not push it lower to make Chinese exports cheaper.  Foreign exchange experts told Reuters last week that a manipulator label was unlikely for Beijing. Trump, who on the campaign trail blamed China for stealing U.S. jobs and prosperity by cheapening its currency, repeatedly promised to label the country as a currency manipulator on day one of a Trump administration - a move that would require special negotiations and could lead to punitive duties and other action. The report did call out Chinas past efforts to hold down the yuans value, saying this created a long-term distortion in the global trading system that imposed significant and long-lasting hardship on American workers and companies. The Treasury also warned that it will scrutinize Chinas trade and currency practices very closely and called for faster opening of Chinas economy to U.S. goods and services and a shift away from exports to more domestic consumption.    China will need to demonstrate that its lack of intervention to resist appreciation over the last three years represents a durable policy shift by letting the RMB (yuan) rise with market forces once appreciation pressures resume, the report said. The report shows the Trump administration is taking an approach to foreign exchange based on data rather than politics, said Nathan Sheets, a former U.S. Treasury under secretary for international affairs during the Obama administration. This isnt the report that Donald Trump had in mind on Nov. 8, said Sheets, who is now with the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. But it lays out legitimate complaints. Its a clear statement to the Chinese that they need progress. The Treasury did not alter its three major thresholds for identifying currency manipulation put in place last year by the Obama administration: a bilateral trade surplus with the United States of $20 billion or more; a global current account surplus of more than 3 percent of gross domestic product, and persistent foreign exchange purchases equal to 2 percent of GDP over 12 months.  No countries were determined to have met all three of these criteria, but Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Germany and Switzerland all met two of them. The Treasury warned Japan against resuming currency interventions, saying that these should be reserved only to very exceptional circumstances with appropriate prior consultations, consistent with Japans G-7 and G-20 commitments.

(Reuters) - The Trump administration will not make public White House visitor logs, the records that detail who has visited President Donald Trump and his staff on official business, his office confirmed, in a departure from a practice that was established under former President Barack Obama.  White House Communications Director Michael Dubke said in a statement on Friday that the grave national security risks and privacy concerns of the hundreds of thousands of visitors annually was the reason for keeping the records secret. Transparency advocates had praised Obamas decision to release the logs, although his administration argued the disclosure was not required by law but instead was voluntary. As a result, Obamas team frequently redacted names from the list of visitors that were released to the public, including celebrities and donors who were sighted on the White House grounds. The logs offer the most comprehensive look at who has access to the president and his team. Examining the logs provides insight into which interests are lobbying the White House and who may have more influence in the administration. Trump has continued the Obama policy of not allowing administration staffers to become lobbyists after leaving their government job, a rule that carries no enforcement mechanism and that they have already waived for one staffer. The announcement that the logs would remain secret quickly drew criticism from watchdog groups. Elected officials work for the people and we deserve to see government business conducted in transparent daylight, Faiz Shakir, political director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement. The only reasonable conclusion is to believe the Trump administration has many things it is trying to hide.During the Obama administration, conservative watchdog groups sued the Secret Service, which maintains the records, in an attempt to make unredacted copies publicly available. After Trump took office, a liberal watchdog group has taken over the fight, filing a lawsuit on Monday demanding the records.  Separately, Democrats in Congress have filed legislation to force the administration to release visitor logs from Mar-A-Largo, the presidents Palm Beach estate where he has spent most weekends since becoming president.

A White House statement also named Spencer Bachus, another Republican former congressman, to be a member of the board of directors of the bank. Both were named for four-year terms. Trump told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday he would fill the two vacancies on the banks five-member board that have prevented it from having a quorum and being able to act on loans over $10 million. His picks must gain approval from the Senate, which blocked nominees by former President Barack Obama. The Export-Import Bank, an independent government agency, provides loans to foreign entities that enable them to purchase American-made goods. For example, it has been used by foreign airlines to purchase planes from Boeing Co (BA.N) and farmers in developing nations to acquire equipment. The bank has become a popular target for conservatives, who worked in Congress to kill the institution, arguing that it perpetuates cronyism and does little to create American jobs. Trumps backing of the bank represents a victory for  manufacturers like Boeing and General Electric Co (GE.N), which have overseas customers that use the agencys government-backed loans to purchase their products. Trump told the Journal the bank benefits small businesses and creates jobs, a reversal of his earlier criticism of the bank as being featherbedding for wealthy corporations. Trumps about-face followed a meeting on Tuesday with former Boeing Chief Executive Jim McNerney, who left the company last year but oversaw the corporations aggressive lobbying effort in support of the bank in 2015. Large American corporations that do significant amounts of exports say other countries have similar agencies and the export bank levels the playing field. A 2015 fight to shutter the bank led by conservatives in Congress allowed the banks charter to expire for five months. After overwhelming bipartisan support emerged to renew the banks charter, which is needed for it to operate, conservatives blocked nominees to the board, preventing it from financing large exports like aircraft and power turbines.

In a two-sentence court filing the Justice Department said it had dropped its lawsuit, filed last year by the Obama administration, because the North Carolina legislature had replaced it with a new law called House Bill 142. The filing marks the first significant move in a complicated legal battle challenging the states nondiscrimination laws since the replacement of the original law, known as House Bill 2 or more commonly as the bathroom bill. House Bill 2s most controversial provision was the requirement that in state-run buildings transgender people use the bathrooms, changing rooms and showers that corresponded to the sex on their birth certificates rather than their gender identity. A number of businesses and sports leagues boycotted North Carolina because they saw the year-old law as discriminatory against the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community. Civil liberties groups also protested the move. The American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of North Carolina, and Lambda Legal filed a lawsuit challenging the law in March of last year. That was followed in May by the Justice Departments own suit against House Bill 2. James Esseks, the ACLUs LGBT Project Director said the new law is flawed because it keeps a ban on cities and counties from creating their own nondiscriminatory ordinaces until 2020 and relegates to the state legislature the power to regulate bathroom access. The legislature has purposefully not taken any action to define access, he said. House Bill 142 leaves transgender people in limbo and thats intentional, Esseks said. This does not fix the problem.

U.S. District Court Judge William Orrick III questioned the purpose of the presidents order as he heard arguments from two large California counties and the Justice Department in San Francisco federal court. Both counties have asked for a nationwide preliminary injunction to the order.  As part of a larger plan to transform how the United States deals with immigration and national security, Trump in January signed an order targeting cities and counties that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. Sanctuary cities in general offer safe harbor to illegal immigrants and often do not use municipal funds or resources to advance the enforcement of federal immigration laws. Sanctuary city is not an official designation. Santa Clara County, which includes the city of San Jose and several smaller Silicon Valley communities, sued in February, saying Trumps plan to withhold federal funds is unconstitutional. San Francisco filed a similar lawsuit.  On Friday, the counties described the order as a weapon to cancel all funding to jurisdictions, said John Keker, an attorney representing Santa Clara County. All around the country, including here, people are having to deal with this right now. Santa Clara County receives roughly $1.7 billion in federal and federally dependent funds annually, about 35 percent of its total revenues. The county argued that every day it is owed millions of dollars of federal funding, and its budgetary planning process had been thrown into disarray by the order. The Justice Department said the counties had taken an overly broad interpretation of the presidents order, which would impact only Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security funds, a fraction of the grant money received by the counties. The government also argued that there had been no enforcement action to date, and it was unclear what actions against the counties would entail. Judge Orrick asked the government what was the purpose of an executive order, if it only impacted a small amount of county funding. Attorneys for the government said the order had highlighted issues that the Trump Administration deeply cared about and a national policy priority. To win a nationwide injunction, local governments must demonstrate a high level of harm, the Justice Department noted in court filings last month.

Business executives are also worried that President Donald Trumps focus on curtailing North Koreas nuclear and missile programs could undercut U.S. commercial interests in China. Days after Trumps meeting with President Xi Jinping, Trump tweeted that Beijing would get a better trade deal with Washington if it helped resolve the U.S. problem with Pyongyang. The U.S. business community should not be used as a bargaining chip, said James Zimmerman, a Beijing-based lawyer and the former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China. Trumps far better trade deal linkage to North Korea is amateurish, illogical horse trading, at best, Zimmerman said. The White House has said U.S and Chinese officials are still at the early stages of fleshing out a pledge by Trump and Xi to develop the 100-day plan to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China, which last year reached $347 billion. It was among the limited set of public outcomes from their first meeting in Florida. While Trump has promised to aggressively address trade imbalances and open the Chinese market to more American goods and services, William Zarit, the Chambers current chairman, said the talks need to address the structural impediments U.S. companies face in China. Wed rather be talking than having a trade war. But remember weve been talking for 20 years and havent gotten very far, Zarit said. The White House has said that issues including opening up Chinas financial services sector and getting U.S. beef exports into China were up for talks. We are pleased to hear the issue has been elevated to the highest levels of both governments and that there is commitment to resolve the U.S. beef access issue in an expedited fashion, CEO of the U.S. Meat Export Federation Philip Seng said. Others remain skeptical. Beef should have been done 10 years ago. The fact that that has been going on for so long is emblematic of the imbalance in the way we negotiate and deal with each other, said James McGregor, Chairman of APCO Worldwide in Greater China. China has purchased hardly any American beef since it conditionally lifted an import ban last year that was imposed in 2003 due to a case of mad cow disease in Washington state. Despite initial media reports suggesting Xi may have offered access for U.S. beef as a concession to stave off rising trade tensions, Chinas Premier Li Keqiang this week appeared to link progress on the issue to U.S. restrictions on imports of some Chinese poultry products for food safety reasons. China is willing to import market-competitive U.S. beef that meets quality and health standards, Li told a U.S. Congressional delegation in Beijing on Monday, according to the state-run Beijing News. Chinese chicken is also very competitive in the international market. We hope the United States can quickly lift the ban on Chinese chicken imports. Only in this way can we better embody fair trade, Li said. While individual companies are hesitant to criticize China for fear of backlash, critics from U.S. business groups accuse Beijing of unfairly subsidizing domestic firms and restricting foreign investment into much of the worlds second-biggest economy. A 50-percent ownership cap for foreign life insurers, for example, despite Chinas 2001 World Trade Organization commitments to lift it, has helped limit their market share to about 6 percent.  Beijing has repeatedly promised to open up financial services more widely to foreign firms, but has given few details on implementation. Jacob Parker, vice president of China operations at the U.S.-China Business Council, said concerns persist that China would make commitments but not follow through or take only incremental steps. While the government could remove some industries from a list of sectors restricted for foreign investment, businesses could still face red tape and licensing hurdles or be restricted to regional pilot zones. There are lots of ways China can call something an opening and it is not, Parker said. Xi proposed further cooperation on infrastructure development in meetings with Trump, but Chinese state-owned companies working on major U.S. public works is a politically fraught issue in the United States, where Trump campaigned on creating jobs. High-tech industries where China hopes to funnel investment, such as semiconductors, virtual reality and autonomous vehicles, are considered sensitive. Such partnerships would likely also have to clear national security hurdles. Skeptics also wonder if Chinese cooperation in redressing the trade imbalance will be limited to areas that serve Chinese needs, such as increasing imports of U.S. gas, oil and coking coal.  Xi stopped in Alaska on his way home, meeting with Governor Bill Walker, who touted the states oil, gas, and mineral resources. On the market access side, lowering restrictions on foreign investment in Chinese banking, securities, investment management, futures, insurance, credit ratings and accounting sectors, as Beijing has already promised, would help China improve the quality financial of instruments and make their markets more stable and professional, said McGregor. If you look at the things that China is talking about opening, its all areas where China needs help, McGregor said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Thursday issued a final rule that will shorten the Obamacare enrollment period and give insurers more of what they say they need in the individual insurance market, likely making it harder for some consumers to purchase insurance, healthcare experts said.  It could also raise out-of-pocket medical expenses, the experts said, because it gives insurers more flexibility in determining the value of their coverage. The rule, which takes effect later this year, comes as President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress have renewed efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, after an effort to pass a bill in the U.S. House of Representatives failed last month.  Issued by a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and first proposed in February, the rule aims to aid insurers, who have lost hundreds of millions of dollars in the individual insurance markets set up by Obamacare. Several major insurers, including Humana Inc and Aetna Inc, have announced plans to exit some state exchanges in 2018.  Insurers welcomed the rule but said there is still too much uncertainty in the market. On Wednesday, Trump told the Wall Street Journal that he may withhold Obamacare payments to insurers that amount to about $7 billion a year to force Democrats back to the negotiating table.  Marilyn Tavenner, president and chief executive of Americas Health Insurance Plans, said in a statement that funding for the payments must continue uninterrupted. Otherwise, she said premiums will rise 20 percent across the market and more insurers would drop out of the exchanges.   The changes under Thursdays final rule include a shortened open enrollment period for Obamacare plans. They also make it harder for people to enroll outside that period, which is allowed under certain circumstances such as a pregnancy or a move.  The rule could also allow insurers to collect unpaid premium payments and make it tougher for people to move in and out of insurance plans, according to healthcare industry experts.  Insurers say gaming the system has created an unprofitable mix of healthy and sick customers. The rule also gives states broader authority by removing the federal governments role in overseeing doctor and hospital networks included in insurance plans. Republicans have said any healthcare reform or overhaul must give states more flexibility. The Affordable Care Act enabled 20 million Americans to gain insurance, mostly through the individual insurance markets set up by the law or through an expansion of Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor and disabled.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": "" WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald J. Trump is planning to increase U.S. defense spending by $54 billion next year. But a series of recent reports by the Defense Department Inspector General and the Government Accountability Officesay that Pentagon accounting systems will struggle to track how the money is spent.  The reports found that the Pentagon remains unable to accurately track its $591 billion annual budget and experiences billions of dollars in accounting gaps and errors each year despite two decades of reform efforts.Taken together, the reports show that many of the endemic accounting problems exposed in a 2013 Reuters investigative series remain in place.  These deficiencies not only affect (the Department of Defenses) ability to have auditable financial statements, a Feb. 9 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report found, they also affect its ability to make sound decisions on missions and operations.  A spokesman for the White Houses Office of Management Budget (OMB) said he was confident that Defense Secretary James Mattis would properly spend the additional funds.  The need to replenish our military and bolster American security is unquestioned and an important priority of this president, OMB Communications Director John Czwartacki said in a statement. We believe Secretary Mattis will deploy all of his resources in the most effective and efficient way possible.  Critics of wasteful Pentagon spending say increasing the Defense Department budget is unwise when the department is unable to account for what it already has.  Its ludicrous, said Mandy Smithberger, director of the Straus Military Reform Project in Washington. Reform isnt going to happen as long as the spigot is turned on.  The Pentagons continued accounting problems are drawing particular scrutiny now because the Defense Department faces a congressionally mandated legal deadline of Sept. 30, 2017, to become ready for its first audit ever. Unlike every other U.S. government department, the Pentagon has never undergone an audit because its financial records are in such disarray.  A spokesman for the Defense Department comptrollers office said he is confident it will meet the deadline.  The Department is committed and on track to be ready to undergo a full financial statement audit in (fiscal year) 2018, Lieutenant Colonel Eric D. Badger said in an email.  At the same time Trump proposes to boost defense spending, he has called for deep cuts to other areas, a White House summary of his proposed 2018 budget shows. Whether Congress will accept or reject Trumps proposals is unclear.  Trump calls for cutting the State Departments budget by $10.1 billion, or 28%. Among other things, U.S. payments to support the United Nations would be cut.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) would take a particularly big hit. Trump would cut $2.6 billion, or 31%, of its budget. The White House document says the budget would eliminate more than 50 EPA programs, and cut EPAs research and development budget by $233 million, or 52%. The budget for grants to states for lead clean-up would be cut by 30% to $9.8 million.  The recent watchdog reports on the Defense Department found that it lacks a unified, functioning accounting system. As Reuters reported in its 2013 series, the Pentagon has hundreds of independent systems, built ad hoc and some dating from the 1970s, that are riddled with errors and incapable of sharing accurate data.  Billions of dollars disappear from accounting records. The military has spent large sums building new systems meant to solve the problem, but so far they have not.  AMarch 16 Defense Department Inspector General reportsaidthe Navycould not find any records to back up how it had spent $866 million inthe first quarter of2016 inU.S. military operations in Afghanistan.The report said that as a result, there was no way to know what the money actually was used for.  A Navy spokeswoman, Lieutenant Kara YingLing, referred Reuters to the Navys official response to the report, which said the Navy agreed with the Inspector Generals conclusions but said its accounting problems will not be fixed until it begins using a new computer system in 2019. YingLing said the Navy is on track to help the Pentagon meet its Sept. 30 audit deadline.  The Feb. 9 GAO report said the Pentagons continued bookkeeping errors affect the federal government as a whole. Defense spending makes up such a large part of the federal budget that the departments unreliable data skews accounting for the entire U.S. government, the GAO said.  The report noted that the Defense Department has been on the GAOs list of High Risk entities that represent threats to the federal governments financial well-being since 1995. The report said the Pentagon has remained on the list because of long-standing deficiencies with its financial management systems.  The GAO report noted that the Pentagon had hired large independent accounting firms for each of the military services to try to help them meet the Sept. 30 audit deadline. But the report said the firms have found so many problems that the ability of the Pentagon to meet the deadline remains in doubt.  A separate Defense Department Inspector General report issued on March 23, 2017, found that the Army continues to be unable to balance its checkbook. The report concluded that the problem for the Army grew worse in 2016.  The report said that for October 2015, the Army had 177,921 discrepancies. The monthly numbers rose steadily to 790,551 for June 2016. The report did not give dollar amounts for those months.  Army spokesman Wayne Hall said the number of discrepancies continued to increase in 2017 because planned fixes to computer systems have not yet been made. He said the Army is working on building more reliable systems.  The report said that because rules require that the Armys numbers exactly match in monthly reports to the Treasury, the Army and the Defense Finance and Accounting Service must find a way to make them match. Their solution was to enter made-up numbers to make it appear falsely that the Armys numbers do match.  The report said that for March 2016, there were $1.9 billion in such forced balance entries. Hall said the Army must make the numbers match under federal rules.  In separate reports, the Inspector General found that other military services have also had problems balancing their financial numbers with the Treasurys. Accountants interviewed by Reuters said that such large discrepancies would be considered accounting fraud in the corporate world.  Badger, the spokesman for the Defense Department comptrollers office, said any errors by the military services were unintentional.  We strongly oppose any accusation of intentionally misrepresenting our books, Badger said in an email. Many manual accounting adjustments are often caused by the ineffective design of legacy business or financial systems.  Trump has said the $54 billion in increased defense spending will send a message to the world in these dangerous times of American strength, security and resolve. Trump has also vowed to negotiate cheaper contracts with defense contractors, a problem also cited in recent watchdog reports.  In a March 2016 report, the Inspector General found that the Air Force had spent billions on a contract to maintain one type of jet engine, without first getting any idea of a fair price.  The open-ended contract, with a guaranteed profit margin regardless of cost, was awarded in 2011. The report said that before signing the contract the Air Force obtained no data on the actual cost of the repairs and how the costs compared to private-sector rates.  The exact amount of the contract was redacted from the report. The Inspector General has not ruled on a March 2016 Freedom of Information Act request filed by Reuters that asked for the redacted information to be made public.

This is a major pro-life victory, said the most powerful Republican in the House of Representatives, Speaker Paul Ryan, adding that a regulation enacted under Democratic former President Barack Obama had forced states to fund Planned Parenthood, a national non-profit that provides contraception, health screenings, and abortions. Under the Congressional Review Act, which allows lawmakers to repeal newly minted rules, both the House and Senate had passed a resolution killing Obamas regulation that had protected federal grants for clinics in states wanting to block the funding. States such as Texas in recent years have kept the grants from going to clinics as part of the countrys longstanding fight over abortion. Broadly, many Republicans seek to restrict abortion or make it illegal while Democrats have fought to keep abortion legal. The resolution had narrowly passed the U.S. Congress, with Vice President Mike Pence called to the Senate on March 30 to break a tie vote in the chamber, where Republicans hold a slim majority. The federal government can never again create a substantially similar regulation under the review law. The grants, known as Title X funds, were already barred from going directly to abortion services but under the now-null regulation Planned Parenthood clinics were assured they could receive money even in the face of state objections.       Allowing states to withhold Title X funding from family planning clinics wont make anyone safer or healthier  it will instead place essential services out of reach, said Diane Horvath-Cosper, a medical doctor and fellow at Physicians for Reproductive Health, adding that for many people the clinics are the only place where they can receive affordable health services such as disease testing.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - At first glance, U.S. President Donald Trump and Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen may have little in common.  Yellen is an academic economist and veteran of Democratic administrations who is committed to an open global economy, while Trump is a real estate mogul with an electoral base suspicious of the economic order Yellen helped to create. Yet the two may have interests in common now that Trump is president and both want to get as many Americans working as possible.  Since her appointment as Fed chair in February 2014, Yellen has kept interest rates low and she currently pledges to raise them only slowly even though unemployment, at 4.5 percent, is at its lowest in nearly ten years.  Meanwhile, Trumps election campaign promises to cut taxes, spend money on infrastructure and deregulate banking, have  helped propel a surge in the U.S. Conference Boards consumer confidence index to its highest level since the internet stocks crash 16 years ago. Former Fed staff and colleagues who know Yellen said Trumps surprising remarks this week in a Wall Street Journal interview, in which he did not rule out Yellens reappointment to a new four year term next year, are not as outlandish as they may appear now that the president has a vested interest in keeping markets and the economy on an even keel.  And the same staff and colleagues say Yellen may well accept reappointment, despite Trumps criticism of her during last years election campaign.  Many in Trumps Republican party have called for tighter monetary policy and a less activist Fed, but the president would not really find that useful, said former Fed vice chair Donald Kohn.  If Trump fills three existing Federal Reserve board vacancies with people Yellen thinks she could work with, it would be really difficult to turn down a reappointment when her term as chair expires in February 2018. If she continues to do well, hed be nuts to ditch her for an unknown quantity, said University of California, Berkeley, economics professor Andrew Rose, a long-time colleague and co-author with Yellen of an oft-cited study of labor markets. Yellen took over from Ben Bernanke as Fed chair in February 2014 with the U.S. economic recovery from the 2008 financial crisis still on shaky ground, and she has made no secret she puts a priority on growth in jobs and wages and a broad recovery in U.S. household wealth.  In a slow return to more normal monetary policy, Yellen has stopped the purchase of additional financial securities by the Fed and in December 2015 began raising short term interest rates for the first time in 10 years. So far those policy shifts have been engineered with little apparent impact on job growth, and so mesh with Trumps core election campaign promises to restore employment and earnings. The slow rise in interest rates in the past year has also happened while U.S. stock prices have risen to record highs, though Trump has claimed the credit for himself.   There is precedent for Trump to stick with a former presidents Fed chair appointment. Paul Volcker, Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke, the three previous Fed chairs, served at least two four year terms and were nominated by both Democratic and Republican presidents.  However it may be a more difficult step for Trump.   During last years election campaign, Trump accused Yellen of accepting orders from then President Obama to keep interest rates low for political reasons, and he said he would replace her as Fed chair because she is not a Republican party member.  In a particularly biting moment last year, in a campaign video advertisement, he labeled her as among the global special interests who had ruined life for middle America.  The Fed on Thursday said it had no response to Trumps comments published on Wednesday on Yellen and or on whether Yellen would consider a second term.  Some of Trumps advisers and some Republican lawmakers want a more conservative Fed in which the chair has less power and would see a Yellen reappointment as yet another step away from his promise to drain the swamp of the Washington establishment. There are also three current vacancies on the Feds seven member Board of Governors, and unorthodox new members could make it difficult for Yellen to manage policy or accept another four year term. But if the choice is her consensus style or someone unproven in their ability to manage public and market expectations, hed be wise to reappoint her, said Joseph Gagnon, a former Fed staffer and Berkeley colleague of Yellens currently at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. I dont see what is in his interests to appoint someone who is going to jack up interest rates. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Acting State Department spokesman Mark Toner confirmed that the hiring freeze would remain until the plan to downsize and reorganize had been fully developed. He could not give a timeline for the reorganization. We cant be onboarding people when we dont know what our reorganization is going to ultimately look like, Toner told a briefing for reporters. Trumps budget proposal for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1 would cut 28 percent of the budget for U.S. diplomacy and foreign aid. Republicans and Democrats in Congress, which approves the budget, have rejected the prospect of such cuts. It was not known whether the White House directed Tillerson to keep the hiring freeze in place for the State Department or whether other agencies would also refuse to lift the hiring ban. Two State Department officials said Tillerson plans to downsize staff over a period of two to three years. Tillerson informed State Department employees of the decision on Wednesday, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters. While Trumps original hiring freeze notice on Jan. 23 excluded political appointees, it has stopped the hiring of rank-and-file workers and the replacement of others who have resigned or retired. William Hoagland, senior vice president of the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington-based think tank, said the Trump administration may have to seek congressional approval if the hiring freeze changes the function of programs congress explicitly voted to fund.  Hoagland said the administration would have to send what is known as an impoundment resolution if the State Department jeopardizes what that agency is there to begin with by not filling positions that are vacated. Congress would then have to approve the resolution, Hoagland said.  The State Departments Toner said Tillerson was not breaking any federal rule by maintaining the hiring freeze.  My understanding is that (Tillerson) has the jurisdiction to keep this freeze in place as we go about this presidentially-mandated reorganization, Toner said.  The Office of Management and Budget, which handles federal budgeting, did not respond to a request for comment.     Trumps budget director Mick Mulvaney told reporters on Tuesday that the hiring freeze would be lifted but that agencies will be asked to remain mindful of Trumps goal to reduce the federal work force.

(Reuters) - At a town hall in his conservative Florida district this week, U.S. Representative Ted Yoho drew applause for defying his own Republican Party leaders to help derail a healthcare plan that was President Donald Trumps first major legislative initiative. Far from paying a price back home, as Trump has threatened they would, Yoho and some of the other far-right members of the House Freedom Caucus appear to have support for standing their ground, based on their reception at several town halls during a two-week congressional recess. A handful of House Freedom Caucus lawmakers were facing constituents for the first time since last months defeat of Trumps effort to repeal and replace Obamacare, which was also rejected by some Republican moderates. Many supporters made clear they expect them to work with Trump to make good on campaign promises to reform the nations health care system. I want it done, said Bob White, 74, after questioning Yoho on the issue during a town hall on Tuesday night in rural Putnam County, Florida. Wield that big stick.  The rebellious faction of conservatives in the House of Representatives was instrumental in toppling a plan supported by Trump to rewrite Obamacare, President Barack Obamas signature healthcare law. Trump has singled out the group for blame. Many caucus members refused to back the Republican leaderships bill because they considered parts too similar to Obamacare and said it would not have done enough to reduce insurance premiums. At town hall meetings, constituents pressed them to keep working to address problems such as high healthcare costs. The reception for Yoho and other caucus members at home could shape their approach to the Republican president and leadership controlling both chambers of Congress, said Matthew Green, an associate professor of politics at Catholic University of America, who studies congressional parties and leaders. The Freedom Caucus members are either going to become more recalcitrant because they will be hearing from their constituents good job, he said. Or if they dont hear that, they might be more willing to compromise. Michigan Representative Justin Amash landed in the crosshairs of the feud when a White House adviser called on Twitter for Trump supporters to defeat him in a primary. But in the farming and manufacturing area he represents in the southwestern state, home to cereal maker Kellogg Co, the four-term congressman heard cheers in a high school auditorium in Battle Creek, Michigan on Tuesday night, where he held a town hall with about 100 people attending. If I had to choose between Justin and Trump, Id go with Justin for sure, said construction worker Eric Smith, 34, who voted for both, but so far has found Trump lacking conservative principles. At this point, Id give Donald Trump a D.  Retiree Cliff Ward, 72, told Amash that he was pleased with his role in the blocking the legislation, which polls showed to be unpopular and expected to end health coverage for millions. Now we need you to work with Trump and the other Republicans to get this done, he added.     Living in Georgetown, Florida, a community so remote that cell phone service is a chief concern, Trump voter Melvin Shebester knew little about the House Freedom Caucus. The faction of small-government conservatives came together in 2015 and since then have been a thorn in the side of more mainstream Republican leadership in the House, including an attempt to push out former Republican House Speaker John Boehner. The 84-year-old Shebester was impressed that his congressman, Yoho, stood up to the president on a bill that he saw as rushed. It takes a lot of guts to stand up against your party, said Shebester, attending Yohos town hall on Tuesday night at a government center in Palatka, Florida with his son and grandson. We cant go up there and tell Trump hes wrong, added his son, Steven Shebester, 56, who lives nearby.      Many Republicans have avoided public town halls, often open to anyone interested, since the meetings became a staging ground for liberal protests earlier this year.  But Yoho, a veterinarian first elected in 2012, has held several. His event in Gainesville, a college town, on Monday was crowded by left-leaning activists who at times shouted him down. On Tuesday night in Palatka, a small town in Yohos sprawling district in north central Florida lined with oaks and Spanish moss, he took questions from about 100 constituents in a politically mixed crowd. He told reporters his office received some 3,500 calls in the days leading up to the healthcare plan showdown, with only about 215 in support. And a phone survey of constituents found the Republican plan was as unpopular as Obamacare itself. He said constituents gave him a clear message: Stay the course.

Tillerson, 65, was nominated by then President-elect Donald Trump to be secretary of state in December. Tillerson retired from Exxon at the end of the year. He was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in early February. His current post carries an annual salary of $207,800, according to the federal Office of Personnel Management tables. As part of an ethics agreement when Tillerson assumed his government post, Tillerson forfeited unvested Exxon stock worth $2.8 million and potential for a bonus of $3.9 million. He also waived his right to retiree health benefits.  Tillersons vested Exxon stock was put into a trust worth about $180 million at the time, the proceeds of which will be paid out over the next decade, much in the same way proceeds are paid out to all Exxon retirees. The trust is prohibited from investing in Exxon.  Tillerson will not be allowed to work anywhere in the oil and gas industry for the next decade. If he does, the entire trusts value would be donated to a charity that neither he nor Exxon chooses, according to the regulatory filings. Darren Woods, Exxons CEO as of January, saw his compensation rise 64 percent last year, when he was Exxons president, to $16.8 million. Woods saw his base salary rise 36 percent to $1 million and the value of stock and stock option awards, his pension and company perquisites, including the cost of a home security system, rise as well.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump has won the first major battle in his war on illegal immigration, and he did it without building his wall. The victory was announced last week by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which released figures showing a 93 percent drop since December of parents and children caught trying to cross the Mexico border illegally.  In December, 16,000 parents and children were apprehended; in March, a month in which immigration typically increases because of temperate weather, the number was just over 1,100.  It was a remarkable decline - steeper than the 72 percent drop in overall apprehensions - but for eight DHS officials interviewed by Reuters it was not surprising.  Trump has spoken about the need to crack down broadly on all illegal immigrants. But, internally, according to the DHS officials familiar with the departments strategy, his administration has focused on one immigrant group more than others: women with children, the fastest growing demographic of illegal immigrants. This planning has not been previously reported.  In the months since Trumps inauguration, DHS has rolled out a range of policies aimed at discouraging women from attempting to cross the border, including tougher initial hurdles for asylum claims and the threat of prosecuting parents if they hire smugglers to get their families across the border. The department has also floated proposals such as separating women and children at the border. DHS Secretary John Kelly told a Senate hearing on April 5 that the sharp drop in illegal immigration, especially among women and children, was due to Trumps tough policies. To date, it has been the threat of new policies rather than their implementation that has suppressed family migration. Mothers and children arent being separated - and DHS has shelved the plan; parents havent been prosecuted, and there is no wall along most of the border. Yet the number of migrants trying to cross  especially women and children  has dropped drastically.  Asked to comment on the policy of targeting women with children, DHS spokesman Jonathan Hoffman referenced the March drop, saying, Those were 15,000 women and children who did not put themselves at risk of death and assault from smugglers to make the trip north.   The White House declined to comment and referred Reuters to DHS. For months, Central Americans had heard about Trumps get-tough policies. And public service announcements on radio and television presented bleak pictures of what awaited those who traveled north. Some of the ads were funded by the United States, others by United Nations agencies and regional governments. One radio ad in Honduras featured a mother, saying, Its been a year and I dont know if she is alive or dead. Id do anything to have her here with me. Curse the day I sent her north. The possibility that mothers and children might be separated at the border caused particular alarm, Honduran Deputy Foreign Minister Maria Andrea Matamoros told Reuters That worries any mother that wants to go to the United States with their kid, and being separated drastically changes their plans, she said.  The policies targeting women and children have their roots in a working group consisting of Capitol Hill staffers and others called together by Trumps transition team in the weeks after the Nov. 8 election. The group was asked to develop policies to discourage illegal border crossings and more quickly expel illegal immigrants after they crossed the border, according to two of the DHS officials and a congressional aide.  One goal was to help Trump fulfill a major campaign promise:ending so-called catch and release, the practice of apprehending illegal immigrants but then freeing them to live in the United States while their asylum or deportation cases were resolved.  The group quickly identified a major obstacle - the large numbers of women and children continuing to cross the border, said the DHS officials and the aide.  Because a federal court ruling bars prolonged immigration detention of juveniles, the Obama administration generally released mothers and children to live in the United States while awaiting resolution of their asylum or deportation cases. The incoming Trump administration viewed that policy as providing encouragement for women to make the dangerous journey north with their children in tow. But the new administration was bound by the same court ruling. After Kellys confirmation as Homeland Security chief in late January,several members of the original working group stepped into key roles at DHS. Gene Hamilton, who had worked for then Republican Senator Jeff Sessions, became senior counselor to Kelly, andDimple Shah, who had been staff director of the House National Security Subcommittee, became deputy general counsel.  Kathy Nuebel-Kovarik, formerly a staffer for Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, became policy chief at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.Julie Kirchner left her position as executive director of the conservative Federation for American Immigration Reform to become a top policy adviser at U.S. Customs and Border Protection. None of the groups members agreed to be interviewed by Reuters. Several DHS officials said that in their new roles they continued to focus on the issue of women and child migrants. Soon, they had the bare bones of a plan: Since the court ruling on children was an obstacle to prolonged detention, why not separate them from their mothers, sending children into foster care or protective federal custody while their mothers remained in detention centers, the two DHS officials and congressional aide said. The group also advocated two other policies directly affecting mothers and children: raising the bar for asylum and prosecuting parents as human traffickers if they hired human smugglers. The thinking was that if they can just implement tough policies for eight weeks - or even threaten to do that - they would see the numbers of families crossing just plummet, said one DHS official familiar with the planning. On Jan. 25, five days after taking office, Trump issued an executive order ending catch and release. (A U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official said the agency still releases most women and children in compliance with the federal court order.)  A week later, in a town hall with U.S. Customs and Immigration Services officers, Chief Asylum Officer John Lafferty outlined the possibility of separating women and children in a semi-public setting for the first time, according to notes of the meeting seen by Reuters. For more than a month after that meeting, the proposal did not leak, but after Reuters broke news of it in early March, Kelly confirmed that it was under consideration. Democratic members of Congress blasted the proposal, and within days it had made headlines across Mexico and Central America.  That month, the number of children traveling with guardians apprehended at the border fell to one-third of what it had been in February.  When Kelly and his advisers saw the numbers dropping, they announced they were shelving the idea of separating women and children  at least for now. Asked whether it may be revived, DHS spokeswoman Jenny Burke said, Families caught crossing the border illegally, generally will not be separated unless the situation at the time requires it.

In Washington, President Donald Trump said the United States relationship with Moscow may be at an all-time low.  Trumps comments came after he made his biggest foreign policy decision of his new presidency last week, firing missiles at Syria to punish Moscows ally for its suspected use of poison gas. Russia condemned the U.S. action. (For graphic on battle for control in Syria click here: tmsnrt.rs/2nm68H0) Hours earlier on Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin was equally pessimistic, saying in an interview broadcast on Russian television, The level of trust on a working level, especially on the military level, has not improved but has rather deteriorated.  The rhetorical salvos came as U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson received an unusually hostile reception in Moscow, where any hope that the Trump administration would herald less confrontational relations was dashed in the week after the U.S. missile strike on Syria. Tillerson met Putin in the Kremlin after talking to his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, for about three hours. The Kremlin had previously declined to confirm Putin would meet Tillerson, reflecting the renewed tensions. Trump had frequently called during the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign for warmer ties with Putin, despite criticism from lawmakers in his own Republican Party. But the civil war in Syria has driven a wedge between Moscow and Washington, upending what many in Russia hoped would be a transformation in relations, which reached a post-Cold War low under Trumps predecessor, Barack Obama.     As Tillerson sat down for talks with Lavrov on Wednesday, a volley of statements, including from a senior Russian official, appeared timed to maximize the awkwardness during the first visit to Moscow by a member of Trumps cabinet. Lavrov doubled down on Russias support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, repeating denials that Assads government was to blame for the gas attack last week and adding a new theory that the attack may have been faked by Assads enemies. Tillerson reiterated the U.S. position that Assad must eventually relinquish power in Syria. We discussed our view that Russia as their closest ally in the conflict perhaps has the best means of helping Assad recognize this reality, he said.  Asked whether Assad could be subject to war crimes charges, Tillerson said people were working to make such a case, though he cautioned doing so would require clearing a high legal hurdle. Lavrov greeted Tillerson with unusually icy remarks, denouncing the missile strike on Syria as illegal and accusing Washington of behaving unpredictably. One of Lavrovs deputies was even more undiplomatic. In general, primitiveness and loutishness are very characteristic of the current rhetoric coming out of Washington, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told Russias state-owned RIA news agency. But Lavrov said some progress had been made on Syria at the meeting and that a working group would be set up to examine the poor state of U.S.-Russia ties. He also said Putin had agreed to reactivate a U.S.-Russian air safety agreement over Syria that Moscow suspended after the U.S. missile strikes.         Tillerson noted the low level of trust between the two countries. The worlds two foremost nuclear powers cannot have this kind of relationship, he said. Moscows hostility to Trump administration figures is a sharp change from last year, when Putin hailed Trump as a strong figure and Russian state television was often full of effusive praise for him. In another possible setback to a thaw with Moscow, Trump said on Wednesday that NATO is not obsolete, as he had declared during the election campaign last year. But he told a news conference at the White House with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg that alliance members still need to pay their fair share for the European security umbrella.     Trump said U.S. relations with Russia were not going well. Right now, were not getting along with Russia at all. We may be at an all-time low in terms of a relationship with Russia. This has built for a long period of time. But were going to see what happens, Trump told the news conference. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Trump said his administrations policy was not to demand Assad step down as part of a peaceful resolution to the conflict, in some contrast to Tillersons remarks in Moscow. Are we insisting on it? No. But I do think its going to happen at a certain point, Trump said. The Wall Street Journal cited Trump as saying that Assads use of chemical weapons again would elicit another military response, but he also said he would not intervene in depth in the conflict. The White House has accused Moscow of trying to cover up Assads use of chemical weapons after the attack on a rebel-held Syrian town last week killed 87 people. Trump responded to the gas attack by firing 59 cruise missiles at a Syrian air base on Friday. Washington warned Moscow, and Russian troops at the base were not hit. Moscow has stood by Assad, saying the poison gas belonged to rebels, an explanation Washington dismisses as beyond credible.  Russia blocked a Western effort at the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday to condemn the gas attack and push Assad to cooperate with international inquiries into the incident. Trump came to the presidency promising greater cooperation with Russia in fighting against the two countries common enemy in Syria, the Islamic State militant group. Tillerson is a former oil executive who was awarded Russias Order of Friendship by Putin. Trumps relations with Russia are also a domestic issue, as U.S. intelligence agencies have accused Moscow of using computer hacking to intervene in the U.S. presidential election to help Trump win. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating whether any Trump campaign figures colluded with Moscow, which the White House denies. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - After less than three months in office, President Donald Trump has abruptly shifted his stance on an array of foreign policy issues from the U.S. relationship with Russia and China to the value of the NATO alliance. Trump, who ran for the White House on a pledge to shake up the status quo in Washington, repeatedly lashed out at China during the campaign, accusing Beijing of being a grand champion of currency manipulation. Candidate Trump also dismissed the NATO military alliance as obsolete and said he hoped to build warmer ties with Russia. But at a White House news conference and in a newspaper interview on Wednesday, he offered starkly different views on those issues, saying his relationship with Moscow was souring while ties with Beijing were improving. He also lavished praise on NATO, saying it was adapting to changing global threats. I said it was obsolete. Its no longer obsolete, Trump said as he stood at a news conference alongside NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg in the White House East Room on Wednesday. The reversals on Russia and NATO could reassure U.S. allies in Europe who were rattled by Trumps overtures toward Moscow during the campaign. But the presidents talk of bonding with Chinese President Xi Jinping could sow confusion in Asia, where U.S. allies are fearful of a rising China. Trumps apparent shifts toward a more conventional foreign policy came amid infighting within his administration that has lately seen a decline in the influence of political operatives, mainly his chief strategist, Steve Bannon. Six months ago, candidate Trump suggested he was eager for an alliance with Russian President Vladimir Putin. If he says great things about me, Im going to say great things about him, Trump said last September. ALL-TIME LOW On Wednesday, however, Trump said he had growing concerns about Russias support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. We may be at an all-time low in terms of a relationship with Russia, said Trump, who ordered the firing of U.S. cruise missiles at a Syrian airfield last week to punish Assad for suspected use of poison gas in Syrias civil war. While criticizing Russia on Wednesday, Trump said he and Xi had bonded during the Chinese presidents visit to the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, where they dined together with their wives and held talks. Ahead of that visit, Trump had predicted difficult discussions on trade. The improving ties with Beijing were underscored when Trump told the Wall Street Journal in an interview on Wednesday that he would not declare China a currency manipulator as he had pledged to do on his first day in office. Trump, a former real estate developer, took office in January as a government novice whose foreign policy mantra during was a vow to keep America safe and build up the U.S. military. Christine Wormuth, former undersecretary of defense in the Obama administration, said Trump had a steep learning curve on foreign policy when he came into office but that it was beginning to even out. Hes starting to have a more nuanced and deeper understanding of a lot of issues, said Wormuth, now a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The evolving Trump foreign policy appears to reflect less of the influence of his campaign team and more the views of Defense Secretary James Mattis, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and national security adviser H.R. McMaster, all of whom are deeply skeptical of Russia. Trump former national security adviser, retired General Michael Flynn, was forced to resign on Feb. 13 for contacts with Russias ambassador to the United States before Trump took office. The new tone on foreign policy comes as Trump has been trying to settle the palace intrigue inside the White House, where Bannon, former chief of the conservative Breitbart News organization, has been at odds with the more mainstream Jared Kushner, the senior White House adviser who is Trumps son-in-law. In an interview with the New York Post on Tuesday, Trump offered only lukewarm support for Bannon. I like Steve, but you have to remember he was not involved in my campaign until very late, Trump said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Security Council on Wednesday to condemn last weeks deadly gas attack in Syria and push Moscows ally President Bashar al-Assad to cooperate with international inquiries into the incident. It was the eighth time during Syrias six-year-old civil war that Moscow has used its veto power on the Security Council to shield Assads government.  In the latest veto, Russia blocked a draft resolution backed by the United States, France and Britain to denounce the attack in the town of Khan Sheikhoun and tell Assads government to provide access for investigators and information such as flight plans. The toxic gas attack on April 4 prompted the United States to launch missile strikes on a Syrian air base and widened a rift between the United States and Russia.  Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that trust had eroded between the two countries under U.S. President Donald Trump.  U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson echoed that comment after meetings with Russian leaders in Moscow, saying that relations are at a low point with a low level of trust. Tillerson called for Assad to eventually relinquish power. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, called on Moscow to stop protecting Assad and said the United States wants to work with Russia toward a political solution for Syria. Russia once again has chosen to side with Assad, even as the rest of the world, including the Arab world, overwhelmingly comes together to condemn this murderous regime, Haley told  the 15-member Security Council. If the regime is innocent, as Russia claims, the information requested in this resolution would have vindicated them. Russias deputy U.N. envoy, Vladimir Safronkov, said the draft resolution laid blame prior to an independent investigation. Im amazed that this was the conclusion. No one has yet visited the site of the crime. How do you know that? he said.  He said the U.S. attack on the Syrian air base was carried out in violation of international norms. Syrias government has denied responsibility for the gas attack in a rebel-held area of northern Syria that killed at least 87 people, many of them children.  A fact-finding mission from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) is investigating the attack. If it determines that chemical weapons were used, then a joint U.N./OPCW investigation will look at the incident to determine who is to blame. This team has already found Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks in 2014 and 2015 and that Islamic State militants used mustard gas. China, which has vetoed six resolutions on Syria since the civil war began, abstained from Wednesdays U.N. vote, along with Ethiopia and Kazakhstan. Ten countries voted in favor of the text, while Bolivia joined Russia in voting no. U.S. President Donald Trump, speaking at an event in the White House, said he was not surprised by Chinas abstention. Britains U.N. Ambassador Matthew Rycroft told the Security Council that samples taken from the site of the April 4 attack had been analyzed by British scientists and tested positive for the nerve gas sarin. He said Assads government was responsible. Diplomats said that Russia has put forward a rival draft resolution that expresses concern at last weeks gas attack and condemns the U.S. strike on Syria.

Pences counterpart in the worlds most populous Muslim country has voiced worries about U.S. President Donald Trumps immigration policy, which critics say is biased against Muslims, and about his America First mantra on trade and investment. We in Indonesia never change. The change is there. Thats why were asking them now, what is your policy now on the economy, on democracy, now that Trump is in power?, Vice President Jusuf Kalla told Reuters on March 31.   What does it mean, America first? I can say, too, Indonesia first if you say America first. Indonesia is one of 16 countries against which the United States runs a trade deficit that will be investigated by the Trump administration for possible trade abuses. Trumps combative approach will not sit easily with Indonesia, where economic nationalism and protectionist tendencies have flourished since a slump in commodity prices in recent years slammed the brakes on economic growth. Unfortunately I do see a hardening of attitudes on our side, said a senior Indonesian government official, who declined to be named. And its of particular concern because were on that list of 16 countries ... that are going to be investigated. The official said a tougher stand by Indonesian authorities had also contributed to a series of disputes with U.S. companies, including Alphabet Incs Google, miner Freeport-McMoRan Inc and financial services giant JP Morgan Chase & Co. A SERIES OF FACE-OFFS Indonesia has dueled with Google over back taxes and fines running into hundreds of millions of dollars, and with Freeport in a contract row that has crippled operations at the worlds second-largest copper mine, Grasberg. It also dropped JP Morgan as a primary bond dealer after the banks research analysts issued a negative report on the country in November. Its a very unfortunate series of issues which all happen to be American, said the official, who expects them to come up in private during Pences visit. Indonesia is the third stop on an April 15-25 tour that includes South Korea, Japan and Australia. Google declined to comment for this report, and JPMorgan did not respond to a request for comment. Freeport Indonesia spokesman Riza Pratama said: This visit is happening entirely independent of our current negotiations with the government of Indonesia. However, billionaire investor Carl Icahn, Freeports third-biggest shareholder and now a special adviser to Trump, has described Jakartas tactics over the mining contract as disingenuous and insulting, according to the New York Times. Another potential irritant is biodiesel.  The U.S. National Biodiesel Board (NBB), a producer group, has petitioned the U.S. government to impose anti-dumping duties on biodiesel from Indonesia and Argentina, claiming they have flooded the U.S. market. This is one of the issues that we have asked the trade ministry to bring to the meeting (with Pence), Paulus Tjakrawan, a director at the Indonesia Biofuel Producers Association, told Reuters.  Our hope is for the government to be firm ... Otherwise we will be taken advantage of, he said. Not to act like thugs but, for example, if they put barriers to our exports, why not stop importing some of their goods? Despite the strains, the government official said Indonesia would be careful to start its relationship with the Trump administration on the right foot. Indonesian President Joko Widodos approach to foreign policy has been led more by economic interests than geopolitical considerations: he has pursued increased trade and investment from China but keeps a diplomatic distance from Beijing and established a strategic partnership with Washington under former President Barack Obama. U.S. ambassador to Indonesia, Joseph R. Donovan Jr, said in a statement last week that Pences visit reflected a continued commitment to that partnership, would deepen economic engagement and boost regional security cooperation. The U.S. embassy here certainly is going to great lengths to make the visit a success, said the Indonesian official.

Trump told The Wall Street Journal that by withholding the payments, Democrats will call him to negotiate.  Major medical and insurance groups penned a letter to Trump on Wednesday urging him to maintain funding for the subsidies, which amount to about $7 billion a year and are paid directly to insurers. They help cover premiums, deductibles and other medical expenses for about 7 million people who purchase health insurance on the individual health insurance market. House of Representatives Republicans sued the Obama administration for funding the subsidies, which they argue have to be appropriated by Congress. A federal judge in May 2016 ruled in favor of the Republicans, prompting an appeal by the Obama administration. The case is pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Major insurers, including Humana Inc and Aetna, have left or announced their intention to leave the Obamacare exchanges, citing multi-million-dollar losses and patient populations that are far costlier and sicker than they expected.

Congressional aides, lobbyists and analysts say the changing focus could delay passage of a tax bill until late 2017 or 2018, potentially foiling Republican efforts to score a legislative victory for President Donald Trump by August, following last months failed bill to repeal and replace Obamacare health insurance.      Like the healthcare bill, the House Republican tax blueprint stems from Ryans A Better Way legislative agenda launched during the 2016 election campaign.  The House can go and do what they want to do. We are going to formulate our own policies, White House budget director Mick Mulvaney told CNBC in an interview posted on the channels website on Wednesday. You will have a White House, Donald Trump tax plan that we are going to take down to the Hill and try and sell. In the meantime, Senate Republicans are expected to review a 2015 tax package from former House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp, as a starting point for their own tax legislation.  Members of the House Freedom Caucus, a bloc of conservative lawmakers that helped derail Ryans healthcare bill, have also suggested that expanding the deficit to stave off adding new taxes could be acceptable. The blueprint was the Republican ideal, written as a campaign document. Now theyre dealing with the realities of a closely divided Congress and a president who wants a win on this key, signature issue, said one business lobbyist, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  But Ryan is not giving up on the idea of forging agreement with the White House and Senate leaders. Our intention has always been and continues to be to coalesce around a unified GOP plan and those conversations continue, said his spokeswoman, AshLee Strong. Business lobbyists and tax experts warn that a loss of focus could prove fatal for the tax overhaul effort, if the House blueprint disappears from the political stage.    Right now the blueprint is the only plan we have. Theres a great amount of uncertainty about how this would play out without it, or whether this would play out at all, said John Gimigliano, who heads federal legislative and regulatory services for the accounting and consulting group KPMG LLP. Lawmakers on the House Ways and Means Committee say the blueprints viability could become clearer next month, when the committee is expected to hold a series of public hearings and hopes to see a floor vote before the August congressional recess.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin met this month with a bipartisan group of House lawmakers about possibly including infrastructure spending in an administration tax package, a feature that is not part of the blueprint.  The House blueprint, which Ryan rolled out last June, would bring sweeping change to the U.S. tax code by slashing business tax rates by 15 percentage points, allowing companies to immediately write off capital investments and ending taxation of foreign profits of U.S.-based multinational corporations. But its future has become clouded by mounting opposition to two provisions that would raise a combined $2.4 trillion to pay for those tax changes: a border adjustment tax, or BAT, that includes a new 20 percent import tax and the elimination of business deductions for interest payments. Advocates of Ryans plan say it would generate revenues that would help Congress avoid paying for tax cuts by expanding the national deficit. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

It was not clear until the last minute whether Putin would grant Tillerson an audience, but the fact that he did is likely to be seen as a sign that Moscow has not given up on the new U.S. administration and wants to try to improve ties which both sides agree are languishing at a post Cold War low. A joint news conference between Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, and Tillerson showed how much work there is to do though as the Russian used many of his speaking opportunities to lambast Washington over its actions in Syria and what he said was its unhelpful foreign interference in the past. Tillerson, on his first visit to Russia in his current role, struck a more conciliatory stance, but said ties and trust levels were at a low point and restated Washingtons position that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad must eventually relinquish power, a position starkly at odds with Russia. There is a low level of trust between our two countries, Tillerson said. The worlds two foremost nuclear powers cannot have this kind of relationship. Lavrov said that while Russia was not placing its hopes in Assad or any other individual in Syria, toppling the Syrian government was not an option and that a political process had to be allowed to play out.  We discussed Assad today, said Lavrov. I dont remember any positive examples of how a dictator was overthrown and everything was just fine afterwards. Differences over a U.S. missile strike on a Syrian air base last week also bubbled to the surface.  Washington says it acted to punish the Syrian government for what it said was a devastating nerve gas attack Damascus launched against its own people that killed scores. Russia said the U.S. strike was illegal though and Lavrov repeated Moscows stance on Wednesday, saying an international investigation should be left to determine who was to blame and what happened.  It was wrong to blame Assad without knowing the facts, he said.  Tillerson said the United States was confident that Assads forces were behind the gas attack, but said there was no firm information to indicate Russian forces were involved in the same attack. In a move that slightly softened the atmosphere, Lavrov said Putin had agreed to restore a U.S.-Russia air safety agreement covering Syria which Moscow suspended in retaliation for the U.S. missile strikes.

Russia is set to block a push by Western powers at the United Nations later on Wednesday to bolster support for international inquiries into the April 4 toxic gas attack in Syria. It will be Moscows eighth veto in support of the Assad government since the Syrian war began six years ago. To my colleagues from Russia - you are isolating yourselves from the international community every time one of Assads planes drop another barrel bomb on civilians and every time Assad tries to starve another community to death, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, told the U.N. Security Council. During a heated Security Council meeting, Russias deputy U.N. envoy Vladimir Safronkov told the 15-member body that Western countries were wrong to blame Assad for the attack in the town of Khan Sheikhoun. Im amazed that this was the conclusion. No one has yet visited the site of the crime. How do you know that? he said.  The attack prompted the United States to strike a Syrian air base with cruise missiles and worsened relations between the United States and Russia.  President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday trust had eroded between the two countries under President Donald Trump, as Moscow delivered an unusually hostile reception to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in a face-off over Syria.     Britains U.N. Ambassador Matthew Rycroft told the Security Council that samples taken from the site of the gas attack, in a rebel-held area of northern Syria, have tested positive for the nerve gas sarin. He accused Russia of siding with a murderous, barbaric criminal, rather than with their international peers. Safronkov, who demanded Rycroft look at him while he was speaking, responded: I cannot accept that you insult Russia.  Haley also accused Iran of being Assads chief accomplice in the regimes horrific acts, adding: Iran is dumping fuel on the flames of this war in Syria so it can expand its own reach. Western powers blame the gas attack, which killed scores of civilians - many of them children - on Assads forces. Syrias government has denied responsibility for the attack, which prompted a U.S. strike on a Syrian air base. Syrian U.N. Ambassador Bashar Jaafari said Syria had sent dozens of letters to the Security Council, some detailing the smuggling of sarin from Libya through Turkey on a civilian air plane by using a Syrian citizen.

The lawsuits were filed by local chapters of the American Civil Liberties Union against U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Department of Homeland Security and cover their operations in 14 cities stretching from Portland, Maine, to San Diego. The suits are an attempt to enforce requests filed under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) just days after Trump signed his first executive order limiting travel. That Jan. 27 order, intended to fulfill a campaign promise to take a tough stance on immigration, first temporarily barred travelers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The order, which also temporarily barred refugees, led to a weekend of chaos at U.S. airports with travelers barred from entering the country upon landing while thousands of people turned out to protest the measures. A federal judge ordered a halt to enforcement of that ban and Trump followed up in March with a less-sweeping order that did not limit travelers from Iraq, but which has also been challenged in courts. Opponents said the orders violated the U.S. constitutions prohibitions on religious discrimination, citing Trumps campaign promises to impose a Muslim ban. The Trump administration said the restrictions are legal and are necessary to protect U.S. national security. The suits, filed in federal courts, seek disclosure of how many people have been detained or subjected to additional screening since the first executive order as well as the guidance that was provided to DHS staff about how to enforce the order. Customs and Border Protection has a long, rich history of ignoring its obligations under the Freedom of Information Act and so these lawsuits are an effort to enforce its obligations, said Zachary Heiden, legal director at the ACLU of Maine, in a phone interview. He noted that the ACLU filed its FOIA requests for information on Feb. 2. Officials at CBP and DHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the suits. In addition to Portland and San Diego, the suits cover CBP operations in Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Tucson, Miami and Tampa.

Adjustment means we lose. We lose. Lets call it an import tax. Lets call it a reciprocal tax, he added. Nobody gets angry when you say reciprocal tax. Trump was talking about a provision in Ryans House Republican tax blueprint that has polarized the tax reform debate, as the White House tries to score a much-needed legislative victory by overhauling the U.S. tax code for the first time since the Reagan era. The proposal would exempt U.S. corporate export revenues from federal taxes, while requiring U.S. companies to shoulder the same flat 20 percent tax rate on supplies and other purchased products, whether produced overseas or domestically. But the president appeared to favor an import tax that could be adjusted to reflect the country of origins tax rate for U.S. products. He said such an approach could take the form of trade policy rather than tax policy. There has to be a certain reciprocal nature to it, the president said. The other countries, if theyre charging you a 50 percent tax, you say: O.K., whatever you charge, were charging. The House border adjustment tax, or BAT, would help Trump keep his campaign pledge to create manufacturing jobs, advocates say, by exempting U.S. export revenue from tax while subjecting imports to the same 20 percent corporate tax imposed on domestic products. But the measure has been angrily denounced by import-dependent industries and rejected by enough Senate Republicans to call its political viability into question. In his Fox interview, Trump lamented the inequalities of the international tax system, saying U.S. products face high tax rates overseas while foreign-made goods enter the U.S. market tax free. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin floated the idea of a reciprocal tax in February, but administration officials have offered few details and lobbyists have suggested that it could strongly resemble the House BAT proposal.

However, at the same briefing, Spicer drew criticism after he sought to underscore the ghastliness of the gas attack by saying: You had someone as despicable as Hitler who didnt even sink to using chemical weapons. Nazi Germany used gas chambers to kill millions of Jews during the Holocaust. Spicer later apologized and said he should not have made the comparison. It was a mistake. I shouldnt have done it and I wont do it again, Spicer told CNN in an interview. It was inappropriate and insensitive. The White House officials said Russia has frequently offered multiple, conflicting accounts of Syrian government aggression including the incident in the village of Khan Sheikhoun to sow doubt within the international community. The United States launched 59 cruise missiles at a Syrian airfield on Thursday to retaliate after the attack. The strikes thrust Trump, who came to power in January calling for warmer ties with Russia, and his administration into confrontation with Moscow. Chinese President Xi Jinping told Trump in a telephone call on Wednesday that any use of chemical weapons is unacceptable and urged a political solution for Syria, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV said of the telephone exchange. (We) must persevere with moving towards a political solution for the Syria issue. It is very important that the United Nations Security Councilmaintains unity on the Syria issue. (I) hope the Security Council can speak with a single voice, CCTV cited Xi as saying. Trumps ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, said on Tuesday she thought Russia knew about the chemical attack in advance. They didnt look shocked. They didnt look surprised. They were so quick to defend. And then the evidence comes out, and we see exactly what it is and we know exactly what the environment was. Then you realize, she said on CNN. U.S. intelligence indicates that the chemical agent in the attack was delivered by Syrian Su-22 aircraft that took off from the Shayrat airfield, according to a White House report given to reporters. In a four-page document, the White House sought to rebut many of Moscows claims about the circumstances of the attack. It said the Syrian planes were in the vicinity of Khan Sheikhoun about 20 minutes before the attack and left shortly afterward. Additionally, our information indicates personnel historically associated with Syrias chemical weapons program were at Shayrat airfield in late March making preparations for an upcoming attack in northern Syria, and they were present at the airfield on the day of the attack, the report said. Washington wants Russia to stop supporting Assad, who has been fighting a six-year-long civil war against mostly Sunni Muslim rebels, also with the backing of Shiite Muslim Iran. Tillerson carried a message from world powers to Moscow denouncing Russian support for Assad, as the Trump administration took on Americas traditional mantle as leader of a unified West. Tillerson earlier met foreign ministers from the Group of Seven advanced economies and Middle Eastern allies in Italy. They endorsed a joint call for Russia to abandon Assad.         It is clear to us the reign of the Assad family is coming to an end, Tillerson told reporters in Italy. We hope that the Russian government concludes that they have aligned themselves with an unreliable partner in Bashar al-Assad. He said Russia had failed in its role as sponsor of a 2013 deal in which Assad promised to give up chemical weapons. Russia says the chemicals that killed civilians last week belonged to rebels, not Assads government, and accused the United States of an illegal aggression on a false pretext.  Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday he believed Washington planned more missile strikes, and that rebels were planning to stage chemical weapons attacks to provoke them.  We have information that a similar provocation is being prepared ... in other parts of Syria including in the southern Damascus suburbs where they are planning to again plant some substance and accuse the Syrian authorities of using chemical weapons, Putin said. Trump denied further plans in Syria. Were not going into Syria, he said in an interview with the New York Post. Our policy is the same; it hasnt changed. Were not going into Syria. A senior Trump administration official called Putins remarks part of a Russian disinformation campaign. The United States, Britain and France have proposed a revised draft resolution to the 15-member U.N. Security Council similar to a text they circulated last week pushing Syrias government to cooperate with investigators.     The secretary of states role as messenger for a united G7 position is a turning point for Trump, who in the past alarmed allies by voicing skepticism about the value of U.S. support for traditional friends, while calling for closer ties with Moscow. Tillerson is a former chairman of oil company Exxon Mobil Corp, which has gigantic projects in Russia. Putin awarded him Russias Order of Friendship in 2013. He is due to meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Moscow on Wednesday. The Kremlin has said Tillerson has no meeting scheduled with Putin this trip, although some Russian media have reported such a meeting could take place.  Western countries have been calling for Assads departure since 2011, the start of a civil war that has killed at least 400,000 people and created the worlds worst refugee crisis. Assads position on the battlefield became far stronger after Russia joined the war to support him in 2015. The United States and its allies are conducting air strikes in Syria against Islamic State, but until last week Washington had avoided targeting forces of Assads government directly. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Tuesday the United States military policy in Syria had not changed and remains focused on defeating Islamic State.

President Donald Trump, in his biggest foreign policy decision since taking office in January, ordered the strikes after concluding that Syria waged a nerve gas attack in rebel-held territory that killed 87 people, many of them children.  Russia, which has advisers on the ground aiding Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, warned the U.S. strike could have serious consequences. Syria denies involvement. It will not spiral out of control, Mattis told reporters at the Pentagon. Im confident the Russians will act in their own best interest and there is nothing in their best interest to say they want this situation to go out of control. Mattis has repeatedly warned that the U.S. military remained ready to act again should Assad use chemical weapons, saying on Tuesday that Assad would pay a very, very stiff price.    At the same time, he acknowledged that Trump had only authorized the single attack, meaning the U.S. military would not automatically have the authority to strike again should Washington determine another case of chemical weapons use. Mattis also sought to downplay concerns about Pentagon mission creep, saying the U.S. militarys focus in Syria was still fighting Islamic State militants, not becoming entangled in Syrias messy civil war between Assad and his opponents. The rest of the campaign stays on track exactly as it was before Assads violation, Mattis said. The incident has chilled U.S. relations with Moscow after a presidential campaign during which Trump frequently called for an alliance with Russia to fight Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq. It has also led the Trump administration to harden its attitude against Assad weeks after top U.S. officials said they were more concerned with defeating Islamic State militants than getting Assad out of power. I dont see a peaceful, stable Syria in the future that has Assad in charge, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said on Tuesday. I dont see a future Syria that has (Assad) as the leader of that government. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson denounced Russian support for Assad as he prepared to fly to Moscow on Tuesday.

U.S. intelligence indicates that Syrian Su-22 aircraft taking off from Shayrat airfield delivered the nerve agent sarin, according to a White House report given to reporters. Mattis said there was no doubt that Damascus was responsible. Although some U.S. officials have strongly hinted they suspect Russia, which has a presence at Shayrat, may have known something about the planned attack, none have conclusively linked Moscow to the incident itself. Mattis suggested the United States did not have firm evidence that Russia had foreknowledge or was complicit in the chemical attack. It was very clear that the Assad regime planned it, orchestrated it and executed it and beyond that we cant say right now.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - If Democrats thought it was hard to stop President Donald Trumps first U.S. Supreme Court nominee, it promises to be even tougher for them if he gets to fill another vacancy, potentially to replace the most influential justice, Anthony Kennedy. Kennedy, a conservative who sometimes sides with the courts liberals in key cases such as on gay rights and abortion, is one of three justices 78 or older. Justice Stephen Breyer is 78 and fellow liberal Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 84. Former Kennedy Supreme Court clerks said the justice, who turns 81 in July, may be pondering retirement either this year or in 2018. That would give Trump a further chance to shape the court after his first nominee, Neil Gorsuch, was sworn in on Monday for the lifetime job to replace the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia after overcoming fierce Democratic opposition in the Senate confirmation process. Kennedy administered Gorsuchs judicial oath at a White House ceremony, and Trump heaped praise on a justice who has spent nearly three decades on Americas top court, calling him a great man of outstanding accomplishment. Gorsuch is one of Kennedy former clerks. Kennedy is planning a reunion of his clerks in June rather than next year as had been expected. Kennedy, through a court spokesman, declined to comment on his plans. The implications for the court if Kennedy were to step down are enormous. For the past decade he been its swing vote in major cases. Gorsuchs confirmation restored the courts 5-4 conservative majority. If whenever Kennedy leaves the bench he is replaced by a stalwart conservative, that would move the court further to the right. Republicans possess a 52-48 majority in the Senate. In order to secure Gorsuchs confirmation, they voted to prohibit a procedural roadblock called a filibuster that had required a super-majority of 60 votes to allow a confirmation vote for Supreme Court nominees, leaving the minority Democrats with little ammunition for the next nomination fight. I think it will be very hard for Democrats to get much traction to derail a future Trump nominee without the threat of a filibuster, George Washington University political scientist Sarah Binder said. But Democrats and Republicans still are predicting a fierce fight over the next court vacancy. For the life of me I dont understand why the Democrats made such a fuss about this one. They look stupid, Republican Senator Orrin Hatch said last week of Gorsuchs nomination. I expect Armageddon on the next one because thats going to change, assuming Trump gets another one, the direction of the court. It would certainly keep the court in a more conservative mode for a long time. A Democratic congressional aide added, The opposition to Gorsuch could look weak compared to what a similarly conservative nominee would face, if it would tip the balance on the court.  Kennedy is the longest-serving of the nine justices. He was nominated by Republican President Ronald Reagan in 1987 and confirmed by the Senate in 1988 after Democrats thwarted Reagans first choice, outspoken conservative Robert Bork, and his second pick, Douglas Ginsburg, withdrew from consideration. Although he has sided with his conservative colleagues on many issues, Kennedy has supported liberal causes such as gay rights, culminating in writing the landmark 2015 ruling legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide. He also joined the liberals in upholding abortion rights. In 2016, Kennedy joined the courts four liberal justices in a ruling striking down a Texas abortion law imposing strict regulations on doctors and facilities in the strongest endorsement of U.S. abortion rights in more than two decades. He also authored a 2016 ruling upholding the consideration of race in college admissions, joined by the courts liberals. University of Georgia School of Law professor Lori Ringhand said Republicans may be wary of defending an extremely conservative court nominee with the midterm congressional elections coming up in 2018, if another vacancy arises. Its not clear it would be to the electoral advantage to Republicans to have a hotly contested Supreme Court nomination right before the midterms that highlighted a nominees extremely conservative positions on social issues that the majority of the public have actually accepted, Ringhand said.

(Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border on Tuesday to make his case for increased prosecutions of illegal immigrants, pressuring U.S. attorneys to prioritize cases against criminal migrants. Sessions, a long-time proponent of tougher immigration enforcement, told U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents at the Port of Nogales, Arizona, that more illegal migrants should be prosecuted as criminals.    It is normally the role of the Secretary of Homeland Security to meet border agents. But Sessions made the visit to highlight his focus on enforcing federal laws as dozens of U.S. cities try to shield illegal immigrants from stepped-up prosecution and deportation efforts. Why are we doing this? the former U.S. senator said. Because it is what the duly enacted laws of the United States require.   Sessions said that each U.S. attorney would be required to designate a point person on border security prosecutions by April 18. The person in that position, known as a border security coordinator, would be directed to coordinate with the Department of Homeland Security, according to Sessions memo.  The directive did not go beyond existing laws, but Sessions said his order mandates the prioritizations of such enforcement by U.S. attorneys.  The Trump administration has threatened to cut off U.S. Justice Department grants to so-called sanctuary cities that fail to assist federal immigration authorities.  Police in such cities have argued that targeting illegal migrants is an improper use of law enforcement resources. Sessions has said a failure to deport aliens convicted of criminal offenses puts whole communities at risk. Under U.S. law, anyone who harbors or transports an undocumented immigrant, has crossed the border illegally two or more times, resists an immigration officers arrest or commits travel document fraud is subject to criminal prosecution.  Other immigrants apprehended for crossing the border illegally face civil procedures, with deportation the only penalty.  Sessions announcement was the latest move by the Trump administration to deter illegal immigration. President Donald Trump has also called for not releasing migrants with pending court cases, targeting more people in immigration raids and building a wall on the southwest border.  Speaking just 50 yards from a border fence on the Arizona-Mexico border, Sessions said that adding more fencing to the border will be a force multiplier against illegal migration.  He also said the Justice Department plans to add 50 more immigration judges in 2017 and 75 more in 2018. Immigration judges oversee civil immigration cases, but there is a backlog of over 540,000 pending cases due a shortage of judges.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The three countries have proposed a revised draft resolution, diplomats said, similar to a text they circulated to the 15-member council last week that condemns the April 4 attack and pushes Syrias government to cooperate with investigators. Western powers blame the sarin gas attack, which killed scores of civilians - many of them children, on Syrian President Bashar al-Assads forces.  Syrias government has denied responsibility for the attack, which prompted a U.S. strike on a Syrian air base. The Security Council vote would come at the end of a visit to Moscow by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. A senior Security Council diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the most likely scenario appeared to be a veto of the U.N. resolution by Syrian ally Russia.

Russia is one of five council veto powers, along with China, the United States, Britain and France. We cannot give up and we must try in good faith, the best we can, to have a text of the Security Council condemning the attack, asking for a thorough investigation, French U.N.

This team has already found Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks in 2014 and 2015 and Islamic State militants used mustard gas.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Maryland lawmakers have passed a first-in-the-nation measure that lets the state attorney general sue generic drug makers that sharply raise prices in a move aimed at fighting what legislators call price-gouging. The bill overwhelmingly was approved by the Democratic-controlled legislature on Monday and hailed by Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh as a way to check sharply higher prices for crucial generic drugs. The Maryland measure comes as concerns about rising U.S. drug costs have been building for years. For example the 2015 decision by Turing Pharmaceuticals to increase the cost of a life-saving, anti-infection drug by 5,000 percent sparked widespread outrage. The legislation takes aim at a generic drug market that makes up 88 percent of U.S. pharmaceutical sales and totaled $75 billion in 2015, according to Froshs office. The market seems to bear it and so some of these manufacturers are charging as much as they possibly can, Frosh said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. Governor Larry Hogan, a Republican, has not said whether he would sign the legislation. His representatives did not respond to requests for comment. The bill allows Marylands state authority on Medicaid, a federal healthcare program for the poor, to let the attorney generals office know when it sees patients being charged an unconscionable increase for essential generic drugs. The attorney general could then seek an explanation from the manufacturer and sue to protect consumers, with a fine of up to $10,000 for each violation. A judge could order the company to reverse its price increase. Generics are pharmaceuticals that are equivalent to a brand-name drug. They usually are available after patent protections for the original maker run out. The bill did not touch on branded prescription drugs new to the market since their manufacturers have development and patent costs they are entitled to recoup, Frosh said.  Maryland is the first state to pass a measure to combat excessive price increases, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island and Tennessee have similar legislation pending, the conference said. The legislation would have a chilling effect on the generic market in Maryland, said Chester Davis Jr., president of the Association for Accessible Medicines, which represents generic drug makers.  Use of generic drugs had saved Maryland $3.7 billion in 2015, he said. To focus on the side of the ecosystem that is actually driving the savings and not the costs definitely seems counterintuitive to us, he said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillersons visit to Moscow this week will be an early test of whether the Trump administration can use any momentum generated by a missile attack on a Syrian air base to craft and execute a strategy to end the Syrian war. Even before Trump ordered last weeks strike in retaliation for a nerve gas attack, Tillersons visit was certain to be dominated by thorny issues, including Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, an apparent violation of an important arms control treaty, and seeing what cooperation, if any, is possible in the fight against Islamic State. Now, Tillerson, a former oil executive with no diplomatic experience, is charged with avoiding a major U.S. confrontation with Russia while exacting some concessions from Moscow. Those include getting rid of Syrian President Bashar al-Assads remaining chemical weapons and pressing Assad to negotiate Syrias future. The Kremlin said on Monday Tillerson was not scheduled to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin during his visit, a move that could point to tensions. It may also suggest that Tillerson will instead follow strict diplomatic protocol and only meet his direct counterpart, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. The State Department said last week a meeting had not been confirmed with Putin, who met with Tillerson when the Texan headed Exxon Mobil. Russia, along with Iran, is Assads primary backer, and its intervention in Syrias war has been crucial to ensuring his grip on power, although no longer over the entire country. Tillerson said he had not seen hard evidence that Russia knew ahead of time about the chemical weapons attack, which killed at least 70 people, but he planned to urge Moscow to rethink its support for Assad in the April 12 talks. Im hopeful that we can have constructive talks with the Russian government, with Foreign Minister Lavrov and have Russia be supportive of a process that will lead to a stable Syria, Tillerson told ABCs The Week on Sunday. The U.S. cruise missile strike on Thursday, meant to dissuade Assad from using chemical weapons again, gives Tillerson more credibility with Russian officials and will boost his efforts, observers and former officials said.   The demonstration of the administrations willingness to use force has the potential to add some leverage to the diplomacy, said Antony Blinken, a deputy to former Secretary of State John Kerry. The U.S. strike - ordered less than three days after the gas attack - could make it clear to Russia that the United States will hold Moscow accountable for Assad, Blinken said. Tillerson ought to be very matter of fact in his meetings, Blinken said, sending Russia a message that: If you dont rein him in, we will take further action. Tillerson said on Thursday that Russia had failed in its responsibility to remove Syrias chemical weapons under a 2013 agreement, which he argued showed Russia was either complicit with the gas attacks or simply incompetent. Securing a Russian commitment on eliminating Assads chemical weapons is likely to be first on his agenda, said Evelyn Farkas, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense in the Obama administration. The talks will be a major test of Tillersons diplomatic skills. As a former chief executive at Exxon Mobil, he has experience doing business in Russia, but no background in the often public negotiations that international diplomacy requires. It also is unclear if Trump, who has expressed skepticism about multilateral institutions such as the European Union and United Nations, will have patience for the protracted negotiations that a comprehensive deal on Syria would require. Russia condemned the missile strike as illegal and Putin said it would harm U.S.-Russia ties. Moscow also said it would keep military channels of communication open with Washington, but would not exchange any information through them. It was an unforeseen turn of events for Trump, who praised Putin repeatedly during last years election campaign and said he would like to work more closely with Russia to defeat Islamic State. Just over a week ago, top administration officials were signaling that removing Assad is no longer a U.S. priority. But one senior official said it was significant that Russia suspended, and did not cancel, cooperation with the United States after the air strike. Nor did Lavrov cancel Tillersons visit to Moscow, suggesting Russia may be willing to tolerate the single strike. As of this weekend, the talks were still on. Theyre going to try to draw a line around this incident, said Alexander Vershbow, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia during the George W. Bush administration. They are still not giving up on working with the Trump administration. The Trump administration also wants to keep the focus in Syria on defeating Islamic State rather than opening a conflict with Russia or Syrias government. Another U.S. official said one hope is that Moscow will see Tillersons visit and a discussion about how to cooperate to stop Assads use of banned weapons as a tacit acknowledgement of Russias great power status, one of Putins main ambitions. The strikes arent necessarily a bad thing for Russia, said Andrew Tabler, a fellow with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Russias had a very hard time getting President Assad to come to the negotiating table in any kind of meaningful way. Now, Tabler said, the Russians can point to more U.S. strikes as the price of further intransigence by Assad.

The decision by U.S. District Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos came after an appeals court last year said the 2011 law had an outsized impact on minority voters. The court sent the case back to Ramos to determine if lawmakers intentionally wrote the legislation to be discriminatory. Ramos said in a 10-page decision that evidence establishes that a discriminatory purpose was at least one of the substantial or motivating factors behind passage of the measure. The terms of the bill were unduly strict, she added. Spokesmen for Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton Jr. and Governor Greg Abbott, both Republicans, could not be reached for comment. In January, after the Supreme Court declined to hear the case, Paxton said it was a common sense law to prevent voter fraud. The ruling on voter ID comes about a month after two federal judges ruled that Texas lawmakers drew up three U.S. congressional districts to undermine the influence of Hispanic voters. The measure requires voters to present photo identification such as a drivers license, passport or military ID card. Plaintiffs have argued the law hits elderly and poorer voters, including minorities, hardest because they are less likely to have identification. They contend the measure is used by Republicans to suppress voters who typically align with Democrats. The legislation has been in effect since 2011 despite the legal challenges. Ramos said the law had met criteria set by the U.S. Supreme Court to show intent that included its discriminatory impact, a pattern not explainable on other than racial grounds, Texas history of discriminatory practices and the laws unusually swift passage. Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, one of the plaintiffs, said the ruling showed other states that discriminatory laws would not stand up to legal scrutiny. This is a good ruling that confirms what we have long known, that Texas voter ID law stands as one of the most discriminatory voting restrictions of its kind, she said. In a shift from its stance under former President Barack Obama, the U.S. Justice Department dropped a discrimination claim against the law in February. The department said that the state legislature was considering changing the law in ways that might correct shortcomings. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Pyongyang has conducted five nuclear tests and is working to develop nuclear-tipped missiles that can reach the United States. A U.S. official told Reuters over the weekend that a U.S. Navy strike group led by a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier was steaming towards the western Pacific as a show of force. Tillerson, on his first visit to Moscow as secretary of state, is due to hold talks with Sergei Lavrov, his Russian counterpart, on Wednesday at a time when U.S.-Russia ties are languishing at a post Cold War low. The Russian foreign ministry, in a statement ahead of his visit, said it was concerned about many aspects of U.S. foreign policy, including on Libya, Yemen and Syria, but said it was particularly concerned about North Korea. We are really worried about what Washington has in mind for North Korea after it hinted at the possibility of a unilateral military scenario, the statement said.

(Reuters) - Alabama Governor Robert Bentley resigned on Monday after pleading guilty to two misdemeanors related to campaign finance violations and linked to his relationship with a former adviser, ending a year-long scandal that has enveloped the states government. The guilty pleas were part of an agreement with prosecutors that called for him to step down, said Ellen Brooks, special prosecutor appointed by the state Attorney General Steve Marshall to investigate Bentley. I have decided it is time for me to step down as Alabama governor, said Bentley at a news conference in the state capital of Montgomery, adding that his service was a calling that God placed on my life. He said he would work with his replacement, Lieutenant Governor Kay Ivey, who was sworn in as governor about an hour after his resignation. Ivey, a Republican, becomes the second woman to serve as Alabamas governor after Lurleen Wallace, wife of George Wallace, who served from January 1967 until her death in May 1968. The Ivey administration will be open, it will be transparent, and it will be honest, Ivey said during a short speech after her swearing in by the minister at her Montgomery Baptist church.  What we have done today is to put an end to this administration, Brooks told reporters. It states to all of us that no one is above the law, even the governor. The Alabama Ethics Commission last week found Bentley probably violated ethics and campaign finance laws after it completed an investigation into allegations that he used public funds to conceal his relationship with Rebekah Mason, a senior adviser who later resigned. It accused Bentley of ordering law enforcement officers to track down recordings that suggested he had had an affair with Mason and accused him of retaliating against an official who discovered the relationship. Bentley has denied having a physical relationship with Mason, who is married, and had repeatedly vowed not to resign, saying he had done nothing illegal. His marriage of 50 years also ended as the scandal unfolded. In his statement on Monday, Bentley apologized for his actions, but did not mention a relationship with Mason. He was charged with misuse of campaign funds and failure to file campaign financial reports on a timely basis. After his guilty pleas, an Alabama judge ordered Bentley to serve one year of unsupervised probation, make restitution and give up his retirement benefits from the state. He also agreed not to run for another political office, Brooks said. After Bentley agreed to the deal, the Alabama House Judiciary Committee suspended hearings which began on Monday that could have led to his impeachment.

Thirty mostly Democratic lawmakers signed the letter to U.S. Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, and Secretary of Defense, James Mattis, citing expectations that the administration plans to go ahead with the sale. As you know, the previous administration made the decision in December 2016 to halt a planned sale of precision-guided munitions (PGM) to Saudi Arabia due to concerns over widespread civilian casualties and significant deficiencies in RSAFs (the Saudi Air Forces) targeting capabilities, the letter, dated Friday but released on Monday, said. According to recent reports, however, the State Department has now reversed course and removed the suspension on these PGM sales, they said in the letter, led by Representative Ted Lieu, a Democratic member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. The State and Defense Departments do not comment on planned arms sales before formal notification is sent to Congress. In December, then-President Barack Obamas administration decided to halt the sale of the systems, manufactured by Raytheon Co, that convert bombs into precision-guided munitions because of concerns about the extent of civilian casualties during Saudi Arabias campaign in Yemen. Congressional aides told Reuters the Trump administration was on the verge of sending a formal notification to Congress about the sale, which would trigger the formal 30-day review to allow members of Congress to attempt to pass legislation to stop any sale. Trump has said he wants to clear the way for U.S. arms sales abroad, to bolster efforts by U.S. partners to fight militant groups and help create U.S. jobs. His administration recently told Congress it also planned to pursue sales to Bahrain and Nigeria that had been delayed under Obama by human rights concerns. Congressional aides said they expected an effort to pass legislation to stop the PGM sale. However, such legislation has never succeeded. A measure seeking to block the sale of tanks to Riyadh failed in September.

Trump was able to fulfill a top campaign promise when the Republican-led U.S. Senate voted to confirm the conservative Colorado-based federal appeals court judge to the lifetime job on Friday despite vehement Democratic opposition. With Gorsuch aboard, the court has five conservative justices and four liberals, a majority that could be pivotal in deciding a range of issues including abortion, gun control, the death penalty, presidential powers, political spending, environmental regulation and religious rights.  Standing in the White House Rose Garden under bright sunshine on a warm spring day, Trump tied the occasion to the political aims of his administration, as the eight other members of the nations highest court looked on. Together we are in a process of reviewing and renewing and also rebuilding our country, Trump told an audience that included conservative activists and administration officials. A new optimism is sweeping across our land and a new faith in America is filling our hearts and lifting our sights. Gorsuch filled a vacancy that had lingered for nearly 14 months after conservative Justice Antonin Scalias February 2016 death. Gorsuchs judicial oath was administered by Justice Anthony Kennedy, for whom Gorsuch worked as a clerk as a young lawyer. Gorsuch becomes the first justice to serve alongside a former boss. Trump made a point of thanking Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for his role in winning confirmation. McConnell last week led the effort to change long-standing Senate rules in order to end a Democratic blockade of Gorsuchs nomination. Under McConnells leadership, the Senate last year refused to consider Democratic former President Barack Obamas nomination of Merrick Garland to replace Scalia, an appointment that would have tilted the court to the left for the first time in decades. Ive always heard that the most important thing that a president of the United States does is appoint people, hopefully great people like this appointment, to the United States Supreme Court, Trump said. He will decide cases not based on his personal preferences but based on a fair and objective reading of the law, Trump said of Gorsuch. During last years presidential campaign, Trump pledged to pick a justice who would overturn the landmark 1973 Supreme Court Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion. During his Senate confirmation hearing, Gorsuch declined to answer about whether Roe v. Wade and other important court precedents were properly decided. To the American people, I am humbled by the trust placed in me today, Gorsuch said, with his wife Louise and the Republican president standing behind him. I will never forget that to whom much is given, much will be expected. And I promise you that I will do all my powers permit to be a faithful servant of the Constitution and laws of this great nation. Those attending included liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who called Trump a faker during the presidential campaign but later said she regretted the remark. Trump at the time called for her resignation, saying her mind is shot.  Scalias widow, Maureen, also attended. Gorsuch earlier in the day took his separate constitutional oath, administered by Chief Justice John Roberts, in a private ceremony at the Supreme Court with the other justices. Gorsuch, 49, could serve for decades. Trump may be able to make further appointments to make the court even more solidly conservative, with three justices 78 or older: Ginsburg, 84; fellow liberal Stephen Breyer, 78; and conservative swing vote Kennedy, 80. Gorsuch will take part in the courts next round of oral arguments, starting on April 17. They include a religious rights case on April 19 in which a Missouri church is objecting to being denied state funds for a playground project due to a state ban on providing public money to religious organizations. Gorsuch can be expected to have an immediate impact on the court. He takes part on Thursday in the justices private conference to decide which cases to take up. Among cases up for discussion is one in which gun activists are seeking to expand gun rights to include carrying concealed firearms in public. Another is a bid to reinstate Republican-backed North Carolina voting restrictions that a lower court found were intended to suppress black voter turnout. A third concerns whether a Christian bakery owner can object on religious grounds to making a cake for a gay couple.  With Gorsuch sworn in, his new colleagues could decide to hear new arguments in their next term, starting in October, in cases argued during their current term in which they may have been split 4-4 and did not yet decide.

The tax opponents will target 40 members of Congress in 11 states, said coalition spokesman Joshua Baca.

The anti-border tax group is planning to host a town hall meeting next week in Nevada with Republican Senator Dean Heller, which will also be co-sponsored by local business groups and Americans For Prosperity, the conservative group funded by the Republican Koch brothers which also opposes the border tax. Town hall meetings have gained more attention recently as events featuring Republican lawmakers have been targeted by activists to voice their opposition to several proposals, including repealing the Affordable Care Act which widened health insurance coverage for about 20 million Americans. Additionally, the anti-tax group will hold a discussion in Ohio with Republican Representative David Joyce, where he will hear from local furniture store owners who would be affected by a border tax, Baca said. Concurrently, members of the Retail Industry Leaders Association, which is comprised of large retailers like Autozone (AZO.N) , Walgreens Boot Alliance, Inc. (WBA.O) and J.C. Penny Company, are using the recess to give members of Congress behind-the-scenes tours of both their headquarters and stores in an effort to persuade them against the tax, spokesman Brian Dodge said.  Both groups are hoping to make more voters aware of their position and are armed with an opinion poll by a pollster who also works for several Republican members of Congress.  The poll, shared first with Reuters and which was conducted with funding from opponents of the tax, found 63 percent of voters are against the tax, including 70 percent of women. Additionally, the poll makes the case that 56 percent of voters say they would be less likely to vote for a member of Congress who supports the tax proposal.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration must decide by the end of this month whether to grant Belarus continued relief from U.S. economic sanctions despite a stiff government crackdown on street demonstrations last month. The renewal decision is considered a low-level priority for the administration, which is facing bigger questions about U.S. relations with Russia and China, and with most major diplomatic positions still unfilled. But whether the United States renews the sanctions relief or instead returns to blacklisting nine major Belarus companies is an early test for the Trump administration on the importance it puts on human rights versus efforts to coax countries in Russias orbit to turn to the West. The sanctions waivers, which began in 2015 and were extended twice last year, were tied to domestic political reforms and intended to encourage Belarus, which has long historical ties to Russia, to move closer to the European Union and the United States. Now, however, U.S. officials are alarmed by the arrests of hundreds of people last month during an attempt to hold a street protest in the capital Minsk, and concerned if continuing sanctions relief could be seen as ignoring the crackdown. Belarus authorities last month raided a human rights groups offices and used violence against peaceful protesters, rights groups say. This most recent crackdown sharpened peoples focus, said a U.S. congressional aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Now there is a real question about whether or not they (the sanctions) should be reimposed. The decision must be taken by the end of April. If the administration makes no decision, the sanctions will be re-imposed. NATO members, including Poland and the Baltic states, feel threatened by what they see as increased Russian intervention in Europe, including Moscows annexation of Ukraines Crimea region in 2014. Belarus is so important from a strategic point of view and its so dependent economically on Russia that we are really very concerned, said Piotr Wilczek, the Polish ambassador to the United States. Belarus is becoming more and more part of this wider Russian problem we have. The Trump administration is inclined to renew the sanctions relief, but likely would wait until the last minute to make sure they dont do anything awful, said a U.S. official, also speaking on condition of anonymity. State and Treasury Department officials declined to comment in detail on the Belarus sanctions. The Belarus Ministry of Foreign Affairs declined to comment. President George W. Bush in 2006 blacklisted top Belarus officials, including President Alexander Lukashenko, for undermining the countrys democratic processes or human rights abuses. The United States later added large Belarus companies to the sanctions list. But in 2015, Lukashenko released political prisoners and indicated he was open to better relations with the West. That October, President Barack Obama temporarily lifted sanctions on nine Belarus companies, including petrochemical conglomerate Belneftekhim and tire manufacturer Belshina.  Now, however, Lukashenko appears to be keeping his country firmly in Moscows orbit. In a letter to him last week, four U.S. senators said they were concerned over the crackdown and that he decided to allow Russia to conduct provocative military exercises in Belarus later this year.

Trump will meet with the heads of General Motors Co (GM.N), International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), a government official briefed on the matter said. Trump has pledged to unlock $1 trillion in private and public infrastructure investments to fix bridges, improve the electrical grid and broadband internet, modernize airports and potentially rebuild hospitals for veterans. Nearly three months after his inauguration, Trump will again seek the advice and funds of the private sector for his national rebuilding program. Trump also wants to streamline the income tax system, cut federal regulations, reduce corporate income tax and add new taxes to prod companies to keep or move production to the United States. He has held numerous sessions with CEOs since taking office. The chief executives are part of Trumps Strategy and Policy Forum that was created in December and last met with the president on Feb. 3. The business leaders from a variety of sectors will also meet in small groups with Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and White House budget director Mick Mulvaney, Spicer said. Participants in Ross meeting include Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon and Indra Nooyi, chief executive officer of PepsiCo Inc PEP.N. Pruitts meeting will include GM CEO Mary Barra and Paul Atkins, CEO of Patomak Global Partners LLC and a Republican former SEC commissioner. Chaos meeting will include Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) CEO Elon Musk. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who heads the worlds largest investment management firm, in a letter to shareholders Monday backed calls for private investment to rebuild U.S. infrastructure. The Trump administration plans to unveil as soon as May the $1 trillion infrastructure plan over 10 years. Fixing crumbling roads and bridges is not enough. We need to be focused on reshaping our world, not just repairing it, Fink wrote. Last week, Trump pitched infrastructure projects to about 50 New York area CEOs. National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn told executives that privatizing air traffic control, which the administration proposed in its budget outline in March, could be a big boost. Other chief executives taking part Tuesday include consultant EY, Boston Consulting Group, the Cleveland Clinic and Global Infrastructure Partners, an infrastructure investment fund.

John Kerry, Tillersons predecessor, often met Putin as well as the Russian foreign minister when he visited Moscow, and Putin granted several audiences to the Texan when he ran oil major Exxon Mobil before taking his current job. Putin even personally awarded Tillerson a top Russian state award  the Order of Friendship  in 2013, and it was widely expected that the former oilman would meet Putin on what is his first trip to Russia as secretary of state. But Putins spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters on Monday that no such meeting was planned, suggesting Tillerson will follow strict diplomatic protocol and only meet his direct counterpart, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. We have not announced any such meetings and right now there is no meeting with Tillerson in the presidents diary, Peskov told reporters on a conference call. He did not say why Putin was not planning to receive Tillerson. U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a missile strike on a Syrian military base last week in retaliation for what Washington and its allies say was a poisonous gas attack in which scores of civilians were killed. Moscow says there is no proof that the Syrian military carried out the attack, and called the U.S. missile strike an act of aggression that violates international law.   Tillersons visit is being seen as an early test of whether Trumps new administration can use any momentum generated by striking the Syrian base to craft and execute a strategy to end the war there. Even before Trump ordered the strike in retaliation for a nerve gas attack, Tillersons visit was certain to be dominated by thorny issues. Those include alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Washingtons accusation that Russia is violating an important arms control treaty, and trying to bridge differences on how to conduct the fight against Islamic State. Syria, ironically, was one of the few areas where analysts believed Moscow and Washington might be able to find common ground. Peskov, Putins spokesman, said on Monday that the U.S. strikes had shown Washingtons total unwillingness to cooperate on Syria. Reacting to media reports that Tillerson would use his visit to press Moscow to back away from supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Russias biggest Middle East ally, Peskov signaled that was a non-starter.

(Reuters) - After the crushing electoral losses that swept Donald Trump into the White House and sealed Republican control of the U.S. Congress, the Democrats road to recovery winds through the leafy, well-heeled suburbs of north Atlanta.  Here, Democrats are threatening a stunning special election upset that could signal how well the party can turn Trumps low approval ratings into political gains. And they appear to have an ally in the April 18 vote: Trump himself.  In the most-watched congressional race so far in the Trump era, a wave of grassroots anti-Trump fervor has positioned Democrat Jon Ossoff, a 30-year-old political newcomer, to possibly capture a House of Representatives seat held by Republicans for decades, one of 24 seats Democrats need nationwide to reclaim the House.  MORE FROM REUTERS: Russian naval activity in Europe exceeds Cold War levels: U.S. admiralIran chides Gulf ArabsRussian computer programmer arrested in Spain: embassy The grassroots intensity here is electric, and its because folks are concerned that what is happening in Washington doesnt represent our values, Ossoff said in an interview. This is a chance for this community to stand up and make a statement about what we believe.  With Democrats desperate for signs of hope after Hillary Clintons loss to Trump, Ossoffs underdog Make Trump Furious campaign has endeared him to national anti-Trump activists and pushed him well ahead of 17 rivals in polls. The documentary filmmaker and former congressional aide raised a jaw-dropping $8.3 million in the first quarter, his campaign said.  Ive never seen the Democrats around here so engaged, and its Donald Trump who got us so engaged, said Carolyn Hadaway, 77, a veteran party activist and retired software engineer from Marietta, a city of about 60,000 people in Georgias central Cobb County.  Georgia would seem an unlikely venue for a Democratic revival. Trump won it by about 5 percentage points in November. And its voters backed Republican nominees in eight of the last nine presidential contests, including the last six in a row.  But demographic changes are brewing. Growing minority communities and transplants from other regions have made Atlantas suburbs increasingly competitive for Democrats. Georgias sixth congressional district, the location for Aprils special election, exemplifies changes common in booming southern cities like Atlanta, Charlotte and Nashville.  The district is white collar, educated and doing well economically, with median household incomes of $80,000 versus $50,000 statewide, and nearly 60 percent of adults holding a college or professional degree, more than twice the statewide average. It is also increasingly diverse, and in recent years became a magnet for well-educated immigrants from India and other parts of Asia.  The district was about 80 percent white at the turn of the century. But since then, the black share of the population has grown from 10 percent to 13 percent, the Hispanic share has doubled to 12.5 percent and Asian representation doubled to more than 10 percent.  About a fifth of the district is now foreign born  twice the statewide average, according to census data.  Though newer immigrants may not be eligible to vote, census data indicate more than 40 percent are naturalized citizens, potentially bringing a different set of views on issues like immigration to the table than the voters in this district who sent Trump adviser and former speaker of the House Newt Gingrich to Congress for 10 straight terms.  Aprils special election fills the seat vacated by Tom Price, the new secretary of health and human services. It gives both parties a chance to test their messages for election battles next year in suburban districts where Democrats need to make inroads and where Trumps populist economic message did not sell well in November.  While Price sailed to re-election with 62 percent of the vote, Trump barely beat Clinton in Georgias sixth district by one percentage point. In 2012, Republican Mitt Romney beat Democratic President Barack Obama in the district by 23 points.  Republican candidates nationwide will closely watch the result as they calculate whether to embrace the president.  The 11 Republicans in the race have split between those who portray themselves as Trump supporters and establishment candidates who keep a respectful and sometimes wary distance.  Im ready to support him, former state senator Dan Moody, who was endorsed by U.S. Senator David Perdue, said of Trump in an interview. But Im not going to jump over a cliff with him.  Grassroots Democratic groups flood the districts tidy suburban neighborhoods on the weekends, busing in volunteers from as far away as Maryland to go door to door on Ossoffs behalf.  The Ossoff momentum worries Republicans, say party officials, and outside help has arrived. A super PAC aligned with House Republican leaders put more than $2 million into ads painting Ossoff as too young and inexperienced.  Ossoff played down the strategic value of a possible upset.  The national implications here will be about how this affects the political calculus for folks in the Republican conference in the House, not about how Democrats are supposed to run in the midterms, he said.  In a low turnout special election, getting supporters to the polls is vital, and Democrats have voted early in greater numbers than Republicans so far.  We arent panicking, but there is concern, said Maggie Holliman, a member of the Republican state executive committee.  Ossoffs best chance is to win the April 18 vote, a jungle primary that features all 18 candidates from both parties on the same ballot. If no one reaches 50 percent, the top two vote getters square off on June 20.  Republicans are confident they can win a one-on-one race with Ossoff, as the party unites with organizational and financial help pouring into the Republican-majority district.  There is a chance Ossoff can win without a runoff, but thats his only chance. Hes benefiting from unified Democratic support and Republicans being highly divided, said Georgia-based Republican strategist Joel McElhannon.  Polls show Ossoff hovering in the low 40s, not enough to avoid a runoff. The leading Republican, former Secretary of State Karen Handel, is well behind.  Handel has been cautious in talking about Trump. She said in an interview she expected to work with him on issues such as tax reform and border security, but first and foremost she would be a conservative advocate for her district.  By contrast Republicans Bob Gray, a local business executive, and Bruce LeVell, head of Trumps national diversity coalition, pledge undivided loyalty to the White House. Gray said he was the Republican in the race who performed the behind-the-scenes political groundwork for Trump in the district.  LeVell pulled out his cellphone and showed a reporter text messages from Trump aides Kellyanne Conway, Sarah Huckabee Sanders and even Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner to prove his insider status with the White House.  If people are looking for someone to help Trump, Im their guy, he said.

Trump has made reducing U.S. trade deficits a key focus of his economic agenda to try to grow American manufacturing jobs. He has taken particular aim at renegotiating trade relationships with China and Mexico.     The new order, if issued, would seek to determine whether U.S. trade deficits for those product lines are the result of dumping of imported products below cost and unfair subsidies by foreign governments, the official said late on Sunday in Washington. That could eventually lead to additional import duties, but any decisions on such punishments would depend on the probes findings, not pre-determined conclusions, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the order was still being considered. The official did not specify which product lines could be investigated. The administration would use the results of that investigation to determine the best path forward, which could include everything from no action at all to the levying of supplemental duties, the official said. The Axios news website earlier quoted an official saying such an executive order would likely target steel and aluminum, two industries that are battling for more protection from Chinese imports. Axios said it also may target household appliances, where South Korean manufacturers with Chinese factories have gained market share. The Trump administration official did not provide any details to Reuters on timing of the executive order, which would be separate from a March 31 Trump order authorizing a 90-day Commerce Department study of trade abuses and their effect on U.S. trade deficits. TRUMP-XI 100-DAY PLAN   News of the additional order comes two days after Trumps first meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Florida, where the two leaders agreed to launch a 100-day plan for trade talks aimed at boosting U.S. exports to China and reducing the U.S. trade deficit with China. Trump during his election campaign had threatened punitive tariffs on Chinese imports and to declare China a currency manipulator. He has not followed through on either threat thus far. The U.S. steel industry has already won extensive anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties on imports from China and other countries and the aluminum industry is seeking similar protections. U.S. appliance maker Whirlpool Corp. has also won anti-dumping duties against Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics brand clothes washers made in China. But U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Trumps nominee to be the top U.S. trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, have said they would work to find new trade remedies to stop unfairly traded imports. Among options they are expected to explore are trade actions under Section 301 of the Tariff Act of 1930, a provision used extensively in the 1980s to raise tariffs and import quotas on certain Japanese products including steel and motorcycles. Section 301 has largely gone unused since the World Trade Organization was launched in 1995.    ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

After the United States launched cruise missile strikes on a Syrian air base alleged to have launched a deadly poison gas attack on Syrian civilians, Trump administration officials said they were prepared to take further actions if necessary. Trumps United Nations ambassador, Nikki Haley, said the United States had multiple priorities in Syria and that stability there was impossible with Assad as president. In no way do we see peace in that area with Assad as the head of the Syrian government, Haley told NBCs Meet the Press. And we have to make sure that were pushing that process. The political solution has to come together for the good of the people of Syria, she said. Her comments appeared at odds with those of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who said the U.S. missile strike was aimed solely at deterring the use of chemical weapons by Assad. There is no change to our military posture in Syria, Tillerson said on ABCs This Week program. Tillerson said the U.S. priority in Syria was defeating Islamic State, the militant group also known as ISIS. Once ISIS is defeated, the United States could turn its attention to trying to help bring about a political process that could bring about stability in Syria, he said. It is through that political process that we believe the Syrian people will ... be able to decide the fate of Bashar al-Assad, Tillerson said. A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said any difference in nuance was inadvertent and unintentional, and declined to comment further. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump said defeating Islamic State was a higher priority than persuading Assad to step down. The Republican criticized calls by his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, for the establishment of a no-fly zone and safe zones to protect non-combatants. What we should do is focus on ISIS. We should not be focusing on Syria, Trump told Reuters in an interview last October. Tillerson on Sunday blamed Russia for enabling the poison gas attack by failing to follow through on a 2013 agreement to secure and destroy chemical weapons stockpiles in Syria. The failure related to the recent strike and the recent terrible chemical weapons attack in large measure is a failure on Russias part to achieve its commitment to the international community, he added. Russia swiftly condemned last weeks attack. On Sunday, a joint command center comprised of Russian, Iranian and militia forces supporting Assad said it would respond to any new aggression and increase its support for its ally. Trump ordered the missile strikes on the Syrian air base after blaming Assad for the chemical weapons attack, which killed at least 70 people, many of them children, in the Syrian town of Khan Sheikhoun. The Syrian government has denied it was behind the assault. Speaking on Fox News Sunday, White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster said the United States was prepared to do more regarding military action in Syria if necessary. On whether Assad should be removed from power, McMaster said: We are not saying that we are the ones who are going to effect that change. What we are saying is other countries have to ask themselves some hard questions. Russia should ask themselves, What are we doing here? McMaster said. Lawmakers from both the Democratic and Republican parties were supportive of Trumps decision to attack the Syrian air base, but some Republican senators said they were concerned about the lack of policy clarity and Tillersons strategy of leaving Assads fate unresolved while concentrating on Islamic State. There seem to be a difference in what Ambassador Haley is saying, that Assad has no future, and what I heard this morning from Secretary Tillerson, Republican Senator Marco Rubio told ABC, adding that Tillersons strategy wont work.  There is no such thing as Assad yes, but ISIS no, Rubio said. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, speaking on NBCs Meet the Press, said removing Assad from power would require the United States to commit thousands more troops to the country to create safe-haven areas for the opposition to regroup, retrain and ultimately take control of the country.

Priebus message to Bannon and Kushner was to stop with the palace intrigue and focus on the presidents agenda, the official told Reuters. Both aides left having agreed that it was time to bury the hatchet and move forward, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Four former advisers to the president said Trump is accustomed to chaos in his decades-long career as a real estate developer but that even he has grown weary of the infighting. Hes got a long fuse for that kind of thing, said one former adviser. I imagine he has gotten tired of this. The White House dismissed persistent talk that Trump might be on the verge of a staff shakeup. The only thing we are shaking up is the way Washington operates as we push the presidents aggressive agenda forward, spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said. The Trump White House has been a hotbed of palace intrigue since he took office on Jan. 20. But the drama has intensified after the failed effort to get healthcare legislation approved by the House of Representatives and the rocky rollout of an executive order attempting to temporarily ban citizens of six Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States. Bannon, former chief of the conservative news organization Breitbart News, has been at odds with Kushner and Gary Cohn, the head of the White House National Economic Council, an administration official and the four former advisers said. The former Trump advisers said Kushner, husband of Trump daughter Ivanka Trump, is trying to tug the president into a more mainstream position, while Bannon is trying to keep aflame the nationalist fervor that carried Trump to his unexpected election victory on Nov. 8. Bannon is getting some of the blame for the administrations early stumbles because, one former adviser said, The president demands results.In what was viewed as a sign of Bannons declining influence, he was removed from his seat on the National Security Council this week. Administration officials said this was done at the urging of national security adviser H.R. McMaster, with whom Bannon had clashed. Some of the former Trump advisers said Priebus is at fault for not gaining control of the feuding and said Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs executive, would be a candidate to replace him. Priebus is the former chairman of the Republican National Committee and bucked many in his party by putting the weight of the RNC behind Trump when it was clear he would be the partys presidential nominee. Reince is chief of staff, said a source familiar with the issue. Hes not going anywhere. Republican strategist Charlie Black, who has known Trump for 30 years, said he did not think a shakeup was imminent and that Trumps White House reflects his traditional approach to running his business. Hes always had a spokes-to-the-wheel management style, said Black. He wants people with differing views among the spokes. Bill Daley, a former White House chief of staff to President Barack Obama, who got pushed out in a shakeup himself after roughly a year into the job, said it appears that inside the Trump White House theres a struggle for the soul and brain of the president.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese state media on Saturday cheered the meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping as one that showed the world that confrontation between the two powers was not inevitable. The official China Daily newspaper said it was encouraging to see the two-day summit that ended on Friday going as well as it could after earlier confusing signals from Washington about how it was approaching the U.S.-China relationship. Trump had campaigned with strident anti-China rhetoric and had angered Beijing before taking office by talking to the president of Taiwan, the self-ruled island Beijing claims as its own. But the two sides avoided any diplomatic gaffes at Trumps Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida that would have tarnished the meeting in the eyes of the protocol-conscious Chinese. China Daily said both parties appeared equally enthusiastic about the constructive relationship they have promised to cultivate. This may sound surreal to those preoccupied with an inescapable conflict scenario between what they see as rising and incumbent powers, the newspaper wrote in an editorial.  But that Beijing and Washington have so far managed to do well in preventing conflicts shows confrontation is not inevitable. State-run Chinese tabloid Global Times said the meeting served as an indicator that the China-U.S. relationship is still very much on course since the Trump administration took office in January and it was likely the two nations would develop a more pragmatic relationship.  It seems that both countries have understood the importance of how essential a smooth transition needs to be and not just for the two countries involved here but really for the entire world over, it said. Their comments were echoed by a front-page commentary in the overseas edition of the ruling Communist Partys official Peoples Daily, which said the meeting established the tone for the development of U.S.-China relations.  In a tweet on Saturday, Trump wrote of the meeting: goodwill and friendship was formed, but only time will tell on trade. The Chinese commentaries, however, made no mention of the U.S. missile strike on a Syrian government air base, which overshadowed the summit. Wang Dong, associate professor of international studies at Chinas elite Peking University, said the move may have had the added bonus in Trumps eyes of sending North Korea a message over its nuclear program, but that China was unlikely to be fazed. There are great differences between the Syria situation and the Korean peninsula situation, Wang said, noting North Koreas conventional military capability to strike back at South Korea in the event of U.S. military action. Any use of force or pre-emptive strikes against North Korea will carry huge ramifications, which would probably lead to a drastically different outcome compared to Syria, Wang said. In the talks, Trump pressed Xi to do more to curb North Koreas nuclear program and the two agreed to a 100-day plan for trade talks aimed at boosting U.S. exports and reducing the gaping U.S. trade deficit with Beijing. U.S. industry had hoped Trump would deliver a strong message to Xi behind closed doors to end what they see as discriminatory trade policies, but not do anything rash to spark a trade war. In an outcome likely to play well in China, state news agency Xinhua said U.S. and Chinese officials initiated new dialogue mechanisms on economic issues, as well as security and diplomatic issues, in what appeared to be a reimagining of the annual Strategic and Economic Dialogue held under President Barack Obama. Some within U.S. industry had suggested those earlier talks yielded little substance, and urged the Trump administration to scrap them until Beijing displayed more initiative to address complaints about its industrial policies. We would like to see more results-oriented outcomes coming out of these new dialogues and fewer laundry lists, said Beijing-based Jacob Parker, vice president of China operations at the U.S.-China Business Council, although he added that he saw the meeting as generally positive on commercial issues.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When Donald Trump started thinking during his campaign for the presidency last year about filling a Supreme Court vacancy, he turned to a group of Washington insiders at the controls of a well-oiled machine that puts conservative judges on the bench. That disciplined network of operatives, shepherded by judicial activist Leonard Leo, on Friday delivered for Trump his first major accomplishment as U.S. president: the confirmation of conservative Neil Gorsuch as a Supreme Court justice.  Unlike the chaotic rollouts of other Trump policy initiatives, the Gorsuch nomination went relatively smoothly. Democrats put up a fight in the Senate, but they lacked the votes to block the Republican majority and they lost. Other key players included experienced Washington hands such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, former Senator Kelly Ayotte and White House Counsel Don McGahn.  It worked because it was all planned out before the nomination. We know what works, what doesnt work, what resources we need. We know the other sides arguments and how to answer them. Its like war, Leo told Reuters on Friday. The only surprise stumble in the effort came when Trump attacked judges who blocked his order banning U.S. entry by people from certain Muslim-majority countries. Gorsuch distanced himself from the presidents Twitter messages. Other than that, discipline was maintained from the first of five meetings that Leo, a veteran of Bush-era judicial confirmation battles, attended with Trump. The two met twice before the election.  Leo helped compile a list of potential nominees for Trump. That helped win over conservative activists unsure of Trumps ideological compass at a time when he was still fighting for the Republican presidential nomination. A second, longer list came in September. It included Gorsuch, a federal judge. The campaign for Gorsuchs confirmation would not have happened without McConnell, who stopped former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, from filling the high court vacancy created when conservative icon Antonin Scalia died in February 2016. After Trump won the election, he named McGahn, a Washington-based campaign finance lawyer at Jones Day, as White House counsel. Known by his colleagues as The Quiet Man, McGahn managed the nomination from inside the administration. Leo, who reported to McGahn, pushed back against Democrats claims that Trump basically out-sourced the nomination process to outside groups. Leo said McGahn carefully scrutinized the lists of nominees and was not simply a rubber stamp. The Gorsuch campaign got heavy marketing and promotion backing from the Judicial Crisis Network (JCN), a coordinating body for conservative and grassroots groups. It launched $10 million in pro-Gorsuch advertising, targeting in particular Senate Democrats facing re-election contests in 2018.  The JCN was born during the administration of former President George W. Bush, when Republicans realized a strong outside campaign was critical to getting conservatives on the court.  Carrie Severino, the groups chief counsel, said the fact Trump agreed to stick to the nominees list made her job easier. We were prepared for several possibilities, and we had ads, websites, research packets, and much more ready to launch the moment a name was confirmed, she said. Leo said conservatives have borrowed techniques from the liberal coalitions that worked to defeat the nomination of Robert Bork by Republican then-President Ronald Reagan in 1987. The JCN also tapped social media and communications professionals. Washington public relations heavyweight Ron Bonjean played a role, reporting to White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer.  At the White House, McGahn and a team in his office held murder boards where Gorsuch was bombarded with questions senators might ask. Legislative Affairs Director Marc Short and his team organized visits with senators and worked with Ayotte. Asked to accompany Gorsuch around Capitol Hill, Ayotte accepted, she said in an interview. Ayotte had lost her re-election bid in November and had criticized Trump. But she helped arrange meetings for Gorsuch with almost 80 senators. In the end, said sources close to the Gorsuch effort, it worked because it was highly regimented. Leo said the machine that got Gorsuch on the bench is here to stay although he will return to his job as executive vice president of the Federalist Society, a conservative lawyers group. Leo hopes Trump will tap that machine for a possible second nomination during his presidency. Supreme Court confirmations have become full-blown political campaigns, he said.

The warships USS Porter and USS Ross in the Mediterranean Sea launched dozens of Tomahawk missiles at the Shayrat air base, which the Pentagon says was involved in a chemical weapons attack this week. (Graphic locator map on attack - tmsnrt.rs/2nm68H0)  It was Trumps biggest foreign policy decision since taking office in January and the kind of direct intervention in Syrias six-year-old civil war his predecessor Barack Obama avoided. The strikes were in reaction to what Washington says was a poison gas attack by the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad that killed at least 70 people in rebel-held territory. Syria denies it carried out the attack. They catapulted Washington into confrontation with Russia, which has advisers on the ground aiding its close ally Assad. We strongly condemn the illegitimate actions by the U.S. The consequences of this for regional and international stability could be extremely serious, Russias deputy U.N. envoy, Vladimir Safronkov, told a meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Friday. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev charged that the U.S. strikes were one step away from clashing with Russias military. U.S. officials informed Russian forces ahead of the missile strikes and avoided hitting Russian personnel. (Graphic explaining kind of missile used in attack - tmsnrt.rs/2nkJYWa)           Satellite imagery suggests the base houses Russian special forces and helicopters, part of the Kremlins effort to help Assad fight Islamic State and other militant groups.  Trump has frequently urged improved relations with Russia, strained under Obama over Syria, Ukraine and other issues, was hosting Chinese President Xi Jinping at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on Thursday night when the attack occurred.     Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, in Florida with Trump, said on Friday the United States would announce additional sanctions on Syria in the near future but offered no specifics. Russias Defense Ministry responded to the attack by calling in the U.S. military attache in Moscow to say that at midnight Moscow time (5 p.m. EDT) it would close down a communications line used to avoid accidental clashes between Russian and U.S. forces in Syria, Interfax new agency said. U.S. warplanes frequently attack Islamic State militants in Syria and come close to Russian forces. U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said on Friday the Trump administration was ready to take further steps if needed. We are prepared to do more, but we hope that will not be necessary, she told the U.N. Security Council. The United States will not stand by when chemical weapons are used. It is in our vital national security interest to prevent the spread and use of chemical weapons. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who also was in Florida with Trump and is scheduled to go to Moscow next week, said he was disappointed but not surprised by the Russian reaction because it showed continued support for Assad. Iran, which supports Assad and has been criticized by Trump, condemned the strike, with President Hassan Rouhani saying it would bring only destruction and danger to the region and the globe. U.S. officials called the intervention a one-off intended to deter future chemical weapons attacks and not an expansion of the U.S. role in the Syrian war.  U.S. allies from Asia, Europe and the Middle East expressed support for the attack, if sometimes cautiously. The action is likely to be interpreted as a signal to Russia, and countries such as North Korea, China and Iran where Trump has faced foreign policy tests early in his presidency, of his willingness to use force. The United States is now likely to be more aggressive in pursuing intelligence about Syrias suspected chemical weapons program. The Pentagon has also signaled interest in determining any Russian complicity. At a minimum, the Russians failed to rein in the Syrian regime activity, a senior U.S. military official told reporters, speaking on condition of anonymity. The official also said the United States had been unable to determine if a Russian or Syrian aircraft bombed a hospital that was treating victims of the chemical attack. Russia joined the war on Assads behalf in 2015, turning the momentum in his favor. Although Moscow supports opposing sides in the war between Assad and rebels, the United States and Russia say they share a single main enemy, Islamic State. Tillerson said the strike took out about 20 percent of the seventh wing of the Syrian air force and hit a fueling facility. The bases runway was still in use. Assads office said Syria would strike its enemies harder. Damascus and Moscow denied Syrian forces were behind the gas attack but Western countries dismissed their explanation that chemicals leaked from a rebel weapons depot after an air strike. The Syrian army said the U.S. attack killed six people and called it blatant aggression that made the United States a partner of terrorist groups including Islamic State. There was no independent confirmation of civilian casualties. U.S. lawmakers from both parties on Friday backed Trumps action but demanded he spell out a broader strategy for dealing with the conflict and consult with Congress on any further action. The U.N. Security Council had been negotiating a resolution, proposed by the United States, France and Britain on Tuesday, to condemn the gas attack and push the Syrian government to cooperate with international investigators. Russia said the text was unacceptable and diplomats said it was unlikely to be put to a vote. Russia expects Tillerson to explain Washingtons stance when he visits Moscow next week, Interfax news agency cited a Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman as saying. Washington has long backed rebels fighting Assad in a multi-sided civil war that has killed more than 400,000 people and driven half of Syrians from their homes since 2011. The United States has conducted air strikes against Islamic State, which controls territory in eastern and northern Syria, and a small number of U.S. troops are helping rebel militias. Asked whether the strikes set back any efforts to work with Russia to defeat Islamic State, sometimes known as ISIS, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said: There can be a shared commitment to defeat ISIS and also agree that you cant gas your own people. Tuesday's attack was the first time since 2013 that Syria was accused of using sarin, a banned nerve agent it was meant to have given up under a Russian-brokered, U.N.-enforced deal that persuaded Obama to call off air strikes four years ago. (Chart of cumulated reported deaths from chemical gases in Syria - tmsnrt.rs/2o5Xbz6)  Video depicted limp bodies and children choking while rescuers tried to wash off the poison gas. Russian state television blamed rebels and did not show footage of victims.                     The U.S. strikes cheered Assads enemies, after months when Western powers appeared to grow increasingly resigned to his staying in power. But opposition figures said an isolated assault was far from the decisive intervention they seek. Neither the Trump administration nor its predecessor has laid out a policy aimed at ending the Syrian conflict. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"
"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""PALM BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - President Donald Trump pressed Chinese President Xi Jinping to do more to curb North Koreas nuclear program and help reduce the gaping U.S. trade deficit with Beijing in talks on Friday, even as he toned down the strident anti-China rhetoric of his election campaign. Trump spoke publicly of progress on a range of issues in his first U.S.-China summit  as did several of his top aides  but they provided few concrete specifics other than Chinas agreement to work together to narrow disagreements and find common ground for cooperation. As the two leaders wrapped up a Florida summit overshadowed by U.S. missile strikes in Syria overnight, Xi joined Trump in stressing the positive mood of the meetings while papering over deep differences that have caused friction between the worlds two biggest economies. Trumps aides insisted he had made good on his pledge to raise concerns about Chinas trade practices and said there was some headway, with Xi agreeing to a 100-day plan for trade talks aimed at boosting U.S. exports and reducing Chinas trade surplus with the United States. Speaking after the two-day summit at Trumps Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also said that Xi had agreed to increased cooperation in reining in North Koreas missile and nuclear programs  though he did not offer any new formula for cracking Pyongyangs defiant attitude.  Trump had promised during the campaign to stop what he called the theft of American jobs by China. Many blue-collar workers helped propel him to his unexpected election victory on Nov. 8 and Trump is under pressure to deliver for them. The Republican president tweeted last week that the United States could no longer tolerate massive trade deficits and job losses and that his meeting with Xi will be a very difficult one.  On Friday, the unpredictable Trump not only set a different tone but also avoided any public lapses in protocol that Chinese officials had feared could embarrass their leader. We have made tremendous progress in our relationship with China, Trump told reporters as the two delegations met around tables flanked by large U.S. and Chinese flags. We will be making additional progress. The relationship developed by President Xi and myself I think is outstanding. And I believe lots of very potentially bad problems will be going away, he added, without providing details. Xi also spoke in mostly positive terms. We have engaged in deeper understanding, and have built a trust, he said. I believe we will keep developing in a stable way to form friendly relations ... For the peace and stability of the world, we will also fulfill our historical responsibility. Well, I agree with you 100 percent, Trump replied. Chinas official Xinhua news agency said Xi had encouraged the United States to take part in the One Belt, One Road plan, Xis signature foreign policy imitative aimed at infrastructure development across Asia, Africa and Europe, seen in some policy circles as a partial answer to the pivot to Asia strategy of Trumps predecessor Barack Obama. Xi also hailed military to military exchanges and said China and the United States should make good use of the dialogue mechanism to be established between the two countries joint staffs of the armed forces, although Xinhua did not give further details. Chinese state media on Saturday cheered the meeting as one that showed the world that confrontation between the two powers was not inevitable and established the tone for the development of U.S.-China relations. But in a sign that rough spots remained, Tillerson afterwards described the discussions as very frank and candid. President Trump and President Xi agreed to work in concert to expand areas of cooperation while managing differences based on mutual respect, he said. After the meeting, Trump took Xi on a walk around the manicured grounds of his lavish Spanish-style complex. Trump could be seen chatting and gesturing to Xi, who did the same. Tillerson said Trump had accepted Xis invitation to visit China and that they also agreed to upgrade a U.S.-China dialogue by putting the two presidents at the head of the forum. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the Chinese had expressed an interest in reducing Chinas trade surplus as a way of controlling their own inflation. Thats the first time Ive heard them say that in a bilateral context, he said. Ross declined to say whether the United States was ready to designate China a currency manipulator, however, referring to an upcoming report in which that issue would be addressed. Although Trump during the presidential election campaign had pledged to label China a currency manipulator on the first day of his administration, he has refrained from doing so.  The highly anticipated U.S.-China summit was upstaged by U.S. missile strikes overnight against a Syrian air base from which Trump said a deadly chemical weapon attack had been launched earlier in the week. It was the first direct U.S. assault on the Russian-backed government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in six years of civil war.  The swift action in Syria could be interpreted as a signal especially to defiant nuclear-armed North Korea  and by extension, its ally China  as well as other countries like Iran and Russia of Trumps willingness to use military force. North Korea is developing missiles capable of hitting the United States. Tillerson said Xi agreed with Trump that North Koreas nuclear advances had reached a very serious stage. He said Trump also raised U.S.concerns about Chinas activities in the South China Sea. Beijing is building and fortifying islands in pursuit of expansive territorial claims in the strategic waterway.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON/PALM BEACH (Reuters) - In a secure room at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, President Donald Trumps top military advisers presented him with three options for punishing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for a poison gas attack that killed dozens of civilians.     It was Thursday afternoon, just hours before 59 U.S. cruise missiles would rain down on a Syrian military airfield in response to what Trump had called a disgrace to humanity.  Trump was at his Florida estate for his first summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping. But that summit took a backseat to the top-secret briefing by U.S. National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, and Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, an official familiar with the briefing told Reuters. McMaster and Mattis presented Trump with three options, which were quickly narrowed to two: bomb multiple airfields or just the Shayrat airfield near the city of Homs, where the military jet carrying the poison gas had taken off, the official said. At least 70 people, including 20 children, were killed in the gas attack in northern Syria. Russia, which has military forces in Syria aiding Assads government, says the deaths were caused by a gas leak from a depot where rebel groups stored chemical weapons, a charge the rebels deny and U.S. intelligence officials say is false. After listening to an argument that it was best to minimize both Russian and Arab casualties, the official said, Trump chose the minimum option and ordered the launch of a barrage of cruise missiles against the Shayrat air field.  Mattis and McMaster argued that choosing that target would draw the clearest line between Assads use of nerve gas and the retaliatory strike, the official said. In addition, the living quarters occupied by Russian advisers, Syrian airmen and some civilian workers were on the periphery of the airfield, which meant it could be destroyed without risking hundreds of casualties  especially if the attack occurred outside the bases normal working hours. Another official privy to the discussions said the administration has contingency plans for possible additional strikes as early as Friday night, depending on how Assad responds to the first attack. Whether this is over is up to President Assad, said this official. We have additional options ready to go. Confronting his first foreign policy crisis, Trump relied largely on seasoned military officers  Mattis, a former Marine  general, and McMaster, a U.S. Army lieutenant general  rather than the political operatives who had dominated his policy decisions in the first weeks of his presidency, said three officials involved in the deliberations. After news of the gas attack first surfaced on Tuesday, Trump immediately requested a list of options to punish Assad, according to two senior officials who took part in those meetings. The officials all spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations and intelligence matters. Senior administration officials said they met with Trump as early as Tuesday evening and presented options including sanctions, diplomatic pressure and plans for a variety of military strikes on Syria, all of them drawn up well before he took office. The most aggressive option on the shelf, one of the officials said, called for a decapitation strike on Assads presidential palace, which sits alone on a hill west of downtown Damascus. He had a lot of questions and said he wanted to think about it but he also had some points he wanted to make. He wanted the options refined, one official said.  On Wednesday morning, intelligence officials and Trumps military advisers said they were certain which Syrian air base was used to launch the chemical attack and that they had tracked the Sukhoi-22 jet that carried it out.  Trump told them to focus on the military plans. It was a matter of dusting those off and adapting them for the current target set and timing, said another official. On Wednesday afternoon, Trump appeared in the White House Rose Garden and said the unspeakable attack against even beautiful little babies had changed his attitude toward Assad. Asked then whether he was formulating a new policy on Syria, Trump replied: Youll see. At about 3:45 p.m on Thursday afternoon, General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff called an unscheduled meeting of the service chiefs at the Pentagon to finalize the plan for the military strikes. Shortly after 4 p.m., Trump signed off on the missile attacks, according to the White House.  Two U.S. warships  the USS Ross and the USS Porter  fired 59 cruise missiles from the eastern Mediterranean Sea at the targeted air base. They began landing at around 8:40 p.m. ET (00:40 GMT), just as the two presidents were finishing their meals. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An attempt by U.S. authorities to identify an anonymous critic of President Donald Trump on Twitter has set off alarm bells among Democratic and Republican lawmakers and civil liberties advocates fearful of a crackdown on dissent.  Twitter Inc on Friday succeeded in beating back a demand for records about a Twitter account called ALT Immigration (@ALT_uscis), which pokes fun at Trumps immigration policies and appears to be run by one or more federal employees. The U.S. government withdrew an administrative summons that customs agents had sent the company in March demanding the records. But the government backed away only after Twitter filed a federal lawsuit accusing it of violating the First Amendments protection of free speech. Customs agents could still continue the investigation using some other methods, civil liberties attorneys said. Although authorities retreated, the case has laid bare the broad power of the U.S. government to demand information from technology companies, sometimes with no oversight from the courts and often with built-in secrecy provisions that prevent the public from knowing what the government is seeking.     The summons that Twitter received came from agents who investigate corruption and misconduct within U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Even after it was withdrawn, some lawmakers had questions about the agencys actions. CBP must ensure that any properly authorized investigation does not disregard the rights to free speech enshrined in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, two Republican U.S. senators, Cory Gardner of Colorado and Mike Lee of Utah, wrote in a letter on Friday to Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly.  The senators asked whether the agency would ever ask a private company to divulge private records about a customer based solely on non-criminal speech. Senate Democrat Ron Wyden of Oregon called for an investigation of whether customs agents had violated a law by retaliating against an internal critic.  The Department of Homeland Security plans to respond directly to the senators, an official said on Friday. There are two primary ways the U.S. government can obtain information from internet companies without a judges approval using a law known as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, according to experts in privacy law. Agencies with enforcement power, such as the Internal Revenue Service, can issue administrative subpoenas demanding user records. Prosecutors can also ask grand juries investigating a crime to issue a subpoena.  An aggressive agency, for example, might demand information about a Twitter account that used an agency logo on the grounds that it is deceptive, said Georgetown University law professor Paul Ohm. Similarly, a prosecutor could ask a grand jury to issue a subpoena based on the idea that a federal employee, suspected of criticizing the administration anonymously, was misusing government resources. It doesnt take a brilliant legal mind to think of hypotheticals, Ohm said. Further, such subpoenas are usually kept secret, making them more difficult to challenge. Some other government tools, such as a national security letter, are intended to be used for narrow purposes related to counter-terrorism investigations. But they do not require judicial approval either, instead relying on internal safeguards. Challenging such demands is difficult and often requires deep pockets, attorneys familiar with such orders said. Its important to keep in mind how formidable the governments range of investigatory powers is, said Andrew Crocker, a staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which advocates for digital rights. In the case of ALT Immigration, Twitter said it was not bound to keep the summons a secret, and the company informed the account holder of the government demand. That person then found legal representation with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).  Esha Bhandari, the ACLU staff attorney representing the dissident, said she thinks the speed with which the government withdrew its summons - less than a day after Twitter sued - means the customs agents will cease investigating, but she cannot be sure. Its impossible to predict, of course, but Im hopeful that this really is a recognition that people have the ability to speak online including in ways that are critical of the government, Bhandari said. The Department of Homeland Security has not said what its plans are for the investigation.  After Trumps inauguration in January, anonymous Twitter feeds that borrowed the names and logos of more than a dozen U.S. government agencies appeared to challenge the presidents views on climate change and other issues. They called themselves alt accounts. Twitter has declined to say if it has received any other government demands to reveal such anti-Trump critics.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani called on the world \""to reject such policies, which bring only destruction and danger to the region and the globe\"". (Graphic locator map on attack - tmsnrt.rs/2nm68H0)  Iraq criticized hasty interventions in an apparent comment on the U.S. action. But a wide range of U.S. allies from Asia, Europe and the Middle East expressed support, if sometimes cautiously, in similar terms. The U.K. government fully supports the U.S. action, which we believe was an appropriate response to the barbaric chemical weapons attack launched by the Syrian regime and is intended to deter further attacks, a British government spokesman said. Japans Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters: Many innocent people became victims from the chemical attacks. Japan supports the U.S. governments determination to prevent the spread and use of chemical weapons, he said. Turkey viewed the strikes positively and the international community should sustain its stance against the barbarity of the Syrian government, Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus said. In an interview with Turkish broadcaster Fox TV, Kurtulmus said Assads government must be punished in the international arena and the peace process in Syria needed to be accelerated. French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said Russia and Iran needed to understand that supporting Assad made no sense and that the escalation of the U.S. military role in Syria was a warning to a criminal regime. Use of chemical weapons is appalling and should be punished because it is a war crime, Ayrault told Reuters and France Info radio. French President Francois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel issued statements saying Assad was solely to blame for the air strikes. The Dutch government said: The United States has given a clear signal that the use of poison gas crosses a line. It also labeled the strikes a proportionate response. U.S. strikes show needed resolve against barbaric chemical attacks. EU will work with the US to end brutality in Syria, the chairman of the council of EU leaders, Donald Tusk, said on Twitter. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the strikes sent a vitallyimportant message that the world would nottolerate the use of chemicalweapons. The retribution has been proportionate and it has been swift, he told reporters in Sydney. We support the United States in thatswift action. Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which back rebels fighting Assad, said they supported the U.S. strikes and held only the Syrian government responsible for the attacks. Other Gulf countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Kuwait, also expressed support for the attacks.  Some countries expressed reservations about the U.S. decision to launch strikes without authorization from the U.N. Security Council. Indonesia, home to the worlds largest Muslim population, condemned the use of chemical weapons in Syria. At the same time, Indonesia is concerned with unilateral actions by any parties, including the use of Tomahawk missiles, in responding to the chemical weapon attack tragedy in Syria, Foreign Ministry spokesman Armanatha Nasir said in a text message. Military actions, undertaken without prior authorization of the U.N. Security Council, are not in line with international legal principles in the peaceful settlement of disputes, as stipulated in the U.N. Charter.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Internal State Department instructions to implement President Donald Trumps temporary travel ban on citizens of six Muslim-majority nations help demonstrate that the ban violates the constitution, the American Civil Liberties Union argued in court filings late on Thursday. The ACLU made the argument as part of its lawsuit in federal court in the Northern District of California on behalf of three student visa holders against Trumps March 6 executive order barring travelers from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the United States for 90 days and refugees for four months. The lawsuit, which seeks class-action status, says the order discriminates against Muslims. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson issued instructions to implement Trumps order in a series of four cables to consular officers worldwide last month, which were first revealed by Reuters. The ACLU pointed to language from one of the cables that directs consular officers to assess whether applicants from the six countries found otherwise eligible for U.S. visas could still be denied visas based on Trumps order. The ACLU said the guidance amounts to an unconstitutional amendment of existing law. Tillerson issued the cable on March 10, and followed it with another set of instructions on March 15, the day before the ban was supposed to go into effect. After federal courts blocked the central tenets of Trumps order, Tillerson issued two other cables that rescinded many of his previous instructions but left some tighter visa vetting procedures in place. A State Department official declined to comment on the litigation or the cables. The Department of Justice also declined to comment. The Trump administration has said that the travel ban and increased screening of foreigners are crucial to protecting the United States from terrorist attacks. The government is arguing in court that the president has broad authority under the law to make immigration decisions when there are concerns about national security. The March executive order replaced a more sweeping travel ban that Trump signed on Jan. 27, which sparked chaos and protests at airports and was challenged by more than two dozen lawsuits. The original ban had covered citizens of Iraq, as well as the six countries also included in the revised ban. Iraq was dropped from the revised order, as was an indefinite ban on all refugees from Syria. The revised ban aimed to overcome legal hurdles by excluding legal permanent residents and allowing for waivers for people with ties to the United States. The ACLU, in its claims that the order discriminates against Muslims, points to calls by Trump on the campaign trail for a Muslim ban and to a speech he made last month calling the new ban a watered-down version of the first.

A Montgomery County State Court judge was still hearing arguments on Friday evening over the governors motion to halt impeachment proceedings in the Alabama House of Representatives. The House Judiciary Committee is scheduled to begin the process on Monday. Bentley, who is accused of using state resources for personal use, has denied any wrongdoing and has refused to step down, as demanded by top political leaders. Bentleys troubles began last year when recordings surfaced of him making suggestive remarks to a former senior adviser, Rebekah Mason, before his wife of 50 years filed for divorce in August 2015. Bentley has denied having a physical affair with Mason, who is married. She resigned as questions about the pairs relationship began to dominate Alabama politics. On Wednesday, the Alabama Ethics Commission found that Bentley probably violated ethics and campaign finance laws.     The Judiciary Committees report on Friday accused Bentley of ordering state law enforcement officers to track down copies of an embarrassing recording that suggested an affair with the Mason. It also accused him of retaliating against an official who discovered the relationship. The committee plans to begin its impeachment process on Monday. The panels process would lead to a recommendation to the full House on whether to impeach.    Bentley remained defiant at news conference on Friday. Once again, let me say, I do not plan to resign, he told reporters without taking questions. I have done nothing illegal. If the people want to know if I misused state resources, the answer is simply no, I have not.  The Ethics Commission on Wednesday said it found that Bentley had accepted a contribution and made a loan to his campaign outside the legal time frame, and that he used campaign funds to pay the legal fees of Mason, local media reported.  The commission has declined to disclose the evidence of its finding because it was referring it to the Montgomery district attorneys office, which could bring criminal charges against the governor.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""NEW YORK/FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (Reuters) - For many supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump, his decision to bomb a Syrian airfield in retaliation for a poison gas attack was a decisive show of strength and resolve - just what they voted for in November. In interviews with more than a dozen Trump voters, many acknowledged that getting the U.S. military directly involved in the Syrian conflict was a far cry from the America First isolationism the Republican candidate espoused during the campaign. Unlike several prominent far-right backers who denounced Thursdays air strikes in Syria , most of the Trump voters interviewed in Texas, Florida and New York on Friday said the attack was not an abdication of his commitment to put U.S. interests above all others. Love it, love it, love it, love it. He said from Day One that hes not going to take any nonsense, Anthony Calvanese, 28, a construction foreman, told a reporter on a sidewalk in New York Citys Staten Island borough. He needs to start showing our superiority in the world. Trumps order came despite his vow in the 2016 campaign to avoid entanglements in Middle East conflicts. Four years ago, he also admonished his predecessor, Democrat Barack Obama, to refrain from retaliating after the Syrian government launched a poison gas attack on its own citizens. The apparent ideological inconsistencies angered some of Trumps staunchest supporters on the far right. Paul Joseph Watson, a London-based editor at Infowars, a U.S. media outlet praised by Trump that promotes unsubstantiated conspiracy theories, declared on Twitter he was OFF the Trump train. Self-described white nationalist leader Richard Spencer called Trumps decision a betrayal and the end of America First.     By contrast, several Trump voters said they still trusted the president to deliver on his promises. Todd Recknagel, a 53-year-old managing partner of a private equity firm in Panama City Beach, Florida, said the move reinforced his support for Trump because it showed the president is willing to adjust his thinking based on events. I appreciate the fact that hes not so inwardly focused that hes willing to stand up for principle on something like Syria, he said in a phone interview.  (Ronald) Reagan wouldnt allow that stuff either, he said, referring to the 1980s president revered by Republicans. Some Trump backers said he had no choice but to act given the horror of Tuesdays poison gas attack.  If we allowed this to go by, we would be as bad as those who stood by and did nothing as Hitler marched across Europe in World War 2, Tom Harney, 64, a yacht broker from Lauderhill, Florida, said outside a diner in Fort Lauderdale. That sentiment was echoed by Joseph Mure Jr., a lawyer who practices in Brooklyn. They murdered innocents: women, babies, children, he told a reporter after exiting a Staten Island courthouse. How many bombs did we drop on Syria? I wish wed dropped twice that amount. U.S. warships in the Mediterranean Sea launched dozens of Tomahawk missiles at the airfield. Others said Trump, who cultivated a tough image during the campaign and promised to strengthen the American military, was demonstrating that the United States remains the worlds leader. Were no longer leading from behind, said Art Tillberg, 67, of Coral Springs, Florida, referring to a phrase Republicans used to criticize Obamas 2011 efforts to oust Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. Still, not all Trump voters agreed with the missile strike, echoing objections from some on the far right that it ran counter to his campaign promises. Anthony Sage, a 42-year-old retired Army staff sergeant, said the attack undermined Trumps America First message. The strike is a waste of American time and money, Sage, who said he served tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan, said on Friday outside the Fort Hood Army base in Killeen, Texas. We should be taking care of people here in America first. Abdi Mohamed, a 23-year-old Somali immigrant from St. Paul, Minnesota, who voted for Trump in November, said the move showed the president was abandoning his outsider instincts in favor of following the advice of the political establishment. He was against military action in Syria, but now it seems more and more he is becoming a bit of a cog in the system, Mohamed said in a phone interview. A few Trump voters found themselves torn: wary of the decision to embroil the United States in Syrias six-year civil war but unwilling to abandon the president they elected. Im kind of on the fence, said Melanie Groves, 39, a small business owner in Louisville, Illinois, who organized a pro-Trump rally last month.  Best-case scenario, this would be a strong message that this red line has been crossed, she said in a phone interview. Worst-case scenario, there are a lot of conspiracy theorists that think we are headed towards World War 3. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Trump says Pyongyang is a problem that will be taken care of amid speculation that North Korea is on the verge of a sixth nuclear test. Military force cannot resolve tension over North Korea, China warns, while an influential Chinese newspaper urges Pyongyang to halt its nuclear program in exchange for Beijings protection. The Trump administration is focusing its North Korea strategy on tougher economic sanctions, possibly including intercepting cargo ships and punishing Chinese banks doing business with Pyongyang, U.S. officials say. Trump says things will work out fine between the United States and Russia, a day after declaring U.S.-Russian relations may be at an all-time low. Trump signals he could be moving closer to the mainstream on monetary policy, saying he has not ruled out reappointment of Janet Yellen as Federal Reserve chair as he considers his choices for the U.S. central bank. [nL1N1HL14B] Trump signs a resolution that will allow U.S. states to restrict how federal funds for contraception and reproductive health are spent, a move cheered by anti-abortion campaigners. Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen presses Deutsche Bank to release information about issues including Trumps debt and any bank meetings with Trump administration officials, saying he has great concern about possible conflicts of interest.

(Reuters) - Syrian-Americans on Friday hailed the U.S. missile attack on a Syrian air base as a blow for human rights, but said they were wary of both President Donald Trumps motives and what comes next. Many who had been angered by Trumps efforts to ban Syrians, along with visitors from several other Muslim-majority nations, welcomed what they saw as his new role as the avenger of civilians killed in this weeks chemical weapons attack. We needed to take some action, show some backbone, said Judy Asghar, 35, an American born to Syrian immigrants who lives in Dearborn, Michigan, epicenter of one of the largest Arab-American communities in the United States.   Some called Thursday nights military action overdue, voicing disappointment with then-President Barack Obamas refusal to attack the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad following a 2013 chemical weapons attack. I was very glad that it finally happened, something that should have happened years ago, Ali Homsi, 59, a civil engineer who moved to the United States from Syria as a student in 1978, said in a telephone interview. Homsi lives in Tempe, Arizona, but still has family in Syria. Many highlighted the human rights abuses that have characterized the six-year civil war and what they see as the impunity of Assads government and pro-Assad forces. No ones been enforcing that up until yesterday, Shireen Jasser, a Houston social worker whose father immigrated to the United States from Syria, said by phone. Were just thankful to President Trump for making this swift decision, said Jasser, president of her citys chapter of the Syrian American Council. The Washington-based group advocates a free, democratic, and pluralistic Syria through American support.  U.S. officials said the air base targeted on Thursday was the launching point for Tuesdays poison gas attack, which killed at least 70 people, many of them children. Some Syrian-Americans and Syrians in the United States said Trumps response to the chemical attack transformed him in their eyes. A lot of Syrian-Americans are now cheering the president, are elated, said Dr. Mohammad Kabbesh, 45, a physician who grew up in Damascus but now lives in Sacramento, California, said by phone. Syrian refugee Motaz al Afandi, 49, of Texas said that if Trump pursues aggressive action toward Assad, he could end up solving the refugee problem.  If we get rid of Al-Assad, we wont need to be refugees anymore, said al Afandi, who runs a tow truck business in the Dallas area and sought asylum in the United States with his wife and three children after fleeing his countrys conflict. Still, some who cheered the military action said the travel ban first launched in January had left them with mixed feelings about Trump, and they reserved judgment as they awaited his next steps. Were partway there, said Youmun Alhlou, 23, of San Jose, California, who works as a legal specialist at Google and whose parents immigrated to the United States from Syria. Others questioned whether the White House was using the humanitarian crisis as an excuse for more overseas wars. Its part of the plan to invade more countries for various reasons, whether its oil or power, said Amir Alshakarna, 31, of Southfield, Michigan, who became an American citizen last year and works for his familys construction company. The Trump who did the travel ban, thats the real Trump. Asghar of Dearborn said Trump could be using military might to distract from the stumbles seen during his first months in office. Those include the failure to persuade Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare, legal challenges to Trumps travel ban and continuing investigations into alleged Russian meddling in the election, which Russia has denied, and into potential Trump associates ties to Russia. If this is all we do, it will mean very little except good politics for Trump, Asghar said.  Americans seem to love presidents who bomb people.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on Friday it is suspending enforcement of the costliest requirements of its conflict minerals rule, after a court remanded it back to the regulator because part of it violates the U.S. Constitution. Acting SEC Chairman Mike Piwowar, a Republican, said he has asked staff for a recommendation on how to proceed with the rule, which requires companies to disclose if their products contain certain minerals from a war-torn part of Africa. For now, he added, companies will not be required to conduct a due diligence review or an audit, which are both part of the process used to determine the origin of the minerals. Until these issues are resolved, it is difficult to conceive of a circumstance that would counsel in favor of enforcing the due diligence requirements, he said in a statement. The move sparked backlash from SEC Democratic Commissioner Kara Stein, who accused Piwowar of acting beyond his authority to gut the meat of a rule mandated by Congress, adopted by the SEC and reviewed by the courts. It is unprecedented for one commissioner, acting alone and without official notice and comment, to engage in de facto rulemaking, she said. It represents a troubling attack not only on the Commission process, but also on the restraints of government power. The conflict minerals rule was required by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law and is supported by human rights groups that want companies to tell investors if their products contain tantalum, tin, gold or tungsten mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo, in the hope that such disclosures will curb funding to armed groups. Business groups have contended that it forces companies to furnish politically charged information that is irrelevant to making investment decisions and that it costs too much for companies to trace the source of minerals through the supply chain. In 2014, a U.S. appeals court struck down part of the conflict minerals law after the Business Roundtable, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers sued the SEC over it. The court found part of it violated free speech rights of companies by forcing them to publicly state that their products were not conflict free. The rest of the rule was left intact.  Since then, companies have furnished reports with SEC and conducted due diligence, though they were granted a reprieve from the audit requirement and the labeling of the minerals themselves.  The litigation formally came to an end on Monday, when the lower court remanded the rule back to the SEC to address the First Amendment concerns. The appeals court did not say whether the Dodd-Frank law itself or the SECs implementation of the rule violated the Constitution, a matter that the SEC will now need to determine.   Companies will still need to file required forms with the SEC and do origin inquiries, as they have been doing. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"
"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican-led Senate on Friday gave Donald Trump the biggest triumph of his young presidency, confirming his Supreme Court nominee over stout Democratic opposition and restoring a conservative majority on the highest U.S. judicial body. The Senate, which last year refused to consider Democratic former President Barack Obamas nominee to the court, voted 54-45 to approve Republican Trumps pick, Colorado-based federal appeals court judge Neil Gorsuch, to the lifetime job. Three Democrats joined the Republicans in voting for Gorsuch. Gorsuchs confirmation ends the longest Supreme Court vacancy since 1862 during the American Civil War, with the court down a justice for almost 14 months since long-serving conservative Justice Antonin Scalia died on Feb. 13, 2016. Judge Gorsuchs confirmation process was one of the most transparent and accessible in history, and his judicial temperament, exceptional intellect, unparalleled integrity and record of independence makes him the perfect choice to serve on the nations highest court, Trump said in a statement. Hes going to make an incredible addition to the court, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the Senate floor. Illustrating the importance of the moment, Vice President Mike Pence served as the Senates presiding officer during the vote to confirm Gorsuch, who also worked in Republican former President George W. Bushs Justice Department and is the son of the first woman to head the Environmental Protection Agency. Republicans, possessing a 52-48 Senate majority, on Thursday overcame a ferocious Democratic effort to block a confirmation vote, resorting to a rule change known as the nuclear option. Today, for the first time in history, the theft of a Supreme Court seat has been completed, profoundly damaging the integrity of the court, said Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley, referring to Republicans casting aside Obamas nominee Merrick Garland, who would have tilted the court to the left for the first time in decades. Merkley this week delivered a 15-1/2-hour Senate speech against Gorsuch. The Senates approval of Gorsuch reinstates the nine-seat courts 5-4 conservative majority, fulfilling an important Trump campaign promise. Gorsuch, 49, was the youngest Supreme Court nominee since Republican President George H.W. Bush in 1991 picked Clarence Thomas, who was 43 at the time. Gorsuch could be expected to serve for decades, while Trump could make further appointments to the high court to make it even more solidly conservative because three of the eight justices are 78 or older. Three Democratic senators up for re-election in 2018 in states won by Trump last year - Indianas Joe Donnelly, West Virginias Joe Manchin and North Dakotas Heidi Heitkamp - voted for Gorsuch. Republican Senator Johnny Isakson missed the vote while recovering from back surgery. Gorsuchs confirmation gave a boost to Trump, showing he can get important agenda items through a Congress controlled by his fellow Republicans after the House of Representatives last month failed to pass healthcare overhaul legislation. Trump is planning major tax cut legislation as well. Senate Republicans resorted to extraordinary steps to overcome Democratic opposition to Gorsuch, including changing long-standing Senate rules to prohibit the use of a procedural blockade called a filibuster for Supreme Court nominees. The rule change was dubbed the nuclear option because it was considered an extreme break from Senate tradition. Democrats accused Gorsuch of being so conservative as to be outside the judicial mainstream, favoring corporate interests over ordinary Americans in legal opinions, and displaying insufficient independence from Trump. Gorsuch joins fellow conservatives Thomas, John Roberts, Samuel Alito and Anthony Kennedy on a court that also includes liberal justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Trump has recorded accomplishments since taking office on Jan. 20, including a variety of unilateral executive actions such as moving to undo Obamas climate change regulations. But he has encountered trouble with other major initiatives. Courts blocked his executive action to stop people from several Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. His administration also has faced questions about any role the presidents associates may have played in alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election to help Trump. The rule change could make it easier for Trump to win confirmation of Supreme Court nominees as long as Republicans control the Senate, with Democrats left powerless to resist even if he gets a chance to replace the courts senior liberal, 84-year-old Ginsburg, or the courts swing vote, 80-year-old Kennedy, with more conservative replacements. A conservative-majority court is more likely to support gun rights, abortion regulations, an expansive view of religious liberty and Republican-backed voting restrictions, while opposing curbs on political spending. The court also is likely to tackle transgender rights and union funding in coming years. Among the groups congratulating Gorsuch on his confirmation were the U.S. Chamber of Commerce business lobbying group, the National Rifle Association gun rights group and anti-abortion activists. Gorsuch will be sworn in on Monday in two different ceremonies, one at the court and one at the White House. He can then prepare for the courts next round of oral arguments, starting on April 17. The courts current term ends in June. Gorsuch will participate in the justices private April 13 conference to consider taking new cases. There are appeals pending on expanding gun rights to include carrying concealed firearms in public, state voting restrictions that critics say are aimed at reducing minority turnout, and allowing business owners to object on religious grounds to providing gay couples certain services.  On April 19, the court will hear a case in which a church contends Missouri violated the U.S. Constitutions guarantee of religious freedom by denying it funds for a playground project due to a state ban on aid to religious organizations. Gorsuch has ruled in favor of expansive religious rights during his decade as a judge. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Reuters and other outlets reported late Thursday that Pai told major telecommunications trade groups of his plans Tuesday to replace 2015 net neutrality rules with voluntary agreements to adopt open internet principles. The 2015 rules prevented broadband providers from giving or selling speedy or so-called fastlane access to some internet services over others.  Pai, a Republican appointed by President Donald Trump, opposes the rules approved by the FCC which gave the agency strong legal control over broadband providers, treating them much like utilities. FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, a Democrat, said if the reports are accurate we are gearing up for a battle that could eviscerate the widely supported open Internet protections. The rules were built on a record of more than four million comments, and demonstrated that a free and open internet is at the very heart of our American democracy, she added. Chris Lewis, vice president at Public Knowledge said Pai could give dominant cable and telecommunications companies what their DC lobbyists have dreamed of for years: voluntary net neutrality rules where consumer protection is no more than trust your cable or internet provider. The FCC declined to comment.  Pai wants to introduce new regulations under which internet providers like AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc would voluntarily agree in their terms of service to not obstruct or slow consumer access to web content. The move would allow the Federal Trade Commission to enforce compliance with the new rules. Internet providers do not oppose net neutrality principles, but opposed the decision to reclassify internet service under a law that subjects them to potential utility style regulation. Pai is expected to unveil his proposal as early as April 27, with an initial vote planned for either May or June, sources told Reuters. The proposal would be open for public comment before the FCC could finalize it. The Internet Association, the trade group that represents major internet companies like Alphabet Inc, Facebook Inc, Netflix Inc and Microsoft Crop, and strongly supports net neutrality, will meet with Pai on Tuesday, a person briefed on the matter said.

In the biggest foreign policy decision of his presidency, Trump ordered the firing of cruise missiles at a Syrian air base that U.S. officials said was the launching point for a deadly chemical weapons attack against Syrian civilians this week. The strike was well planned, well executed. It was certainly more than a pinprick, and sends a message ... that using chemical weapons again is not something (Syrian president Bashar al-Assad) can do with impunity, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told a news conference. McConnell said Vice President Mike Pence had called him to explain the rationale for the strikes. It was one of a series of calls by administration officials to members of Congress beginning shortly before the strikes and extending until after midnight on Thursday evening. Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was called by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Trump himself. After seeing the devastation in Syria and visiting refugee camps, he said he became emotional when he heard the news.

Democratic Senator Mark Warner, vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Trumps Director of National Intelligence, Dan Coats, had called. I am hopeful these strikes will convince the Assad regime that such actions should never be repeated, Warner said in a statement. Partisan debate over how to deal with Syria has been bitter. In 2013, then-President Barack Obama ran into stiff resistance from many Republicans, including McConnell, when he proposed military action to retaliate for a chemical attack that crossed Obamas red line. Many Democrats, some of whom had paid a political penalty for backing Republican President George W. Bushs war in Iraq, also opposed intervention. Obamas abrupt decision not to fire missiles and instead work with Russia to remove Assads chemical weapons infuriated many Republicans who had backed the Democratic presidents proposal. The conflict in Syria has now dragged on for seven years, devastating the country, destabilizing the region and leaving millions homeless. Republican Senator Marco Rubio said he wanted a broader strategy. I would love to have one yesterday, or the day before. Id like to have one already but Id rather them design it correctly than not, he said, leaving a briefing by General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Most lawmakers insisted Trump should seek Congress approval for any additional military action. Congress must live up to its Constitutional responsibility to debate an Authorization of the Use of Military Force against a sovereign nation, Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi wrote in a letter asking Speaker Paul Ryan to call the House of Representatives back to Washington to debate a formal authorization to use military force. The House is not due to return until late April. Republican Senator Rand Paul, a member of the foreign relations committee, called the Syria strikes illegal. Under the U.S. Constitution, declarations of war require congressional approval. Weve had no chance to weigh or weigh in on whether we should do it or not, Paul told reporters. Democratic Senator Chris Murphy, another committee member, said that if Congress does not assert itself now, it risked losing its constitutional right to declare war. I think its devastating to the future role of Congress in foreign affairs. If we dont authorize this action, I dont see why any president would ever come to Congress, Murphy said.

The crisis in Syria sharpened Trumps desire to reduce the infighting and he is expected to make some staffing decisions soon, the Journal said, citing a senior administration official. Asked about the article, a White House spokeswoman said it was completely false.  The Journal said Trump has spoken to some of the people close to him in recent days about the performance of Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and has asked for the names of possible replacements. Some people close to the president have suggested Gary Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council and a former executive at Goldman Sachs Group Inc, the Journal reported. Another aide who could be reassigned is Steve Bannon, Trumps chief strategist, who has tangled with Jared Kushner, the presidents son-in-law and a close adviser, the Journal said. Trump removed Bannon from the National Security Council this week in what was seen as a victory for new national security adviser H.R. McMaster, a former Army lieutenant general who was working to exert control over the national security apparatus.     White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said the Journal story was an attempt to distract from Trumps bold and decisive action in ordering missile strikes on Syria, the Senates confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch and the visits of foreign leaders this week.

Trump, who had long said the top U.S. priority in Syria should be to fight Islamic State, immediately ordered a list of options to punish Assad, according to senior officials who took part in the flurry of closed-door meetings that played out over two days. Confronting his first foreign policy crisis, Trump relied on seasoned military experts rather than the political operatives who had dominated policy in the first weeks of his presidency and showed a willingness to move quickly, officials involved in the deliberations said.  On Thursday afternoon, Trump ordered the launch of a barrage of cruise missiles against the Shayrat air field north of Damascus, which the Pentagon says was used to store the chemical weapons used in the attack. I think it does demonstrate that President Trump is willing to act when governments and actorscross the line ... It is clear that President Trump made that statement to the world, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters. Senior administration officials said they met with Trump as early as Tuesday evening and presented options including sanctions, diplomatic pressure and a military plan to strike Syria drawn up well before he took office. He had a lot of questions and said he wanted to think about it but he also had some points he wanted to make. He wanted the options refined, one official said.  On Wednesday morning, Trumps military advisers said they knew which Syrian air base was used to launch the chemical attack and that they had tracked the Sukhoi-22 jet that carried it out.  Trump told them to focus on the military plans. It was a matter of dusting those off and adapting them for the current target set and timing, said another official. That same afternoon, Trump appeared in the White House Rose Garden and said the unspeakable attack against even beautiful little babies had changed his attitude toward Assad. Asked then whether he was formulating a new policy on Syria, Trump replied: Youll see. By late afternoon on Thursday, the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff met at the Pentagon to finalize the plan for the military strikes as Trump headed to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida for a summit meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. At another meeting there, Trump signed off on the missile attacks and went to dinner with Xi.  Two U.S. warships  the USS Ross and the USS Porter  fired 59 cruise missiles from the eastern Mediterranean Sea at the targeted air base at around 8:40 p.m. ET (00:40 GMT), just as the two presidents were finishing their meals. Throughout the three days of meetings, Trumps key military advisers were national security adviser H.R. McMaster, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joseph Dunford, officials said. In a White House marked by palace intrigue, McMaster has jostled for influence with Stephen Bannon, Trumps chief strategist, who lost his seat on the National Security Council on Wednesday just as the military preparations were developing.   Tillersons State Department told allies on Thursday that a strike against Syria was imminent, without providing details, one official said. But the move angered Russia, a major ally of Assad, and appeared to diminish chances of closer cooperation with Moscow that Trump has said is possible, especially in fighting the Islamic State militant group.  Tillerson played down suggestions that Trump was dropping his America First approach to foreign policy. And one of the other officials involved in the planning said the cruise missile launch was a one-off strike rather than the start of an escalating campaign.

The court may need to reargue the case with Gorsuch on board to avoid a 4-4 split. Cross-border shooting: Hernandez v.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""PALM BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping urged cooperation with the United States on trade and investment on Thursday, inviting President Donald Trump to visit China in a cordial start to their first meeting likely to broach sensitive security and commercial issues. Trump has said he wants to raise concerns about Chinas trade practices and press Xi to do more to rein in North Koreas nuclear ambitions during his two-day visit to the Spanish-style Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, though no major deals on either issue are expected. The two sides should promote the healthy development of bilateral trade and investment and advance talks on a bilateral investment agreement, Xi said, according to a statement on Chinas Foreign Ministry website. We have a thousand reasons to get China-U.S. relations right, and not one reason to spoil the China-U.S. relationship, Xi told Trump. Trump accepted Xis invitation to China later this year, state news agency Xinhua news agency cited officials as saying on Friday. Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan, joined Trump and his wife, Melania, at a long table in an ornate candle-lit private dining room festooned with red and yellow floral centerpieces, where they dined on pan-seared Dover sole and New York strip steak.  Trump, a New York real estate magnate before he ran for office, joked before dinner: Weve had a long discussion already, and so far I have gotten nothing, absolutely nothing. But we have developed a friendship - I can see that - and I think long term we are going to have a very, very great relationship and I look very much forward to it. The fanfare over the summit on Thursday was overshadowed by another pressing foreign policy issue: the U.S. response to a deadly poison gas attack in Syria. As Trump and Xi were wrapping up dinner, U.S. forces fired dozens of cruise missiles at a Syrian airbase from which it said the chemical weapons attack was launched this week, an escalation of the U.S. military role in Syria that swiftly drew sharp criticism from Russia.  In Beijing, Chinas Foreign Ministry urged all parties in Syria to find a political settlement. Trump and Xi were expected to get into more detailed discussions about trade and foreign policy issues on Friday, concluding their summit with a working lunch. Trump promised during the 2016 presidential campaign to stop what he called the theft of American jobs by China and rebuild the countrys manufacturing base. Many blue-collar workers helped propel him to his unexpected election victory in November and Trump wants to deliver for them. We have been treated unfairly and have made terrible trade deals with China for many, many years. Thats one of the things we are going to be talking about, Trump told reporters ahead of the meeting. The bilateral investment treaty mentioned by Xi, talks on which began during former president George W. Bushs administration and resumed under Barack Obama, has received little attention since Trump took office.  Trump is still finding his footing in the White House and has yet to spell out a strategy for what his advisers called a trade relationship based on the principle of reciprocity. He brought his top economic and national advisers to Florida for the meeting, including Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. Even as we share a desire to work together, the United States does recognize the challenges China can present to American interests, said Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, also in Florida for the meeting. Trumps daughter, Ivanka, and her husband, Jared Kushner, who both work at the White House, also were among the dinner guests. The summit brings together two leaders who could not seem more different: the often stormy Trump, prone to angry tweets, and Xi, outwardly calm, measured and tightly scripted, with no known social media presence.  What worries the protocol-conscious Chinese more than policy clashes is the risk that the unpredictable Trump could publicly embarrass Xi, after several foreign leaders experienced awkward moments with the new U.S. president. Ensuring President Xi does not lose face is a top priority for China, a Chinese official said. The most urgent problem facing Trump and Xi is how to persuade nuclear-armed North Korea to halt unpredictable behavior like missile test launches that have heightened tensions in South Korea and Japan. North Korea is working to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting the United States. Trump has threatened to use trade to try to force China to exert influence over Pyongyang. I think China will be stepping up, Trump told reporters on Thursday. Beijing says its influence is limited and that it is doing all it can. The White House is reviewing options to pressure Pyongyang economically and militarily, including secondary sanctions against Chinese banks and firms that do the most business with Pyongyang. A long-standing option of pre-emptive strikes remains on the table, but despite the tougher recent U.S. talk, the internal review de-emphasizes direct military action, the U.S. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Analysts believe any military action would likely provoke severe North Korean retaliation and massive casualties in South Korea and Japan and among U.S. troops stationed there. On trade, U.S. labor leaders say Trump needs to take a direct, unambiguous tone in his talks with Xi. President Trump needs to come away from the meeting with concrete deliverables that will restore production and employment here in the U.S. in those sectors that have been ravaged by Chinas predatory and protectionist practices, said Holly Hart, legislative director for the United Steelworkers union. A U.S. administration official told Reuters that Washington expects to have to use legal tools to fight for U.S. companies, such as pursuing World Trade Organization lawsuits. I dont expect a grand bargain on trade. I think what you are going to see is that the president makes very clear to Xi and publicly what we expect on trade, a U.S. official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. Trump has often complained Beijing undervalues its currency to boost trade, but his administration looks unlikely to formally label China a currency manipulator in the near term - a designation that could come with penalties.

Such an estimate is crucial as we contemplate reauthorization, of parts of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that are due to expire at the end of the year, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, a Republican, and John Conyers, the panels top Democrat, wrote in a letter addressed to Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats. The request comes as some Republican lawmakers, many of whom have stridently defended U.S. surveillance programs in the past, express sudden interest in considering additional privacy safeguards to how U.S. spy agencies collect and share intelligence that contains information about Americans. That interest has been sparked by evolving, unsubstantiated assertions that the Obama White House used surveillance powers to improperly spy on the incoming Trump administration. Privacy advocates have for years demanded that the U.S. government share an estimate of how many Americans are ensnared by programs authorized under a certain part of FISA, known as Section 702, that allows for the collection of vast quantities of internet communications from foreigners believed to be living overseas.  Some experts and lawmakers have said they believe data on  millions of Americans could be caught under such surveillance, exposing them to warrantless searches by federal investigators. It is clear that Section 702 surveillance programs can and do collect information about U.S. persons, on subjects unrelated to counter-terrorism, wrote Goodlatte and Conyers, who requested a response by April 24. It is imperative that we understand the size of this impact on U.S. persons as our committee proceeds with the debate on reauthorization. In a separate letter sent last December to the outgoing Obama administration, members of the House Judiciary Committee said they were given assurances by officials that an estimate would be provided, likely by January of this year. Richard Ledgett, the deputy director of the National Security Agency, said yes when asked by a Reuters reporter last month whether an estimate would be provided before year end. He also said about 20 vignettes would be publicly released that show the important national security value of Section 702, which officials have described as among the most important intelligence tools at their disposal.

The cruise missile strike near the city of Homs early in the day came in response to what Washington and its allies said was a chemical weapons attack this week by Syrian forces. Damascus has strongly denied using chemical weapons. Some residents of Idlib province, where the chemical attack took place killing scores of people, said they hoped the U.S. strike would weaken Assads government. The American strike was good, its positive - we support any strike against the Syrian regime, 29-year-old Alaa al-Zir said. We hope there will be more strikes - and other action - to follow ... so the revolutionaries can advance further and these massacres against civilians can stop, he said. Another man, Qadi Hajj Qadur, said the strike was likely too little, too late from the United States under new President Donald Trump, but that it was still a positive development and signaled hope for an end to the conflict. Its been seven years and weve experienced killing and they (the international community) didnt impose a no-fly zone, they didnt do anything. Now America has come and wants to defend us. Is Trump a friend? I dont know. But hopefully something good will come from him, and there will be a (peace) agreement, and this corrupt regime which slaughtered people can be gone.

Trumps decision to launch missiles at a Syrian government target marks a dramatic departure and was welcomed by the opposition, who called for further strikes. Syrias government controls most of the west of the country including its largest population centers, but rebels still hold Idlib province as a stronghold, with pockets of control in other areas including outside Damascus. The Damascus government said the U.S. strike was rash and an act of flagrant aggression, but did not expect a bigger escalation.  In an interview with the Lebanese TV station al-Mayadeen, Assad aide Bouthaina Shaaban said any Syrian who welcomed the strike was a traitor. Damascus residents struck a defiant tone, echoing the governments vow to escalate the pace of its attacks on insurgents and to win back the whole country. Others said the U.S. attack was no surprise and vowed to stand up to Washington. Talk in the U.N. Security Council about (Syria using) chemical weapons is lies, and Syria knows this. They just wanted to have an excuse to strike, said a Damascus fireman, who did not give his name. It doesnt make a great difference anyway.

The nuanced line taken by the blocs 28 states reflects their disgust at a chemical attack that killed scores of people in a rebel-held area this week, but also a worry about any more escalation in the conflict following the unilateral U.S. move. The U.S. has informed the European Union that ... (it) launched a strike on Shayrat Airfield in Syria with the understandable intention to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons, the blocs top diplomat, Federica Mogherini, said in a statement on behalf of all member states. The U.S. also informed us that these strikes are limited and focused on preventing and deterring further use of chemical weapons atrocities, the statement read. She added that the use of chemical weapons was a war crime and perpetrators of such acts should be sanctioned within the framework of the United Nations. The bloc supports Syrian opposition rebels and some moderate rebels negotiating under U.N.-mediated talks with representatives of Damascus. The talks have long been stalled and the war, which is in its seventh year, has killed more than 400,000 people and sent millions from their homes. The EU firmly believes that there can be no military solution to the conflict, the joint statement said. Only a credible political solution... will ensure peace and stability. While France and Britain have led calls for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to go, some other EU states, including the Czech Republic, Hungary, Spain and Italy, are more dovish. But the blocs role in international peace efforts has been largely marginal as it lacks influence on the ground, where Russias military intervention has given Assad the upper hand. The EU is the largest aid donor in Syria, and has threatened it will not pay for reconstruction of the country if Assad and his allies take full control by wiping out the opposition.  The EU says a credible political transition must start first with the aim of giving the opposition and Syrias various ethnic and religious groups political representation. The chairman of EU leaders Donald Tusk, French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault, the Polish foreign ministry as well as a British government spokesman supported Washington.

George Sabra, a prominent opposition politician, told al-Hadath TV: The truth is that militarily, if it is limited to this strike, then it has no meaning. The Free Syrian Army, a loose alliance of rebel groups that includes factions that have received military support from the United States, called the U.S. strike the correct starting point for finding a just political solution to the war We view that the responsibility of the United States is still great, and does not stop with this operation, it added in a statement, warning that the Damascus government and its allies could commit acts of revenge against civilians.

The Syrian government has strongly denied responsibility and says it does not use chemical weapons. The Homs governor said on Friday the base was being used to provide air support for operations against Islamic State east of Palmyra. Hassan Haj Ali, commander of the Free Idlib Army rebel group, which fights under the FSA umbrella, told Reuters the strikes came at a very important phase and showed Syrians that there is still humanity in this world. He said he did not expect further such U.S. attacks, however. Nasr al-Hariri, chief negotiator of the High Negotiations Committee (HNC), said on Twitter that the strikes should they continue, would kick off a correct start in combating terrorism.   The Saudi-based HNC, the main opposition body which includes political and armed groups, has participated in U.N.-sponsored peace talks in Geneva. We hope for the continuation of the strikes in order to prevent the regime from using its planes to launch any new air raids or going back to using internationally banned weapons, said Ahmad Ramadan, head of the media office of the Syrian National Coalition political opposition group.  The airbase targeted by the U.S. strike was used to kill Syrians, Ramadan said. The American attack sends a clear message to the regime and its backers that they can no longer avoid repercussions, he added. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Republicans and Democrats both praised his selection. He has administrative experience as a committee chairman, and familiarity with delicate subjects after leading the House Ethics Committee from 2013 to 2015. I like him. I hope he can get us back on track, Representative Eric Swalwell, a Democratic committee member, said in a brief interview outside the U.S. House of Representatives. While Conaway, 68, has ties to mainstream Republicans and a long association with the Bush political family, the former accountant from Texas was a strong Trump supporter during the 2016 campaign. In 2016, Conaway backed Trump, citing the candidates choice of Mike Pence as his vice president, his promise to appoint conservative Supreme Court justices and the congressmans own vehement opposition to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. But unlike Devin Nunes - who on Thursday stepped down as leader of the investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential election, including possible collusion with Trump associates - Conaway was not a member of the incoming presidents transition team. Russia denies the allegations. Conaway is considered less partisan than some other Republican committee members such as Trey Gowdy, the chairman of the House Select Committee that investigated the 2012 attacks on a U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya. Democrats accused Gowdy of running a partisan inquiry that focused on former Secretary of State Clinton in an effort to damage her 2016 presidential campaign. In his statement announcing he would step aside, Nunes said Gowdy and another Republican committee member, Tom Rooney, would also be leaders of the Russia investigation. Fox News reported that Nunes called Conaway on Wednesday night. Nevertheless, some Conaway comments about the Russia investigation have raised eyebrows.  During a March 20 committee hearing, he asked FBI Director James Comey whether Washington Post reporters had helped intelligence agencies write their assessment that Moscow was seeking to help Trump win the election. And in a January interview with the Dallas Morning News, he seemed to make light of the alleged Russian meddling in the election, saying it and the Democrats use of Mexican singers to entertain their voters were both foreign interference. Although he also serves as chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, Conaway has kept a low profile, and is better known for his close ties to the Bush family than the media spotlight. First elected to the House in 2004, and easily re-elected six times, Conaway is the second-ranking Republican on the intelligence panel. House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters on Thursday that he had faith in Conaway.

U.S. officials said they had informed Russian forces ahead of the strikes  intended to punish the Syrian government for what they say was a chemical weapons attack earlier this week  and had avoided hitting Russian personnel. Satellite imagery suggests the Shayrat air base that was struck in western Syria is home to Russian special forces and military helicopters, part of the Kremlins effort to help the Syrian government fight Islamic State and other militant groups. Russias main air base and a naval facility were not hit.  Moscow had been hoping to cooperate with Trump to jointly fight Islamic State in Syria, a move it was banking on to boost U.S.-Russia ties which are at a post-Cold War low. After the U.S. strikes, that task now looks harder. President Putin views the U.S. strikes on Syria as aggression against a sovereign state in violation of the norms of international law and on a made-up up pretext, said a Kremlin statement.  This step by Washington will inflict major damage on U.S.-Russia ties.  Putin, a staunch ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, was holding a meeting of Russias Security Council to discuss the strike on Friday afternoon and the Russian Foreign Ministry called for an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council. A foreign ministry statement said Moscow was suspending a Syrian air safety agreement with the United States originally drawn up to ensure that the two countries planes did not collide. Its clear to any specialist that the decision to launch a strike was taken in Washington before the events in Idlib (the province where the gas poisoning took place) which were simply used as a pretext for a show of force, the ministry said. Dmitry Peskov, Putins spokesman, told reporters the U.S. strikes had been conducted to help rebel groups fighting Assad. Russia would keep military channels of communication open with Washington, but would not exchange any information through them, he added. When asked whether Russia had deactivated its own anti-missile defense systems in Syria before the missile strike, Peskov declined to comment.  U.S.-RUSSIA TIES IN PERIL The Russian Defence Ministry meanwhile mocked the effectiveness of the U.S. strikes, saying only 23 missiles had found their targets. It was unclear where another 36 had landed, it said, promising Syrian air defenses would now be beefed up.  A Russian frigate armed with Kalibr cruise missiles sailed through the Bosphorus en route to the eastern Mediterranean in the early hours of Friday morning, according to pictures taken by Turkish bloggers for their online Bosphorus Naval News project. It was unclear if that was related to the U.S. strikes.  Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said there were no reports of any Russians being hurt in the attack. He said he hoped U.S.-Russia ties would not be irreparably hurt as a result.  Rex Tillerson is due to make his first visit to Moscow next week as U.S. secretary of state, an eagerly awaited event in Russia where politicians have been anxious to try to use the change of administration to reboot relations.   One senior Russian lawmaker, Leonid Slutsky, told the Russia 24 television channel on Friday Moscow should use the Tillerson visit to try and talk sense into Washington. Syria, ironically, was one of the few areas where analysts believed Moscow and Washington might be able to find common ground.     The Kremlin says Washingtons allegations that the Syrian army possesses and used chemical weapons are flat out wrong and accuses the West of ignoring rebel use of such weapons. It says scores of Syrians were killed by poison gas on Tuesday because the Syrian air force had struck a militant bomb-making factory which it said contained chemical weapons procured in Iraq. Western countries have dismissed this version of events and say Syrian planes dropped the gas, which Assad denies.  The Kremlin said on Friday the U.S. attack had thrown up a serious obstacle to the idea championed by Trump during his election campaign of creating an international coalition against terrorism.  Konstantin Kosachev, chairman of the upper houses international affairs committee, said it looked like Trump may have been pushed into approving military action by the Pentagon and U.S. intelligence agencies.  One way or another, Russian cruise missiles are continuing to strike terrorists and American ones government troops who are heading the war against the terrorists, Kosachev wrote on social media. I fear that with these approaches the hoped-for U.S.-Russian anti-terrorism coalition in Syria ... is breathing its last before it is even born.

The stance could complicate Turkish efforts to repair ties with Russia, damaged in November 2015 when Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet near the Syrian border.

France, a key backer of rebels opposed to President Bashar al-Assad, has repeatedly called on him to step down and this week said a suspected chemical attack by Assads forces was a test for U.S. President Donald Trump. The United States has started clarifying its position because over the last few days we heard one thing and then another, Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault told Reuters and France Info radio in the Mauritanian capital, Nouakchott, where he was on a diplomatic visit. Here, we have an action that is a sort of condemnation, through military strikes on a military base, of what this criminal regime is doing. In Paris, President Francois Hollande confirmed French backing for the U.S. action, saying France had been seeking U.S. missile strikes in 2013 after a previous chemical attack. Assad bore full responsibility for this development, Hollande said in a joint statement with Germany from the Elysee after speaking with Chancellor Angela Merkel. He said France and Germany would continue efforts through the United Nations to achieve the best response to chemical attacks.  The U.S. missile strikes came in response to a suspected chemical weapons attack on a rebel-held town in northern Syria earlier this week which killed at least 70 people. Ayrault, who was informed ahead of the strikes by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, said he did not believe Washington wanted to continue its strikes and that the escalation of the U.S. military role in Syria, in which two U.S. warships fired dozens of cruise missiles at an Assad-controlled airbase, was a warning. France, a NATO ally, has been a vocal critic of Washingtons policy in Syria since the previous administration of Barack Obama pulled back from launching strikes against Assad following the 2013 chemical attack that killed hundreds of people. French planes had been minutes away from taking off when  Obama backed down. A signal was sent, because yet again a red line was crossed by Assad, Ayrault said. The use of chemical weapons is appalling and should be punished because it is a war crime, Ayrault said. He said Pariss only military role in Syria at present was its part in the coalition fighting Islamic State and that it had no intention of entering the conflict between Assad and rebels. The conflict is now in its seventh year and has killed more than 400,000 people and displaced millions. We are not seeking any confrontation, but Russia and Iran must understand that backing the Assad regime makes no sense, he said, urging Moscow to now fully back a UN Security Council resolution that sets out the path for a transition to peace in the country.  Peace negotiations (are going on) for a political transition, to rebuild the country and enable the return of refugees and that will not happen with Bashar al-Assad, he said. I will tell the Russians: Stop playing. Stop hesitating and pretending. Play your role and implement resolution 2254(the UN resolution that sets out a roadmap for peace talks).

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel stood fully behind the decision to fire more than 50 Cruise missiles at the airfield from where Washington said President Bashar al-Assads forces launched a deadly chemical attack this week. In both word and action, President Trump sent a strong and clear message today that the use and spread of chemical weapons will not be tolerated, Netanyahu said in a statement.  Israel ... hopes that this message of resolve in the face of the Assad regimes horrific actions will resonate not only in Damascus, but in Tehran, Pyongyang and elsewhere. During the six-year conflict in Syria, Israel has largely stayed on the sidelines, carrying out only occasional airstrikes when it feels threatened, including by the movement of weapons to Lebanese Hezbollah militants on its frontier with Syria. Israeli officials said the United States had informed them about the airstrikes ahead of time, but it was not clear whether Israel provided intelligence or any other form of input to the White House to support carrying out the attack. Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman called the U.S. move an important, necessary and moral message. The American notification to the Israeli military and defence establishment before the strike is additional proof of the strength of the deep ties, he said.  Yaakov Amidror, Israels former national security adviser, said the calibrated response by the United States had sent a message that Washington was reengaged in the region and that Russia did not have free rein in Syria.  The Americans are telling the Russians: You are not alone any more, not in Syria not in the Middle East, and we are ready to take all the steps to be involved, and if you neutralise the U.N. Security Council, we will know how to act without its permission, he said on a conference call with reporters.  Yet again, military action is an option that will be used when the Americans decide that it should be used and (tell hostile states): Watch your behaviour and your attitude towards American interests. Asked about the risk of retaliation, he said: The chances for an attack initiated by either Syria or Hezbollah is even less today than before because now it is understood that if they violate the interests of the United States of America ... this administration is ready to take action. As for Israel stepping up its actions in Syria, Amidror said it would only engage if either of its two red lines are crossed: if strategic weapons are passed to Hezbollah units or if launch sites for attacks are set up in the Golan Heights, where Israeli-occupied territory borders Syria. We will stay on the sidelines because our strategic decision was not to take part in this war. If there is something specific that we can do militarily or from an intelligence point of view and so on, Im sure that Israel would be more than happy to contribute to such efforts.

A deadly chemical attack was launched this week from that base. This action was appropriate and just. Resolving the years-long crisis in Syria is a complex task, but Bashar al-Assad must be held accountable and his enablers must be persuaded to change course. I look forward to the administration further engaging Congress in this effort.  Building on tonights credible first step, we must finally learn the lessons of history and ensure that tactical success leads to strategic progress. That means following through with a new, comprehensive strategy in coordination with our allies and partners to end the conflict in Syria. It is critical that Assad knows he will no longer enjoy impunity for his horrific crimes against his own citizens, and this proportional step was appropriate. As we move forward, it will be important for the administration to engage with Congress and clearly communicate its full strategy to the American people. Assad was warned, repeatedly, by the U.S. and the U.N. that the intentional targeting of innocent men, women and children is intolerable. Now Assad has been caught red-handed carrying out another abhorrent chemical attack, and the administration has taken a measured response. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF, RANKING MEMBER, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE I will be reintroducing an authorization for use of military force against ISIS and al Qaeda when Congress returns to session. Congress cannot abdicate its responsibility any longer and should vote on any use of force not made in self defense. This is necessary whether action is taken against terrorist groups or, as here, against regime capabilities. Making sure Assad knows that when he commits such despicable atrocities he will pay a price is the right thing to do. It is incumbent on the Trump administration to come up with a strategy and consult with Congress before implementing it. SENATOR BEN CARDIN, TOP DEMOCRAT ON SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS I cannot emphasize this enough, any longer-term or larger military operation in Syria by the Trump administration will need to be done in consultation with the Congress. Furthermore, it is the presidents responsibility to inform the legislative branch and the American people about his larger policy in Syria, as well as the legal basis for this action and any additional military activities in that country. SENATOR MARCO RUBIO, REPUBLICAN ON SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS What must follow is a real and comprehensive strategy to ensure that Assad is no longer a threat to his people and to U.S. security, and that Russia no longer has free rein to support his regime. While we all condemn the atrocities in Syria, the United States was not attacked. The president needs congressional authorization for military action as required by the Constitution, and I call on him to come to Congress for a proper debate. Our prior interventions in this region have done nothing to make us safer, and Syria will be no different. My preliminary briefing by the White House indicated that this was a measured response to the Syrian nerve gas atrocity. Any further action will require close scrutiny by Congress, and any escalation beyond air strikes or missile strikes will require engaging the American people in that decision. While Im encouraged that the Trump administration has felt compelled to act forcefully in Syria against the Assad regime, Im gravely concerned that the United States is engaging further militarily in Syria without a well-thought-out, comprehensive plan. Frankly, the presidents actions today generate more questions than answers. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Homs Governor Talal Barazi, in separate remarks to Reuters, said the targeted airbase had been providing air support for army operations against Islamic State east of Palmyra, and the attack served the interests of armed terrorist groups. I believe - God willing - that the human casualties are not big, but there is material damage. We hope there are not many victims and martyrs, he told Reuters. U.S. President Donald Trump said he ordered missile strikes against an airfield from which a deadly chemical weapons attack was launched this week, declaring he acted in Americas national security interest against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Barazi told al-Mayadeen there were civilian casualties at a village next to the base, but did not elaborate. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based organization that reports on the war, said four Syrian soldiers were killed, including a senior officer. It was citing its own sources. The Syrian army could not be reached for comment.  Speaking at dawn, Barazi said rescue and fire-fighting operations had been going on for two hours at the base.    He said the attack was a form of support for the armed terrorist groups, and it is an attempt to weaken the capabilities of the Syrian Arab Army to combat terrorism. Speaking to Syrian state TV, Barazi said: The Syrian leadership and Syrian policy will not change. This targeting was not the first and I dont believe it will be the last, he added. In separate comments to al-Mayadeen, he said: The war against terrorism will continue.   U.S. officials said dozens of cruise missiles were fired against the base in response to the suspected gas attack in a rebel-held area that Washington has blamed on Assads forces. The Syrian government has strongly denied responsibility.

FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, a Republican appointed by President Donald Trump, met on Tuesday with major telecommunications trade groups to discuss his preliminary plan to reverse the rules, the sources said. The FCC declined to comment but Pai previously said he is committed to ensuring an open internet but feels net neutrality was a mistake. The rules approved by the FCC under Democratic President Barack Obama in early 2015 prohibited broadband providers from giving or selling access to speedy internet, essentially a fast lane, to certain internet services over others. As part of that change, the FCC reclassified internet service providers much like utilities. Pai wants to overturn that reclassification, but wants internet providers to voluntarily agree to not obstruct or slow consumer access to web content, two officials said late Tuesday. The officials briefed on the meeting said Pai suggested companies commit in writing to open internet principles and including them in their terms of service, which would make them binding. It is unclear if regulators could legally compel internet providers to adopt open internet principles without existing net neutrality rules. As part of that move, the Federal Trade Commission would assume oversight of ensuring compliance. Three sources said Pai plans to unveil his proposal to overturn the rules as early as late April and it could face an initial vote in May or June.  Internet providers like AT&T Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and Comcast Corp have argued net neutrality rules would make it harder to manage internet traffic and investment in additional capacity less likely. Websites worry that without the rules they might lose access to customers. AT&T and major trade groups sued the FCC in 2015 over the net neutrality rules.      Democrats and privacy advocates say net neutrality is crucial to keeping the internet open. Pai in December predicted that net neutralitys days were numbered. He told Reuters in February he believes in a free and open internet and the only question is what regulatory framework best secures that. Pai and congressional Republicans have moved quickly to dismantle Obama-era telecommunications rules. Trump on Monday signed a repeal of Obama-era broadband privacy rules a victory for internet service providers and a blow to privacy advocates.

I think we should have been more willing to confront Assad, Clinton said in the interview, conducted by New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof.  I really believe we should have and still should take out his air fields and prevent him from being able to use them to bomb innocent people and drop sarin gas on them.  Clinton noted that she had advocated for a no-fly zone in Syria after leaving government, something that Obama opposed.  Her remarks came two days after a poison gas attack in Syria that killed at least 70 people, many of them children. The U.S. government believes the chemical agent sarin was used in the attack. The United States and other Western countries blamed Assads armed forces for the worst chemical attack in Syria in more than four years.  Trump said on Thursday that something should happen with Assad after the attack, as the Pentagon and the White House studied military options.  When asked about Russian interference in the presidential election she lost as the Democratic candidate in November, Clinton called for a bipartisan investigation.  I dont want any Republican candidate to be subjected to what I was subjected to....I dont want anybody running campaigns to have their communications stolen, she said.  U.S. intelligence agencies have said that Russia provided hacked material from the Democratic National Committee to WikiLeaks through a third party. Russia has denied the hacking allegations.  It was a more effective theft even than Watergate, Clinton told Kristof before an audience of about 3,000 people at New Yorks Lincoln Center, referring to the U.S. political scandal of the 1970s that led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon.  We arent going to let somebody sitting in the Kremlin, with bots and trolls, try to mix up our election. Weve got to end that and we have to make sure that is a bipartisan, American commitment.  Representative Devin Nunes, a Republican, earlier on Thursday stepped aside from the congressional inquiry into Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential election because he is under investigation for disclosing classified information. Representative Mike Conaway, the second-ranked Republican on the House of Representatives intelligence committee, will now lead the probe.  Clinton attributed her White House loss to both Wikileaks and FBI Director James Comeys sending a bombshell letter to Congress only days before the election announcing he was reinstating an investigation into her emails.  Asked whether it was bittersweet to watch the stumbles of the Trump administration in its early days, she declined to agree.  I dont take any pleasure in seeing the kind of chaotic functioning, Clinton said.  Clinton said she has no intention of another run for public office and said she is writing a book that, in part, delves into just what derailed her attempt to become Americas first woman president.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - President Donald Trump faces his biggest test as a world leader when he meets Chinese President Xi Jinping Thursday and Friday for a summit that will set the tone for perhaps the most consequential of U.S. foreign relationships. The two leaders are expected to struggle to find common ground on the main issues that divide them when they meet at Trumps Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. The main agenda items are: North Korea is perhaps Trumps most pressing national security challenge. Pyongyang has been working to develop nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States. Trump is expected to repeat his call for China to do more to rein in its ally and neighbor and has warned that Washington might deal with Pyongyangs weapons programs alone if need be. China says it is doing all it can and has said it is up to the United States to de-escalate with Pyongyang. A White House strategy review focuses on options for pressuring Pyongyang economically and militarily. Among measures under consideration are secondary sanctions against Chinese banks and firms that do the most business with Pyongyang.  A long-standing option of pre-emptive strikes remains on the table, but the review de-emphasizes direct military action, a senior U.S. official said. Any military action would likely provoke severe North Korean retaliation and massive casualties in South Korea and Japanand among U.S. troops stationed there. TRADE Trade is one of the biggest hot-button issues, given Trumps charges in his presidential campaign that Chinese trade practices were killing U.S. jobs and his vow to impose 45 percent tariffs on Chinese imports. The administration has not acted on unilateral tariffs but is targeting a reduction in Chinas $347 billion goods trade surplus through tougher enforcement of trade laws and anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has also demanded reciprocity in the U.S.-China economic relationship, saying that U.S. companies do not enjoy the same access to Chinas vast market as Chinese firms get in the United States.  China says Washington should create better conditions for Chinese investment in the United States if it wants to correct the imbalance. Neither side wants a trade war, but it may be hard to do much more than lower the temperature in Mar-a-Lago. Some analysts believe Xi may bring a package of job-creating Chinese investments and the prospect of a more open services sector that Trump could tweet as tangible achievements. Relations are also clouded by Chinas expansive claims in the disputed South China Sea, where Beijing has been building artificial islands and installing military facilities on them. U.S. officials see this as part of a long-term Chinese bid to deny U.S. forces access to the strategic sea, a key global trade route. They say Washington plans more robust naval operations to challenge Chinese claims and assert the right to freedom of navigation, though months have passed since the last one in October under Trumps predecessor Barack Obama. The situation in North Korea has appeared to push the South China Sea issue onto the back burner for now, but Trump is expected to air U.S. concerns. Trump has repeatedly charged that China manipulates its yuan currency to keep its exports cheap, and he is likely to raise the issue with Xi. But Trump did not make good on his promises to formally declare China a currency manipulator on the first day of his presidency.  While economists believe China pushed down the value of the yuan in the past, Chinas central bank for much of the past two years has been working to prop up the yuan amid capital outflow pressures, spending more than $1 trillion in the process.  This would make it very hard to justify a manipulator designation under the U.S. Treasurys current foreign exchange analysis, due one week after Xis visit. The summit would not be happening if Trump had not reaffirmed the one China policy that has underpinned bilateral relations for decades. Trump infuriated Beijing when, as president-elect, he took a call from Taiwans president and suggested he might not abide by the policy. He backtracked in a call with Xi in February. Xi may now be looking to head off a big new weapons package to Taiwan that U.S. officials have told Reuters is being crafted.  For its part, Taiwan will be watching anxiously for any sign that Trump is using it as a bargaining chip. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The poll suggests any effort to reach a consensus on key policy issues could be complicated simply by Trumps involvement.  The survey from Feb. 1 to March 15 of nearly 14,000 people asked respondents to consider a series of statements Trump has made on taxes, crime and the news media, among other issues. In many cases, the data showed that people will orient their opinions according to what they think of Trump.  Republicans, for example, were more likely to criticize American exceptionalism  the notion that the United States holds a unique place in history - when told that Trump once said it was insulting to other countries. They were more likely to agree that the country should install more nuclear weapons, and they were more supportive of government spending for infrastructure, when they knew that Trump felt the same way.  Democrats moved in the opposite direction. They were less supportive of infrastructure spending, less critical of the judiciary and less likely to agree that urban crime was on the rise when they knew that those concerns were shared by Trump.  Im basically in disagreement with everything he says, said Howard House, 58, a Democrat from Jacksonville, Florida, who took the poll. Ive almost closed my mind to the guy.  Trump is not the first president to polarize the public. A 1995 poll by the Washington Post found that Democrats appeared to favor legislative action when they thought it was then-President Bill Clintons idea, and a 2013 survey by Hart Research Associates showed that both positive and negative attitudes about the 2010 Affordable Care Act intensified when called by its other name, Obamacare.  But previous presidents were more popular than Trump at this point, according to the Gallup polling service, and they may have been better positioned to address the public divide because of it. Gallup had Trump at a 42 percent approval rating on Tuesday. He was as low as 35 percent last week.  That leaves Trump facing a largely disapproving electorate, even as the White House signals that in the coming months it wants to pass a sweeping tax-reform package, a large infrastructure plan, and perhaps try again to supplant the Affordable Care Act.  The White House said that Trump has tried to reach out to those who did not support him during the campaign in an attempt to build political consensus.  The door to the White House has been open to a variety of people who are willing to come to the table and have honest discussions with the President about the ways we can make our country better, a White House spokeswoman wrote in an email.  THE HYPER-PARTISAN ERA OF TRUMP  Poll respondents were split into two groups. Each received nearly identical questions about statements Trump has made in recent years. One group, however, was not told the statements came from Trump.  The poll then asked if people agreed or disagreed with those statements. In a few cases, Trump made little to no impact on the answers. But most of the time the inclusion of his name changed the results.  A series of questions about conflicts of interest produced the biggest swings.  Some 33 percent of Republicans said it was okay if an official financially benefits from a government position. However, when a separate group was asked the same question with Trumps name added in, more than twice as many Republicans  70 percent  said it was okay.  When interviewed afterward, some respondents said they knew they were making special exceptions for Trump.  Susie Stewart, a 73-year-old healthcare worker from Fort Worth, Texas, said it came down to trust. While most politicians should be forbidden from mixing their personal fortunes with government business, Stewart, who voted for Trump, said the president had earned the right to do so.  He is a very intelligent man, Stewart said. Hes proved himself to be one hell of a manager. A builder. I think he has the business sense to do whats best for the country.  On the other side of the political spectrum, House, the Democrat from Florida and a Hillary Clinton supporter, said he also made an exception for Trump. But in this instance it meant that House disagreed with everything Trump supported.  If Trump said the sky was blue, Im going to go outside and check, he said.  It is impossible to say exactly what motivates people to answer a certain way in a political poll, said John Bullock, an expert in partisanship at the University of Texas at Austin.  Some respondents may have looked past the question and answered in a way that they thought would support or oppose Trump, Bullock said. But he said it was also likely that others simply have not thought deeply about the issue and are looking to Trump as a guide for how to answer.  They think of him either as a man who shares their values or someone who manifestly does not, Bullock said.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Derek Kan is general manager for San Francisco-based ride services company Lyft in Southern California. He previously was policy adviser to Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, the husband of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao. The announcement comes after Chao said in late February she was reviewing self-driving vehicle guidance issued by the Obama administration. The guidelines, which were issued in September, call on automakers to voluntarily submit details of self-driving vehicle systems to regulators in a 15-point safety assessment. Automakers have raised numerous concerns about the guidance, including that it requires them to turn over significant data, could delay testing by months and lead to states making the voluntary guidelines mandatory. Reuters reported on Thursday that Lyft Inc has nearly completed a funding round of at least $500 million, valuing the company at $7.5 billion, according to a source close to the company. The $7.5 billion valuation marks a sharp increase from the $5.5 billion valuation at Lyfts last financing more than a year ago. Kan also serves on the board of Amtrak and has worked at a Silicon Valley start-up and Bain & Company. Reuters reported in February that General Motors Cos plans to deploy thousands of self-driving electric cars in test fleets in partnership with Lyft, beginning in 2018, citing two sources familiar with the automakers plans. GM is an investor in Lyft. Kan will offer policy guidance as the department faces a number of big decisions at the agency. The White House is still looking to fill many key transportation posts, including a head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

In an interview, Trump declined to tell the New York Times whether he had reviewed intelligence to bolster his claim about Rice but said he would explain himself at the right time. Rice said she had no immediate comment on the presidents remarks when contacted by Reuters. Later on Wednesday, Erin Pelton, a spokesman for Rice, said in an email to Reuters: Im not going to dignify the Presidents ludicrous charge with a comment. Trump and his allies have focused on unsubstantiated reports that Rice, who served as Obamas national security adviser, disclosed the names of Trump aides swept up in U.S. surveillance of foreign targets. Rice dismissed the reports as absolutely false in an interview with MSNBC on Tuesday. According to five U.S. intelligence officials, Rice followed standard procedure in requesting the National Security Agency to reveal to her the names of American citizens who had been in contact with Russians whose communications were monitored by U.S. intelligence. It is unlikely she would have known that any unidentified American had a connection to Trump, the officials said. As White House national security adviser, Rice could not order the NSA to reveal the identities of any Americans. Instead, she could only request it to do so. Such requests, which a number of senior officials are authorized to make, trigger a legal and intelligence review by the agency to determine whether revealing the name has potential intelligence value and could expose a security threat to the United States, said one of the officials, who is familiar with the process and spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal intelligence procedures. There is nothing unusual, much less suspicious, about any request by Rice, said another intelligence official, especially since it could have revealed Russian intelligence contacts or agents operating in the United States. This official and two other intelligence officials said the NSA often receives dozens of such requests in a month. John Culhane, a professor at Widener University Delaware Law School, said he thought Rice could have a credible libel lawsuit against Trump. Though public figures like Rice face a higher standard in bringing such claims, Culhane said she could contend Trump demonstrated a reckless disregard for the truth. But the president typically enjoys immunity from civil lawsuits over official acts, Culhane noted, and a court could find that Trumps interview with the newspaper was within the scope of his official duties.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senate Republicans on Thursday crushed a Democratic blockade of President Donald Trumps U.S. Supreme Court nominee in a fierce partisan brawl, approving a rule change dubbed the nuclear option to allow for conservative judge Neil Gorsuchs confirmation by Friday. With ideological control of the countrys highest court at stake, the Republican-led Senate voted 52-48 along party lines to change its long-standing rules in order to prohibit a procedural tactic called a filibuster against Supreme Court nominees. That came after Republicans failed by a 55-45 tally to muster the 60-vote super-majority needed to end the Democratic filibuster that had sought to deny Gorsuch confirmation to the lifetime post. The Senates action cleared the way to confirm Gorsuch by simple majority on Friday, with a final vote expected by late morning. Republicans control the Senate 52-48. The rule change was called the nuclear option because it was considered an extreme break with Senate tradition. Trump had encouraged Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to go nuclear. Confirmation of Gorsuch would represent Trumps first major victory since taking office on Jan. 20, after setbacks on healthcare legislation and the blocking of his order that sought to ban travelers from several Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. Senate confirmation of Gorsuch, a Colorado-based federal appeals could judge, would restore the nine-seat courts 5-4 conservative majority, enable Trump to leave an indelible mark on Americas highest judicial body and fulfill a top campaign promise by the Republican president. Gorsuch, 49, could be expected to serve for decades. This will be the first and last partisan filibuster of the Supreme Court, McConnell said on the Senate floor, accusing Democrats of trying to inflict political damage on Trump and to keep more conservatives from joining the high court. In 20 or 30 or 40 years, we will sadly point to today as a turning point in the history of the Senate and the Supreme Court, a day when we irrevocably moved further away from the principles our founders intended for these institutions: principles of bipartisanship, moderation and consensus, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor. Schumer ridiculed McConnells contention that the Democratic action was unprecedented. He noted that the Republican-led Senate refused last year to consider Democratic former President Barack Obamas nomination of appellate judge Merrick Garland for the same seat that Trump selected Gorsuch to fill. With three of the courts justices 78 or older, Trump told reporters he hoped to appoint as many as four Supreme Court justices, a move likely to make it overwhelmingly conservative. In fact, under a certain scenario there could even be more than that, Trump said aboard Air Force One en route to a meeting with Chinas president in Florida, adding that the Senate rule change would not alter how he picks court nominees. A conservative-majority court is more likely to support broad gun rights, an expansive view of religious liberty, abortion regulations and Republican-backed voting restrictions, while opposing curbs on political spending. The court also is likely to tackle transgender rights and union funding in coming years. A 60-vote threshold giving the minority party power to hold up the majority party has forced the Senate over the decades to try to achieve bipartisanship in legislation and presidential appointments. In the final procedural vote that paved the way for  confirmation, three Democratic senators up for re-election in 2018 in states won by Trump last year - Indianas Joe Donnelly, West Virginias Joe Manchin and North Dakotas Heidi Heitkamp - broke with their party and voted with Republicans to bring about a confirmation vote, although they opposed the rule change. A fourth Democrat, Michael Bennet, who represents Gorsuchs home state of Colorado, voted with Republicans on Thursdays first procedural vote to bring debate to a close. But he stuck with fellow Democrats in opposing the final vote to end the filibuster, the one that succeeded following the rule change. Republicans have called Gorsuch superbly qualified and one of the nations most distinguished appellate judges. Democrats accused him of being so conservative as to be outside the judicial mainstream, favoring corporate interests over ordinary Americans in legal opinions, and displaying insufficient independence from Trump. What Republicans did to Obamas nominee Garland was worse than a filibuster, Schumer said. Schumer said Republicans denied the constitutional prerogative of a president with 11 months left in his term. The nuclear option was used by Senator McConnell when he stopped Merrick Garland, Democratic Senator Richard Durbin said  on the Senate floor. What we face today is the fallout. McConnell blamed the escalation of fights over judicial nominees on the Democrats and their opposition starting three decades ago to nominees made by Republican former Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. Experts said eliminating the filibuster for Supreme Court appointments could make it more likely that presidents, with little incentive to choose centrist justices who could attract support from the other party, will pick ideologically extreme nominees in the future. Ending the filibuster also would make it easier for future Supreme Court nominees to be confirmed when the president and Senate leadership belong to the same party. The filibuster in one form or another dates back to the 19th century but assumed its current form in the 1970s.  While Democrats opposed the rule change and accused Republicans of a power grab, it was their party that first resorted to the nuclear option when they controlled the Senate in 2013. In the face of Republican filibusters of Obama appointments, they barred filibusters for executive branch nominees and federal judges aside from Supreme Court justices but still allowed it for Supreme Court nominees and legislation. The Republican-backed rule change maintains the ability to filibuster legislation. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The measure passed in a 64-45 vote over Republican Governor Bruce Rauners opposition to another stopgap spending measure. A six-month temporary budget for the fiscal year that ends June 30 expired on Dec. 31. Illinois is limping towards the end of a second-straight fiscal year without a complete budget due to a stalemate between Rauner and Democrats who control the legislature. The countrys fifth-largest state has been operating on continuing appropriations and court-ordered spending, while its pile of unpaid bills reached nearly $13 billion on Wednesday. The bill would tap money from the states commitment to human services and education assistance funds to direct $258 million to pay for dozens of programs, including senior meals  and crime prevention, and indigent burials. Another $559 million would go to state universities, community colleges, and educational grants for low-income students. The bills sponsor, Democratic State Representative Greg Harris, said the so-called life-line measure would allow social service organizations and state universities to continue to exist. He cited a United Way survey released on Wednesday that showed 69 percent of social service agencies had received no payments or partial payments from the state so far in fiscal 2017, forcing 49 percent of the agencies to reduce services.  He said universities had resorted to program cuts and layoffs. Republican lawmakers contended that passage of a stopgap measure would take the pressure off the legislature to finally pass a full budget. The reality is we dont do things around here without pressure, said Republican State Representative Steven Andersson. The measure will now head to the Senate, which is on break until April 25. A spokesman for Democratic Senate President John Cullerton said the bill would be reviewed. Earlier on Thursday, Rauner voiced opposition to another stopgap budget. Weve been doing that for decades, and its created the crisis and mess were in, he told reporters in Decatur. Thats a failure to do stopgaps. Lets do a balanced budget so the problem is fixed.  After a bipartisan bill package aimed at ending the impasse stalled in the Senate last month, credit rating agencies warned that Illinois credit ratings, the lowest among the 50 states, could sink even lower.

The National Economic Council director, also a former Goldman Sachs (GS.N) president, expressed support to lawmakers for a banking system where firms would focus primarily on trading and underwriting securities or issuing loans. Big banks have strongly opposed such a move that would fundamentally overhaul their business. Reinstating the law, which was repealed in 1999, has not attracted significant attention in Congress, but advocates in the White House and both parties now argue it would provide critical safeguards to prevent another financial crisis. Critics of that approach say it lacks nuance and would not have prevented the last financial meltdown.  The fact Cohn, widely viewed as one of Wall Streets own, was willing to push that position spooked big banks representatives in Washington. The White House confirmed Cohns remarks in a private meeting with lawmakers on Wednesday. A spokesperson said he was simply discussing the Presidents previously stated position in favor of a 21st century Glass-Steagall. Cohn's remarks were first reported by Bloomberg. bloom.bg/2nZK5n1 The Trump administration has indicated support for a return to Glass-Steagall. The White House has stuck by the idea since it was included in the Republican Party platform during the presidential campaign, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin expressed interest in a modernized version of the law. When asked on Thursday when large financial institutions should begin to worry about Glass-Steagall becoming a reality, one industry representative said, Right now. However, any legislation establishing such a firewall faces long odds in the current Congress. The heads of the House and Senate banking committees have indicated support for alternative approaches, and efforts to move Glass-Steagall legislation in prior years have garnered little support. A new Glass-Steagall would require legislation, and it simply isnt a priority issue in Congress, wrote Ian Katz, a financial policy analyst for the research firm Capital Alpha Partners, in a note to clients. In the meeting which was arranged by Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, Cohn was asked by Senator Elizabeth Warren about Glass-Steagall. Cohn responded favorably, noting that the Republican Party platform supports the idea, according to sources familiar with the meeting. The meeting included lawmakers from both parties and their staff. Bringing back Glass Steagall would likely have a significant impact on banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Citigroup (C.N) that have large highly intertwined commercial lending and investment banking operations, say analysts.  It would impact Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) to a lesser degree although, they would likely have to revert to being standalone investment banks and shed their deposit funding.

Devin Nunes, chairman of the House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and an ally of Republican President Donald Trump, characterized charges that he made unauthorized disclosures of classified information as entirely false and politically motivated. Several leftwing activist groups have filed accusations against me with the Office of Congressional Ethics, he said in a statement. The surprise disclosure that Nunes was under investigation injected new uncertainty into the wider Russia probe by his committee. The investigation is one of several in Congress examining whether Russia tried to influence the election in Trumps favor, mostly by hacking Democratic operatives emails and releasing embarrassing information, or possibly by colluding with Trump associates. Russia denies the allegations, which Trump also dismisses. The House Ethics Committee issued a statement saying it would investigate allegations Nunes may have made unauthorized disclosures of classified information in violation of House Rules, law, regulations, or other standards of conduct. Nunes said in a statement he had decided to step aside from the Russia investigation to fight the allegations and wanted to expedite the dismissal of these false claims. He remains committee chairman. Representative Mike Conaway, the second-ranked Republican on the intelligence committee, will now lead the probe. While he was a strong Trump supporter last year, the seven-term congressman was not a member of Trumps transition team, unlike Nunes.  The intelligence panels top Democrat, Representative Adam Schiff, said Nunes decision to step aside was made in the best interests of the committee, and I respect that decision. Schiff had called on Nunes to recuse himself. Conaway, who is also chairman of the House Agriculture Committee and a former House Ethics chairman, is respected as an administrator and investigator. I have great admiration and respect for Mr. Conaway and look forward to continuing to work on that together, Schiff told reporters. Democrats, and some Republicans, had said the House panel risked losing all credibility after Nunes received information at the White House that information about Trump aides had been swept up in routine surveillance, held a news conference and briefed Trump on it - all before sharing it with other members of his committee.  Lawmakers said Nunes decision was welcome. We need to move on. We need to have an independent, credible investigation that makes progress, Representative Eric Swalwell, a Democratic committee member, said in an interview. Trump praised Nunes as honorable, calling both him and Conaway high-quality people in comments to reporters traveling to Florida on Air Force One. The ethics investigation stems from whether Nunes disclosed classified information while publicly discussing the contents of foreign intelligence reports. Jane Harman, a former top House Intelligence Democrat who is now president of the Wilson Center think tank, said she hoped  the committee could overcome the paralysis gripping the investigation. Most people recognize that the House as an institution needs to do serious oversight here and that the House is on trial, she said. House Republican leaders, including Speaker Paul Ryan, praised Nunes. Hes just making sure that as he works through this other (ethics) process and makes sure that people understand he didnt do anything wrong. Hes fully cooperating, and I believe he will be cleared, Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, who leads the House Republican Conference, told reporters. But until that happens, it protects the integrity of the Russia investigation, she said. Trump sparked a controversy in March when he tweeted, without giving evidence, that Obama had wiretapped him as he  competed with Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016. Two and a half weeks later, Nunes held the news conference saying an unidentified source had shown him intelligence reports containing unmasked names of Trump associates incidentally caught up in routine foreign surveillance. Immediately afterward, critics said he had disclosed classified information in what many saw as an effort to provide cover to Trumps wiretapping claim and distract from the wider Russia investigation, a day after FBI Director James Comey confirmed at a hearing that his agency was investigating the matter. Nunes said surveillance of Trump associates appeared legal but expressed concern that Americans names may have been improperly revealed. That allegation kicked off an evolving, unsubstantiated controversy about whether the Obama White House spied on the incoming Trump administration. U.S. foreign intelligence activities are classified, but the president can authorize the release of information about them. It is not clear whether Trump authorized Nunes to discuss the foreign surveillance. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The second-term Republican governor faces a hearing in separate proceedings on Monday that could lead to his eventual impeachment and ouster. The probable cause findings by the Alabama Ethics Commission prompted Republican Del Marsh, the leader of the state Senate, to call on Bentley to step down, local media reported. Marsh said the governor was not able to lead effectively. Bentley faces escalating political fallout over his relationship with a former senior adviser and has been dogged for the past year by questions concerning his potentially inappropriate use of state resources. Asked for a response to Marshs comments, Bentley said in a statement: I have no intentions of resigning and I am looking forward to continuing to work on important issues facing the state. The Alabama House of Representatives Judiciary Committee will begin the impeachment process on Monday, said its chairman, Representative Mike Jones. Its time to put this in front of us, lets address it, and lets get it behind us, Jones said on the floor of the House on Thursday. The committee will make a recommendation to the full House on whether to impeach Bentley. The judiciary committee has been conducting its own investigation apart from the ethics commission and plans to issue a report on Friday. Bentley denies any legal wrongdoing. We think there is not a basis that the governor violated any law, his lawyer, Bill Athanas, told reporters Wednesday night. So the battle goes on. After allegations of a scandal broke last year, Bentley apologized for making inappropriate remarks to married staffer Rebekah Mason, while denying allegations of a physical affair. Mason resigned as questions about the pairs relationship began to dominate Alabama politics. Bentleys wife filed for divorce in August 2015 after 50 years of marriage, citing unspecified problems. Local media said the ethics commission found probable cause that Bentley violated state campaign regulations by accepting a contribution and making a loan to his campaign outside the time frame permitted by law and using campaign funds to pay Masons legal fees. He also may have violated ethics law by using public resources for his personal interest.

Pritzker, heir to the Hyatt Hotels Corp fortune, formally entered a growing Democratic field for Illinois governor on Thursday, labeling Republican Bruce Rauner a failure as the states chief executive. Pritzkers bid pits him against Chicago businessman Chris Kennedy, son of the late U.S. Senator Robert Kennedy, and three other Democratic candidates in the partys March 20, 2018 primary. Governor Bruce Rauner is a failure. He promised a turnaround and all we got was a runaround, Pritzker told supporters at a Chicago Park District gymnasium on the citys crime-prone southside. Illinois, the countrys fifth-largest state, is immersed in one of the most politically turbulent eras in its 199-year history. Rauner has feuded with Democrats, who control the state legislature, over his insistence that a state budget be tied to a list of his policy demands that would weaken unions, impose legislative term limits, freeze property taxes and impose new rules on injured workers seeking compensation from their employers. With House Speaker Michael Madigan and fellow Democrats blocking that agenda, Illinois has been without a complete budget during Rauners first two years in office. The fiscal futility has left Illinois - the only state ever to go 22 months without a budget - with nearly $13 billion of unpaid bills as of Wednesday. Weve got to start by taxing the millionaires and billionaires first. Were not going to middle-class families until we get people to pay their fair share, Pritzker told reporters after his announcement. Pritzker, the 52-year-old brother of former U.S. Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker, is positioned as the wealthiest candidate in the race so far, with a net worth estimated by Forbes at $3.4 billion. Rauner, a former private equity investor, does not appear on the Forbes list, but enters a re-election bid with plentiful resources of his own. Last November, the governor released his 2015 tax returns that showed he and his wife had more than $188 million in taxable income. A month later, he steered $50 million in personal funds into his campaign account, state records show. The state Republican Party attacked Pritzker on Thursday by linking him to the long-serving Democratic House speaker and insisting Pritzker favored a reinstatement of the states 5 percent individual income tax.  In January 2015, the state income tax dropped to 3.75 percent after a temporary 2011 tax increase lapsed. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A leading conservative Republican, who helped block President Donald Trumps healthcare bill, said on Thursday that Congress should begin rigorous debate on tax reform now if it hopes to pass legislation before an August deadline. The quest to revamp the tax code moved to the top of Trumps legislative agenda after a Republican push to repeal and replace President Barack Obamas signature healthcare law failed in the House of Representatives on March 24 in a humiliating defeat for the president and his party. To tackle the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code since the Reagan era quickly, House Republicans need to avoid the political fault lines that sank their healthcare bill, partly by having conservatives on board. House Republicans hope to vote on a tax reform bill before they leave for summer recess at the end of July. We can get it done before August as long as we are real serious about having real debate... debate has to be about changing policy, said Representative Mark Meadows, chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, a group of about three-dozen staunchly conservative lawmakers. Im optimistic on tax reform, if we do it differently than we did healthcare, he told a forum hosted by Politico. Freedom Caucus members complained that House Republican leaders held no healthcare hearings this year before legislation was introduced and kept their bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act under wraps until just before it was introduced. Meadows said the tax reform debate boils down to a decision between a controversial border adjustment tax plan backed by House Speaker Paul Ryan and deficit-funded reforms. He did not take a position on Thursday but recently said his group could support reforms that are not revenue neutral. We need to go ahead and start having those discussions today. Lets look at legislative text, he said. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady plans to hold public hearings on tax reform issues in coming weeks. On Thursday, Brady offered no indication that legislation was imminent but said he understood the need for rank-and-file members to have input. We continue to work toward spring action from the Ways and Means Committee and continue to work to get this done in 2017, Brady told reporters. One lesson we learned in the healthcare debate is that members of Congress want plenty of time, not just to review the bill but to have input into tax reform.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) executive and White House adviser Gary Cohn shocked more than a few of his former Wall Street colleagues this week when he showed support for reinstating a Depression-era law that would break up the biggest U.S. banks. Here are some details about the law, called the Glass-Steagall Act, and why it has returned to the spotlight: WHAT IS GLASS-STEAGALL: Originally passed as part of the U.S. Banking Act of 1933, Glass-Steagall established a firewall between commercial and investment banking activity. The law was whittled away over time as banks gained permission to engage in more trading activity, and was repealed altogether in 1999 with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. WHO SUPPORTS IT?: Since the 2008 financial crisis, Glass-Steagall has become a calling card for politicians eager to crack down on Wall Street. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren frequently invokes it, and Senator Bernie Sanders made it a major part of his presidential campaign. President Donald Trump also seized on the policy during his campaign. WHAT DOES THE WHITE HOUSE SAY?: The Trump administration has not backed away from his campaign stance, but there are questions about how aggressively the president will push for a new law. The issue only tends to come up when officials are asked about it. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he supported a modern version of Glass-Steagall in response to a question during his confirmation hearing. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the White House supports the proposal when asked by reporters. Cohn responded favorably when asked by Warren at a private meeting with senators. WHAT WOULD A NEW GLASS-STEAGALL LOOK LIKE?: There are number of ideas to create what some refer to as a 21st Century Glass-Steagall. Warren has proposed splitting commercial and investment banking, and also barring depository institutions from using modern financial instruments like derivatives. Thomas Hoenig, the vice chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, has proposed a similar split, and would subject banks to a higher, 10 percent capital requirement. Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, would force big banks to take on so much capital they would prefer to split into smaller institutions. COULD IT HAPPEN?: Although many Wall Street critics have seized on Glass-Steagall, efforts to change the law have garnered very little support. Warrens proposal received just a handful of legislative co-sponsors. And because Congress and the White House are still consumed with complex fights over health care and tax reform, there seems to be little appetite for a broad, controversial overhaul of the financial system. ARE THERE RISKS FOR BANKS?: Big U.S. lenders including JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Citigroup (C.N) would be most impacted, because their commercial lending and investment banking operations are closely intertwined, say analysts. Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) might be less impacted, although they would likely have to revert to being standalone investment banks and shed their deposit funding. But even if Glass-Steagall does not become law, the industry may have to spend money, time and energy lobbying against the idea, when they would rather focus on rolling back existing rules.

The U.S. government trade lender has been hobbled for the better part of two years by conservative Republicans in Congress who tried to shut it down in 2015 by revoking its charter, and then limited its lending powers last year by blocking nominations to its board of directors. With only two active members on its five-seat board, the bank cannot make or guarantee loans over $10 million, preventing it from financing large exports such as U.S.-built commercial aircraft, nuclear reactors or petrochemical plants. Thus far, Trump administration officials have not said publicly whether they support reviving EXIMs full lending powers, but some members of Congress say that Trump has told them privately that he supports the institution. The bank is part of a domestically focused trade toolbox that this administration will continue to focus on in the coming months, Ross said in brief video remarks to EXIMs annual conference in Washington. We will use that toolbox to rebalance our trade policy in order to put American workers first. Ross did not provide details of how EXIM will be used in his trade strategy or whether the administration has specific plans to nominate new board members. He urged hundreds of U.S. manufacturers, lenders and foreign government and company officials attending the meeting to work towards increasing U.S. exports to create jobs. U.S. Representative Chris Collins of New York, a Republican Trump ally who headed a small manufacturer that used EXIM working capital loan guarantees in the past, told the conference that Trump told him on Feb. 16 at a White House meeting that he was all in on supporting EXIM. We asked him very directly about the five board seats, Collins said. The president looked to his right and to his left and said Can you get me some names? Im all in. There was no hesitation whatsoever. Reviving EXIM, however, would anger conservative groups backed by the Koch brothers, the influential billionaire Republican donors. The groups have waged a campaign that has painted EXIM as unnecessary corporate welfare even though it is self-funding through the interest and fees it charges borrowers.

With taxes at the top of Republican priorities, the two groups, backed by the wealthy Koch brothers, reported that seven states won by President Donald Trump in Novembers election would be among the 10 hardest hit by the proposal. Freedom Partners and Americans for Prosperity, both based in the Washington area, said the border adjustment tax, or BAT, would harm all 50 states, but that those heavily dependent on imports could suffer most. The report predicted economic harm to Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas - all states Trump won in the 2016 presidential election. The list of hard-hit states also includes California, New Jersey and Illinois, which were carried by Democrat Hillary Clinton. The study was sharply criticized by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, a Texas Republican who intends to include the BAT in tax reform legislation this spring. That so-called study will be easily discredited and probably fits the definition of fake news, Brady told reporters. It takes one provision, pretends the economy freezes ... applies it in our current tax code and comes up with fantasy figures. BAT, billed as a way to boost U.S. manufacturing, would exempt export revenues from federal tax, while ending the deductibility of import costs by corporations, making imports for production or resale costlier. The plan is part of a tax reform blueprint supported by House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan. Trump is also working on a tax plan. Billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch have funded both groups behind the study. The Kochs exert strong financial and ideological influence on the Republican Party. Opposition to BAT from the Kochs and import-dependent industries suggests a rocky road ahead for Trumps stated priority of tax reform. The proposal is also opposed by a number of Senate Republicans who could prevent its passage, should the House approve a tax reform bill that contains it.  Koch organizations, including the brothers privately held conglomerate Koch Industries, have warned that BAT could devastate the U.S. economy by raising prices on consumer goods, including gasoline. Refineries owned by Koch Industries rely on oil imports from Canada. The Koch groups say they support tax reform but oppose BAT.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

In an April 5 letter that Reuters saw on Thursday, the lawmakers told Trump, a Republican, that killing the rule could harm more than 2 million Americans who would otherwise benefit from city-run retirement plans. We ask you to work with us to increase access to retirement savings programs and promote greater retirement security, they wrote. The senators signing the letter are Patty Murray of Washington and Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrats on committees overseeing pensions and tax matters; Maria Cantwell of Washington; Kirsten Gillibrand of New York; and Robert Casey of Pennsylvania. The resolution on city-run retirement plans is one of 13 measures that Congress has passed to repeal rules enacted under previous president Barack Obama, a Democrat. An obscure law called the Congressional Review Act gives Congress a tool to repeal regulations that it finds objectionable. All that is required is a simple majority vote in both chambers and the presidents signature. The law is limited, however, in how it can be used. Only rules that were finalized within 60 legislative days are eligible for repeal. Trump has signed 11 of the 13 resolutions so far.  The White House Office of Management and Budget has advised Trump to sign the city-run retirement plan measure, and a White House official said on Wednesday that the president would sign more resolutions this month.  The Labor Department adopted two rules at the end of Obamas tenure that exempted both city and state-run retirement plans from the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA, a law designed to protect workers savings. The plans are geared toward private-sector workers whose employers do not offer 401(k) or other retirement benefits, and would let them enroll automatically in plans like those being introduced in places like California. Cities and states say they need the exemption for the plans to work effectively, but trade groups like the Chamber of Commerce and Investment Company Institute want it repealed amid concerns that workers would not have adequate pension protections. The resolution to repeal the city-run retirement plan rule narrowly passed the Senate in a 50-49 vote.  The Senate is expected to take up a separate resolution to repeal the rule on state-run retirement plans after the Easter recess. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, the committees chairman, said he hoped the nomination of Robert Lighthizer for the administrations top trade negotiating job could be taken up after Congress two-week Easter break ends on April 24.     Senate confirmation of Lighthizers nomination has been delayed partly by demands from Democrats that the Finance Committee first advance a bill aimed at protecting retired coal miners pensions and health care benefits. Only one Democrat, Senator Ron Wyden, showed up for the start of the panels meeting on Thursday. Also contributing to delays were questions over whether Lighthizer, a veteran trade lawyer and Reagan-era deputy USTR, needs a congressional waiver from a 1995 law prohibiting USTR candidates from working on behalf of foreign governments. After leaving USTR but well before that law was passed, Lighthizer did some work for Brazils agriculture department in the late 1980s and assisted a law firm colleague who was advising a Chinese electronics industry group in the early 1990s.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Republican-backed Senate rule change expected on Thursday could make it more likely that presidents will pick ideologically extreme U.S. Supreme Court nominees with little incentive to choose centrist justices, experts said. With a deep partisan divide in Washington, Democrats are using a procedural tactic called a filibuster to try to block confirmation of President Donald Trumps Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch in the Republican-led Senate. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has threatened to change long-standing rules in the 100-seat Senate if the Democrats succeed with the filibuster in order to prohibit the tactic against Supreme Court nominees. That would mean such nominees could be confirmed by a simple majority rather than needing to first muster a 60-vote super-majority. Experts said the rule change, called the nuclear option, could produce an ever-more ideologically polarized Supreme Court. Over the years with the Senate narrowly divided, the filibuster rule has meant that presidents have needed to make appointments who could win at least a few votes from the other party. For the court, the prospect of a filibuster has shaped the way presidents pick nominees, said Stephen Wermiel, a Supreme Court scholar at the American University Washington College of Law. Although it has not been widely used, the idea that it was there as a deterrent to presidents appointing justices who might be considered extreme has been a significant factor, Wermiel said.  Republican Senator John McCain, a defender of Senate traditions, warned of the consequences of the rule change, though he said he would reluctantly support the move. We will see more and more nominees from the extremes of both left and right, McCain said. I do not see how that will ensure a fair and impartial judiciary. In fact, I think the opposite will be true, and Americans will no longer be confident of equal protection under the law. Republican Senator Lindsay Graham said Supreme Court  nominees are going to be more ideological, not less with the rule change, which he warily supported. The nuclear option would erase the last shred of bipartisanship in the Senate confirmation process, said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, who led the filibuster against Gorsuch. Elimination of the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees could matter most with the next vacancy on the nine-seat court after Gorsuch, who was nominated by Trump to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last year. Three current justices are 78 or older: liberal Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 84; conservative Anthony Kennedy, who sometimes sides with the courts liberals in big cases, is 80; and liberal Stephen Breyer is 78. Having more justices who are ideologically extreme would make compromise among them harder and lead to rulings the public may view as based more on a political agenda than the law, said University of Massachusetts, Amherst political science professor Paul Collins, co-author of a book on Supreme Court confirmation hearings.  If confirmed as expected on Friday, Gorsuch would restore the courts 5-4 conservative majority. Overturning the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion nationwide may become more likely if there is no filibuster to moderate the choice of future court nominees, Wermiel said. Without a filibuster, a future Democratic president with a Democratic-led Senate could feel free to name a justice from the dogmatic left. The result would be a court even more polarized than the current one already is perceived to be, said Brookings Institution think tank expert Russell Wheeler said. An ideologically-driven administration would eschew middle-of-the-road judges, Wheeler said. They would stack the court with ideological soulmates. Trump advisor Leonard Leo said the best way to avoid extreme nominees is through the electoral process. Trump made it clear during the 2016 presidential campaign he would pick from a list of potential Supreme Court nominees that he made public, and the voters elected Trump, Leo said.  People knew or should have known what they were getting when he was elected president, Leo said.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump removed his chief strategist Steve Bannon from the National Security Council on Wednesday, reversing his controversial decision early this year to give a political adviser an unprecedented role in security discussions. Trumps overhaul of the NSC, confirmed by a White House official, also elevated General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Dan Coats, the director of National Intelligence who heads all 17 U.S. intelligence agencies. The official said the change moves the NSC back to its core function of what its supposed to do. It also appears to mark a victory for national security adviser H.R. McMaster, who had told some national security experts he felt he was in a battle to the death with Bannon and others on the White House staff. Vice President Mike Pence said Bannon would continue to play an important role in policy and played down the shake-up as routine. This is just a natural evolution to ensure the National Security Council is organized in a way that best serves the president in resolving and making those difficult decisions, Pence said on Fox News.  Bannon said in a statement he had succeeded in returning the NSC back to its traditional role of coordinating foreign policy rather than running it. He cited President Barack Obamas national security adviser, Susan Rice, for why he advocated a change. Susan Rice operationalized the NSC during the last administration so I was put on NSC to ensure it was de-operationalized. General McMaster has NSC back to its proper function, he said. Trumps White House team has grappled with infighting and intrigue that has hobbled his young presidency. In recent days, several other senior U.S. foreign policy and national security officials have said the mechanisms for shaping the Trump administrations response to pressing challenges such as Syria, North Korea and Iran still were not in place.  Critics of Bannons role on the NSC said it gave too much weight in decision-making to someone who lacked foreign policy expertise. Bannon, who was chief executive of Trumps presidential campaign in the months leading to his election in November, in some respects represents Trumps America First nationalistic voice, helping fuel his anti-Washington fervor and pushing for the president to part ways at times with mainstream Republicans. Before joining the Trump administration, Bannon headed Breitbart News, a right-wing website. U.S. Representative Adam Schiff, ranking Democrat on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, called the shift in the NSC a positive step that will help McMaster gain control over a body that was being politicized by Bannons involvement. As the administrations policy over North Korea, China, Russia and Syria continues to drift, we can only hope this shake-up brings some level of strategic vision to the body, he said. Bannons removal from the NSC was a potential setback for his sphere of influence in the Trump White House, where he has a voice in most major decisions. But a Trump confidant said Bannon remained as influential as ever. He is still involved in everything and still has the full confidence of the president but to be fair he can only do so much stuff, the confidant said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The White House official said Bannon was no longer needed on the NSC after the departure of Trumps first national security adviser, Michael Flynn. Flynn was forced to resign on Feb. 13 over his contacts with Russias ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kislyak, prior to Trump taking office on Jan. 20. The official said Bannon had been placed on the NSC originally as a check on Flynn and had only attended one of the NSCs regular meetings. The official dismissed questions about a power struggle between Bannon and McMaster, saying they shared the same world view. However, two current national security officials rejected the White House explanation, noting that two months have passed since Flynns departure. McMaster, they said, speaking on the condition of anonymity, also has dueled with Bannon and others over direct access to Trump; the future of deputy national security adviser K.T. McFarland, a former Fox News commentator; intelligence director Ezra Cohen-Watnick, a Flynn appointee; and other staffing decisions. Trump is preparing for his first face-to-face meeting on Thursday and Friday with Chinese President Xi Jinping with the threat of North Koreas nuclear and missile programs a key component of their talks. Bannons seat on the NSCs principals committee, a group that includes the secretaries of state, defense and other ranking aides, was taken by Rick Perry, who as energy secretary is charged with overseeing the U.S. nuclear weapons arsenal.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans are poised to repeal a U.S. Senate rule that allows minority-party Democrats to block confirmation of Supreme Court nominees, including President Donald Trumps choice of Neil Gorsuch for the lifetime post. The expected rule change, amid deepening partisanship in a chamber known as the worlds greatest deliberative body, is raising questions over whether there could be a future move to prohibit filibusters on legislation. Here is how the filibuster has been used and what curtailing it could mean: It is a procedural move, often by a minority of senators, to block legislation or Supreme Court nominations that typically enjoy the support of majority-party senators, in this case, Republicans. According to Senate historians, filibuster comes from a Dutch word meaning pirate. The practice became popular in the 1850s and was also used by House of Representatives members, until that body became so large with an expanding U.S. population as to require stricter rules governing floor debates. Senate Democrats have gathered more than the 41 votes they need in the 100-seat chamber to mount a filibuster against Gorsuch, a conservative appeals court judge. The first U.S. president is said to have observed that the Senate was created to cool legislation from the hot-tempered House just as a saucer was used to cool hot tea. The filibuster is just such a coolant. When a bill or Supreme Court nomination hits the Senate floor, senators who oppose it can talk until at least 60 senators band together to limit debate. That gives a minority of senators huge power. If a bill or a nomination fails to draw the needed 60 votes, it is effectively killed. The all-time record for a Senate filibuster speech - 24 hours, 18 minutes - was set by the late segregationist Senator Strom Thurmond, who tried unsuccessfully in 1957 to kill a civil rights bill. This week, Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley delivered the eighth-longest speech, against Gorsuch, that was 15 hours, 26 minutes. It is Senate slang for banning filibusters through a rules change by the majority party. In recent years, as filibusters have added to Senate gridlock, there have been threats to execute the nuclear option. Groups of senators, known as gangs, have sometimes defused the threats. In 2013, Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid deployed the nuclear option when he became fed up with Republican filibusters against then-President Barack Obamas nominees. He changed Senate rules to ban filibusters against the presidents judicial and executive-branch nominees but left it in place for Supreme Court appointees. Now, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, is thought to be ready to expand the ban to Supreme Court nominees. McConnell has told reporters he will not broaden the ban on filibusters to legislation and does not believe Republican senators would want to do that. Some political scientists think Democrats have more to gain than Republicans by ending filibusters on legislation. My sense has always been that Democratic policy priorities have suffered more from the filibuster than Republican priorities, said George Washington University political science professor Sarah Binder. That is because Democrats are more likely than Republicans to back an expansion of government programs, which generally requires legislation. But Binder said she could imagine Democrats or Republicans trying to score a major win on an issue central to their constituencies. For Democrats: No filibuster could mean trying to pass another major healthcare or campaign finance reform or new gun controls. For Republicans: Some sort of major deregulation of an industry or changes to entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid.

The Senate vote, expected at 11 a.m. (1500 GMT), is a bid by Republican leaders to try to end a Democratic procedural effort called a filibuster aimed at blocking Gorsuchs confirmation to a lifetime post on the court. Republicans were expected to fall short of being able to halt the filibuster, but have said they have the votes needed to change long-standing Senate rules to prohibit such a procedure against Supreme Court nominees. Republicans said Gorsuch would be confirmed on Friday one way or the other. Senate confirmation of Gorsuch, 49, would reinstate the nine-member courts conservative majority, allowing Trump to leave an indelible mark on Americas highest judicial body and fulfill a top campaign promise by the Republican president. There is still time for them to support a nominee who even longtime Democrats have praised, or at the very least, do not block him with the first successful partisan filibuster in American history, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said of the Democrats on Wednesday. During Senate debate on Wednesday, various Republicans called the conservative Colorado-based federal appeals court judge incredibly qualified, an intellectual heavyweight and always true to the law. Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer indicated, however, that Democrats intended to follow through on their filibuster pledge, having gathered more than the 41 votes they need to mount the effort. A filibuster requires a super-majority of 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate to proceed to a simple majority vote on a Supreme Court nominee or legislation. Republicans control the Senate 52-48. We Democrats believe the answer isnt to change the rules, its to change the nominee, as presidents of both parties have done when a nominee fails to earn confirmation, Schumer said on the Senate floor. Democrats accuse Gorsuch of being so conservative as to be outside the judicial mainstream, favoring corporate interests over ordinary Americans in legal opinions, and displaying insufficient independence from Trump. They are also angry that Senate Republicans last year refused to consider former Democratic President Barack Obamas nomination of appellate judge Merrick Garland to replace conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February 2016, the same seat Gorsuch has been named to fill. The rule change, which requires a simple majority, has been dubbed the nuclear option, and Trump has encouraged McConnell to go nuclear. Ending the filibuster would make it easier for future Supreme Court nominees to be confirmed when the president and Senate leadership belong to the same party. Republican Senator John McCain, known as a defender of Senate traditions, offered reluctant support for the rule change, but said it would likely lead to judicial nominees from the extremes of both left and right. The 60-vote threshold that gives the minority party power to hold up the majority party has forced the Senate over the decades to try to achieve bipartisanship in legislation and presidential appointments.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Republican-backed Senate rule change expected on Thursday could make it more likely that presidents will pick ideologically extreme U.S. Supreme Court nominees with little incentive to choose centrist justices, experts said. With a deep partisan divide in Washington, Democrats are using a procedural tactic called a filibuster to try to block confirmation of President Donald Trumps Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch in the Republican-led Senate. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has threatened to change long-standing rules in the 100-seat Senate if the Democrats succeed with the filibuster in order to prohibit the tactic against Supreme Court nominees. That would mean such nominees could be confirmed by a simple majority rather than needing to first muster a 60-vote super-majority. Experts said the rule change, called the nuclear option, could produce an ever-more ideologically polarized Supreme Court. Over the years with the Senate narrowly divided, the filibuster rule has meant that presidents have needed to make appointments who could win at least a few votes from the other party. For the court, the prospect of a filibuster has shaped the way presidents pick nominees, said Stephen Wermiel, a Supreme Court scholar at the American University Washington College of Law. Although it has not been widely used, the idea that it was there as a deterrent to presidents appointing justices who might be considered extreme has been a significant factor, Wermiel said.  Republican Senator John McCain, a defender of Senate traditions, warned of the consequences of the rule change, though he said he would reluctantly support the move. We will see more and more nominees from the extremes of both left and right, McCain said. I do not see how that will ensure a fair and impartial judiciary. In fact, I think the opposite will be true, and Americans will no longer be confident of equal protection under the law. Republican Senator Lindsay Graham said Supreme Court  nominees are going to be more ideological, not less with the rule change, which he warily supported. The nuclear option would erase the last shred of bipartisanship in the Senate confirmation process, said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, who led the filibuster against Gorsuch. Elimination of the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees could matter most with the next vacancy on the nine-seat court after Gorsuch, who was nominated by Trump to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last year. Three current justices are 78 or older: liberal Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 84; conservative Anthony Kennedy, who sometimes sides with the courts liberals in big cases, is 80; and liberal Stephen Breyer is 78. Having more justices who are ideologically extreme would make compromise among them harder and lead to rulings the public may view as based more on a political agenda than the law, said University of Massachusetts, Amherst political science professor Paul Collins, co-author of a book on Supreme Court confirmation hearings.  If confirmed as expected on Friday, Gorsuch would restore the courts 5-4 conservative majority. Overturning the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion nationwide may become more likely if there is no filibuster to moderate the choice of future court nominees, Wermiel said. Without a filibuster, a future Democratic president with a Democratic-led Senate could feel free to name a justice from the dogmatic left. The result would be a court even more polarized than the current one already is perceived to be, said Brookings Institution think tank expert Russell Wheeler said. An ideologically-driven administration would eschew middle-of-the-road judges, Wheeler said. They would stack the court with ideological soulmates. Trump advisor Leonard Leo said the best way to avoid extreme nominees is through the electoral process. Trump made it clear during the 2016 presidential campaign he would pick from a list of potential Supreme Court nominees that he made public, and the voters elected Trump, Leo said.  People knew or should have known what they were getting when he was elected president, Leo said.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Democratic senator delivered a 15-1/2-hour, all-night speech denouncing President Donald Trumps U.S. Supreme Court nominee on Wednesday, joining an effort to block Senate confirmation of Neil Gorsuch in a heated political showdown with Republicans. Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon began his speech on the Senate floor on Tuesday evening and wrapped up mid-morning on Wednesday. The Senate was expected to vote on Thursday at 11 a.m. to try to end a Democratic procedural effort called a filibuster aimed at blocking Gorsuchs confirmation to a lifetime post on the court. Republicans were expected to fall short of being able to halt the filibuster, but said they had the votes needed to then immediately change the Senate rules to prohibit filibusters against Supreme Court nominees. Republicans said Gorsuch would  be confirmed on Friday one way or the other. Senate confirmation of Gorsuch, 49, would reinstate the courts conservative majority, allow Trump to leave an indelible mark on Americas highest judicial body and fulfill a top campaign promise by the Republican president. Toward the end of his marathon speech, Merkley looked weary, his suit jacket unbuttoned and his yellow tie billowing out. He stood beside an easel holding graphics that an aide would periodically adjust. For the first time in U.S. history, a seat has been stolen from one president and delivered to another in a court-packing scheme. If that were to succeed, it would set a precedent that will haunt the court for decades to come, Merkley said. He noted that the Republicans who control the Senate refused last year to consider former Democratic President Barack Obamas nomination of appellate judge Merrick Garland to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February 2016, the same seat Gorsuch now has been named to fill. Later on the Senate floor, Republican Senator Cory Gardner countered that such an argument amounted to advocating that two wrongs must make a right. Merkley criticized Gorsuchs legal opinions and said Gorsuch would become a conservative legal activist on the court. At one point, Merkley read a 1998 speech by one of the past giants of the Senate, Democrat Robert Byrd, decrying partisanship in Congress.  I believe that the American people are more than tired of partisan warfare. I believe they wish for less of it from Congress, especially in the Senate, where more statesmanship and a longer view are expected, Merkley said, quoting Byrd. The Senate has a lengthy history of long speeches, including notable ones in recent years by Senators Ted Cruz, Chris Murphy and Rand Paul. The Senate Historical Office listed Merkleys speech at 15 hours and 26 minutes, the eighth longest in Senate history. The longest came in 1957 when segregationist Senator Strom Thurmond spoke for 24 hours and 18 minutes against legislation, later enacted, protecting black voting rights. On the second day of formal Senate debate on Gorsuchs  nomination, various Republicans called the conservative Colorado-based federal appeals court judge incredibly qualified, an intellectual heavyweight and always true to the law. Democrats are bowing to hard-left special interests that cant get over the results of the election and thus are demanding complete Democratic opposition to everything this president touches, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said. Democrats accuse Gorsuch of being so conservative as to be outside the judicial mainstream, favoring corporate interests over ordinary Americans in legal opinions, and displaying insufficient independence from Trump. Republicans control the Senate 52-48. The rule change, which requires a simple majority, has been dubbed the nuclear option, and Trump has urged McConnell to go nuclear. A filibuster requires a super-majority of 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate in order to proceed to a simple majority vote on a Supreme Court nominee or legislation. The 60-vote super-majority threshold empowers the minority party to hold up the majority party and has forced the Senate over the decades to try to achieve bipartisanship on legislation and presidential appointments. Republican Senator John McCain, known as a defender of Senate traditions, offered reluctant support for the rule change, but said it likely would lead to judicial nominees from the extremes of both left and right. What we are about to do at the end of this week will have tremendous consequences, and I fear that some day we will regret what were about to do. In fact, Im confident we will, McCain said on the Senate floor. The White House denied on Wednesday that Gorsuch had engaged in plagiarism after media reports accused him of copying some language and failing to cite relevant sources in his 2006 book about assisted suicide and euthanasia. There is only one explanation for this baseless, last-second smear of Judge Gorsuch: those desperate to justify the unprecedented filibuster of a well-qualified and mainstream nominee to the Supreme Court, White House spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement.

Trump also said in an interview with the New York Times he may move up the unveiling of a plan to rebuild the countrys deteriorating roads, bridges and tunnels, which had been expected later this year. Im thinking about accelerating it. Im thinking about putting it with another bill. Could be health care, could be something else. Could be tax reform, Trump said. Trump was stung by his first legislative push, a failed attempt to roll back former President Barack Obamas healthcare law, which ended in an embarrassing collapse in Congress two weeks ago. The White House has tried to revive healthcare talks while also seeking other legislative measures - such as tax reform - that could give Trump a win in the early part of his presidency. U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said last week the Trump administration would later this year unveil a $1 trillion, 10-year plan to modernize U.S. roads, bridges, airports, electrical grid and water systems, offering incentives for public-private partnerships. Trump said he wanted to accelerate that roll-out, but provided no timeline. Trump said Democratic lawmakers are desperate for infrastructure and may be more likely to sign on to a Republican-backed tax reform or healthcare bill if spending on roads and bridges were included. Were talking about a trillion-dollar infrastructure, Trump said. Some of the infrastructure projects may be built through public-private partnerships, Trump said, declining to say how the total spending would split between public and private sources. But he also said that with interest rates low, the government may be better off financing the projects itself. When you can borrow so inexpensively, you dont have to do the public-private thing. Because public-private can be very expensive, Trump said. Trump said he would make an announcement in two weeks about whether he would seek changes to a wage law for federal projects blamed by conservative groups for inflating costs, though he declined to say what the announcement would be.  Conservative groups have pressured the White House on the law, known as the Davis-Bacon Act, which requires contractors on federal projects to pay local prevailing wages - a measure backed by labor unions and Democrats. On tax reform, Trump said he wanted to wait and see what happens on healthcare legislation, which has stalled in the House of Representatives, before setting out details on taxes. The details of the healthcare bill could determine how much he could cut taxes, he said. Republicans have been working on a plan to cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, end taxing foreign profits for U.S.-based multinationals and cut other tax rates for businesses and investors - as well as simplify and cut personal income taxes.

In a 74-39 vote, the states House of Representatives passed legislation that shifts the burden of proof from defendants to prosecutors when the law is invoked to avoid trial. The measure now returns to the state Senate, which last month approved its own version of the bill. Both chambers are controlled by Republicans. Floridas stand your ground law, passed in 2005, received wide scrutiny and inspired similar laws in other states. It removed the legal responsibility to retreat from a dangerous situation and allowed use deadly force when a person felt greatly threatened. Opponents say the measures will embolden gun owners to shoot first, citing the 2012 death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida, which spurred national protests and the Black Lives Matter movement. The neighborhood watchman who killed him, George Zimmerman, was acquitted of murder after the law was included in jury instructions. Wednesdays House vote on changing the law followed party lines. Supporters, including the National Rifle Association, the powerful U.S. gun lobby, see the legislation as bolstering a civilians right to quell an apparent threat. This bill is trying to put the burden of proof where it belongs, on the state, because all people are innocent before being proven guilty, said the Republican sponsor of the bill, Representative Bobby Payne. Floridas law did not specify the process for applying stand your ground immunity. State courts established the current protocol, which calls for a pre-trial hearing before a judge and puts the burden of proof on the defendant. Most of those speaking in the House debate were Democrats who said the bill would lead to more violence. Who will speak for the voiceless victims, silenced by an aggressor who claims he wasnt an aggressor but is protected by a flawed law? said Democrat Representative Bobby Dubose. While public defenders support the changes to the law, the Florida Prosecuting Attorneys Association and gun control advocates oppose them.  Every battery case, every domestic violence case, every use of force case, as a matter of routine, defense attorneys will now request hearings, said Phil Archer, a state attorney.

The plan for hearings emerged during an hour-long meeting between House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady and 15 panel Democrats, according to a House Democratic aide.  There were no details about when the hearings would occur, what tax reform issues would be addressed or whether the full Ways and Means Committee would preside.  We had a positive and open discussion, and I appreciated the opportunity to engage in a two-way dialogue, Brady, a Texas Republican, said in a statement afterward.  The Republican-led committee is expected to unveil tax reform legislation this spring in preparation for a summer vote on the House floor. Committee staff have been working to craft a bill based on a House Republican blueprint that would sharply cut taxes for businesses and individuals. House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Wednesday that the House, Senate and White House, all controlled by Republicans, arent on the same page yet on tax reform. Brady announced the bipartisan meeting earlier this week, saying the discussion would focus on ways to simplify the U.S. tax code for individuals and prevent U.S. companies from moving production and research facilities overseas - two Republican objectives.  It was clear from this meeting we share the same fundamental goals on tax reform, particularly as it relates to growth and simplicity, a Republican committee aide said. Brady underscored his intention to include a border adjustment tax provision in tax reform legislation, aides said. The policy, which would impose a 20 percent tax on imports, has divided the business community and drawn criticism from Republicans in the House and Senate.  Wednesdays meeting marked the first time Brady sat down with the committees Democratic members to discuss the House Republican tax reform plan, aides said. But the bipartisan atmosphere was jarred by the release of a letter from committee Republicans to President Donald Trump, calling for the removal of John Koskinen as Internal Revenue Service commissioner. Koskinen was appointed by former Democratic President Barack Obama. Democrats raised this letter with Republicans during the meeting, noting how this type of partisan action hurts the prospects for bipartisanship in other issues, such as working together on issues like tax reform, the Democratic aide said.

Led by New York state, the coalition said the administration has a legal duty to regulate emissions of the gases scientists believe cause global climate change. The law is clear: the EPA must limit carbon pollution from power plants, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement announcing the challenge.  Trump signed an executive order last week targeting climate change regulations ushered in by former President Barack Obama, saying they hinder U.S. energy production and jobs without providing meaningful environmental benefits.  The orders main target was Obamas Clean Power Plan, a law that would require states to slash carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, but which was never implemented because it was challenged in court by 26 Republican-led states. Trumps order directed the Environmental Protection Agency to review the regulation to decide whether to suspend, rescind, or revise it. Shortly after, EPA filed a legal motion asking the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to delay ongoing court proceedings on the regulation to allow for the review. The New York-led coalitions motion on Wednesday asked the court to throw out the EPAs request to delay court proceedings, saying the delay would waste the substantial resources already expended in this litigation. This case is ripe for decision now, and nothing that EPA has proposed to do obviates the need for this courts review, according to the statement.

We are going to go home tomorrow without a deal, Congressman Chris Collins, a Republican moderate in the U.S. House of Representatives, told reporters.   A White House ally, Collins said days of negotiations have broken down over conservative demands to allow states to waive popular Obamacare policies that protect sick people from price discrimination and allow young adults to stay on their parents healthcare plans until age 26. He said the hard-line conservative House Freedom Caucus was moving the goal posts for negotiations, risking potential support from moderate Republicans.   Both sides of the debate have warned that the Republican push for healthcare reform, one of President Donald Trumps top campaign promises, could lose momentum if lawmakers left this week without a deal to bridge fissures that led to the legislations failure on March 24, when House Speaker Paul Ryan canceled a vote. Earlier on Wednesday, Heritage Action Chief Executive Mike Needham told reporters his conservative group was looking at ways to target House moderates known as the Tuesday Group, with attack ads in their districts and other tactics. But Ryan told a forum that the discussions had been very productive and emphasized that Republican leaders have not set a deadline for agreement. We can keep working this for weeks now, Ryan said. Weve got time to figure this out.    Republicans have been railing against President Barack Obamas Affordable Care Act since its enactment in 2010.

The legislation has not yet emerged, despite talks with Republican lawmakers led by Vice President Mike Pence. A House Republican leadership aide said on Wednesday that plans remained on track for the divided chamber to begin a more than two-week recess by mid-afternoon on Thursday. Representative Mark Meadows, chairman of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, late on Tuesday said, Theres a concern on my part that if were making real progress, that going home sends the wrong message.  Meadows told reporters on Wednesday he had not yet heard from the White House about timing of the next negotiation session. Still, the negotiations will allow lawmakers to return to their home districts and tell voters they are trying to deliver on a campaign promise that helped them win election. In an interview with Axios and NBC television, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Republicans will produce a healthcare bill, but did not provide a timetable. Late on Tuesday, following a closed-door meeting with House Republicans, Pence told reporters there was good talk, good progress toward a bill. He did not elaborate. Republican lawmakers have said efforts are focused on maintaining Obamacares essential health benefits, such as mental health coverage and maternity care. But states could apply for waivers if they could improve coverage and reduce costs.

Even after seeing images of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abes back-slapping sessions with Trump at Mar-a-Lago in February, Chinese officials thought the oceanfront, Spanish-style club in Palm Beach, Florida, lacked the symbolic significance of the White House itself. They thought, no, it has to be the White House, the symbolism of that, a senior administration official told Reuters. They were ultimately convinced that this was worth doing. Its unusual because most foreigners realize that being invited to the presidents personal place is a big deal. Trump and Xi are to hold their first summit encounter beginning on Thursday at Mar-a-Lago, a property that original owner Marjorie Merriweather Posts estate willed to the U.S. government for use as a diplomatic and presidential retreat after her death in 1973.     Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters in Beijing that the Chinese side was fine with having the meeting there. President Trump, after taking office, announced that Mar-a-Lago would be the winter White House. The U.S. proposal to hold the U.S.-China heads of state meeting there, I think, represents the importance that the U.S. side places on this meeting. China respects the U.S. sides arrangements, she said. No matter where the heads of state meet, the most important thing is to develop China-U.S. relations and make contributions to both countries and the world, she said. Topping the agenda at Mar-a-Lago will be U.S.-China trade ties and U.S. requests for China to help rein in its nuclear-armed neighbor North Korea.  Trump bought the estate in 1985 and turned it into an exclusive club, which now boasts a membership fee of $200,000 and is a haven for the tony Palm Beach set who pull up to the gate in Bentleys and Rolls-Royces.             Its a place where he feels comfortable and at home, and where he can break the ice with Xi Jinping without the formality, really, of a Washington meet-up, said another senior White House official. Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan, will join Trump and his wife, Melania, for dinner on Thursday night then Trump and Xi will have a series of meetings there on Friday. The entire visit will last less than 24 hours. What matters is that the two of them get together for a successful summit, even if its on the moon, said former U.S. ambassador to China, Max Baucus.  However, I do think that Mar-a-lago will probably help enhance conversation between the two of them. President Trump can show President Xi around, show him the digs. Trump is very proud of that, and President Xi will be interested in seeing all of that.     The two leaders are not expected to make public appearances but there are likely to be occasions for a pool of the news media to see them. No joint news conference was expected.  Past U.S. presidents have often turned to settings away from the trappings of Washington to conduct delicate diplomacy. George H.W. Bush had his seaside estate in Kennebunkport, Maine, and George W. Bush frequently played host to foreign leaders at his ranch in Crawford, Texas. Trumps immediate predecessor, Barack Obama, used the Sunnylands retreat in Rancho Mirage, California, as a site for an informal summit with Xi in 2013. While Trump treated Abe to golf, no such outing is planned for the leader of China.  Mar-a-Lago has already been the scene of some controversy for Trump. When a North Korean missile test disrupted Abes visit there, Trump and the Japanese leader were seen at a dinner table on the terrace discussing how to respond, as club members looked on from nearby tables.

Democrats on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions questioned whether Gottliebs ties to the pharmaceutical industry would compromise his ability to act impartially, ahead of a vote on whether to advance his nomination to the full Senate. Gottlieb, a former FDA deputy commission who is a partner at a large venture capital fund and sits on the boards of multiple healthcare companies, has advocated loosening requirements needed for approval of new medical products. His nomination is generally expected to be approved. The hearing also covered Gottliebs views on issues ranging from clinical trials to the opioid epidemic and vaccines. Senator Chris Murphy said Democrats had a level of discomfort with Gottliebs nomination, not just because of his private industry background but also because of his prior activity as a political adviser to Republican presidential candidates and opposition to the Affordable Care Act. The worry about impartiality is certainly connected to the private sector experience but its also to your very deep political involvement as well, Murphy said. Gottlieb, 44, acknowledged the concern, but said he would work hard to make sure I preserve my impartiality. In an ethics disclosure form filed last month Gottlieb said he would resign from multiple corporate boards and divest his healthcare company holdings. Republicans on the committee said Gottliebs background would provide him with valuable insight into the industry that the FDA regulates. Gottlieb said his goal was to implement the provisions in the recently passed 21st Century Cures Act that among other things require the FDA to consider ways to streamline the clinical trial process. He said he would be in favor of clinical trial constructs that dont require the tight randomization that current clinical trials do. Gottlieb also said he would be willing to challenge the view that vaccines cause autism, a theory that has been widely debunked by vaccine experts. In January Trumps transition team floated the idea of forming a panel on autism. In 2014 Trump said in a tweet that he believed in vaccinations but not massive, all at once, shots and that Govt. Should stop NOW! Gottlieb said the question of whether vaccines cause autism is one of the most exhaustively studied issues in medicine and that there is no causal link between vaccines and autism. Pressed on whether he would challenge contrary views, Gottlieb said he has a history of not being shy about speaking truth to power and making my views known. Gottlieb called the opioid epidemic a public health emergency on the order of Ebola and Zika. He said it is the biggest health crisis facing the FDA and that solving the problem would require a broad public health response. Gottlieb, who held a financial interest in the vape shop Kure, said some e-cigarettes may have the potential to wean smokers off combustible cigarettes and be less harmful. An e-cigarette or vaping product might be a good smoking cessation tool while a chocolate chip-flavored e-cigarette might not be, he said. Ultimately, he said, science will tell where to draw that line. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Hensarling noted that the CFPB has failed to finalize regulatory projects mandated by Congress,  such as writing rules directing financial institutions to collect data about credit applications by minority and women-owned businesses. Republicans claimed the agency failed to detect wrongdoing at Wells Fargo & Co, relying on outside investigators and news reports to point out widespread problems with improper account creation. The CFPB was asleep at the wheel! said Ann Wagner, a Missouri Republican. The earliest the committee could determine the CFPB began to examine Wells Fargo was in May 2015, after the bank notified the regulator that the Los Angeles City Attorney was already pursuing a civil case, she said. Yet the CFPB was front and center in September 2016 when the high-profile $185 million multi-agency settlement was announced. Cordray said Wagner was conflating issues and said the oversight work became exponential over time. The CFPB levied a $100 million fine against the bank in an enforcement action with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the City and County of Los Angeles. The probe began after a 2013 Los Angeles Times investigative story. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump hopes to sign several more measures into law before the end of April to roll back Obama-era regulations under the time-limited Congressional Review Act (CRA), a White House official said on Wednesday. Aggressive use by Republicans in Congress of the obscure CRA has provided them with several small-scale legislative victories at a time when they have struggled with major legislation.  Highlighting these, White House Director of Legislative Affairs Marc Short said on a conference call with reporters: There are several more that we hope to sign before this window closes on April 28. The law has a short time span for introducing resolutions of disapproval: 60 legislative days after a regulation is finalized, meaning it can only be used shortly after a president of an opposing party leaves office. Since Trump, a Republican, took office on Jan. 20, House of Representatives Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy has led Congress in churning out 13 resolutions killing regulations by Democratic President Barack Obama, most of concern to business interests. Trump, who vowed in the 2016 election campaign to slash regulations, has signed 11 resolutions under the CRA, rolling back the rules they targeted and barring agencies from writing substantially similar measures in the future. On Monday, Trump signed a CRA resolution repealing broadband privacy protections. He has also signed resolutions killing rules meant to expand background checks for mentally ill gun purchasers, change public school assessments, and reduce coal waste runoff into streams. Democrats have assailed the reversals as harmful to the environment, education and checks on Wall Street, with many saying the measures were meant to please big-money lobbyists. Last Friday was the deadline for introducing new CRA resolutions. Now Republicans must complete voting on resolutions already in the legislative pipeline. Written in 1996 and successfully used only once before 2017, the CRA was meant to restore the balance of power between Congress and the federal bureaucracy. But lobbyists and lawmakers have seized on it as a tool to repeal rules written in the final months of a preceding administration. The U.S. government has thousands of regulations, which are categorized by their impact on the economy. The Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan arm of Congress, has reported that 76 major new rules, subject to CRA review, were written in 2015, down from 81 in 2014. The busiest year on record for major new rules was 100 in 2010. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"
"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": "" WASHINGTON/LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - When President Donald Trump signed an executive order last week to sweep away Obama-era climate change regulations, he said it would end Americas war on coal, usher in a new era of energy production and put miners back to work.  But the biggest consumers of U.S. coal - power generating companies - remain unconvinced.  Reuters surveyed 32 utilities with operations in the 26 states that sued former President Barack Obamas administration to block its Clean Power Plan, the main target of Trumps executive order. The bulk of them have no plans to alter their multi-billion dollar, years-long shift away from coal, suggesting demand for the fuel will keep falling despite Trumps efforts.  The utilities gave many reasons, mainly economic: Natural gas - coals top competitor - is cheap and abundant; solar and wind power costs are falling; state environmental laws remain in place; and Trumps regulatory rollback may not survive legal challenges.  Meanwhile, big investors aligned with the global push to fight climate change  such as the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund  have been pressuring U.S. utilities in which they own stakes to cut coal use.  Im not going to build new coal plants in todays environment, said Ben Fowke, CEO of Xcel Energy, which operates in eight states and uses coal for about 36 percent of its electricity production. And if Im not going to build new ones, eventually there wont be any.  REUTERS RECOMMENDSWindow closing for Republican stealth assault on regulationsAfter Australian cyclone, coking coal spikes as China chases U.S. supplies Of the 32 utilities contacted by Reuters, 20 said Trumps order would have no impact on their investment plans; five said they were reviewing the implications of the order; six gave no response. Just one said it would prolong the life of some of its older coal-fired power units.  North Dakotas Basin Electric Power Cooperative was the sole utility to identify an immediate positive impact of Trumps order on the outlook for coal.  Were in the situation where the executive order takes a lot of pressure off the decisions we had to make in the near term, such as whether to retrofit and retire older coal plants, said Dale Niezwaag, a spokesman for Basin Electric. But Trump can be a one-termer, so the reprieve out there is short.  Trumps executive order triggered a review aimed at killing the Clean Power Plan. The Obama-era law would have required states, by 2030, to collectively cut carbon emissions from existing power plants by 30 percent from 2005 levels. It was designed as a primary strategy in U.S. efforts to fight global climate change.  The U.S. coal industry, without increases in domestic demand, would need to rely on export markets for growth. Shipments of U.S. metallurgical coal, used in the production of steel, have recently shown up in China following a two-year hiatus - in part to offset banned shipments from North Korea and temporary delays from cyclone-hit Australian producers.  Coal had been the primary fuel source for U.S. power plants for the last century, but its use has fallen more than a third since 2008 after advancements in drilling technology unlocked new reserves of natural gas.  Hundreds of aging coal-fired power plants have been retired or retrofitted. Huge coal mining companies like Peabody Energy Corp and Arch Coal fell into bankruptcy, and production last year hit its lowest point since 1978.  The slide appears likely to continue: U.S. power companies now expect to retire or convert more than 8,000 megawatts of coal-fired plants in 2017 after shutting almost 13,000 MW last year, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration and Thomson Reuters data.  Luke Popovich, a spokesman for the National Mining Association, acknowledged Trumps efforts would not return the coal industry to its glory days, but offered some hope.  There may not be immediate plans for utilities to bring on more coal, but the future is always uncertain in this market, he said.  Many of the companies in the Reuters survey said they had been focused on reducing carbon emissions for a decade or more and were hesitant to change direction based on shifting political winds in Washington D.C.  Utility planning typically takes place over much longer periods than presidential terms of office, Berkshire Hathaway Inc-owned Pacificorp spokesman Tom Gauntt said.  Several utilities also cited falling costs for wind and solar power, which are now often as cheap as coal or natural gas, thanks in part to government subsidies for renewable energy.  In the meantime, activist investors have increased pressure on U.S. utilities to shun coal.  In the last year, Norways sovereign wealth fund, the worlds largest, has excluded more than a dozen U.S. power companies - including Xcel, American Electric Power Co Inc and NRG Energy Inc - from its investments because of their reliance on coal-fired power.  Another eight companies, including Southern Co and NorthWestern Corp, are under observation by the fund.  Wyoming-based coal miner Cloud Peak Energy said it doesnt blame utilities for being lukewarm to Trumps order.  \""For eight years, if you were a utility running coal, you got the hell kicked out of you,\"" said Richard Reavey, a spokesman for the company. \""Are you going to turn around tomorrow and say, 'Let's buy lots of coal plants'? Pretty unlikely.\""  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

House Democrats said they would use a parliamentary procedure to file a petition aimed at forcing a vote on legislation requiring U.S. presidents to disclose multiple years of federal income tax filings. Representatives for the White House and House Speaker Paul Ryan did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Trump, a Republican and New York real estate developer who touted his business acumen in the 2016 presidential campaign, defied decades of precedent by candidates when he refused to release his tax returns, saying they were under audit. The Internal Revenue Service says audits pose no obstacle to releasing tax returns. Democrats, for their so-called discharge petition to move forward, would need to obtain signatures of support from the majority of the 435 lawmakers in the Republican-controlled House.  Such a move could be a long-shot given that just two Republicans, Representatives Mark Sanford and Justin Amash, have signed on to sponsor the proposed bill that would then see a vote. The petition is the latest effort by Democrats on the issue as just two glimpses of Trumps taxes have surfaced in media reports on his 1995 and 2005 filings.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - If confirmed as expected this week by the U.S. Senate, President Donald Trumps Supreme Court nominee would join his new fellow justices in time to act on divisive cases concerning religion, guns and big business, underscoring Neil Gorsuchs importance  as the fifth conservative on a nine-justice court. The Senates Republican leaders have pledged to confirm the Colorado-based appeals court judge on Friday. His first official task after being sworn in would come at an April 13 private meeting among the justices to discuss taking various appeals from lower courts. There are appeals pending on expanding gun rights to include carrying concealed firearms in public, state voting restrictions critics say are aimed at reducing minority turnout, and allowing business owners to object on religious grounds to serving gay couples. All three could lead to landmark rulings if taken up. On April 17, the justices will begin hearing a new round of oral arguments, including a closely watched case on the separation of church and state focusing on whether a Missouri church was improperly denied state funds. The court is nearing the end of its current term, which runs from October to June. Gorsuch also would play a key role in important cases the justices already have agreed to hear in their next term, including a bid by employers to prevent workers from bringing class action claims, a goal of big business. The court has been divided between four conservatives and four liberals since the February 2016 death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia. Major issues before the court highlight the significance of Gorsuch filling Scalias seat and restoring the courts 5-4 conservative majority. Senate Republicans paved the way for Trump to replace Scalia by refusing last year to consider Democratic former President Barack Obamas nomination of appellate judge Merrick Garland to fill the vacancy. That would have given the court a liberal majority for the first time in decades. Legal experts suspect a conservative majority on the court could motivate conservative lawyers to bring cases in a hope that five justices will back abortion restrictions, oppose political spending limits, and favor wider gun and religious rights. Justice Anthony Kennedy, a conservative who sometimes sides with the four liberals, will remain the courts swing vote. Most experts expect Gorsuch to be more aligned with the courts two most stalwart conservatives, Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas. Theres no reason to think he will be anything other than extremely conservative, said Chicago-Kent College of Law professor Carolyn Shapiro. With four votes needed to take up a case at the private meetings, each justice is important. Among pending appeals the court is likely to act on in the coming weeks is a case in which activists have asked the justices to rule for the first time that the U.S. Constitutions Second Amendment, which protects the right to bear arms, extends to carrying firearms outside the home.  In another case, the court could decide whether to revive voter-identification and other restrictions in North Carolina blocked by a lower court. The justices also could hear a Christian bakers religious claim that he should not be forced to sell a cake to a gay couple. Conservative justices generally take expansive views of gun and religious rights and may back state laws whose Republican backers say are intended to prevent voter fraud. On April 19, the court will hear a religious rights case in which a church contends Missouri violated the Constitutions guarantee of religious freedom by denying it funds for a playground project due to a state ban on aid to religious organizations. Gorsuch has ruled several times in favor of expansive religious rights during his decade as a judge. Given Gorsuchs solicitude for religious liberty, his joining the court can only help the church, said Ilya Shapiro, a lawyer with the libertarian Cato Institute think tank. There are several cases the court has already heard but has not yet decided in which Gorsuch could play a role. The court has the option of hearing fresh arguments, with Gorsuch in a position to cast a potential deciding vote.  One such case is a bid by Miami to revive lawsuits accusing major banks of predatory mortgage lending to black and Hispanic home buyers. Another concerns whether the family of a Mexican teenager can sue a U.S. Border Patrol agent who fatally shot the 15-year-old from across the border in Texas. Longer term, an issue likely to return to the court is a conservative-backed challenge that could weaken organized labor. The court was expected to deny unions a vital source of cash last year. But after Scalia died, it issued a 4-4 ruling leaving in place a lower courts decision favoring unions.  The court is also likely to weigh in on whether transgender students are protected under a federal law prohibiting sex discrimination in education. The court took up that question last fall but in March sent the case back to a lower court without resolving the main legal question. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Tillerson is due to visit Russia for talks expected to touch on the nations annexation of Crimea, its deployment of a land-based cruise missile and its role in Syrias civil war. While there, he should also meet with civil society activists, Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen and Republican Senator Marco Rubio said in the letter. The senators sit on the subcommittee that oversees the State Department budget. We feel strongly that democratically-minded Russians should know that the U.S. supports their aspirations, and as our nations top diplomat, you are in a unique position to communicate this message, the letter said. Tillerson, who has taken four trips abroad during his two months in office, has so far not engaged in the public diplomacy in which previous Republican and Democratic secretaries of state took part. Such events might include meetings with activists as well as town halls with youths and interviews with local journalists. A State Department spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. In Turkey last week, Tillerson met with Norine Brunson, the wife of jailed American pastor Andrew Brunson, a missionary held there since October. In a visit to China last month, Tillerson made brief mention of human and religious rights but had no known meetings with activists or engagements with civil society representatives. By contrast, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton ended her 2009 visit to China with services at a state-sanctioned church, a conversation with womens rights activists and a brief Web chat with Chinese internet users. Russian opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza told a Senate hearing last month that it was important that the world pay attention to voices in Russia besides those of President Vladimir Putins government. Russia is so much bigger and so much more diverse than the Putin regime, Kara-Murza said. In Moscow, both Republican and Democratic secretaries of state have met with civic leaders at Spaso House, the U.S. ambassadors stately residence.

She claimed that by filming her, staff had breached data protection laws. Beyts, 62, who said she had a bladder condition at the time, told the court she had tried to hide from sight after urgently needing to go to the toilet while walking on the course. Four days later she was visited by police who charged her for public urination, media reports said. At the time, the club was not registered under UK data protection laws and staff had used photographs taken of Beyts on their mobile phones as part of a police complaint against her which was later dropped, British media reports said. While Sheriff Donald Corke ruled she should not have been filmed, he said any distress was not a result of the companys failure to register under the data Protection Act.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""BEIJING/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Although worried about the prospect of a trade war, American businesses operating in China nonetheless want President Donald Trump to wring some concessions on market access from Chinas leader Xi Jingping when the two meet this week. Trump warned in a tweet last week the meetings at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Thursday and Friday will be very difficult and American companies must be prepared to look at other alternatives.  Trump has said he wants U.S. companies to stop investing in China and instead create jobs at home. He has also accused China of manipulating its currency to boost exports. Critics within U.S. industry have accused China of unfair government subsidies to its companies, and of flooding the U.S. market with cheap products from steel to solar panels, while restricting foreign investment over vast swathes of the worlds second-biggest economy.  But they also worry Trumps policies on China are not entirely clear, with his trade team still not in place, and may be subject to a grand bargain involving other issues such as North Korea. Trump is set to enter the meeting without several key advisors, including his pick for trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer who has yet to be confirmed by Congress. His nominee as ambassador to China, Iowa Governor Terry Branstad, has also yet to be confirmed, while several posts in the U.S. State Department that formulate Asia policy remain unfilled. With this in mind, it is hard to imagine that there will be much in the way of concrete accomplishments at this summit, or even that there has been any significant interagency discussion on strategy leading up to it, said Randal Phillips, Mintz Groups Beijing-based managing partner for Asia and the former chief CIA representative in China. Some of the largest U.S. companies have contributed to the billions of dollars of foreign direct investment that have poured into China over the past two decades, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. They include tech companies like Apple, which makes much of its iPhone in China, automakers such as General Motors and Ford, heavy machinery firms like Caterpillar, retailers like Starbucks and makers of shaving foam and detergent, like Procter & Gamble. U.S. steel producers want Trump to press Xi on Chinese steel prices, according to a source who has been in discussions with the administration in advance of the summit. U.S. automakers complain about a disparity in tariffs: The United States has a 2.5 percent tariff on auto imports, Chinas is 25 percent.  But the stakes are perhaps highest for American technology firms, who worry that Chinas new cyber-security law, which takes effect in June, sets potentially discriminatory standards for multinationals. The Information Technology & Innovation Foundation (ITIF), a think-tank whose board includes representatives from Apple, IBM Google and other tech heavyweights, has urged the Trump administration to pressure China to stop rigging markets. It warned that possible retaliation from Beijing was not a reason for inaction. Trump has staked out various positions on China as president in his tweets, phone calls and statements. In a phone call with Xi after taking office, Trump gave ground on one of Beijings most sensitive issues  the status of Taiwan - after earlier suggesting he might not stick to Washingtons long-held one China policy. Trump signed two executive orders on trade on Friday, one to improve import tariff collection and another to study the causes of the U.S. trade deficit. Trump said at the White House signing ceremony he and Xi were going to get down to some serious business and vowed that the theft of American prosperity by foreign countries would end. Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zheng Zeguang said on Friday  the U.S.-China trade imbalance was mostly the result of differences in the two countries economic structures and noted  China had a trade deficit in services. China tops the list of countries who have trade surpluses with the United States, with a $347 billion surplus last year. Some in the U.S. business community worry about tit-for-tat retaliation in trade disputes with China. Jacob Parker, vice president of China operations at the U.S.-China Business Council, said the two presidents need to take positive actions that would lead to a more durable relationship, not retaliatory actions that would lead to a trade war. The list of commercial issues between the two countries was so long, it would be impossible to make a major dent in them with one meeting, he said. China is the largest export market for U.S. soybean producers, accounting for 62 percent of U.S. soy exports in 2016 with a value of over $14 billion, leading some experts to suggest the sector could be particularly vulnerable to retaliation. Steve Censky, chief executive of the American Soybean Association, told Reuters he hopes Trump will take a prudent approach to the trade relationship and address any issues in a workman-like manner, recognizing that both countries have a lot to lose if the relationship suffers. William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China met senior Trump administration officials in February, and said it was clear they were very familiar with the issues facing American companies in China, perhaps more so than previous administrations. But several corporate lobbyists, representing a range of companies expressed concern Trumps lack of attention to detail could prove counterproductive when it comes to the intricacies of the massive trade and investment relationship. Its not yet clear whether ... this is a White House that wants to fundamentally reset the terms of the relationship or tinker at the edges and declare a public relations win, said a China expert at a Washington business lobby who asked not to be named.

The nine-seat court has been operating with only eight justices since the death of conservative Antonin Scalia on Feb. 13, 2016. The court, with four liberals and four conservatives, has ended up with 4-4 split decisions in several cases. The new justice could cast the deciding vote in some cases being considered in the term that ends in June. But in cases argued before the new justice was seated, the court may need to order new oral arguments, which would likely not be heard until the courts next term starts in October. Here is a look at five cases in which the new justice could be pivotal. Church v. state: Trinity Lutheran Church v. Comer A religious rights case from Missouri to be argued on April 19 in which a church contends the state violated the U.S. Constitutions First Amendment guarantee of religious freedom by denying it funds for a playground project because of a state ban on aid to religious organizations. Employee class-action lawsuits: Epic Systems Corp v. Lewis A significant case for business and labor on whether companies can head off costly class-action lawsuits by forcing employees to give up their right to pursue work-related legal claims in court as a group. An issue that has closely divided the court in the past, this case is set to be argued in the autumn. Housing discrimination: Bank of America v. Miami The eight-justice court appeared closely divided when it heard arguments in this case in November on whether Miami could pursue lawsuits accusing major banks of predatory mortgage lending to black and Hispanic home buyers. The court may need to reargue the case with Gorsuch on board to avoid a 4-4 split.  Cross-border shooting: Hernandez v. Mesa A possible 4-4 split appeared on the cards when the court heard arguments in this civil rights case in February. The court has been asked to revive a civil rights lawsuit filed by the family of a Mexican teenager against a U.S. Border Patrol agent who fatally shot the 15-year-old from across the border in Texas in 2010. Corporate liability: Jesner v. Arab Bank In a case to be heard next term, the court agreed this week to consider reviving litigation that seeks to hold Arab Bank Plc ARBK.AM financially liable for militant attacks in Israel and the Palestinian territories and accuses the Jordan-based bank of being the paymaster to militant groups. The question of whether companies can be held liable for actions overseas under a federal law called the Alien Tort Statute is one the court took up but failed to decide in 2013.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate moved on Tuesday toward ramming through approval of President Donald Trumps Supreme Court nominee this week, as its top Republican said he had the votes to wipe away Democratic roadblocks but vowed to preserve the minority partys ability to hold up legislation. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell plans to change the Senates long-standing rules in order to eliminate the ability to use a procedural hurdle called a filibuster against Supreme Court nominees like Trumps pick, Neil Gorsuch, if a Democratic filibuster succeeds as expected in blocking a confirmation vote. Senate confirmation of Gorsuch, 49, to the lifetime post would restore the courts conservative majority and enable Trump to leave a lasting imprint on Americas highest judicial body even as he regularly criticizes the federal judiciary. McConnell said he had the necessary votes to approve the rule change with a simple majority vote, expected on Thursday. Republicans control the Senate 52-48. The rule change has been dubbed the nuclear option, and Trump has encouraged McConnell to go nuclear. Such a step would threaten to further erode trust between the parties in Congress. Theres a reason they call it the nuclear option, and that is because theres fallout. And this fallout will be dangerously and perhaps disastrously radioactive for the Senate for years to come, Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal told reporters. Republicans were so confident they could use their muscle to pass the rule change that Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley said flatly that Gorsuch will be on the Supreme Court Friday night. Amid a fierce debate over both Gorsuch and the Senates rules, McConnell tried to tamp down any speculation that Republicans would stage a monumental power grab by ending the filibuster for legislation. McConnell said that as long as he was the Senates majority leader, he would never remove the ability to mount a filibuster against legislation, as opposed to presidential appointments. McConnell fought against many of former Democratic President Barack Obamas legislative initiatives when Republicans were the minority party in the Senate. Theres not a single senator in the (Republican) majority who thinks we ought to change the legislative filibuster, not one, McConnell told reporters. The move to change venerable Senate rules reflects an intensifying of the already-toxic partisanship in Washington since Trump took office in January. McConnells promise to keep the ability to filibuster legislation could make it more difficult for Republicans to get key parts of Trumps legislative agenda through the Senate, considering the expected strong Democratic opposition. A filibuster requires a super-majority of 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate in order to proceed to a simple majority vote on a Supreme Court nominee or legislation. The 60-vote super-majority threshold that gives the minority party power to hold up the majority party has forced the Senate over the decades to try to achieve bipartisanship in legislation and presidential appointments. The Senate on Tuesday kicked off its formal debate on confirming Gorsuch, a Colorado-based appeals court judge, and McConnell said he would get the clock ticking toward a vote expected on Thursday to stop the Democrats filibuster. Democrats on Monday amassed the votes needed to sustain the filibuster, prompting Republicans to move toward changing the rules. Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley took to the Senate floor on Tuesday evening to rally support for the Gorsuch filibuster. His office said in a statement that he plans to hold the floor and refuse to yield for as long as he is able to continue speaking. Merkleys talking filibuster is not expected to affect the Republican timetable for Gorsuchs confirmation.  The filibuster in one form or another dates back to the 19th century but assumed its current form in the 1970s. The Democrats were the first to use the nuclear option. In 2013, when they controlled the Senate, they changed it to bar filibusters for executive branch nominees and federal judges aside from Supreme Court justices. They did so after Republicans filibustered Obamas appeals court nominees. Democrats are now being pushed by far-left interest groups into doing something truly detrimental to this body and to our country, McConnell said on the Senate floor. They seem to be hurtling toward the abyss this time, and trying to take the Senate with them. Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer, leading the filibuster effort, said it was the Republicans who bore responsibility for the crisis and for deciding, as he said, to break the rules. He noted that the Senate, under McConnells guidance, refused last year to consider Obamas nomination of appellate judge Merrick Garland to fill the same high court vacancy that Trump elected Gorsuch to fill. What the majority leader did to Merrick Garland by denying him even a hearing and a vote is even worse than a filibuster, Schumer said on the Senate floor. Restoring the nine-seat high courts conservative majority would fulfill one of Trumps top promises during the 2016 presidential campaign. Republicans say Gorsuch is well qualified for the job and that there is no principled reason to oppose him. Democrats say he is so conservative as to be outside the judicial mainstream, has favored corporate interests over ordinary Americans in legal opinions, and has shown insufficient independence from Trump.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON The clock began running out this week on a strategy that has provided U.S. Republicans in Congress with their only notable legislative successes this year: aggressive use of an obscure U.S. law known as the Congressional Review Act (CRA).  On his 75th day in power, President Donald Trump has yet to offer any major legislation or win passage of a bill he favors, but House of Representatives Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy has notched numerous small-scale victories with his strategy.  Vice President Mike Pence told business leaders at the White House on Tuesday that Trump would sign more CRA resolutions soon and roll back an avalanche of red tape from the administration of President Barack Obama, a Democrat.  REUTERS COMMENTARYWar College: One tank to rule them allThe right way to address the Marines United Facebook GroupIn legal battles against travel ban, Trump's own statements are his worst enemy Since Trump took office on Jan. 20, McCarthy has led Congress in churning out 13 resolutions under the CRA killing Obama-era regulations, most of concern to business interests.  Trump has signed 11 of these into law, not only rolling back the rules they targeted but also barring agencies from writing substantially similar regulations in the future.  White House spokesman Sean Spicer said on Tuesday the number of resolutions signed over two months showed Trump is vastly different from past presidents in rolling back regulations.  On Monday Trump signed a CRA resolution repealing broadband privacy protections. He has also signed resolutions killing rules meant to expand background checks for mentally ill gun purchasers, change public school assessments, and reduce coal waste runoff into streams.  Last Friday was the deadline for introducing any new CRA resolutions on regulations enacted by Obamas administration. Now Republicans must complete voting on resolutions already in the legislative pipeline by mid-May.  Democrats assail the reversals as harming the environment, education and checks on Wall Street, with many saying the regulations were killed in order to please big-money lobbyists.  Representative Louise Slaughter, the senior Democrat on the Rules Committee that sends resolutions to the House floor for votes, said in an interview of course it benefits the lobbyists.  But she said fumbles around healthcare and tax reform also pushed CRA resolutions to the fore.  Partly I think its because they dont have anything else to do, she said about Republicans eagerness. Other than that I think its just another take that Obama.  McCarthy, a Californian and the No. 2 House Republican, saw the CRAs potential before the election. Written in 1996 and successfully used only once before 2017, the law was originally meant to restore the balance of power between Congress and the federal bureaucracy. But lobbyists and lawmakers recognized it could be used as a policy weapon, if the stars aligned.  Under the law, resolutions only need simple majorities in each chamber to go on for the presidents signature. So one party must control both the legislative and executive branches for it to work. The law sets a short time span for introducing disapproval resolutions: 60 legislative days after a regulation is finalized, meaning it can only be used right after a president of an opposing party leaves office.  The stars aligned on Nov. 8, when Republicans captured the White House, Senate and House. For weeks Republican lawmakers bombarded McCarthy with lists of regulations to repeal and lobbying groups laid plans. The first disapproval resolutions were introduced on Jan. 30.  Right after the election, McCarthy told his party to go through each regulation on our priority list, he said.  If you look at Article One of the Constitution, this isnt the role of these agencies. The agencies have become too big, McCarthy said in an interview with Reuters.  The first resolutions sailed through, primarily because Republicans had opposed the regulations long before they were finalized. McCarthy said so many lawmakers objected to the stream pollution rule that wiping it off the books was easy.  Even though the CRA effort is winding down, McCarthys brief campaign showed that aggressive use of the law could succeed, and provided Republicans with some modest, but needed successes in a time when they are struggling with larger matters.  After years of talk about cutting red tape, it is now actually happening, House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Tuesday. We are reversing the Obama administrations most recent and last regulatory onslaught.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. House of Representatives vote to overhaul Obamacare before lawmakers leave Washington for a two-week break looked unlikely late on Tuesday as top White House deputies and key Republican groups said more discussions were needed. Vice President Mike Pence and administration officials met on Capitol Hill for two hours with lawmakers from the moderate Tuesday Group, the conservative Republican Study Committee, and the House Freedom Caucus, the rebel group of conservative lawmakers that derailed the first administration-backed healthcare bill last month. While progress had been made, the officials and House lawmakers said no bill text had been agreed on and no decisions had been made by the various Republican factions. The lack of a resolution complicates a White House push for a House vote on a healthcare proposal before Friday, when lawmakers return to their districts for two weeks. Good talk, good progress, Pence told reporters without providing details. Freedom Caucus leader Mark Meadows said the meeting had focused on an amendment to create a backstop to ensure individuals with chronic illnesses in high-risk pools do not see spikes in insurance premium costs if other aspects of Obamacare, also known as the 2010 Affordable Care Act, are repealed. No decisions were made. Were going to get back together tomorrow at a time to be determined, Meadows told reporters. Republican Study Committee Chairman Mark Walker said the focus when talks resumed would be on sticking points such as whether to allow states to opt out of Obamacare mandates that insurers must cover a minimum tier of services and cannot charge more to those with pre-existing conditions - a popular provision of the law that Trump has promised to protect. The Republican failure last month to dismantle Obamacare was President Donald Trumps first major legislative setback and it raised questions about how he would build Republican consensus to deliver on other major legislative goals. Many Republicans were elected on promises to repeal and replace Obamacare but House Speaker Paul Ryan was forced to withdraw the bill when it became clear there were not enough Republican votes to pass it. Hard-line conservatives, such as those in the Freedom Caucus, thought it was too similar to former Democratic President Barack Obamas signature healthcare law. Moderate conservatives balked at proposed changes to some of its most popular provisions that were sought by conservative lawmakers. Trump initially said he would move on to fulfilling other campaign promises such as a tax overhaul and infrastructure-spending package, but a new attempt at reviving the failed healthcare push took off on Monday when White House officials met Republican lawmakers.  A source familiar with internal House Republican deliberations said healthcare, not taxes, now topped the House agenda and that the White House was driving the healthcare effort. They want to get this done as quickly as possible, Meadows told reporters after Tuesdays meeting. Republican lawmakers have said the new push on healthcare would maintain Obamacares essential health benefits clause listing services and care that insurers must cover. However, in a move to attract hard-line conservatives, states could apply for a waiver if they showed it would improve coverage and reduce costs. The backstop for individuals in the high-risk pool discussed on Tuesday would direct additional funds to a $115 billion state stability fund authorized in the first Republican bill. No final decision was made, even though there was consensus, lawmakers said. Were taking our time and working through policy and structure until we reach consensus, said Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady. Lets let the solution and common ground drive the timetable, rather than the other way. That was really the consensus, he said. Ryan told reporters after a closed meeting with fellow Republicans on Tuesday morning that the renewed healthcare effort was simply in the conceptual stage right now, and did not give a timeline for having a bill on the House floor. Talk of a revived plan hurt shares of hospitals and insurers that have benefited from Obamacares expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor, which extended insurance to millions of people and helped cut hospital debt. Major hospital and medical groups, including the American Medical Association, were opposed to the initial Republican bill because it would lead to massive coverage losses and cuts in hospital revenue.

Representative Adam Schiff, the House of Representatives Intelligence Committees ranking Democrat, said documents that officials at the White House provided to the panels chairman, Republican Devin Nunes, would be made available to all the members of his committee and their Senate counterparts. This action is long overdue and follows an inexplicable series of events in which the White House played a role in selectively and surreptitiously providing the documents to our chairman, Schiff said in a statement. If the White House had any concerns over these documents, or any other documents, they should have provided them to our committee weeks ago, he said. Congressional committees and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are investigating what U.S. intelligence has  concluded were attempts by Moscow to influence the U.S. election in Trumps favor.  They are also looking at links between Russia and Trump. Russia denies such allegations. Trump and his allies have mounted an aggressive defense. Most recently, they have focused on unsubstantiated reports that Susan Rice, former President Barack Obamas national security adviser, disclosed the names of Trump aides swept up by surveillance of foreign targets. Rice dismissed the reports as absolutely false in an interview with MSNBC. The day after FBI Director James Comey confirmed the FBI investigation of potential ties between Russia and the Trump campaign last month, Nunes announced to reporters that the communications of members of Trumps transition team were caught up in the surveillance. He said the information came from documents obtained from a source he would not identify. Nunes, a close Trump political ally, discussed the matter with the Republican president before consulting committee Democrats. After reports Nunes got the documents from White House aides, Schiff called for him to recuse himself from the inquiry, saying his actions compromised the panels ability to complete a credible, bipartisan investigation.  Republican Senator Richard Burr, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, whose leaders have insisted they can conduct a bipartisan investigation, said on Tuesday he was open to looking into the Rice allegations, if they proved true.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""QAYYARA WEST AIRFIELD, Iraq (Reuters) - President Donald Trumps son-in-law, Jared Kushner, voiced optimism about the long-term U.S. alliance with Iraqs military and its campaign to retake Mosul from Islamic State on Tuesday, as he visited a base about 10 miles (16 km) from the city. Kushner was on the last day of a two-day trip to Iraq as the guest of Marine General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the U.S. militarys Joint Chiefs of Staff. The visit to the Hammam al-Alil base included an operational briefing from Iraqi and U.S. commanders. The trip has demonstrated the far-reaching portfolio of Kushner, 36, who is part of Trumps innermost circle and who has been given a wide range of domestic and foreign policy responsibilities, including working on a Middle East peace deal. His views on Iraq could shape Trumps own opinions. It comes as Trump is examining ways to accelerate a U.S.-led coalition campaign that U.S. and Iraqi officials say has so far been largely successful in uprooting Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria. Mosul is by far the biggest city to have been held by Islamic State, and winning it back would largely destroy the Iraqi part of the groups caliphate, proclaimed from a Mosul mosque in 2014.  There are mounting concerns about civilian casualties in the final phases of the assault and questions about how quickly Mosul can be rebuilt, repopulated and governed in a way that avoids alienating its Sunni-majority population. The Mosul battle, the biggest in Iraq since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003, has been under way since October, with 100,000 Iraqi troops, Kurdish fighters and Shiite militiamen seeking to drive out the militants with the support of U.S.-led air strikes. Although Trump campaigned on defeating the hardline Sunni militant group, he has not announced any major changes to war strategy and it is unclear how Kushners experience in Iraq might shape his advice to the president.  Speaking after lengthy battlefield reports from Iraqs military, Kushner sounded upbeat about the campaign and said the partnership between U.S. and Iraqi troops was very impressive. He expressed hope the partnership would be enduring, signaling White House interest in longer-term U.S. military assistance.  I hope the victory that you have in Mosul in the near future will not just be a victory for the American and Iraqi troops but it will be a victory for the world, Kushner said. On Tuesday, Islamic State issued its first official remarks referring to Trump since he assumed the U.S. presidency in January, describing him as an idiot. You (the U.S.) are bankrupt and the signs of your demise are evident to every eye, spokesman Abi al-Hassan al-Muhajer said in a recording released on the messaging network Telegram. There is no more evidence than (that) you being run by an idiot who does not know what Syria or Iraq or Islam is.  Even after Mosul and other pockets of territory are recaptured, U.S. officials expect Islamic State to go underground and fight on as a more traditional insurgency.  Kushners trip was his first to Iraq and the visit to Hammam al-Alil, where U.S. advisers and artillery are positioned to assist the battle in Mosul, was also the closest Dunford has gotten to Mosul since the campaign began. They stopped briefly at Qayyara West Airfield, another key hub in the war, where U.S. forces manning High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems fired twice at Islamic State targets in Mosul the night before.  Iraqi security forces are engaged in fierce, house-to-house fighting in Mosul. Nearly 290,000 people have fled the city to escape the fighting, according to the United Nations, and it has had a heavy toll on civilians trapped in the city. The advance has been slowed since March 17, when scores of people sheltering from air strikes were killed in a blast. The United States has acknowledged it may have had some kind of role in the incident but also said Islamic State may be to blame. A U.S. investigation is ongoing.  Dunford said Baghdad was looking at ways to better safeguard civilians, given tactics by Islamic State that has raised the risks - including the use of civilians as human shields. The Iraqis are looking to make some adaptations, he told reporters after the talks, which included meetings on Monday with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi in Baghdad.

The two leaders are expected to struggle to find common ground on the main issues that divide them when they meet on Thursday and Friday at Trumps Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. The main agenda items are: Perhaps Trumps most pressing national security challenge. North Korea has been working to develop nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States. Trump is expected to repeat his call for China to do more to rein in its ally and neighbor and has warned that Washington might deal with Pyongyangs weapons programs alone if need be. China says it is doing all it can and has said it is up to the United States to de-escalate with Pyongyang. A White House strategy review focuses on options for pressuring Pyongyang economically and militarily. Among measures under consideration are secondary sanctions against Chinese banks and firms that do the most business with Pyongyang.  A long-standing option of pre-emptive strikes remains on the table, but the review de-emphasizes direct military action, a senior U.S. official said. Any military action would likely provoke severe North Korean retaliation and massive casualties in South Korea and Japanand among U.S. troops stationed there. TRADE Trade is one of the biggest hot-button issues, given Trumps charges in his presidential campaign that Chinese trade practices were killing U.S. jobs and his vow to impose 45 percent tariffs on Chinese imports. The administration has not acted on unilateral tariffs but is targeting a reduction in Chinas $347 billion goods trade surplus through tougher enforcement of trade laws and anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has also demanded reciprocity in the U.S.-China economic relationship, saying that U.S. companies do not enjoy the same access to Chinas vast market as Chinese firms get in the United States.  China says Washington should create better conditions for Chinese investment in the United States if it wants to correct the imbalance. Neither side wants a trade war, but it may be hard to do much more than lower the temperature in Mar-a-Lago. Some analysts believe Xi may bring a package of job-creating Chinese investments and the prospect of a more open services sector that Trump could tweet as tangible achievements. Relations are also clouded by Chinas expansive claims in the disputed South China Sea, where Beijing has been building artificial islands and installing military facilities on them.  U.S. officials see this as part of a long-term Chinese bid to deny U.S. forces access to the strategic sea, a key global trade route.  They say Washington plans more robust naval operations to challenge Chinese claims and assert the right to freedom of navigation, though months have passed since the last one in October under Trumps predecessor Barack Obama. The situation in North Korea has appeared to push the South China Sea onto the back burner for now, but Trump is expected to air U.S. concerns. Trump has repeatedly charged that China manipulates its yuan currency to keep its exports cheap, and he is likely to raise the issue with Xi. But Trump did not make good on his promises to formally declare China a currency manipulator on the first day of his presidency. While economists believe China pushed down the value of the yuan in the past, Chinas central bank for much of the past two years has been working to prop up the yuan, amid capital outflow pressures, spending more than $1 trillion in the process. This would make it very hard to justify a manipulator designation under the U.S. Treasurys current foreign exchange analysis, due one week after Xis visit. The summit would not be happening if Trump had not reaffirmed the one China policy that has underpinned relations for decades. Trump infuriated Beijing when, as president-elect, he took a call from Taiwans president and suggested he might not abide by the policy. He backtracked in a call with Xi in February. Xi may now be looking to head off a big new weapons package to Taiwan that U.S. officials have told Reuters is being crafted.  For its part, Taiwan will be watching anxiously for any sign that Trump is using it as a bargaining chip. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Remaining in the global deal to combat climate change will give U.S. negotiators a chance to advocate for coal in the future of the global energy mix, coal companies like Cloud Peak Energy Inc and Peabody Energy Corp told White House officials over the past few weeks, according to executives and a U.S. official familiar with the discussions. The future is foreign markets, so the last thing you want to do if you are a coal company is to give up a U.S. seat in the international climate discussions and let the Europeans control the agenda, said the official, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the issue. They cant afford for the most powerful advocate for fossil fuels to be away from the table, the official said. Cloud Peak and Peabody officials confirmed the discussions. In Cloud Peaks view, staying in the agreement and trying to encourage a more balanced, reasonable and appropriate path forward on fossil fuel technologies among signatories to the accord seems like a reasonable stance, said Cloud Peaks vice president of government affairs, Richard Reavey. The coal industry was interested in ensuring that the Paris deal provides a role for low-emission coal-fired power plants and financial support for carbon capture and storage technology, the officials said. They also want the pact to protect multilateral funding for international coal projects through bodies like the World Bank. The Paris accord, agreed by nearly 200 countries in 2015, would seek to limit global warming by slashing carbon dioxide and other emissions from burning fossil fuels. As part of the deal, the United States committed to reducing its emissions by between 26 percent and 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. During his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump vowed to pull the United States out of thepact, tapping into a well of concern among his fellow Republicans that the United States energy habits would be policed by the United Nations. But since being elected, he has been mostly quiet on the issue, and administration officials have recently been asking energy companies for advice. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said last week that the administration expected to make a decision on whether to remain a party to the deal by the time leaders of the Group of Seven wealthy nations meet in late May. The prospect of the United States remaining in the Paris deal has irritated some smaller miners, including Murray Energy Corp, whose chief executive, Robert Murray helped fund Trumps presidential bid. Staying in the Paris accord could also face resistance from within Trumps party.

The presidents team is hearing input from experts on all sides of the tax reform debate as we formulate what will ultimately be the presidents plan to enact the first significant tax reform since 1986. As of now, neither a carbon tax nor a VAT are under consideration, said White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters. The administration is looking for funding for ways to pay for President Donald Trumps promised cuts in middle class and corporate taxes. This is the second time the administration has played down the chances of a carbon tax. On Feb. 8, officials met with a group of Republicans who called for a $40 per ton tax on carbon emissions to fend off global climate change. Many Republicans have opposed a carbon tax arguing it would cut jobs and hike energy costs. The Washington Post said the new options reflect the challenges presented by a possible border adjustment tax that Republicans have been considering. A House panel has been working on a plan since mid-2016 that would cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, end taxing foreign profits for U.S.-based multinationals and cut other tax rates for businesses and investors. The plan has divided businesses, prompting import-dependent industries to warn of higher prices for consumer goods from clothing and electronics to gasoline.

The departments rule, which requires brokers offering retirement investment advice to act in the best interest of their customers, has been heavily criticized by Republicans and Wall Street amid concerns it may make investment advice too costly. The delay of the rule, which was slated to take effect April 10, was prompted after President Donald Trump in February ordered the department to conduct the review on whether it should be revised or repealed. In order to delay the effective date, the department had to undertake a formal rule-making process.  If the department ultimately decides on a repeal or change, it will need to undertake another rule-making process in the future. In addition to the 60-day delay, the department also said that other regulatory requirements in the rule for firms to provide disclosures and written representations of compliance to investors will not be mandated until Jan. 1, 2018. That date, the department added, is when it expects to complete its review. As of March 17, the department said it had received 15,000 comments in support of a delay, versus 178,000 comments opposing any delay.  Despite the lop-sided results, the department said a delay is justified because time is needed to complete the presidentially mandated review. Rigid adherence to the original April 10 compliance deadline, the department said, could result in an unduly chaotic transition to the new standards and lead to confusion, excessive costs, and needlessly restricted or reduced advisory services.

The cuts would slash by more than half the staff of the EPA department that conducts vehicle, engine, and fuel testing to verify emissions standards are met and mileage stickers are accurate. Its work helped lead to Volkswagen AGs (VOWG_p.DE) 2015 admission that it violated vehicle emissions rules for years.     In a March 21 budget document posted online by the Washington Post, the Trump administration proposed eliminating $48 million in federal funding for EPA vehicle and fuel testing and certification. It represents a 99 percent federal cut to the vehicle testing budget and would require pretty much shutting down the testing lab, said Margo Oge, who headed the EPAs Office of Transportation and Air Quality under President Barack Obama. The proposal, which would also cut 168 out of 304 full-time jobs, seeks to partially fund current operations by boosting fees automakers and engine manufacturers pay for testing. An EPA official confirmed the documents authenticity.     The Trump administration has proposed cutting the EPAs budget by 31 percent and eliminating more than 50 programs. EPA spokesman John Konkus declined to answer questions about how the cuts could affect vehicle testing. We know we can effectively serve the taxpayers and protect the environment. While many in Washington insist on greater spending, EPA is focused on greater value and real results, Konkus said. Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, an auto trade association, said automakers were concerned the proposed cuts could delay certification of new vehicles and getting products to consumers. Janet McCabe, a former EPA official in the Obama administration, said Monday that companies that take care to comply with the rules can be at a disadvantage without strong enforcement of the rules. We know that a little bit of cheating can mean a lot of air pollution, McCabe said. The administration plans to release a detailed budget plan in May.  In March, Trump ordered a review of tough U.S. vehicle fuel-efficiency standards put in place by the Obama administration. The EPA stepped up scrutiny of automakers after Volkswagen admitted to cheating diesel emissions tests in 580,000 U.S. vehicles. VW agreed to pay up to $25 billion in penalties and buyback costs and pleaded guilty in March to felony charges. In September 2015, EPA said it would review emissions from all U.S. diesel vehicles after Volkswagens admission it used secret software to emit up to 40 times allowable emissions.     That review prompted the allegation by the EPA in January that Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV used undisclosed software to allow excess diesel emissions from 104,000 U.S. trucks and SUVs. Fiat Chrysler denies wrongdoing.     The EPA is also scrutinizing emissions from Daimler AGs Mercedes-Benz vehicles. It has not approved Daimler or Fiat Chryslers request to sell 2017 model diesels.     The EPA has also investigated cases of several automakers overstating mileage on window stickers in recent years. In 2014, the EPA hit Korean automakers Hyundai Motor Co and affiliate Kia Motors Corp with $350 million in penalties for overstating fuel economy ratings.

Trump called NAFTA a disaster throughout the 2016 election campaign, but the plan outlined in a draft notification letter would preserve many of its provisions, including a settlement system for other disputes that circumvents local courts. The U.S. Trade Representatives office circulated the letter with its NAFTA objectives to members of Congress for review.

The AFL-CIO, an umbrella organization of unions representing 12.5 million workers, endorsed Trumps opponent in the presidential election, Hillary Clinton. But the AFL-CIO has long been critical of NAFTA and Trumka, the labor federations president, met with Trump after the election.   Trumka said on Tuesday that the AFL-CIO will judge the Trump administration based on its actions and provide backing when it supports workers. How Trump handles the revamping of NAFTA will be the real test, Trumka said.

Brockmeyer, a 17-year veteran of the SEC, has led the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) unit since 2011.  The unit was one of five specialty areas created in 2010 in an effort to bolster the SECs enforcement program following revelations over the agencys repeated failures to detect Bernard Madoffs massive Ponzi scheme. Brockmeyer oversaw a wide array of FCPA cases, including charges against hedge fund Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC and its chief executive Daniel Och over bribery in Africa, charges against JPMorgan Chase & Co following the so-called princeling investigation into hiring practices in China in order to win business and charges against Brazilian aircraft maker Embraer SA over bribes paid in a variety of countries. The SEC said that after Brockmeyer departs, the units current deputy chief Charles Cain will serve as acting chief until a permanent replacement is named. The SECs enforcement of the FCPA is an area that is being actively watched by the defense bar, after President Donald Trump previously made disparaging remarks about the law and called for it to be changed. Trumps pick to lead the SEC, Wall Street attorney Jay Clayton, also previously chaired a committee at the New York City Bar Association which drafted a paper that was somewhat critical of how the law was being enforced. Clayton, whose nomination was approved by the Senate Banking Committee earlier on Tuesday, is still awaiting confirmation by the full Senate. Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee have previously raised concerns about whether he will actively pursue FCPA cases. In written responses to questions from the panels top Democrat Sherrod Brown following his confirmation hearing, Clayton said he believes the law can be a powerful and effective means to combating corruption.  He added, however, that it is more effective when international authorities are also willing to coordinate and take enforcement actions against bribery, as opposed to having the United States go at it alone.

We have had no such indication, David OSullivan, the head of the EU mission to the United States, told a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on how the United States and EU could work together to push back against Russian aggression. I think there is still remarkable unity of purpose between the United States and the European Union with regard to those issues, OSullivan said. Allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russian actors were behind the hacking of senior Democratic Party operatives and spreading disinformation during the 2016 U.S. presidential election have lingered over Trumps tenure. Democrats charge the Russians wanted to tilt the election toward the Republican, who worried lawmakers from both parties during his campaign by calling for warmer relations with Russia. Trump has dismissed that claim, and Russia denies the allegations. During the hearing, Corker questioned the wisdom of legislation to impose more sanctions on Russia over its aggressive actions in Ukraine and Syria. Senator Ben Cardin, the foreign relations committees top Democrat, drafted such a bill earlier this year. It is sponsored by both Democrats and Republicans. Corker asked OSullivan whether it would be preferable for the United States to act unilaterally or work with the European Union on such sanctions. OSullivan said close coordination would be preferable. We have moved in lockstep throughout this process and I think that has not only ensured of the right political response, but also the effectiveness of the sanctions, OSullivan said. Some of the ideas that have been discussed could have a serious impact on the European energy sector, he said. Many of our member states are heavily dependent upon imports from Russia and it would be very important not to destabilize that situation, OSullivan said.

The bill comes amid rising concern among civil liberties advocates about the effect on privacy of border searches of social media information, photos and email held on phones and laptops, which have grown in frequency in recent years and do not require a warrant.  President Donald Trumps administration has fanned those concerns as it has sought to implement extreme vetting security checks to restrict the flow of immigrants and refugees into the United States, an effort that has included consideration of a requirement that visitors share their social media passwords.  In addition to foreign visitors, media reports in recent months have suggested digital data of Americans re-entering the country has also been subject to added scrutiny. Numbers maintained by the Department of Homeland Security show border searches of phones have spiked in recent years, and official documents show the agency is able to extract data from some mobile devices, including those protected by passwords. Generally, U.S. law enforcement is required to obtain a warrant before it can search electronic devices of an American. A unanimous 2014 U.S. Supreme Court decision affirmed that a search and seizure of an arrested persons cell phone was unconstitutional without a warrant. But a so-called border search exception allowed federal authorities to conduct searches within 100 miles (160 km) of a U.S. border without a warrant. The Protecting Data at the Border Act would seek to limit the exception by requiring a warrant before searching devices at the border that belong to a U.S. citizen of permanent resident, except in some emergency circumstances. It would not apply to foreigners with valid U.S. visas who are entering the country or people who are applying for U.S. visas. The bill would also bar officials from delaying or denying entry into the United States if a person refused to share passwords, personal information numbers, social media or online account information or access credentials. Democratic Senator Ron Wyden and Republican Senator Rand Paul sponsored the legislation, while Democratic Representative Jared Polis and Republican Representative Blake Farenthold introduced the bill in the House. Despite attracting bipartisan sponsors, it was not clear whether the measure would be able to earn enough Republican support to advance in the Republican-controlled Congress. A border stop shouldnt be an excuse for extreme surveillance such as downloading the entire contents of your phone, said Greg Nojeim, senior counsel at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a Washington civil liberties organization that supports the legislation.

U.S. District Judge Richard Berman said at a hearing on Tuesday in Manhattan federal court that he will hold another hearing, likely later this month, into whether conflicts of interest prevent the two men from effectively representing the trader, Reza Zarrab. Giuliani and Mukasey will not appear in court or help prepare for Zarrabs trial, Benjamin Brafman, another of Zarrabs lawyers, said at the hearing. Instead, he said, they are seeking a diplomatic solution to the case. The two men traveled to Turkey shortly after Feb. 24 to meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Giuliani, an ally of President Donald Trump, discussed the trip in advance with then-U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, who brought the charges against Zarrab, Brafman said, while Mukasey conferred with Attorney General Jeff Sessions. No one was trying to hide their involvement, Brafman said. Zarrab is accused of conspiring to conduct illegal transactions through U.S. banks on behalf of Irans government and other Iranian entities. Prosecutors said in a court filing last week that eight of those banks were clients of Giuliani or Mukaseys firms, and that Giulianis firm is a registered agent of Turkey, raising potential conflicts. Brafman said in a response the issue quite frankly is none of the Governments business. But Berman said at Tuesdays hearing that it was unquestionably the business of the court. At the hearing, Brafman argued that Zarrab had an absolute right to meet with anyone he chose. If he had chosen to meet with another lawyer without telling anyone, there would be no issue, Brafman said. Hes interviewed half the lawyers in America, so thats not so much of a hypothetical, Brafman joked, alluding to Zarrabs hiring of more than a dozen lawyers at major firms. The dispute highlights the politically charged nature of the case, which expanded in scope last week with the arrest of an executive at a Turkish state-owned bank accused of conspiring with Zarrab. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu criticized that arrest as political. Zarrab, a dual national of Iran and Turkey, had previously been arrested in 2013 in a corruption probe of people tied to Erdogan, then prime minister of Turkey.

Republicans in Congress last week narrowly passed the repeal of the privacy rules with no Democratic support and over the strong objections of privacy advocates. The signing, disclosed in White House statement late on Monday, follows strong criticism of the bill, which is a win for AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc. The bill repeals regulations adopted in October by the Federal Communications Commission under the Obama administration requiring internet service providers to do more to protect customers privacy than websites like Alphabet Incs Google or Facebook Inc. The rules had not yet taken effect but would have required internet providers to obtain consumer consent before using precise geolocation, financial information, health information, childrens information and web browsing history for advertising and marketing. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai praised the repeal in a statement late on Monday for having appropriately invalidated one part of the Obama-era plan for regulating the internet. Those flawed privacy rules, which never went into effect, were designed to benefit one group of favored companies, not online consumers. Pai said the FCC would work with the Federal Trade Commission, which oversees websites, to restore the FTCs authority to police internet service providers privacy practices. Republican FCC commissioners have said the Obama rules would unfairly give websites the ability to harvest more data than internet service providers. The action is the latest in a string of reversals of Obama administration rules. On Monday, the FCC reversed a requirement that Charter Communications Inc extend broadband service to 1 million homes that already have a high-speed provider. On Friday, Comcast, Verizon AT&T Inc said they would voluntarily not sell customers individual internet browsing information. Verizon does not sell personal web browsing histories and has no plans to do so but the company said it has two advertising programs that use de-identified customer browsing data, including one that uses aggregate insights that might be useful for advertisers and other businesses. The American Civil Liberties Union said last month Congress should have opposed industry pressure to put profits over privacy and added most Americans believe that their sensitive internet information should be closely guarded. Trade group USTelecom Chief Executive Jonathan Spalter in a statement praised Trump for stopping rules that would have created a confusing and conflicting consumer privacy framework. Last week, 46 Senate Democrats urged Trump not to sign the bill, arguing most Americans believe that their private information should be just that.    Republicans later this year are expected to move to overturn net neutrality provisions that in 2015 reclassified broadband providers and treated them like a public utility - a move that is expected to spark an even bigger fight.

The town hall is an opportunity to discuss policies to create a pro-business climate with top Partnership CEOs from all industries, White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said  Trump has held a series of meetings with chief executives and other business leaders since taking office in January as he has prodded companies to add U.S. jobs and asked how government could reduce regulations to boost economic growth.  The town hall is scheduled to last an hour and 45 minutes and include banking, private equity and hedge funds, insurance companies and others. Also taking part will be Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Ivanka Trump, the presidents daughter and a senior adviser. Among the business leaders attending are senior executives from General Electric, Hearst, HSBC Bank USA, Interpublic Group, Vornado Realty Trust, Centerbridge Partners and Paulson & Co.   Trump, who was a real estate mogul before entering the White House, has pledged to use his business acumen to revitalize the American economy and create millions of jobs. While the Republican president has begun the process of rolling back some labor and environmental regulations that he said were harming businesses, the administration has yet to secure a significant legislative victory to support his efforts to boost the economy.         Trump has also proposed sweeping cuts in government regulations and signed an executive order to roll back some energy rules. Last week, the White House said Trump had named his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, already a White House senior adviser, to take on the additional task of overseeing an effort to overhaul the federal government.

Among those whom Clayton was in touch with was Peter Thiel, a Trump donor and Silicon Valley entrepreneur who co-founded Palantir Technologies, which has a contract with the SEC that Clayton may one day have to review, according to written answers from Clayton in response to questions from the Senate Banking Committees top Democrat, Sherrod Brown. Claytons responses followed his confirmation hearing before the committee on March 23. Clayton wrote that he communicated on a substantive basis with current members of the Trump administration and other former transition officials including Thiel. He did not elaborate about the nature of the communications. In 2015, Palantir, based in Palo Alto, California, won a more than $43 million contract with the SEC to provide data mining services, according to public records. The contract was for five years, with years two through five being optional, an SEC spokeswoman told Reuters at the time.  If confirmed as SEC chairman, Clayton will have direct authority over contracting matters for the agency. A spokesman for Clayton declined to comment. Palantir did not respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for the White House referred all questions to spokesmen for Clayton. Clayton also disclosed in his written responses that he communicated with others, including Rebekah Mercer, a Trump donor whose father, Robert Mercer, founded the hedge fund Renaissance Technologies; Genie Energy Ltd President Ira Greenstein; venture capitalist Darren Blanton; Martin Silverstein, a lawyer who is senior counsel with the law firm Greenberg Taurig and who was ambassador to Uruguay for four years under President George W. Bush; Trumps current chief strategist Steve Bannon; and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, the documents show. I believe it is fair to presume that one or more of these individuals may be affiliated with one or more public companies or other companies that are regulated by the SEC, Clayton wrote. He did not address whether any of the individuals may also have a financial stake in SEC contracts. The disclosure of his communications with Thiel come just one day before the Senate Banking Committee is set to vote on whether to send Claytons nomination to the full Senate. He is still expected to be approved by the committee and later by the full Senate.  The issue has the potential to stoke deeper concerns among some Democrats on the panel who already have misgivings about possible conflicts of interest. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat from Nevada, told Reuters in a statement that Clayton should disclose more details about his talks with Thiel.  We must be sure that no commitments or deals were made between Mr. Thiel and Mr. Clayton, especially pertaining to Thiels companys pending business before the SEC, she said.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Top White House officials met moderate and conservative Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives on Monday in an effort to revive a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare. Key members of the administration, including Vice President Mike Pence, invited a group of moderate Republicans known as the Tuesday Group to the White House. Pence then went to Capitol Hill to meet the Freedom Caucus, a group of House conservatives who last month derailed a healthcare bill backed by President Donald Trump. The White House would like to see a revised bill come up for a vote as early as weeks end, before the House breaks for a spring recess, and the text of the new proposal could be ready some time on Tuesday, lawmakers said. It was clear the president would be very happy come Friday to have this passed, said U.S. Representative Chris Collins, a member of the Tuesday Group and a Trump ally.  This could move fairly quickly, he said. Just 10 days ago, House Speaker Paul Ryan was forced to cancel a vote on a bill to replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, when it was clear he could not deliver the votes needed for it to pass. The defeat was a big political setback for Trump and fellow Republicans in Congress who were elected on pledges to repeal  and replace former Democratic President Barack Obamas signature healthcare law. Freedom Caucus members said the Republican bill was too similar to Obamacare, while moderate Republicans balked at some of the changes conservatives sought. Trump attacked Freedom Caucus members on Twitter late last week for their opposition to the bill and threatened to work to defeat them in the 2018 congressional elections. At the weekend, he struck a more conciliatory tone, tweeting early on Sunday: Talks on Repealing and Replacing Obamacare are, and have been, going on, and will continue until such time as a deal is hopefully struck. After golfing with the president on Sunday, Republican Senator Rand Paul, a sharp critic of the Republicans previous healthcare bill, also expressed renewed hope the healthcare bill could be revised in a way that picked up support from the conservative and moderate factions of the Republican Party. Paul told reporters he was very optimistic that we are getting closer and closer to an agreement repealing Obamacare. Pence and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus laid out the administrations revised healthcare plan during a 40-minute meeting with Freedom Caucus members, said Congressman Mark Meadows, the leader of the conservative group. Meadows said he was intrigued by the new plan, which would allow states to opt out of some of Obamacares mandates, possibly by obtaining waivers. Were encouraged ... but would certainly need a whole lot more information before we can take any action either in support or in opposition, Meadows told reporters. He expected to see a detailed draft of the proposal within 24 hours, he said. In the earlier meeting with the moderate Tuesday Group, White House officials said the new plan would preserve Obamacares essential health benefits clause, or services and care that insurers must cover, but states could apply for a waiver if they could show it would improve coverage and reduce costs, according to Collins. Trump aides also discussed directing funds from the $115 billion stability fund for states into high-risk pools for people with pre-existing health conditions to better ensure insurance premiums come down in cost, Collins said. Its an acknowledgement that they were chasing votes with the Freedom Caucus and the Far Right and then ended up losing votes with those of us who are typically the most reliable votes, Collins said of the proposal provisions discussed at the meeting.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) - When U.S. President Donald Trump meets Chinese President Xi Jinping this week, their summit will be marked not only by deep policy divisions but a clash of personalities between Americas brash tweeter-in-chief and Beijings cautious, calculating leader. They may have one thing in common: their rhetoric about restoring their nations to greatness. But the two men differ in almost every other respect, from their political styles to their diplomatic experience, adding uncertainty to what has been called the worlds most important bilateral relationship. Five months after his election on a stridently anti-China platform, Trump appears to have set himself on a course for collision rather than conciliation with Xi, raising doubts as to whether the worlds two biggest economies can find common ground. Topping the agenda at Trumps Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida will be whether he will make good on his threat to use crucial U.S.-China trade ties to pressure Beijing to do more to rein in its nuclear-armed neighbor North Korea, which is working to developmissiles capable of hitting the United States. Trump, a 70-year-old former real estate magnate with no foreign policy experience before entering the White House, has tweeted that it will be a very difficult meeting with the veteran Communist Party leader seven years his junior, given Chinese trade practices he says are killing U.S. jobs. He has also demanded that Beijing do more to solve the North Korean problem  his biggest national security challenge - or he will act alone to deal with Pyongyangs nuclear and missile programs. Some White House aides believe Trumps son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner could be an influential moderating voice on how he handles Xi in their talks on Thursday and Friday. Contacts between Kushner and Chinas U.S. envoy helped smooth the way for the meeting, according to current and former U.S. officials. Even so, what worries the protocol-conscious Chinese more than policy clashes is the risk that the unpredictable Trump could publicly embarrass Xi, after several foreign leaders experienced awkward moments with the new U.S. president. Ensuring President Xi does not lose face is a top priority for China, a Chinese official said. U.S. presidents meetings with their Chinese counterparts are usually more tightly scripted than with other foreign leaders, something Chinese officials insist on to make sure they are treated with the decorum they believe befits a global power. This summit should offer a study in contrasts: Trump impatient, outspoken and prone to angry tweet-storms; Xi, outwardly calm and measured, with no known social media presence. Their shared nationalist tendencies could aggravate  friction between their countries, which are increasingly global rivals. Trump insists the United States has been cheated economically for decades by countries like China and must regain its luster, while Xi wants China, once an ancient empire, to be able to flex its muscles on the world stage. Xi and Trump are not natural friends, said a former senior U.S. official specializing in Asia. The question is when Trumps Make America Great Again hits Xis Chinese Dream, whats the result? It remains unclear how far Trump will go in translating populist rhetoric into policy that steps up pressure on China, given the risk of a trade war neither country can afford. But aides say he wont pull his punches, especially on trade, on which he has held an outspoken view for decades. This adds to doubts as to whether the two leaders can find  common ground on North Korea and Chinas expansive claims in the South China Sea. Some analysts question whether Trump can get the better of Xi, who was born into a life of politics and has a reputation for being a tough tactician. Xis performed pretty well in these types of environments, said Christopher Johnson, a China expert and former CIA analyst at Washingtons Center for Strategic and International Studies. While Trump has been in office little more than 10 weeks, Xi has honed his U.S. strategy since assuming the Chinese leadershipin 2013. The son of a revolutionary leader, Xi has sought to project the image internationally of a strong advocate of globalization at a time when Trump has stoked fears ofU.S. protectionism. Still, Chinese officials are mindful of the pitfalls if Trump veers off-script. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe found himself in a long, uncomfortable handshake at the White House in February, and Trump appeared to ignore German Chancellor Angela Merkels offer of a handshake during their meeting last month. An acrimonious call between Trump and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull caused particular concern in Beijing, officials there say.  Still, the decision to hold a summit so early in Trumps presidency suggests both Washington and Beijing see the value of trying to build a personal relationship between the two leaders. Trump goes into the meeting with significant gaps in histeam of Asia advisers and his China policy still not fully formulated. Hardliners like trade adviser Peter Navarro, who authored a book Death by China, have feuded over the administrations approach to China with more pragmatic aides such as economic adviser Gary Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs president, current and former U.S. officials say. Administration officials argue Trump can use his Art of the Deal sales techniques to convince Xi that China needs the United States more than the United States needs China, especially when it comes to market access. But analysts say the Chinese are shrewd enough at geopolitics to fend off U.S. demands. Xi may also see Trump politically weakened by his high-profile legislative failure on healthcare as well as his low public approval ratings. Trump has already backed down on Chinas most sensitive issue - Taiwan - having first infuriated Beijing by suggesting he might not abide by Washingtons long-standing one China policy. Trump may now feel he is owed a favor in return. A fence-mending phone call in February was arranged by Kushner and Chinas U.S. ambassador, Cui Tiankai, officials say, after Cui invited Trumps daughter Ivanka to the Chinese Embassys Lunar New Year reception, where her daughter sang in Mandarin. Both sides are keeping expectations low for tangible outcomes from the summit, billed as informal get to know you meetings similar to the 2013 Sunnylands summit in California between Xi and Trumps predecessor, Barack Obama. And whatever else, unlike Abes February visit to Mar-a-Lago, there will be no golf diplomacy: Chinas Communist Party associates golf with shady dealings and has sought to stop officials from playing it as part of Xis fight against corruption.

A joint statement said the two leaders agreed on the importance of advancing peace throughout the Middle East, including in Libya, Syria, and Yemen, and expressed interest in supporting Israel and the Palestinians in moving toward peace. I just want to let everybody know in case there was any doubt that we are very much behind President Sisi. Hes done a fantastic job in a very difficult situation. We are very much behind Egypt and the people of Egypt, Trump said in an Oval Office meeting with the Egyptian leader. The trip was Sisis first official U.S. visit since being elected president in 2014. Trumps predecessor, Barack Obama, never extended an invitation. Obama froze aid to Egypt for two years after Sisi, then a general, overthrew President Mohamed Mursi in mid-2013 after mass protests against Mursis rule. Mursi, a Muslim Brotherhood member, had been elected the previous year. The one-on-one meeting between Trump and Sisi, followed by a separate gathering with top aides, showed how intent the new U.S. president is on rebooting the bilateral relationship and building on the strong connection the two presidents established when they first met in New York last September. I just want to say to you, Mr President, that you have a great friend and ally in the United States, and in me, Trump said. Sisi said he appreciated that Trump has been standing very strong ... to counter this evil ideology. The joint statement said Trump and Sisi agreed that Islamist militants could not be defeated solely by military force. It said the leaders agreed on the necessity of recognizing the peaceful nature of Islam and Muslims around the world. While Trump noted the United States and Egypt have a few things they do not agree on, he made no public airing of U.S. concerns about human rights in Egypt. Rights groups have called for the release of Aya Hijazi, an Egyptian-American who works with street children and was arrested in May 2014 on human trafficking charges. Hijazi has been held in custody for 33 months in violation of Egyptian law, which states that the maximum period for pre-trial detention is 24 months. A senior administration official said the subject of Hijazi did not come up in the meeting with Trump, Sisi and their advisers, but said the detention was an issue of concern and a case that was being watched closely by the Trump administration. At the United Nations in New York, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, said the Trump administration was not backing away from human rights because they fully support me speaking about human rights in the Security Council. Human rights groups have estimated that Sisis government has detained at least 40,000 political prisoners. Egypt has long been one of Washingtons closest allies in the Middle East, receiving $1.3 billion in U.S. military aid annually. It is fighting an Islamist insurgency in Sinai in which hundreds of Egyptian soldiers and police have been killed. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

In a letter to U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, the State Department said it was dropping the funding because the U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA) supports, or participates in the management of, a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. The cut marks U.S. President Donald Trumps first move to curtail funding for the United Nations and is likely to raise further questions about how deep those cuts will eventually go throughout the organization, where the United States is the top donor.    It comes after Trump in January reinstated the so-called Mexico City Policy that withholds U.S. funding for international organizations that perform abortions or provide information about abortion. Known by critics as the global gag rule, Trump broadened its scope to include all global health assistance in his Jan. 23 executive order that withholds at least half a billion dollars in U.S. funds. A lack of clarity around the rule, however, has left aid groups scrambling and both Republican and Democratic U.S. lawmakers seeking clarity. In a statement on its website, UNFPA said it regrets the U.S. decision to end funding, which it said is based on an erroneous claim that the agency supports coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization in China. UNFPA said its mission is to ensure that every pregnancy is wanted, every childbirth is safe and every young persons potential is fulfilled.  The support we received over the years from the government and people of the United States has saved tens of thousands of mothers from preventable deaths and disabilities, and especially now in the rapidly developing global humanitarian crises, the statement said. The cut follows Trumps proposed 28 percent budget reduction for diplomacy and foreign aid, including an unspecified reduction in financial support for the United Nations and its agencies, announced last month.        U.N. agencies such as the UNFPA are funded by governments voluntarily. The United States was the fourth-largest voluntary donor to UNFPA in 2015, giving $75 million in core budget and earmarked contributions. U.N. officials have warned that abrupt funding cuts could trigger more global instability and argued that dollars for diplomacy are more effective than military spending in combating terrorism.

A White House official said Trump may still do more on the program.  Trump had promised to end the lottery system for H1B visas, which gives each applicant an equal chance at 65,000 positions each year. Lobbyists for businesses who rely on H1B visas, commonly used by the tech sector, had expected Trump to upend the lottery in favor of a system that prioritized workers who are highly skilled and would be highly paid in the United States. The lottery for fiscal year 2018 opened on Monday without changes. The start of the lottery was seen by those watching the issue as the unofficial deadline for the Trump administration to enact H1B visa reform, and the failure to meet that deadline signals that Trumps promised overhaul of the system may be off the table or long delayed.  More oversight is a good start, but employers can still use the program legally to depress wages and replace American workers. That falls short of the promises President Trump made to protect American workers, said Peter Robbio, a spokesman for Numbers USA, a Washington-based group that advocates for limiting immigration into the United States.  The Trump administration has taken other steps to crackdown on H1B visa abuse, such as issuing a Justice Department warning to employers and announcing plans to increase transparency on applicants. These are important first steps to bring more accountability and transparency to the H1B system, a White House official said. The administration is considering several additional options for the president to use his existing authority to ensure federal agencies more rigorously enforce all aspects of the program. Tech companies rely on the program to bring in workers with special skills and have lobbied for an expansion of the number of H1B visas awarded.  Proponents of limiting legal immigration, including Trumps senior adviser Stephen Miller, have argued the program gives jobs that Americans could fill to foreign workers at a less expensive cost.  The measures announced by DHS on Monday focus on site visits by U.S. authorities to employers who use H1B visas.  In future site visits, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agents will investigate incidents where an employers basic business information cannot be validated; businesses that have a high ratio of H1B employees compared with U.S. workers; and employers petitioning for H1B workers who work off-site.

(Reuters) - New York lawmakers on Monday passed an emergency spending plan authorizing Governor Andrew Cuomo to pay bills and keep the state government operating for the next two months. The state was supposed to have a budget at the start of its fiscal 2018 on Saturday, but the legislature and Cuomo failed to agree on a comprehensive plan as they debated broader policies. Mondays stopgap, 1,700-page extender budget avoids a government shutdown through May 31, assuring that state agencies and contractors will provide services and roughly 200,000 state employees will get paid despite the impasse. The full budget has been delayed in part by debate over raising the age of adult criminal responsibility to 18, which would leave North Carolina as the only state to automatically prosecute and imprison 16- and 17-year-olds as adults regardless of the crime. There are political and ideological differences between the Senate and Assembly. We must resolve these issues. A complete budget requires it, Cuomo, who supports lifting the age, said in a statement late on Sunday. Lawmakers and Cuomo have been divided over other issues, including a replacement for an expired program that gives tax breaks to affordable housing developers and extending a so-called millionaires tax on wealthy New Yorkers.     Cuomo also laid some blame on uncertainty about Washingtons policies, including any revised effort to overhaul the Affordable Care Act, which could strip New York of at least $4.6 billion of Medicaid and other funding. New York State is a target for hostile federal actions ranging from severe financial cutbacks to deprivation of legal and personal rights, said Cuomo, a Democrat who is widely touted as a possible 2020 presidential candidate. Assembly member Fred Thiele Jr., an Independent who caucuses with Democrats, was one of several lawmakers to criticize the inclusion of policy initiatives in the budget legislation, saying from the legislative floor during voting on the bill that we are not the platform committee for Cuomo 2020. They should not be forced down the throat of the legislature as part of the budget process, Thiele said during the session. The national stage is watching, said Assemblymember Diana Richardson, a Democrat from Brooklyn, who voted against the extension. The budget extension authorizes $40 billion in state spending, including $10.3 billion in state appropriations, $12.4 billion aid to local governments and $17.3 billion in capital projects. Lawmakers want to get the budget done this week. Whenever it arrives, it will be by far the latest budget since Cuomo took office in 2011. The Republican-led Senate and Democrat-dominated Assembly endorsed the extension overwhelmingly, but many said they did so reluctantly to avoid a government shutdown. Some were sour on the length of the extension or that it allows for $8.9 billion in new debt over the next two months.     The measure authorizes billions of dollars in bond financing for bridges and infrastructure projects. Cuomo and lawmakers are also close to a deal on plans to allow car-hailing services such as Lyft and Uber outside New York City, where they are already permitted, Assemblymember Kevin Cahill, a Democrat from Kingston who chairs the Assembly Insurance Committee, said in an interview on Monday after the voting session.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions threatened on Monday to strip U.S. Justice Department grants from cities and other local governments that choose to shield illegal immigrants from  deportation efforts under President Donald Trump. His remarks were aimed at dozens of cities and other local governments, including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, that have joined a growing sanctuary movement aimed at protecting immigrant communities. Tuesdays meeting in New York marked the second straight day of brainstorming on the immigration issue by leaders of some of Americas biggest urban centers. Public officials, liberal activists and academics from around the country shared information on a host of issues. Topics discussed included when and how to challenge requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to hold illegal immigrants under arrest, for separate local offenses. Attendees came from California, Texas, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Washington State and elsewhere. Sanctuary cities in general offer safe harbor to illegal immigrants and often do not use municipal funds or resources to advance the enforcement of federal immigration laws. Sanctuary city is not an official designation. Federal records show the Justice Department doled out $1 billion to state governments and $430 million to nonprofits in 2016, but only $136 million directly to cities and counties. Crime is generally lower in sanctuary counties, according to a study presented by University of California San Diego assistant professor Tom Wong. He said the findings echoed those of law enforcement officials themselves, since they have found they are more effective when they can focus on day-to-day policing instead of immigration enforcement. Chicago City Council member Carlos Ramirez-Rosa said that although his city is a sanctuary jurisdiction, immigration agents raided a home there on Monday where eight people, including three children, were sleeping. The agents shot and wounded Felix Torres, though he was not the person agents were seeking, Ramirez-Rosa said.

Brady said the meeting has nothing to do with the healthcare debacle on March 24, when the Republican-controlled House pulled legislation to repeal and replace the healthcare law known as Obamacare when it became clear that Republicans would fall short of the votes needed. Trump blamed the failure on hardline Republican conservatives who opposed the bill and threatened to reach out to Democrats. But the Trump administration has signaled an interest in finding bipartisan support for tax reform legislation, billed as the first comprehensive overhaul of the U.S. tax code since 1986. The White House has also shown signs of moving away from the House tax reform blueprint backed by Brady and House Speaker Paul Ryan, informing Republican lawmakers on March 16 that all options were on the table.  The House blueprint, which Democrats oppose, calls for sweeping changes and tax cuts that would mainly benefit the wealthy. But it has divided the business community and Republicans over a border adjustment tax provision that would impose a 20 percent tax on imports while exempting export revenues from tax. White House officials told lawmakers last month that they were seriously considering other options, including deficit-funded tax cuts and a European-style value-added tax for businesses.

EXPORT-IMPORT BANK Trumps office says he plans to revive the hobbled Export-Import Bank of the United States, a victory for American manufacturers such as Boeing Co and General Electric Co that have overseas customers that use the agencys government-backed loans to purchase their products. Top Wall Street bankers say they are having positive discussions about financial regulation in Washington, and downplay the idea U.S. policymakers may force their institutions to split up. The United States is pushing for trade to be a key issue in top-level economic talks with Japan, a source says, an unwelcome development for Tokyo, which is seeking to fend off U.S. pressure to reduce the bilateral trade imbalance. Trumps administration has focused on one group of illegal immigrants more than others: women with children, according to eight Department of Homeland Security officials interviewed by Reuters about agency planning.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats on Monday corralled enough support to hold up a Senate confirmation vote on President Donald Trumps Supreme Court nominee but Republicans threatened to change the Senate rules to ensure conservative judge Neil Gorsuch gets the lifetime job. The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 11-9 along party lines to send Gorsuchs nomination to the full Senate, setting up a political showdown this week between Trumps fellow Republicans and the opposition Democrats that appears likely to trigger a change in long-standing Senate rules to allow his confirmation. Democrats, portraying Gorsuch as so conservative he is outside the judicial mainstream, have amassed 42 senators in support of a procedural hurdle called a filibuster requiring a super-majority of 60 votes in the Republican-led, 100-seat Senate to allow a confirmation vote. Even before the panel voted, committee member Christopher Coons put the Democrats over the threshold as the 41st senator backing the filibuster bid. (GRAPHIC - Where senators stand on bid to block Gorsuch vote tmsnrt.rs/2ov6ko0)  The Senates Republican leaders insist Gorsuch will be confirmed on the Senate floor on Friday regardless of what the Democrats do. Republicans hold a 52-48 Senate majority. In the face of the filibuster, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would be expected to force a confirmation vote by having the Senate change its rules and allow for a simple majority vote for confirmation of Supreme Court justices, a move sometimes called the nuclear option that Trump favors. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, leading the filibuster effort, said McConnell should have the vision and courage to see past this impasse and not go nuclear, suggesting that Trump replace Gorsuch with a new consensus nominee chosen after meeting with Democrats. Senate confirmation of Gorsuch, 49, would restore the nine-seat high courts conservative majority, fulfilling one of Trumps top promises during the 2016 presidential campaign. Trump in January nominated Gorsuch, a conservative appeals court judge from Colorado. He could be expected to serve for decades. On the Senate floor, McConnell called the Democratic strategy a new low, saying there was no principled reason to oppose a judge as well qualified and widely respected as Gorsuch. He did not explicitly say he would use the nuclear option, but several Republicans said that would happen. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the decision would be McConnells. Republican Senator John McCain, a long-time opponent of Senate rules changes, told reporters he would support the move. Judiciary Committee Republicans blasted Democrats for pursuing what they called the first partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee - there was a successful bipartisan filibuster five decades ago against a Democratic presidents nominee - and said it would come to naught because of the threatened rule change. But it was Senate Republicans who last year refused to even consider Democratic former President Barack Obamas nomination of appellate judge Merrick Garland to fill the same high court vacancy that Trump has selected Gorsuch to fill. Democrats, including me, are still furious at the way Judge Merrick Garland was treated last year. But the traditions and principles that have defined the Senate are crumbling, and we are poised to hasten that destruction this week, Coons said. Gorsuch was nominated to fill a vacancy created by the February 2016 death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia. Democrats have accused Gorsuch of being insufficiently independent of Trump, evading questions on key Supreme Court rulings of the past including on abortion and political spending, and favoring corporate interests over ordinary Americans. Republicans control the White House and Congress for the first time in a decade. The inability of Senate Republicans to coax enough Democratic support to avoid the nuclear option reflected the intense partisan divide in Washington and the Trump administrations failure to win the cooperation of the opposition party. Senators Dianne Feinstein, the committees top Democrat, and panel member Patrick Leahy, along with fellow Democrats Mark Warner and Ben Cardin, also announced filibuster support on Monday. Spicer accused Democrats of partisan obstruction that sets a very dangerous precedent and told a briefing that were obviously disappointed that the overwhelming majority of them are still playing politics with the nations highest court. The actual confirmation vote would be by a simple majority if the filibuster is stopped. To date, four Democrats oppose a filibuster, four short of the eight that Republicans needed. With the failure of Republican healthcare legislation in Congress and with courts blocking the presidents ban on people from several Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States, winning confirmation for Gorsuch has taken on even more importance for Trump. The 60-vote super-majority threshold that gives the minority party power to hold up the majority party has over the decades forced the Senate to try to achieve bipartisanship in legislation and presidential appointments. Republican committee member Lindsey Graham said, If we have to, we will change the rules, and it looks like were going to have to. I hate that. I really, really do. While Gorsuchs opponents would fight a Senate rule change, it was the Democrats who in 2013 changed the Senate rules to limit filibusters after Republicans used the procedure against Obamas appeals court nominees.  The Senate, then led by Democrats, barred filibusters for executive branch nominees and federal judges aside from Supreme Court justices. Even if Republicans do change the rules, legislation, as opposed to appointments, would still need to meet a 60-vote threshold. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

For Kushner, who has not been to Iraq before, the trip comes at a critical time as Trump examines ways to accelerate a U.S.-led coalition campaign that U.S. and Iraqi officials say has so far been largely successful in uprooting Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria. The visit appears to demonstrate the far-reaching portfolio of Kushner, 36, who is part of Trumps innermost circle and who has been given a wide range of domestic and foreign policy responsibilities, including working on a Middle East peace deal.  Marine General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the U.S. militarys Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he invited Kushner and Tom Bossert, White House homeland security adviser, to accompany him so they could hear first-hand and unfiltered from military advisers about the situation on the ground and interact with U.S. forces.  I said, Hey, next time I go to Iraq, if youre interested, come and itd be good, Dunford said, adding he extended the invitation weeks ago.  That kind of ground-level awareness of the war helps inform strategic decisions, Dunford said, adding it was the same reason he regularly leaves Washington to visit Iraq. The more appreciation you could have for whats actually happening on the ground, the more informed you are when you start talking about the strategic issues, Dunford said. Kushner, who is married to Trumps daughter Ivanka Trump, did not speak with reporters. Trump campaigned on defeating Islamic State but has yet to announce any dramatic shift in war strategy.   After arriving, Kushner joined Dunford for meetings with the U.S. ambassador to Baghdad and the senior American commander in Iraq, Lieutenant General Stephen Townsend.  Dunfords delegation also met Iraqs Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, whose office said their talks focused on the ongoing battle to retake the city of Mosul from Islamic State and U.S.-led coalition assistance, including aiding civilians displaced by the fighting. The delegation affirmed its support to Iraq in the war on terror, Abadis office said in a statement. The trip comes as Iraqi security forces engage in fierce, house-to-house fighting in Mosul, Islamic States last major stronghold in Iraq and the city where leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared a caliphate nearly three years ago. Nearly 290,000 people have fled the city to escape the fighting, according to the United Nations.  Although the loss of Mosul would deal a major defeat to Islamic State, U.S. and Iraqi officials are preparing for smaller battles even after the city is recaptured and expect the group to go underground to fight as a traditional insurgency. What happens to the U.S. military role in Iraq after Mosul is recaptured remain unclear.  Influential Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr has previously called on Iraqs government to order the withdrawal of U.S. and allied forces after the battle of Mosul is over. Dunford said Abadi understood the need for continued U.S. military support. Its not our judgment that the Iraqis will be self sustaining and self sufficient in the wake of Mosul. More importantly, its not Prime Minister Abadis assessment, Dunford said before his talks. Across the border in Syria, a U.S.-backed campaign to isolate Islamic States de facto capital of Raqqa is advancing ahead of an eventual assault on the city.  But in Syria, too, tough decisions await Trump. NATO ally Turkey has been incensed by U.S. support for the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, seen by the U.S. military as a reliable partner but by Turkey as a hostile force with deep links to Kurdish PKK militants who have waged a three-decade insurgency against the Turkish state. The U.S. military has said no decision has been made yet on whether to support the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, which include the YPG, in the Raqqa assault.

The Kansas House of Representatives voted 81 to 44 in favor of overriding the veto, falling three votes short of the 84 needed to advance the override.  State lawmakers in the Republican-controlled senate voted in favor of the measure last week, just days after President Donald Trumps efforts to repeal and replace the ACA, also known as Obamacare, ended with the bill being pulled from a vote. The Republican-controlled House also voted in favor of the measure, but Brownback quickly vetoed the bill on Thursday. The House took up a debate on overriding the veto that day, but postponed a vote until Monday. It is disappointing that the Kansas House failed to override the veto because a small group of representatives chose to side with the Governor instead of the 82% of Kansans who support expanding KanCare and the vast majority of their colleagues in both chambers, David Jordan, the executive director of the Alliance for a Healthy Kansas, a coalition of groups that backed Medicaid expansion, said in a statement on Monday.  Brownback said the measure failed to eliminate waiting lists for disability services, did not add work requirements and was not budget neutral. It also continued to support Planned Parenthood, which provides a range of reproductive services including abortions, which Brownback opposes.   Kansas was not among the 31 states that in 2016 had opted to expand Medicaid, with the federal government footing much of the cost under Obamacare. With the ACAs enhanced federal funding, Medicaid expansion in Kansas, effective Jan. 1, 2018, would cost the state an estimated $31 million in fiscal 2018, which begins July 1, according to estimates cited in a legislative report on the bill. It would cost $67 million in fiscal 2019 with more than 180,000 additional recipients, the report said.   Without enhanced federal matching funds, the states costs would balloon to $465 million by fiscal 2019. Kansas tax collections fell $11.6 million below estimates for March mainly due to lower-than-expected personal income taxes, the states revenue department reported on Monday. However, tax revenue so far in fiscal 2017 was $57.5 million ahead of projections.

The challenge, also joined by environmental groups, came after the U.S. Department of Energy last month delayed standards proposed under the Obama administration to reduce air pollution and operating costs associated with the products. Ten Democratic attorneys general, plus New York City and a Pennsylvania regulator, on Monday notified Energy Secretary Rick Perry of their plan to sue in 60 days for stalling proposed standards for air compressors, commercial boilers, portable air conditioners, power supplies, and walk-in coolers and freezers. The same group, excluding Maryland, on Friday petitioned the federal appeals court in New York to force the administration to implement ceiling fan efficiency standards that were to have taken effect two weeks ago, but have been delayed to Sept. 30. Implementation was delayed after White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus on Jan. 20 directed federal agencies to put new regulations on hold until their new leaders could review them. The Obama administration issued a similar directive in 2009. The Energy Department said it does not comment on pending litigation. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said adopting the common-sense efficiency standards would dramatically reduce air pollution, including from carbon dioxide, mercury and methane. He said enough electricity would be saved to serve 36 million households annually, and save consumers and businesses close to $24 billion. Leaving the final rules in regulatory limbo has very real, negative economic and environmental consequences, essentially frustrating Congress energy conservation goals, the states said in their letter to Perry. The letter was signed by officials of California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, New York City and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. The Consumer Federation of America, the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Sierra Club on Monday sent Perry a similar letter threatening litigation. Both letters accused the Energy Department of ignoring its obligation under federal law to publish final efficiency rules in the Federal Register. In notices published last month, the Energy Department said Perry had only begun his job on March 3 and needed more time to conduct further review and consideration of new regulations.

New Hampshire banned such selfies in 2014, saying the photos could set the stage for a return of the kind of vote-buying or voter intimidation that was rampant in the 19th century.  The Supreme Court declined to hear the states appeal of a ruling by the Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last September that the law ran afoul of the U.S. Constitutions First Amendment, which guarantees free speech. The state cannot curtail speech based on a hypothetical danger, the appeals court stated. Ballot selfies have become a popular way for voters to show support for favored candidates through postings on social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat.  Three New Hampshire residents who were under investigation for violating the law, including a man who wrote in the name of his dog to express dismay at his choices in the 2014 Republican primary for the U.S. Senate, sued the state that year claiming the measure violated the First Amendment. The 1st Circuit agreed last year, noting that New Hampshire had no complaints of vote-buying or evidence that people were being coerced to vote a certain way. New Hampshires secretary of state, William Gardner, appealed to the Supreme Court, noting that 18 states had laws that in some form prevented voters from displaying their ballots.  Digital photography and social media could allow an invasion of the sanctity of the voting booth and eliminate the anonymity of the secret ballot, Gardner said. With recent advances in technology, ones right to vote freely without fear of retaliation is in jeopardy, Gardner added. Some states, including nearby Rhode Island, have passed laws explicitly allowing ballot selfies, reasoning in part that the trend has helped younger voters show their enthusiasm for the democratic process.

The justices agreed to hear an appeal by roughly 6,000 plaintiffs, who included relatives of non-U.S. citizens killed in such attacks and survivors of the incidents, of a lower court ruling throwing out the litigation. The plaintiffs accused Arab Bank under a U.S. law called the Alien Tort Statute of deliberately financing terrorism, including suicide bombings and other attacks. They are hoping to overturn a 2015 New York federal appeals court ruling that the bank could not be sued under the statute because it is a corporation. The Alien Tort Statute, a law dating back to 1789, lets non-U.S. citizens seek damages in U.S. courts for human rights violations abroad. The lead plaintiff in the case is Joseph Jesner, whose British citizen son was killed at age 19 in a 2002 suicide bombing of a bus in Tel Aviv. The plaintiffs filed several lawsuits under the law in Brooklyn federal court, claiming Arab Bank used its New York branch to transfer money and serve as a paymaster for international terrorists.  The transfers helped Hamas and other groups fund attacks and reward families of the perpetrators between 1995 and 2005, the suits alleged.  The bank said in court papers that the U.S. government has called it a constructive partner in the fight against terrorism financing. The bank said only four transactions out of 500,000 involved designated terrorists by the U.S. government, and they were the result of machine or human error.  The bank also cited a separate 2010 case, Kiobel v Royal Dutch Petroleum, in which the New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that corporations cannot be sued under the Alien Tort Statute.  After reviewing that case, the Supreme Court in 2013 narrowed the laws reach, saying claims must sufficiently touch and concern the United States to overcome the presumption that the Alien Tort Statute does not cover foreign conduct.  But the high court declined to explicitly decide whether the 2nd Circuit ruling on corporate liability was correct.  Based on the Kiobel ruling, the 2nd Circuit threw out the litigation against Arab Bank.  The plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court, urging it to decide once and for all whether or not corporations are shielded over foreign conduct.

In a news conference at the IDBs annual board of governors meeting in Paraguays capital, Asuncion, President Luis Alberto Moreno linked the U.S. decision to a policy shift since Republican President Donald Trump took office in January.  On this occasion, the United States, for various domestic reasons, did not want to participate, Moreno said. He added that the U.S. delegation had indicated at an October 2016 meeting that it was willing to contribute, but that it all depended on the result of the election. Once President Trumps government began, they informed us -at the beginning of February - that the United States would not be making any contribution.  The IDB provides loans to governments and businesses to finance projects ranging from large-scale infrastructure to small businesses. Founded in 1959, it says it is the leading source of development financing for Latin America, lending $11.3 billion and $13.8 billion in 2015 and 2014, respectively.  The Multilateral Investment Fund, or MIF, created in 1993, was instrumental in the development of microfinance and provides technical assistance to small projects aimed at providing economic opportunity to the poor. It was a brainchild of former U.S. President George H.W. Bush, and the United States has historically been its largest donor, the IDB said in a statement.  IDB member countries pledge to renew the funds coffers every several years. At the October meeting, the IDB governors agreed to provide an additional $300 million to keep the fund running from 2019 to 2023.  This marked the first time since the MIFs founding that the United States did not contribute to its fund replenishment, an IDB spokesman confirmed. It comes as Trump has proposed slashing the U.S. foreign aid and diplomacy budget by 28 percent. In the U.S. absence, Latin American and Caribbean countries contributed 55 percent of the total $317 million added to the MIF this year, while Japan pledged $85 million, the IDB said. During the last replenishment in 2007, contributions from Latin America and the Caribbean totaled 8 percent of the $501 million added to the fund. The United States contributed $150 million.

The comments, in an interview published on Sunday by the Financial Times, appeared designed to pressure Chinese President Xi Jinping ahead of his visit to Trumps Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida this week. China has great influence over North Korea. And China will either decide to help us with North Korea, or they wont. And if they do that will be very good for China, and if they dont it wont be good for anyone, Trump was quoted as saying, according to an edited transcript published by the newspaper. Asked what incentive the United States had to offer China, Trump replied: Trade is the incentive. It is all about trade. Asked if he would consider a grand bargain in which China pressured Pyongyang in return for a guarantee the United States would later remove troops from the Korean peninsula, the newspaper quoted Trump as saying: Well if China is not going to solve North Korea, we will. That is all I am telling you. It is not clear whether Trumps comments will move China, which has taken steps to increase economic pressure on Pyongyang but has long been unwilling to do anything that may destabilize the North and send millions of refugees across their border. It is also unclear what the United States might do on its own to deflect North Korea from the expansion of its nuclear capabilities and from the development of missiles with ever-longer ranges and the capacity to deliver atomic warheads. Trumps national security aides have completed a review of U.S. options to try to curb North Koreas nuclear and missile programs that includes economic and military measures but leans more toward sanctions and increased pressure on Beijing to rein in its reclusive neighbor, a U.S. official said. Although the option of pre-emptive military strikes on North Korea is not off the table, the review prioritizes less-risky steps and de-emphasizes direct military action, the official added, saying it was not immediately known if the National Security Council recommendations had made their way to Trump. The White House declined comment on the recommendations. Trump and Xi are also expected to discuss Chinese ambitions in the South China Sea, through which about $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes every year, when they meet on Thursday and Friday. China claims most of the resource-rich South China Sea, while Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims on the strategic waterway. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson spoke on Sunday with Chinas top diplomat, State Councilor Yang Jiechi, about Xis visit and other issues of bilateral and regional importance, a State Department official said on condition of anonymity. Chinas foreign ministry said in a statement on Monday about the call that Yang had described the meeting between Xi and Trump as being of great significance for peace, stability and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and the world at large. Tillerson told Yang that the United States would do its utmost to ensure that the meeting had positive results, the ministry said. Trumps deputy national security adviser, K.T. McFarland, said there was a real possibility North Korea could be capable of hitting the United States with a nuclear-armed missile by the end of Trumps four-year term, the Financial Times reported. McFarlands estimate appeared more pessimistic than those of many experts. The typical estimates are that it will take five years or so, said Siegfried Hecker, a former director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the United States and a leading expert on North Koreas nuclear program. Such estimates are notoriously hard to make both because of the scarcity of intelligence about North Korea and uncertainty about how high a success rate Pyongyang might want for such missiles. John Schilling, a contributor to the 38 North North Korea monitoring project, said Pyongyang might have missiles capable of limited strikes on the U.S. mainland by the end of Trumps term, but it will most likely be a bit later than that. I doubt that any missile they could put into service by the end of 2020 will be very reliable, but perhaps it doesnt have to be - one or two successes out of six launches against the U.S. would be a political game-changer to say the least, Schilling said.

Donnelly joined Senators Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota as the only Senate Democrats to announce support for President Donald Trumps court pick. If confirmed to fill a vacancy created by the February 2016 death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, Gorsuch, 49, an appeals court judge, would restore the nine-seat high courts conservative majority, fulfilling one of Trumps top campaign promises. Most other Democrats have made their opposition clear and 37 senators have indicated support for a filibuster of the nomination, which would force Republicans to come up with 60 votes to move forward. Republicans control the Senate 52-48. Its highly, highly unlikely that hell get to 60, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on NBCs Meet the Press. On Sunday evening, Democratic Senator Jon Tester declared he would vote against Gorsuch. In a statement, the Montana lawmaker said Gorsuch was smart but added: That doesnt make him right for a lifetime appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court. If the planned filibuster holds, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell would only be able to advance the nomination of Gorsuch by changing long-standing Senate rules so it could be approved by a simple majority. McConnell, who also appeared on Meet the Press, declined to rule out that option, which the Republican president has urged, and vowed the Senate would confirm Gorsuch one way or another. What I can tell you is Neil Gorsuch will be confirmed this week. How that happens really depends on our Democratic friends, he said. The Senate Judiciary Committee is set to vote on the nomination on Monday, setting the stage for what McConnell has said will be a vote in the full Senate on Friday.

The review, which was accelerated to have it done before Trumps summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping this week, includes a range of economic and military measures but leans towards new sanctions and increased pressure on Beijing to rein in its neighbor, the official said. The list of recommendations was put together by Trumps National Security Council on his orders and was ready for his consideration, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.  It was not immediately clear if the review had reached the Republican presidents desk or how quickly he would decide on a course of action, which could be delayed by the slow pace at which the administration is filling key national security jobs. The White House declined comment. Trump told the Financial Times in an interview published on Sunday that the United States was prepared to respond to North Korean nuclear threats on its own if China fails to pressure Pyongyang. Trump made clear he would he would urge China to use its influence with North Korea when he meets Xi at his Florida resort on Thursday and Friday for their first face-to-face meeting. The review, which was led by national security adviser H.R. McMaster, proposes a multi-pronged approach aimed at tightening the screws on North Korea economically and militarily, the official said. It will be up to Trump to decide how and when to proceed, and he could also send the review back for further work, the official said. While most details remained under wraps, senior U.S. officials told Reuters recently that options under consideration included tougher sanctions aimed at cutting North Korea off from the global financial system, which could entail secondary sanctions against Chinese banks and firms that do the most business with Pyongyang. The U.S. official said Trump may warn Xi of such moves, including efforts to beef up South Korean and Japanese anti-missile defenses  something Beijing strongly opposes. The Chinese have urged Washington to de-escalate tensions with Pyongyang and to find a way to restart negotiations, but U.S. officials say it would  be premature to resume talks now because it would be seen as a reward to North Korea for bad behavior. The chief U.S. concern is North Koreas efforts to develop an intercontinental nuclear missile that could carry a nuclear warhead and be capable of hitting the United States. Although the long-standing option of pre-emptive military strikes against North Korea is not off the table, the review  gives priority to less-risky steps and de-emphasizes direct military action, the official said. Other steps that have been under consideration are escalating cyber attacks and other covert action aimed at undermining North Koreas leadership, another U.S. source said recently.

In a form signed by Flynn on March 31, the former White House official listed speaking engagements to Russian entities, including the Kremlin-funded RT TV, Volga-Dnepr Airlines and Kaspersky Government Security Solutions Inc, a U.S. subsidiary of Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab. The form, released on Saturday, does not say how much Flynn was paid but the speeches are in a section titled sources of compensation exceeding $5,000 in a year. The speeches were not included in a form that Flynn signed electronically on Feb. 11, which the White House also released. The discrepancy on reporting income linked to Russia could add to the scrutiny the retired general, who was forced to resign his White House post after only 24 days, is already under for his contacts with Russian officials. U.S. intelligence agencies have said Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election in an effort to help Trumps candidacy. Multiple congressional committees and the FBI are looking into Russias involvement. Flynns lawyer, Robert Kelner, said his client was in the process of submitting his financial disclosures forms in the days before he left the White House. That process was suspended when he left. When asked this week to resume the process and finalize the form, he did, Kelner said in an email. He added that it had been far from clear that Flynn was required to itemize each speech.The White House did not respond to a request for comment on Sunday.

Representative Adam Schiff said the Republican president and his aides have instead attempted to throw the focus on the possibility of illegal leaks of classified information and whether Trump or his associates were caught up in incidental collection by surveillance that was targeting foreigners. Congressional committees, along with the FBI, are investigating what U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded were attempts by Russia to influence the Nov. 8 presidential election in Trumps favor. They also are looking at any links between Russia and Trump. Schiff said Trump himself tried to shift Congress focus away from that core mission of foreign intervention. I think his tweets tell the story, Schiff said on CNNs State of the Union. And the story is look over there - at leaks, and look over there - at anything the Obama administration we can claim did wrong on incidental collection or anything else.  But whatever you do, under no circumstances look here, at me or at Russia, he said. Trump has repeatedly used Twitter to attack reports on Russian election meddling as fake news and witch hunts and denounce leakers of classified information on the issue. The real story turns out to be SURVEILLANCE and LEAKING! Find the leakers, Trump said in a Twitter post on Sunday. Republican Senator John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, was asked about Trumps Twitter commentary on the congressional investigations.  Sometimes I think this is a distraction from what we should be doing, Cornyn said on CBS Face the Nation. The Senate panel intends to begin interviewing as many as 20 people, including Jared Kushner, Trumps son-in-law and one of his closest advisers, as early as Monday. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on Sunday there was no evidence of Trump collusion with Russia to win the election. Its time to move on, she told Fox News. On March 4, the president without giving evidence accused his Democratic predecessor, President Barack Obama, of ordering a wiretap of Trump Tower. No elected official, including from Trumps Republican Party, has supported the claim. But the Republican chairman of the House intelligence panel, Devin Nunes, set off a political firestorm on March 23 when he said the communications of members of Trumps transition team were caught up in incidental surveillance targeting foreigners. Nunes refused to share the source of his information, but the New York Times revealed last week that two White House officials provided him with the documents on the surveillance, which Trump said was somewhat vindication of his wiretap claim. Schiff went to the White House on Friday to view the documents. Asked on CNN if he understood why Nunes had issues with the surveillance, Schiff would only say, I dont agree with the chairmans characterization.

Chinese President Xi Jinping is due to have his first meeting with President Donald Trump on April 6-7. Xi and other Chinese officials have pledged to remain in the agreement. To demonstrate the leadership that we have shown on this issue with China and India and other nations is very important and discussions should ensue, Pruitt said on Fox News Sunday, but what Paris represents is a bad deal for this country. Last week, Trump signed an executive order rolling back former President Barack Obamas climate change policies, including the Clean Power Plan to slash carbon emissions from power plants  a key factor in the United States ability to meet its Paris commitments. The executive order did not address the question of whether the United States would remain in the agreement but White House spokesman Sean Spicer said last week a decision would be made before the G7 summit in June. Sources told Reuters that White House officials are getting feedback from fossil fuel companies about the pros and cons of staying in the agreement. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said last week all countries should move with the times and fulfill their promises and earnestly take proactive steps to jointly push the enforcement of this agreement. Pruitt said China and India signed onto the agreement without being required to reduce emissions. Under the agreement each country has submitted a national strategy to meet its own emission reduction goals.         Asked on Sunday to clarify a statement he made last month that carbon dioxide  emitted from fossil fuel power plants  is not a primary contributor to climate change, Pruitt said human activities contribute to that change in some  measure.

A lengthy financial disclosure form released on Friday by the White House, along with scores of others for senior White House staffers, showed the downscale New Jersey roots of the family business run until recently by Ivanka Trumps husband. For instance, in the 12 months before he began his White House employment, Kushner made more than $2,500 in rental income from tenants of Union, New Jerseys Park Lane Mobile Home Park. A small, industrial lot nearby brought in no more than $5,000. In the town of Wayne, New Jersey, Kushner disclosed ownership of a block of street-level apartments that returned more than $15,000, according to the paperwork. Kushners stakes in such holdings were among the smallest he reported. White House ethics officials said the legally required disclosure document gave a snapshot of the assets and positions Kushner held when he entered his new job as adviser to his father-in-law, and before he would have started selling assets that could pose conflicts of interest. Kushners 54-page report also included most of the assets and income of his wife. It covered scores of assets worth six- and seven-figures. The New York Times reported the couples real estate and investment empire was worth as much as $741 million. As reported, Kushners property portfolio did not rival the collection of glitzy hotels, casinos and golf courses owned, controlled or licensed by the president. But Kushner reported an interest in the Puck Building, a landmark in New York City. It was one of his most valuable holdings and delivered millions of dollars in income. Kushners grandfather anchored the family real estate business in northern New Jersey. His father, Charles, built that empire until 2004 when he pleaded guilty to 18 counts of tax evasion, witness tampering and making unlawful campaign donations and was sentenced to two years in prison.

White House ethics officials said the legally required disclosure documents provided a snapshot of assets and positions held by personnel when they first entered their new jobs at the White House, and before they started selling stocks and other assets that could pose conflicts of interest. The White House disclosed Gary Cohn, former Goldman Sachs president and now head of the White House National Economic Council, had assets worth at least $230 million, but possibly much more. Little information was given on several of his assets and only indicated they were worth more than $1 million. Cohn had income ranging from $48 million to nearly $77 million in the year preceding his engagement in the White House, though it could be much higher. Jared Kushners 54-page report  which included most of the assets and income of his wife Ivanka Trump - included scores of assets worth six- and seven-figures. The New York Times reported that the couples real estate and investment empire was worth as much as $741 million. Kushner held executive positions with 266 LLCs, corporations, groups and non-profits, which he has resigned from since January.  Democratic lawmakers have expressed concern about potential conflicts of interest for Kushner, who like Trump is a New York real estate developer. Trump this week officially added his daughter Ivanka to his staff. She had a fashion business and was involved in her fathers global real estate development business, but stepped aside from managing the businesses when her father entered the White House. Senior adviser Steve Bannons pre-White House bank accounts, real estate and other holdings were valued at between $3.3 million and $12.6 million. White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus had assets of between $604,000 and $1.16 million and income of $1.42 million. About $566,000 of his income came from the Republican National Committee and the rest from his partnership in a Milwaukee law firm. Neither Trump nor Vice President Mike Pences assets were included in the documents. Trump has faced questions about conflicts of interest with his hotel and golf course businesses since his election in November. He has handed off control to his two oldest sons, but ethics watchdogs have complained that the arrangements do not go far enough to avoid conflicts, and have urged Trump to divest fully or set up a blind trust for his assets. Trump, a real estate magnate and television celebrity with no political experience before he was elected president, has brought in some high-net-worth people to advise him. For example, Reed Cordish, a Baltimore real estate developer before he become Trumps technology adviser, disclosed pre-White House assets of between $92 million and $798 million. He had income of between $48 million and $55 million. These are incredibly successful individuals, very high-net worth, very sophisticated complex asset structures, numerous sub LLCs, trusts and other items, all of which have to be worked through, a senior White House ethics official told reporters before the data was released. Wealthy senior White House staff have to enter into ethics agreements where they agree to resign from positions and divest from assets. Copies of those agreements were not available. The White House said the independent Office of Government Ethics, which reviews financial disclosures to help executive branch officials avoid conflicts of interest, has classified about 25 percent of Trump White House staffers as having extremely complex reports, meaning the filers are very wealthy. In contrast, only a sliver of the staffers in former Democrat President Barack Obamas White House fell into the extremely complex category, according to pie charts released by the White House. No numbers accompanied the charts.  Almost three-quarters of the Obama White House filers had disclosure statements that were rated simple or moderate while only a third of the Trump filers were in those categories. Not all of Trumps advisers were gold-plated before joining the government. Peter Navarro, Trumps trade adviser, earned a relatively modest $240,000 from University of California-Irvine, with less than $1,000 in royalties from the book Death by China in the past year, and speaking fees from the Casket and Funeral Supply Association and other groups.  Omarosa Manigault, who rose to fame on Trumps reality show the Apprentice and now is a White House adviser, had a modest income under $100,000. The disclosures showed she is a beneficiary of a trust established by her late fiance, actor Michael Clarke Duncan, worth between $1 million and $5 million.  Manigault is currently engaged to a Florida pastor. Forms show she received a wedding dress, veil and accessories worth $25,000 for an appearance on the reality show Say Yes to the Dress.

Democrats are attempting use a procedural hurdle called a filibuster that requires 60 votes to allow a confirmation vote in the 100-seat U.S. Senate. Senate Republicans are hoping to vote on April 7 to confirm the conservative appeals court judge nominated by the Republican president in January.  Democratic Senators Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Brian Schatz of Hawaii came out against Gorsuch on Friday and backed a filibuster. Republicans control the Senate 52-48. But if Democrats can muster 41 votes, they would be able to sustain the filibuster. As of Friday afternoon, 36 Democrats had indicated their support for such a move. Two Democrats have said they support Gorsuch. Another two have voiced opposition to Gorsuch but have not made clear whether they would support a filibuster to block a confirmation vote.  Seven Democrats and one independent, Angus King of Maine, who usually votes with them, have not yet announced their position. If Democrats amass enough support to block a confirmation vote, it would force Republican Senate leaders to try to change the chambers long-standing rules and allow confirmation by a simple majority, a move backed by Trump that is sometimes called the nuclear option. If confirmed by the Senate to fill a vacancy created by the February 2016 death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, Gorsuch would reinstate the nine-seat high courts conservative majority at a time when Republicans control Congress and the White House. McCaskill said in a statement she could not support Gorsuch because a study of his legal opinions revealed a rigid ideology that always puts the little guy under the boot of corporations. McCaskill is up for re-election next year in a state Trump won in the 2016 presidential election. Blumenthal, a member of the Judiciary Committee that held a four-day confirmation hearing last week and will vote on sending the nomination to the Senate floor on Monday, said in a statement Gorsuch has not been forthcoming with senators about his views on key issues, leaving his core beliefs little known.  Instead he has evaded real answers at every turn, Blumenthal said. We must assume that Judge Gorsuch has passed the Trump litmus test - a pro-life, pro-gun, conservative judge. Blumenthal said Gorsuchs refusal to distance himself from right-wing groups raised questions about whether he may be an acolyte of hard-right special interests. Schatz said Gorsuchs record as a judge was troubling and he had not shown he would challenge executive overreach.  His refusal to answer questions on long-decided cases or condemn attacks on the judiciary during the hearing demonstrates that he is outside of the legal mainstream, Schatz said.     Their statements came one day after Gorsuch won his first Democratic support, giving Republicans who control the chamber two of the eight Democratic votes they need to break a filibuster. Senators Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Democrats who face re-election in states that voted for Trump last year, said they would vote for Gorsuch. Trump made the appointment of conservative jurists to the Supreme Court a key promise during the 2016 presidential election. Republicans have defended Gorsuch as well qualified to be a Supreme Court justice and praised his performance during the confirmation hearings.  If the filibuster is beaten, the confirmation vote itself would require a simple majority. Some Democrats have accused Republicans of stealing a Supreme Court seat last year when the Senate refused to consider Democratic former President Barack Obamas nominee to replace Scalia, appellate judge Merrick Garland.

Retired General Michael Flynn, who resigned only 24 days after becoming national security adviser, wants protection against unfair prosecution if he testifies before the intelligence committees of the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives, his lawyer, Robert Kelner, said on Thursday. Testimony from Flynn could help shed light on the conversations he had last year with Sergei Kislyak, Russian ambassador to the United States, while national security adviser for Trumps presidential campaign. U.S. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives intelligence committee, said it was too soon to consider immunity requests. As with any investigation - and particularly one that grows in severity and magnitude by the day - there is still much work and many more witnesses and documents to obtain before any immunity request from any witness can be considered, he said in a statement. Schiff said the House intelligence panel would discuss any request with the Justice Department and the Senate Intelligence Committee, describing such a request a grave and momentous step. Schiff on Friday was allowed to see documents at the White House that previously had been seen only by the Republican chairman of the intelligence committee. Trump, a Republican, said in a tweet that Democrats were instigating the congressional investigations because they were upset about his Nov. 8 victory over their partys candidate, Hillary Clinton. Mike Flynn should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss), by media & Dems, of historic proportion! Trump said. Trump would not comment further when asked about Flynn during a White House meeting with U.S. manufacturers. White House spokesman Sean Spicer was asked at a news briefing if he was concerned that Flynn could provide information that could be harmful to the administration and replied, Nope. He said Trump wanted Flynn to testify to get this matter behind us but declined to say specifically that he should be granted immunity. The president is very clear that he wants Mike Flynn to go and be completely open and transparent with the committee, and whatever it takes to do that he is supportive of, Spicer said. Schiff and an aide went to the White House on Friday at the administrations invitation to review documents that it said  support Trumps contention he and his team were subjected to surveillance by the Obama administration during the presidential campaign. The Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Devin Nunes, has been criticized by his colleagues on the panel  for his handling of the investigation of possible Russian connections, including going to the White House complex independently to review documents on the purported surveillance. While I cannot discuss the content of the documents, Schiff said, if the White House had any concern over these materials, they should have been shared with the full (House and Senate intelligence) committees in the first place as a part of our ordinary oversight responsibilities. He said the material should now be given to both congressional intelligence committees. FBI Director James Comey has said there is no evidence of wiretapping at Trump Tower in New York but that the agency is investigating whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia. Senator Angus King, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, also said it was too soon to discuss immunity. A government official with direct knowledge of the case told Reuters that lawyers for Flynn raised the immunity request roughly 10 days ago with representatives of the Senate panel. Officials told them the committee was not interested in any immunity discussions at that time. The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Flynn had also sought immunity from the Federal Bureau of Investigation in exchange for testimony. Flynn was forced to resign on Feb. 13 for failing to disclose talks with Kislyak about U.S. sanctions on Moscow and misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations, which occurred before Trump took office. Congressional committees and the FBI are looking into allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. election campaign. The Russian government has denied the allegations and denied that it hacked emails of Democratic groups and released information to tip the election toward Trump, who has called for better U.S. relations with Moscow. King, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, defended the investigations in a CNN interview. This is not a witch hunt, he said. This is an effort to get to the truth of some very important questions. There is no doubt whatsoever that the Russians were behind an effort to interfere in our elections, he said.

Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said it was neither reachable nor desirable for Germany to spend the agreed NATO target of two percent of member states economic output on defense. NATO allies have until 2024 to do that. Two percent would mean military expenses of some 70 billion euros. I dont know any German politician who would claim that is reachable nor desirable, Gabriel told the first meeting of NATO foreign ministers attended by Tillerson.  The United States will realize it is better to talk about better spending instead of more spending, he said, noting that humanitarian, development and economic aid to stabilize countries and regions should also count.   In his first remarks to NATO ministers, Tillerson said allies needed to pay up or outline plans for meeting that target when NATO leaders meet on May 25 for the first top-level summit of the alliance to be attended by U.S. President Donald Trump.  Trump has criticized NATO as obsolete and suggested Washingtons security guarantees for European allies could be conditional on them spending more on their own defense. He has also said he wants NATO to do more to fight terrorism.  Our goal should be to agree at the May leaders meeting that by the end of the year all allies will have either met the pledge guidelines or will have developed plans that clearly articulate how...the pledge will be fulfilled, Tillerson said.  Allies must demonstrate by their actions that they share U.S. governments commitment. In Berlin, German government spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said the government was committed to increasing defense spending and would continue to do so because we know it is necessary and makes sense to further strengthen our armed forces. U.S. defense expenditure makes up about 70 percent of the total NATO allies defense spending. Only four European NATO members - Estonia, Greece, Poland and Britain - meet the two-percent target. NATO head Jens Stoltenberg rejected Gabriels call to include non-military spending toward the goal, but said Germany was moving in the right direction with more military spending after years of cuts. He said NATO ministers on Friday discussed national plans for arriving at the target as they prepared for the May summit.  In London, Britains Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said that other European NATO allies must raise their game, and those failing to meet the two-percent commitment... should at least agree to year-on-year real terms increases. Tillerson did, however, offer assurances of Washingtons commitment to NATO during his brief stop in Brussels, where he did not hold one-on-one meetings with countries, which is customary during such gatherings.  His initial decision to skip his first meeting with NATO foreign ministers had added to questions about the Trump administrations commitment. The meeting was later rescheduled and he attended on Friday. The United States is committed to ensuring NATO has the capabilities to support our collective defense, Tillerson said. We will uphold the agreements we have made to defend our allies. Tillerson said NATO was fundamental to countering Russian aggression in Ukraine and said the United States would hold Moscow accountable to its commitments under a two-year Minsk ceasefire deal. He pledged to keep sanctions in place against Moscow until it complies with the Minsk agreement. Trump has said in the past that, as part of a rapprochement he is seeking with Russia, he is prepared to review the sanctions, which were imposed  by Barack Obama over Russias 2014 annexation of Ukraines Crimea Peninsula. We do not, and will not, accept Russian efforts to change the borders of territory of Ukraine, Tillerson said according to a transcript of his remarks. The United States sanctions will remain until Moscow reverses the actions that triggered our sanctions, he added, expressing alarm at a surge in violence along the front lines in eastern Ukraine. Stoltenberg said ties between European NATO members and the United States were rock solid.  He said fair burden sharing to keep the trans-atlantic bond strong and stepping up NATO efforts to project stability and fight terrorism were on the agenda on Friday as the bloc seeks to respond to the new, harsher tone from across the Atlantic.

The Trump administration slams China on a range of trade issues from its chronic industrial overcapacity to forced technology transfers and longstanding bans on U.S. beef and electronic payment services.

Trump seeks to push his plan for fair trade and more manufacturing jobs back to the top of his agenda by ordering a study into the causes of U.S. trade deficits and a clampdown on import duty evasion. Trump has neither a clear White House tax plan nor adequate staff yet to see through a planned tax overhaul, according to interviews with people in the administration, in Congress and among U.S. tax experts.

Lawyers for environmental group the Sierra Club had asked the EPAs Office of Inspector General to check whether Pruitt violated policy when he told a CNBC interviewer on March 9, I would not agree that its a primary contributor to the global warming that we see. The EPA Inspector Generals office responded to the Sierra Club on Thursday in an email, saying it had referred the matter to the EPAs Scientific Integrity Officer, Francesca Grifo, for review. If after the SIO review, she concludes there is some aspect of the letter itself, or her findings or conclusions that she believes are appropriate for further consideration by the OIG, she will so notify the OIG, the email stated. A spokeswoman for the EPA defended Pruitts comments. Administrator Pruitt makes no apologies for having a candid dialogue about climate science and commonsense regulations that will protect our environment, without creating unnecessary regulatory burdens that kill jobs, said Liz Bowman in an emailed statement. Differing views and opinions on scientific and technical matters is a legitimate and necessary part of EPAs decision-making process, which is consistent with EPAs scientific integrity policy that was in place even during the Obama administration, she added.  The EPA website says its scientific integrity policy requires EPA officials and staff to ensure the agencys work respects the findings of the broader scientific community. An overwhelming majority of scientists think that carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels are a major contributor to global climate change, triggering sea level rise, droughts and more frequent violent storms. The request by Sierra Club ramps up tension between the U.S. environmental movement and the administration of President Donald Trump, who has called global warming a hoax meant to weaken the U.S. economy and has packed his cabinet with people who question the science of climate change. Grifo is a biologist who was hired by former President Barack Obamas administration. Before she joined the EPA in late 2013, she oversaw scientific integrity at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a non-partisan group advocating stronger environmental protections.  Pruitt, a former attorney general for Oklahoma, sued the EPA more than a dozen times over its regulations as top prosecutor for the oil and gas producing state.

The moves were disclosed in a letter on Friday to U.S. District Judge Richard Berman, who is overseeing the case in which the trader, Reza Zarrab, is accused of conspiring with others to conduct illegal transactions through U.S. banks on behalf of Irans government and other Iranian entities. The new disclosures highlight the politically charged nature of a case that expanded in scope earlier this week with the arrest in New York of an executive at a Turkish state-owned bank charged with conspiring with Zarrab to evade sanctions.  Zarrab, a dual national of Iran and Turkey, had been arrested in 2013 in a corruption probe of people with close ties to Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was prime minister of Turkey at the time. Erdogan is currently president. In the letter prosecutors said Giuliani and former U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey - both recently added to Zarrabs legal team - traveled to Turkey shortly after February 24 to meet with Erdogan to discuss ways to end the prosecution. Giuliani informed the office of Attorney General Jeff Sessions about the planned trip, according to the letter. Acting U.S. Attorney Joon Kim in Manhattan said that Mukasey and Giuliani, who is a close ally of President Donald Trump, had also sought to meet with other officials in the U.S. government on the issue. Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Mukaseys efforts are aimed at reaching a disposition in the case, Kim wrote in the letter. Kim has sought to question whether Giuliani and Mukasey should be allowed to represent Zarrab given the potential conflicts of interest. Zarrab allegedly victimized at least eight large banks which are current or former clients of Giuliani and Mukaseys law firms. Kim had called earlier this week for a special hearing to make sure Zarrab understands the potential conflict. Benjamin Brafman, an attorney for Zarrab, responded in a letter to the court on Friday, saying he would consent to a limited hearing but stressed that he believed the prosecution had no right to question the actions of Giuliani and Mukasey. That information quite frankly is none of the Governments business, Brafman wrote. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Robert Francis Beto ORourke, a Spanish-speaking, Irish-American representing a predominantly Latino district that includes the border city of El Paso, is considered a long shot in the Republican-dominated state, analysts said.  MORE FROM REUTERS Connecticut may become first state to allow deadly police drones Wayward tabby returning to Denver home after 800-mile adventure British robot helps autistic children with social skills But ORourkes outsider credentials are expected to add flair to the 2018 Senate race in Texas, where a Democrat has not won a state-wide election in more than 20 years. Beto is short for his name in Spanish, Roberto.  This is Cruzs to win. He has got a national fundraising network so he will have all the money in the world, said Cal Jillson, a political science professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.  In a campaign launch from El Paso shown on Facebook Live, the Ivy-League educated ORourke, 44, pledged to fight for veterans, shun corporate money and serve only two terms in the Senate if elected, saying it was in the peoples best interest to have fresh blood in Congress.  ORourke, who played guitar and provided vocals for the punk band Foss in the 1990s, also took a shot at Republican President Donald Trump for his hard-line stance on immigration, vowing to fight when necessary against a president who is focused on building walls, or conducting military immigrant round-ups.  ORourke and Republican Congressman Will Hurd of Texas gained attention on social media earlier this month by live-streaming the journey they made together from Texas to Washington and billing it as 1,600-mile bipartisan road trip. They rented a car and took the trip due to a winter storm that shut East Coast airports.  Polls rate Cruz as the most popular politician in the state among Texans. ORourke does not have much political support outside his base of El Paso, a western Texas city closer to San Diego, California than to Houston.  Another possible challenger to Cruz is Democratic U.S. Representative Joaquin Castro, analysts said.  Just ahead of ORourkes announcement, Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott announced he was endorsing Cruz. Cruz backers later sent out a fundraising email, saying ORourke was out of touch with Texas values.

The executive orders came a week after Trumps promise to replace Obamacare imploded in Congress and a week before he meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Florida, a summit that promises to be fraught with trade tensions.  Trump said at a White House signing ceremony that he and Xi were going to get down to some serious business next week and vowed that the theft of American prosperity by foreign countries would end.  One of the orders directed the Commerce Department and the U.S. trade representative to conduct a 90-day review of the causes of massive U.S. trade deficits. It will study the effects of abuses such as the dumping of products below costs, unfair subsidies, misaligned currencies and non-reciprocal trade practices by other countries. Were going to investigate all trade abuses, and, based on those findings, we will take necessary and lawful action to end those many abuses, Trump said, adding that he wasnt beholden to any businesses. Trump administration officials have said they plan tougher enforcement of U.S. trade remedy laws and will initiate more unilateral trade deals. In his 2016 White House bid, the New York businessman campaigned heavily against free-trade deals and accused China of draining jobs from U.S. factory towns with cheap exports.    Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zheng Zeguang on Friday said the U.S.-China trade imbalance was mostly the result of differences in the two countries economic structures and noted that China had a trade deficit in services. China does not deliberately seek a trade surplus. We also have no intention of carrying out competitive currency devaluation to stimulate exports. Zheng told a briefing about the Xi-Trump meeting. The study of trade abuses appeared aimed at justifying unilateral retaliatory trade actions by the United States, said Matt Gold, a former deputy assistant U.S. trade representative who is now an adjunct trade law professor at Fordham University in New York. They probably think it will give them better political ammunition, Gold said. But he added that it would not likely reveal anything that is not already in the Office of the U.S. Trade Representatives annual list of trade barriers, which also was released on Friday. The report criticized Chinas excess industrial capacity and requirements for technology transfers and cyber security, which it said are aimed displacing foreign products with domestic versions. The trade abuses study will focus on those countries that have chronic goods trade surpluses with the United States.  China tops the list, with a $347 billion surplus last year, followed by Japan, with a $69 billion surplus, Germany at $65 billion, Mexico at $63 billion, Ireland at $36 billion and Vietnam at $32 billion. The study also will examine past trade deals that have failed to produce forecast benefits for the United States, as well as World Trade Organization rules that U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said do not treat countries equally, such as on taxation. The United States has long complained that WTO rules allow exports from other countries to be exempt from value-added taxes (VAT), but do not allow equivalent corporate income tax benefits for U.S. exporters. The Trump administration is considering a border tax that would be levied on imports and which would aim to put the United States on a similar tax basis for trade as countries that have VAT. The second trade order will fight nonpayment and under-collection of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties the United States slaps on many foreign goods. White House National Trade Council Director Peter Navarro said some $2.8 billion in such duties went uncollected between 2001 and the end of 2016 from companies in some 40 countries. Navarro said the order directs the Commerce and Homeland Security departments to close these gaps by imposing tougher bonding requirements to ensure duty collections and new legal requirements for assessing risks associated with importers.

Trump set the tone for what could be a tense meeting at his Mar-a-Lago retreat next week by tweeting on Thursday that the United States could no longer tolerate massive trade deficits and job losses. Trump said the highly anticipated meeting, which is also expected to cover differences over North Korea and Chinas strategic ambitions in the South China Sea, will be a very difficult one. Ahead of the meeting, Trump signed executive orders on Friday aimed at identifying abuses that are causing massive U.S. trade deficits and clamping down on non-payment of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties on imports, his top trade officials said. Separately, the U.S. Trade Representatives office, which is controlled by the White House, said Beijings industrial policies and financial support for industries such as steel and aluminum have resulted in over-production and a flood of exports that have distorted global markets and undermined competitive companies. Seeking to downplay the rift, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang reiterated a desire for cooperation on trade. With regard to the problems existing between China and the United States in trade relations, both sides should in a mutual respectful and mutual beneficial way find appropriate resolutions, and ensure the stable development of Sino-U.S. trade relations, he told a daily news briefing.  The leaders of the worlds two largest economies are scheduled to meet next Thursday and Friday for the first time since Trump assumed office on Jan. 20. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the United States has serious concerns on the U.S. trade relationship with China. This isnt a sit around and play patty-cake kind of conversation, he told reporters. Theyre big issues. Trump wants to have a very good and respectful and healthy relationship, but he also wants to make sure that he tackles the challenges and the problems that are facing American workers, Spicer said. Speaking earlier at a briefing on the Xi-Trump meeting, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zheng Zeguang acknowledged the trade imbalance, but said it was mostly due to differences in their two economic structures and noted that China had a trade deficit in services. China does not deliberately seek a trade surplus. We also have no intention of carrying out competitive currency devaluation to stimulate exports. This is not our policy, Zheng said. State news agency Xinhua also struck a conciliatory tone. Of course, it would be naive to believe that the two sides can bridge their differences in a single diplomatic meeting, it said in an English language commentary on Friday.  Yet as long as the two nations can maintain their good faith, which they have shown recently, to talk and to make concessions based on mutual respect, then no difference would be too difficult to iron out. Trump has frequently accused China of keeping its yuan currency artificially low against the dollar to make Chinese exports cheaper, and stealing American manufacturing jobs. The yuan fell 6.5 percent last year in its biggest annual loss against the dollar since 1994, knocked by pressure from sluggish economic growth and a broadly strong U.S. currency. Trump has resisted acting on a campaign promise to declare China a currency manipulator on his first day in office, but tensions have persisted over how his administrations China policy would evolve. While apprehensive about a trade war, the American business community in China has grown more vocal. Fear of retaliation had once made business lobbies eschew more forceful U.S. trade policies toward China, but such groups have increasingly urged the Trump administration to take targeted action to address market access imbalances. Zheng said domestic consumption in China will increase as it pursues economic reforms, helping to raise demand for foreign goods and services, including those from the United States. This also helps ameliorate the trade imbalance between China and the United States, he said. The trade imbalance could be resolved by improved  cooperation, Zheng said, urging Washington to lift restrictions on civilian technology exports to China and create better conditions for Chinese investment in the United States.  The USTR report, however, accused China of using a range of measures to engineer the transfer of foreign technology to local firms. It said these include denying financial or regulatory approvals to companies using foreign-owned intellectual property or that do not conduct research or make products in China. The report also brought up longstanding complaints about online piracy of movies, books, music, video games and software in China as well as a ban on U.S. beef that has been in place since 2003.

In a letter to Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye made public on Friday, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly gave no indication that agents would stop the arrests. Sessions and Kelly criticized California officials for limiting the cooperation of state and local law enforcement officers with U.S. agents, preventing them from going to jails to pick up illegal immigrants arrested for other crimes.   As a result, ICE officers and agents are required to locate and arrest these aliens in public places, rather than in secure jail facilities, Sessions and Kelly wrote in the letter dated on Wednesday, using the acronym for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Kelly, whose Department of Homeland Security includes ICE, and Sessions, who as attorney general heads the Justice Department, are members of Republican President Donald Trumps Cabinet. Since taking office in January, Trump has widened the net for illegal immigrants to be detained and removed from the country, in keeping with his White House campaign promise. Immigrant rights groups say federal agents have entered courthouses with increased frequency this year, including in California, Massachusetts, Maryland and Texas. California law enforcement officers, including in Los Angeles and San Francisco, decline requests from ICE agents to hold illegal immigrants past their release dates in local jails so they can be transferred to federal custody. The stance of these law enforcement officials conforms with advice from the states two most recent attorneys general. These and other sanctuary jurisdictions that opt not to cooperate with federal immigration agents have drawn fire from conservative Republicans. On Monday, Sessions threatened to withhold millions of dollars in U.S. funding for cities that fail to assist immigration authorities. In their letter, Kelly and Sessions said agents make arrests at courthouses rather than other public places in part because visitors are screened for weapons before entering, as they are at jails. They were responding to a letter sent two weeks ago by Cantil-Sakauye, who asked the two Cabinet officials to stop immigration agents from arresting undocumented immigrants inside California courthouses. Courthouses should not be used as bait in the necessary enforcement of our countrys immigration law, she wrote.  The presence of immigration agents in courthouses in the nations most populous state could undermine public trust in its judicial system, she said.  Her letter went on to say that immigration agents were stalking undocumented immigrants at courthouses, language that drew a sharp rebuke from Sessions and Kelly.  They said the use of the word stalking suggested criminal conduct. They said that was unwarranted because agents have full authority to arrest illegal immigrants.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump has neither a clear White House tax plan nor adequate staff yet to see through a planned tax reform, according to interviews with people in the administration, in Congress and among U.S. tax experts. In an echo of its attempt to roll back Obamacare that ended in an embarrassing collapse in Congress, the Trump administration has vowed quick action on taxes. But it has yet to appoint people with the skills to evaluate complex tax laws, draft legislation and sell it to deeply divided lawmakers. Burned by last weeks failed healthcare measure largely authored by House of Representatives Republicans, Trump is determined not to count on Congress so much this time for handling the details on taxes, his second major legislative initiative. But that only underscores his need for a strong White House tax team, which the administration still lacks. Many policy options are still being studied, from deficit-funded tax cuts to a European-style value-added tax. Theyre still sorting out whos in charge, whos going to take the lead, said William Hoagland, a longtime Senate Republican aide who worked on the last successful comprehensive tax reform effort in 1986. You need someone who has the ear and support of the president who can sell a tax plan, and you need the technical support for that person, said Hoagland, now senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank. Financial markets have been reassessing expectations of fast action on taxes that have helped fuel a Trump stocks rally. Members of Trumps tax team are known, but not their exact duties. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn are senior team leaders. Others include White House advisers Steve Bannon, Jared Kushner, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. Trump huddled with Mnuchin on Thursday to discuss taxes. We are at the first stages of this process, beginning to engage with members of Congress, policy groups, business leaders, industry, constituents from around the country, and other stakeholders, White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters on Thursday, Trumps 69th day in office. When Trump was elected in November, Republican lawmakers enthusiastically joined his call to rewrite the tax code and dismantle Obamacare in the first 100 days of his presidency. In early February, Trump promised a phenomenal tax plan by early March that never appeared. Mnuchin spoke on Feb. 23 of enacting tax reform by August. Spicer acknowledged this week that the timetable could be slipping.     Another senior White House official said the administration had assumed it would still be working on healthcare at this point, not tax reform yet. The official, not authorized to speak publicly, spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity. So far, Trumps tax campaign is a far cry from President Ronald Reagans 1986 effort, in which Don Regan, as Treasury secretary and then White House chief of staff, spent many months developing legislation that won bipartisan support in Congress. The process under Reagan was much more developed, elaborate and long, and there was a strong bench of top-rate technicians putting things together, said Steven Rosenthal, senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, a think tank.   Under Trump, he said, None of that is happening. During the 2016 election campaign, Trump issued a tax plan that partly resembled one developed by House Speaker Paul Ryan, but Trump does not now appear wedded to either. It is a safe bet he will not lean heavily on the plan from Ryan, who drafted and championed the ill-fated plan to gut Obamacare. Trump now desperately needs a policy victory ... I would expect the president to play a much more activist role, said Stephen Moore, a fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a think tank. Moore helped write the Trump campaign tax plan. Mnuchin last week talked about a middle-class tax cut. He also said tax reform in many ways would be a lot simpler than healthcare, dismaying tax experts who said that is not so. Comprehensive tax reform is so complex that it has defied Congresses and presidents since Reagan. Tax law is riddled with loopholes embedded in the economy and defended by beneficiaries. Some fundamental questions remain unanswered within the Trump team. For instance, it is unclear if Trump would support a plan that adds to the budget deficit. Past tax reform efforts have tried to be revenue neutral. Trump also has sent mixed messages on Ryans proposed border adjustment tax that would end the corporate deduction for import costs and make export income tax-free, aiming to boost exports and raise new tax revenues. The Trump team is heavy on Wall Street experience, but short on tax expertise. At Treasury, Mnuchin is the only Senate-confirmed political appointee in place. The job of Treasury assistant secretary for tax policy is unfilled. A person familiar with the hiring process for the job said: Treasury needs more capable tax expertise ASAP, or the White House will yank total control for tax reform from the department for the rest of the year, maybe beyond.   Mark Mazur, who held the Treasury tax job under former Democratic President Barack Obama, said Mnuchin has too much on his plate to concentrate fully on taxes. Mnuchin has praised Treasurys 100 tax policy career staff, but they can only offer options to Trump appointees, said Mazur, now director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. The political appointees are the ones who need to turn the crank on the sausage-making machine, Mazur said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

He wants to use President Sisis visit to reboot the bilateral relationship and build on the strong connection the two presidents established when they first met in New York last September, the official said, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity. Egypt has long been one of Washingtons closest allies in the Middle East, receiving $1.3 billion in U.S. military aid annually. The country is fighting an Islamist insurgency in Sinai, and hundreds of Egyptian soldiers and police have been killed fighting insurgents. The bilateral relationship was strained when former President Barack Obama criticized Sisi for cracking down on the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypts oldest Islamist group. Sisi does not make a distinction between the Brotherhood, which says it is peaceful, and Islamic State militants. Egypt considers the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist group.  Obama froze aid to the country for two years after Sisi, then a general, overthrew President Mohamed Mursi in mid-2013  after mass protests against Mursis rule. Mursi, a Muslim Brotherhood member, had been elected the previous year. Human rights groups have estimated that at least 40,000 political prisoners have been detained by Sisis government. Trumps relationship with Sisi got off to a good start when they met last September in New York while Trump was running for president, the White House said.  Trump supports Sisis approach to counterterrorism, which includes both military and political efforts, his efforts to reform Egypts economy, and Sisis calls for reform and moderation of Islamic discourse, the official said. Asked whether the United States would designate the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist group, as Egypt has, the official said Trump was interested in hearing Sisis views during the meeting. We, along with a number of countries, have some concerns about various activities that the Muslim Brotherhood has conducted in the region, the official said. Sisis visit comes as the Trump administration has proposed massive cuts to U.S. foreign aid, the details of which are still to be determined. The White House anticipates aid to Egypt will continue but provided no details on Friday. Were in the budget process right now and those discussions are ongoing as to how it will be broken out, the official told reporters. Some U.S. lawmakers have opposed loosening restrictions on aid to Egypt because of concerns about human rights in the country. The Trump administration intends to address human rights issues behind closed doors, the White House official said. Our approach is to handle these types of sensitive issues in a private, more discreet way. We believe its the most effective way to advance those issues to a favorable outcome, the official said. The official would not say whether Trump would discuss with Sisi the case of Aya Hijazi, an Egyptian-American who works with street children and was arrested in May 2014 on human trafficking charges. Rights groups have called for her release. Hijazi has been held in custody for 33 months in violation of Egyptian law, which states that the maximum period for pretrial detention is 24 months. A verdict was set to be read in a March 23 court session, but was postponed with no reason stated by the judge until April 16.The maximum possible jail sentence in her case is 25 years. The White House is aware of Hijazis case at the most senior levels, the official told reporters. We are going to address this with Egypt in a way that we think maximizes the chances her case will be resolved in a satisfactory way, the official said.

General Flynn certainly has a story to tell, and he very much wants to tell it, should the circumstances permit, said a statement from Flynns lawyer, Robert Kelner. Testimony from Flynn could help shed light on the conversations he had with Russian Ambassador to the United States Sergei Kislyak last year when he was the national security adviser for Trumps presidential campaign. Kelner said discussions had taken place about Flynns availability to testify with officials of the intelligence committees of both the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives. Both committees are investigating allegations of Russian meddling in the U.S. election campaign last year as well as possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russians.    Flynn was forced to resign as Trumps national security adviser in February for failing to disclose talks with the Russian ambassador before Trump took office about U.S. sanctions on Moscow and misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations. Questions remain about the scope of the discussions and what other contacts took place between other Trump advisers with the Russians. Earlier this week, the White House disclosed that Trumps son-in-law and White House senior adviser, Jared Kushner, met executives of Russian state development bank Vnesheconombank, or VEB, in December. U.S. intelligence agencies have said Russia hacked emails of senior Democrats and orchestrated the release of embarrassing information in a bid to tip the presidential election in favor of Trump, whose views were seen as more in line with the Moscows. Russia has denied the allegations. Trump has dismissed suggestions of links with Moscow as Democratic sour grapes for losing the election. The Wall Street Journal, citing officials with knowledge of the matter, reported on Thursday that Flynn had sought immunity from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the House and Senate intelligence panels in exchange for his testimony. The newspaper said he had so far found no takers. The House denied the Journal report. Michael Flynn has not offered to testify to HPSCI in exchange for immunity, committee spokesman Jack Langer said in a statement. The FBI declined to comment. The Senate committee did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Kelners statement did not mention the FBI. He said Flynn is now the target of unsubstantiated public demands by Members of Congress and other political critics that he be criminally investigated. Kelner said Flynn would not submit to questioning in such a highly politicized, witch hunt environment without assurances against unfair prosecution.Independent Senator Angus King, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told CNN he could not confirm the Journal report, but if that turns out to be the case, thats a significant development I believe because it indicates that he has something important to say.

We are seeing signals of a shift that should alarm us all, this administrations proposed budget cuts to international health, development and diplomacy would be a blow to women and children and a grave mistake, Clinton said during a speech at Georgetown University. The Trump administration has asked Congress for a 28 percent, or $10.9 billion, cut in U.S. State Department funding and other international programs to help pay for a 10 percent, $54 billion hike in military spending next year. The White House has shrugged off concerns from Democrats, some Republicans and current and former national security leaders about the impact, saying the proposed cuts are Trump making good on promises he made during his presidential race against Clinton, the Democratic nominee. Clinton, also the State Departments top diplomat during the Obama administration, was speaking at the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security, which presents an annual award in Clintons name to women who have advocated for peaceful solutions. Advancing the rights and full participation of women and girls is the great unfinished business of the 21st century, said Clinton, the first woman to be nominated for president by a major U.S. party. Its not only the right and moral goal for us to be pursuing ... this is strategic and necessary for matters of peace, prosperity and security. Clinton garnered some of the most enthusiastic applause from the university students in attendance when she took a subtle jab at her former presidential rival. Shortly after Clinton praised the institute for making an evidence-based case for promoting womens roles, she stopped to remark: Here I go again, talking about research, evidence, and facts.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Friday slammed China on a range of trade issues from its chronic industrial overcapacity to forced technology transfers and longstanding bans on U.S. beef and electronic payment services. The annual trade barriers list from the U.S. Trade Representatives (USTR) office sets up more areas of potential irritation for the first face-to-face meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping next week in Florida. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, asked about his expectations for the meeting, told Fox News on Friday: What I would hope will come out would be a commitment to starting to abide by the rules and a commitment to working collaboratively to help reduce our deficit. USTR, controlled by the White House, said that Chinese government industrial policies and financial support for industries such as steel and aluminum have resulted in overproduction and a flood of exports that have distorted global markets and undermined competitors. While China has begun to take steps to address steel excess capacity, these steps have been inadequate to date and even fewer efforts have been taken by China in aluminum and other sectors, USTR said in the report. USTR released the list of trade irritants in 63 countries just after senior Trump trade officials announced an executive order to study the causes of U.S. trade deficits.  The report said China also is using a series of cybersecurity restrictions as part of an apparent long-term goal to replace foreign information and communications technology products and services with locally produced versions. USTR also accused China of using a range of measures to engineer the transfer of foreign technology to Chinese firms. They include denying financial or regulatory approvals to companies using foreign-owned intellectual property (IP) or that do not conduct research or manufacture products in China. China also reportedly conditions foreign investment approvals on technology transfer to Chinese entities, mandates adverse licensing terms on foreign IP licensors, uses anti-monopoly laws to extract technology on unreasonable terms and subsidizes acquisition of foreign high technology firms to bring technology to the Chinese parent companies. Gaps in IP rights enforcement have allowed the misappropriation of foreign IP and trade secrets, both within and outside of China. USTRs criticisms are consistent with increasingly vocal concerns raised by international business groups about what they see as a worsening business climate for foreign firms in China, as well as Chinas goal to boost domestic manufacturing content in 10 sectors from robotics to biopharmaceuticals. Earlier this month, the European Union Chamber of Commerce said the Made in China 2025 plan amounts to a large-scale import substitution plan aimed at nationalizing key industries or severely curtailing the position of foreign business. USTR also brought up longstanding complaints about online piracy of movies, books, music, video games and software in China as well as a ban on U.S. beef that has been in place since 2003. It said delays in Chinas approval process for agricultural products derived from biotechnology also worsened in 2016, hurting U.S. corn exports. Ross, the commerce secretary, also said Trump will sign two executive orders on Friday. The first calls for a 90-day study by the Commerce Department into the causes of U.S. trade deficits, the results of which would be used to formulate policy. A second order would solve a problem involving collection of anti-dumping duties, he said. Theres some $3 billion worth of duties that have never been collected because they set up straw-man importers that dont have any financial substance, so by the time the case ends, theres nobody there against whom you can assess the fine. So what these orders will do is require letters of credit or insurance company bonds or cash so there will be somebody against whom we can levy the fine, Ross said.

What did the governor know about the lane closures at the George Washington Bridge, and when did he know it? To learn the truth, the legislatures Bridgegate probe should be resumed, with Christie subpoenaed and required to testify, said Democratic Assemblyman John Wisniewski, who co-chaired a special committee that unearthed the damning emails and texts revealing the plot. He also is campaigning to replace Christie as governor. But fellow Democratic leaders in the state legislature offered a lukewarm response, saying it was not clear what further investigation would accomplish. Bridget Kelly, Christies former deputy chief of staff, was  sentenced on Wednesday to 1-1/2 years in prison. Bill Baroni, former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, got a prison sentence of two years. Along with David Wildstein, another former Port Authority executive who pleaded guilty, they are the only officials charged in connection with the shutdown of access lanes at the bridge in Fort Lee, New Jersey, in September 2013. The resulting traffic nightmare was intended to punish the towns Democratic mayor, Mark Sokolich, for declining to endorse Christies re-election campaign. Christie has denied any involvement, but the fallout damaged his unsuccessful 2016 presidential campaign and saddled him with historically low approval ratings at home. A spokesman did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday. At trial, numerous witnesses, including close Christie advisers, testified that the governor and his inner circle were aware of the lane closures much earlier than they admitted publicly. Following her sentencing, Kelly said she refused to be a scapegoat and vowed to fight her conviction. The criminal case might never have existed had it not been for the legislative committee, which used its subpoena power to secure communications between Kelly, Baroni and Wildstein. Those documents included the now-infamous email from Kelly to Wildstein saying, Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee. We need to follow the facts wherever they go, Wisniewski said in a phone interview. He noted that Christie previously invoked executive privilege to avoid turning over texts and emails in what he called a Nixonian move. But the assembly speaker, Democrat Vincent Prieto, said in a statement it was unlikely after the federal trial that additional hearings or subpoenas will provide new information. Prieto, whose approval would be needed to set up a new committee, also criticized Wisniewski for sending out a campaign statement calling for a renewed investigation, saying Wisniewski was using the issue for political reasons.  Christie cannot run for another term this year due to term limits. Wisniewski, however, said leaving the investigation half-finished would allow such abuses to occur again. State Sen. Loretta Weinberg, a longtime Christie foe who co-chaired the investigative committee, said she had mixed feelings about further action. Im not sure what our goal would be, Weinberg, a Democrat, said in a phone interview. She said it was not clear whether the legislature could force Christie to testify under oath or gain access to his communications. Christies status as a lame-duck governor is another factor weighing against a renewed probe, as is the potential cost to taxpayers, Weinberg said. The target of the scheme, Sokolich, the Fort Lee mayor, said it was obvious the plot extended beyond the three charged defendants. There were many others who were half a text or one email conversation away from getting indicted, he said, adding that Christie has already been found guilty in the court of public opinion. I guess well never know for sure, Sokolich said. Welcome to Jersey politics. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""ROME (Reuters) - Italys preparations for hosting this years Group of Seven major powers meetings have been hampered by the slow transition at the U.S. State Department, which has created decision-making bottlenecks, European diplomatic sources said. The G7 draws together the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada, with countries taking it in turn to draw up agendas that they see as of pressing concern. Italy holds the 2017 presidency and its objectives laid out this week appeared to put Rome on a collision course with U.S. President Donald Trump by promoting highly sensitive topics such as climate change, free trade and immigration initiatives. The G7 foreign ministers meet in Tuscany on April 10-11, preparing for a leaders summit in Sicily at the end of May. However, officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said efforts to reach an agreement on statements and strategy ahead of time - a normal part of pre-meeting G7 diplomacy - were going slowly. The immediate concerns lay with the State Department, where new Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has left vacant numerous positions seen as vital to drafting summit accords. Its very difficult to talk to someone who can give a straight answer because the ones who are there are acting head of something and theyre not even very senior, said a senior Italian government official involved in G7 diplomacy.  The White House has yet to nominate candidates for either of the two deputy secretary of state slots, beneath Tillerson. Further down the chain, all six of the departments regional bureaus are led by acting assistant secretaries of state, while Trump has yet to appoint ambassadors to Italy or the Vatican. This has made it extremely difficult for us to prepare for the meeting, the government official added.  A State Department official acknowledged that some positions had yet to be filled, but said that it was preparing for a successful series of G7 meetings. We continue to have a deep bench of experienced and capable staff members serving in key positions and working closely with their G7 counterparts, including our Italian hosts, the official said. A diplomat in another European capital also involved in G7 preparations said the department heads beneath the secretary of state were vital for getting approval for agendas, scheduling and the often delicate wording of policy statements. We no longer know who to talk to. It is slowing everything down, he said, adding that any ambitious projects would struggle to take off given the confusion. A senior diplomat in a third EU capital said: Since President Trump took office, it has become very difficult to deal with the State Department on planning and we are still learning to work with that.  The senior Italian diplomat leading behind-the-scenes G7 discussions, Raffaele Trombetta, said this week that Africa would play a prominent role in Italys summit agenda, with seven African leaders invited to join the talks in Sicily.  However, in a sign that Rome was lowering expectations for this years event, the Italian government was unlikely to launch any major funding initiative at a time when Trump is looking to slash back on U.S. foreign aid. Usually the G7 sets aside money for a particular cause, but this time it doesnt look like theres the will to do it. Its not just the Americans. The Japanese dont want one either, said the Italian government source. Trombetta said trust was the presidency slogan - trust between governments and their citizens, and between countries.  There is also a need of renewed trust between the leaders who will be attending the summit, he said, noting that the prime ministers of Britain and Italy and the presidents of France and the United States would be attending their first G7. EU leaders worry Trump might undermine 70 years of strong trans-Atlantic ties and have been alarmed by his criticism of NATO, his support for trade protectionism, his rejection of climate change policies, and his anti-migrant rhetoric. Flying into these headwinds, Trombetta said Italy wanted the G7 to reaffirm the importance of the 2015 Paris agreement, which obliges nations to curb global warming and which senior White House advisers have called on Trump to renounce. Rome was also eager for a commitment to fighting all forms of protectionism, said Trombetta. However, he acknowledged that this might be hard to achieve, with the United States this month already breaking with a tradition of endorsing open trade at a meeting of G20 finance ministers in Germany. It is a highly political issue. I expect it will go up to the leaders. It will be dealt with by them at the Taormina summit ... It will be one of the main points of tension of our presidency, he said. Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni is flying to the United States next month, in part to seek an understanding with Trump on the G7 agenda ahead of the Sicily summit. But if Trump pushes back, he is unlikely to face strong resistance from Italy, which has made good relations with the United States the cornerstone of its foreign policy.  We can argue with France, Germany and Britain, but never with America, said another senior government official, who was not authorized to talk to the media. We will do with Trump what we always do (with the Americans); find a way to get along with him. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Trump set the tone for what could be a tense meeting at his Mar-a-Lago retreat next week by tweeting on Thursday that the United States could no longer tolerate massive trade deficits and job losses. The leaders of the worlds two largest economies are scheduled to meet next Thursday and Friday for the first time since Trump assumed office on Jan. 20. In Thursdays tweet, Trump said the highly anticipated meeting, which is also expected to cover differences over North Korea and Chinas strategic ambitions in the South China Sea, will be a very difficult one. Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zheng Zeguang acknowledged there was a trade imbalance, but said this was mostly due to differences in their two economic structures and noted that China had a trade deficit in services. China does not deliberately seek a trade surplus. We also have no intention of carrying out competitive currency devaluation to stimulate exports. This is not our policy, Zheng told a briefing about the Xi-Trump meeting. The yuan fell 6.5 percent last year in its biggest annual loss against the dollar since 1994, knocked by pressure from sluggish economic growth and a broadly strong U.S. currency. Chinas last one-off currency devaluation, a 2 percent move in August 2015, shocked global markets and was widely viewed by traders and economists as a failure. Trump has frequently accused China of keeping its currency artificially low against the dollar to make Chinese exports cheaper, and stealing American manufacturing jobs. While he resisted acting on a campaign promise to declare China a currency manipulator on his first day in office, tensions have persisted over how the Trump administrations China policy would evolve.  Zheng said domestic consumption in China will increase as it pursues economic reforms, helping to raise demand for foreign goods and services, including those from the United States. This also helps ameliorate the trade imbalance between China and the United States, he said.  Chinese investment in the U.S. is also rising, creating more  employment opportunities, Zheng said, adding that Beijing is willing to work with Washington to promote more balanced trade between the two countries. He said the trade imbalance can be resolved by improved  cooperation, and urged Washington to lift restrictions on civilian technology exports to China and create better conditions for Chinese investment in the United States.  Referring to protracted negotiations on a U.S.-China Bilateral Investment Treaty given disagreements about access to sectors the sides deem sensitive, Zheng said China remained committed to seeking solutions through dialog. Nonetheless, the United States had to do play its part too, he said. China can expand imports from the United States. The United States should take steps to promote exports to China, Zheng said. As long as both sides broaden their thinking, take positive moves, both countries can do a lot in the trade and business sphere, and can achieve mutually beneficial, win-win results.

The White House said Trump would host Xi next Thursday and Friday at his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida. It said Trump and his wife, Melania, would host Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan, at a dinner next Thursday. In a tweet on Thursday evening, Trump said the highly anticipated meeting between the leaders of the worlds two largest economies, which is also expected to cover differences over North Korea and Chinas strategic ambitions in the South China Sea, will be a very difficult one. We can no longer have massive trade deficits and job losses, he wrote, adding in apparent reference to U.S. firms manufacturing in China: American companies must be prepared to look at other alternatives. Despite a string of U.S.-China meetings and conversations that have appeared aimed at mending ties after strong criticism of China by Trump during his election campaign, U.S. officials have said the Republican president will not pull his punches in the meeting.     General Electric Co Chief Executive Officer Jeff Immelt urged Trump on Thursday to maintain the countrys economic relationship with China, saying the United States had much to gain from globalization. The country loses if we dont trade. The relationship with China is key, Immelt told an aviation panel hosted by industry group the Wings Club. If you give up on trade, you give up on the best lever that the president of the United States has in negotiating around the world. I just think that President Trump is too smart to give up on that. The U.S. Commerce Department said earlier that Beijing must change its trade practices and the way its state enterprises operate. China and others need to realize the games are over  continuing their unfair trade practices and operation as a non-market economy will have serious consequences, it said. The department said it was launching a new review of Chinas status as a non-market economy, which allows the United States  to maintain high anti-dumping duties on cheap Chinese imports, but the designation is widely expected to remain in place.    Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang stressed the need to see the big picture while fostering mutual trade interests. The market dictates that interests between our two countries are structured so that you will always have me and I will always have you, he told a regular briefing. Both sides should work together to make the cake of mutual interest bigger and not simply seek fairer distribution. Trump administration officials say the need for China to do more to rein in the nuclear and missile programs of its neighbor and ally North Korea will top the agenda, along with trade. The U.S. side is also expected to criticize Beijing for its pursuit of expansive claims in the South China Sea. White House spokesman Sean Spicer told a news briefing the meeting would be an opportunity for Trump to develop a relationship in person with President Xi. Hes spoken to him on the phone a few times, but we have big problems ... everything from the South China Sea, to trade, to North Korea. There are big issues of national and economic security that need to get addressed. Asked if the administration had a vision, or a description for its China policy like the pivot or rebalance to Asia touted by former President Barack Obama, Spicer said: Right now were not worried so much about slogans as much as progress. Theres a lot of big things that we need to accomplish with China, and I think that we will - we will work on them. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson agreed in Beijing this month to work with China on North Korea and stressed Trumps desire to enhance understanding.  China has been irritated at being told repeatedly by Washington to rein in North Koreas nuclear and missile programs, or face U.S. sanctions on Chinese businesses trading with North Korea, and by the U.S. decision to base an advanced missile defense system in South Korea. Beijing is also deeply suspicious of U.S. intentions toward self-ruled Taiwan, which China claims as its own, after Trump, as president-elect, broke with decades of U.S. policy by taking a phone call from Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen and saying Washington did not have to stick to a one China policy. Trump later agreed in a phone call with Xi to honor the long-standing policy and has also written to him since seeking constructive ties. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"
"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - North Carolina on Thursday repealed a law restricting bathroom use for transgender people, hoping to bring back businesses and sports leagues that boycotted the Southern state because they saw the year-old measure as discriminatory. However, the new law replacing the old one bans cities in the state from passing their own anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people until 2020, drawing scorn from civil rights advocates and casting doubt on whether boycotting businesses will return to the state. Democratic Governor Roy Cooper signed the replacement bill into law after the Republican-controlled state Senate and House of Representatives approved it in separate votes in the capital, Raleigh. The new measure rescinds House Bill 2, the so-called bathroom bill also popularly known as HB 2, which required transgender people to use the bathrooms, changing rooms and showers in state-run buildings that correspond to the sex on their birth certificate rather than their gender identity.  HB 2s enactment a year ago prompted boycotts that cost the state economy hundreds of millions of dollars. Deutsche Bank AG and PayPal Holdings Inc reversed expansion plans in the state. Entertainers such as Bruce Springsteen and Itzhak Perlman canceled concerts.  In basketball-crazed North Carolina, the withdrawal of National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) tournament games and the National Basketball Association All-Star game, which had been awarded to Charlotte, reverberated throughout the state. Under the new law, transgender people are once again free to use the bathroom of their choice, but they lack any recourse should a person, business or state entity eject or harass them. The new law also denies LGBT people state legal protections in other areas such as employment and housing. Outraged LGBT advocates, who had wanted an unconditional repeal of HB 2, were already pressuring business and sports organizations not to return. This (is) the end of HB 2 in name only. The bill that was passed today is a disgrace, not a fix, a reset, or a compromise, and certainly not a repeal, Mara Keisling, director of the Washington-based National Center for Transgender Equality, said in a statement. Putting any kind of moratorium on civil rights, whether six months or three years long, is dangerous and wrong, she said. Deutsche Bank, which in response to HB 2 froze plans to create 250 jobs at its location in Cary, North Carolina, declined to comment on Thursday. Elected political rivals on both sides of the issue claimed at least partial victories in reaching the compromise that produced the new law. Both Cooper and the Republican House speaker said they expected the NCAA to once again schedule championship events. NCAA President Mark Emmert said at a news conference posted online by the Raleigh News and Observer newspaper that the board of directors would decide whether the change is sufficient to spur a return. The deal to replace HB 2 came together on Wednesday night, just ahead of an NCAA deadline to amend the law. The governor told reporters the law was imperfect but said Thursdays action would help begin repairing North Carolinas damaged reputation. I wish this were a complete, total repeal, and whenever I get the chance to do that I will do that. ... Im going to fight every single day for LGBT protections, Cooper said. HB 2 was passed in response to an ordinance in Charlotte, the states largest city, that permitted transgender people to use the bathrooms matching their gender identity. The Charlotte ordinance alarmed social conservatives who, without evidence, feared it would endanger women and girls in intimate spaces. House Speaker Tim Moore said the new state law protected bathroom safety, but some social conservatives were unsatisfied.   The truth remains, no basketball game, corporation, or entertainment event is worth even one little girl losing her privacy and dignity to a boy in the locker room, or being harmed or frightened in a bathroom, said Tami Fitzgerald, executive director of the NC Values Coalition in Raleigh and an outspoken supporter of HB 2. Cooper, the former state attorney general, has opposed HB 2 from the outset. He unseated former Republican Governor Pat McCrory last year in large part because of the laws political and economic fallout, political analysts say.

Both West Virginias Manchin and North Dakotas Heitkamp are up for re-election next year in states that voted for Trump in the 2016 presidential election. I hold no illusions that I will agree with every decision Judge Gorsuch may issue in the future, but I have not found any reasons why this jurist should not be a Supreme Court justice, Manchin said in a statement. Manchin met with the nominee for a second time on Wednesday night. Heitkamp said that Gorsuch has a record as a balanced, meticulous and well-respected jurist who understands the rule of law. If confirmed by the Senate to fill a vacancy created by the February 2016 death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, Gorsuch, 49, would restore the nine-seat high courts conservative majority. Senators Maria Cantwell of Washington state, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Tammy Duckworth of Illinois said on Thursday they would vote against Gorsuch. Their announcements mean 35 of the 48 Democrats in the 100-seat Senate oppose Gorsuch, the Colorado-based federal appellate judge nominated by Trump in January for a lifetime post on the high court.  Most Democrats have said they would back an effort to block a confirmation vote using a procedural hurdle called a filibuster that requires 60 votes to allow a confirmation vote. But there are some seeking to avoid such a move, including Chris Coons of Delaware. Im open to anyone whos got a reasonable suggestion for how we might slow what seems to be an inexorable path towards changing the rules, Coons said on Thursday. The Senate Judiciary Committee is set to vote on sending the nomination to the Senate floor on April 3. Republican Senate leaders hope to confirm Gorsuch on April 7. Republicans control the Senate 52-48, meaning they need to win over eight Democrats to block a filibuster. The confirmation vote itself would require a simple majority. Eleven Democrats, including Coons, have yet to announce whether they would vote against Gorsuch or support a filibuster.  Some Democrats have said Republicans stole a Supreme Court seat last year when the Senate refused to consider Democratic former President Barack Obamas nominee, Merrick Garland.

Wilson, a former U.S. representative from New Mexico, would become the top civilian overseeing the Air Force if confirmed by the Senate. Her purview would include weapons acquisitions like the stealthy F-35 jet. Asked if she felt it would make sense to rely on a spruced-up version of the F-18, she said: As a general matter, the real thing I dont think you can do with an F-18 or an F-15 or an F-16 is give it stealth capability retroactively. Her comments are significant because Trump has suggested buying more Boeing Co F/A-18s, which he called comparable to the F-35. This is despite the F-35s status as  a stealth aircraft, meaning it is difficult for enemy radar to detect. The 1990s-vintage F/A-18 does not use stealth technology.  The U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Wilsons nomination touched on expanding the size of the Air Force, acquisitions of new space and cyber warfare capabilities as well as aircraft like the F-35. In January, U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis ordered cost-cutting reviews of two major aircraft acquisition programs including the F-35. The ongoing review is examining how to cut costs and also determine whether Boeings F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, with improvements, could be an effective, less expensive alternative to the F-35C variant. Wilson did not delve into new acquisition program specifics during the hearing but said the Air Force is too small for what the nation expects of it.  She is the first civilian head of a military branch to testify before the Senate this year. Nominees for the Army and Navy have removed their names from consideration. A graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy, Wilson has been president of the South Dakota School of Mines & Technology since 2013 and said during her testimony that her nomination was unexpected.  The Senate must hold a vote to confirm Wilson as the secretary of the Air Force. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Measures similar to North Carolinas House Bill 2, the so-called bathroom bill, were filed in 16 states this legislative session. Momentum had already slowed for most of the bills and some of them had failed. Republicans in the state that was in vanguard, North Carolina, are now signaling that this legislation was not, in the end, in the best interest for their state, either for its economy or its reputation, said Mark Jones, a professor of political science at Rice University in Houston. North Carolina lawmakers said they acted to replace the law in hopes of ending boycotts by businesses and sports leagues that considered the year-old measure discriminatory. The boycotts cost the Southern states economy hundreds of millions of dollars. Supporters of the restrictions have said the measures offer common-sense solutions that will help keep sexual predators out of bathrooms and changing facilities. Opponents say the measures are unenforceable and promote discrimination against an already marginalized group of people. None of the states that proposed similar legislation this session has enacted a version into law, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, which tracks statehouses. Proposals introduced in South Dakota, Virginia, Montana and Wyoming failed to pass, according to the organization and news reports.  In Tennessee, a bathroom bill died in a Senate committee without a debate. The states Republican lieutenant governor questioned the need after Republican President Donald Trumps administration in February revoked the former Obama administrations landmark guidance to public schools letting transgender students use the bathrooms of their choice. On Wednesday, Arkansas state Senator Linda Collins-Smith, a Republican, withdrew the bathroom bill she had proposed in that state. She instead recommended the issue for study in committee after facing pressure from the states pro-business governor and business groups to drop it. After North Carolina, a similar measure proposed in Texas, the most populous Republican-controlled state, has drawn the closest attention. It has already cleared the Texas Senate and moved further than the similar legislation proposed this session in the other states, the National Conference of State Legislatures said. A key backer of Texas bathroom measure that restricts bathroom access for transgender people and is known as Senate Bill 6, was undeterred by North Carolinas change of course.   The actions in North Carolina do not affect what we have done in Texas, Republican Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick said in a statement. He previously said the law would have no economic impact on the state. But the Republican speaker of the Texas House of Representatives said last week the bill would face a tough time in that chamber because of worries over economic fallout. Alabama Republican state Senator Phil Williams said North Carolinas action would not affect similar restrictions he proposed for his state. Bathroom bills will remain on the legislative landscape this year in many states, analysts said.

Trump threatened to try to defeat members of the Freedom Caucus - a bloc of conservative Republicans in the House of Representatives  - in next years congressional elections if they continued to defy him. The Freedom Caucus will hurt the entire Republican agenda if they dont get on the team, & fast. We must fight them, & Dems, in 2018! Trump wrote on Twitter on Thursday morning. He later singled out three Freedom Caucus members by name, U.S. Representatives Mark Meadows, Jim Jordan and Raul Labrador. If @RepMarkMeadows, @Jim_Jordan and @Raul_Labrador would get on board we would have both great healthcare and massive tax cuts & reform, he said in one tweet. Where are @RepMarkMeadows, @Jim_Jordan and @Raul_Labrador? #RepealANDReplace #Obamacare, he asked in another. House conservatives fought back. Labrador, one of the founders of the Freedom Caucus, urged Trump in a tweet to Remember who your real friends are. Were trying to help you succeed. Most people dont take well to being bullied, said Representative Justin Amash, who compared Trumps approach to what a child does when he wants to get his way. Trumps deteriorating relationship with Republican House conservatives could make it harder for him to pass his legislative agenda, which includes rewriting the U.S. tax code, revisiting a healthcare overhaul and funding construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border. Trump, a New York businessman who touted his skills as a dealmaker in his bid for the White House, has repeatedly criticized Freedom Caucus members, blaming them for the defeat of legislation to repeal and replace former President Barack Obamas signature healthcare law.  Freedom Caucus members said the bill did not go far enough to dismantle the 2010 Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. Asked during a briefing whether Trumps tweet about the Freedom Caucus was a divide-and-conquer strategy, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said: No, its a math strategy, which is to get to 216, the number of votes currently needed to pass House legislation. The discord following the healthcare debacle was not limited to tensions between Trump and the Freedom Caucus. In recent days, the president has been out of sync with the two highest ranking Republicans in Congress, House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Trump and his aides have suggested reviving the push for a healthcare bill. While Ryan expressed openness to the idea, McConnell said he thought doing so would be futile. But Ryan publicly disagreed with Trump when the president offered to work with Democrats on new healthcare legislation. I dont want that to happen, the speaker told CBS in an interview aired on Thursday. More than healthcare legislation was at stake. Republican lawmakers still await key details on what Trumps priorities are in the monumental tax reform effort they want to launch. Passing a budget for next year could also prove challenging. Trump and the Freedom Caucus want to dramatically shrink domestic programs. Moderate Republicans are aghast at proposals to cut popular programs that fund environmental cleanup and meals for senior citizens. Most pressing is an April 28 deadline for approving new funding to keep the government running. The GOP (Republican) House is riven by factions that are quite ideological. Trump is not, said University of Virginia political science professor Larry Sabato. And lets throw in the fact that Trump is unpopular and weak and has no Democratic support in Congress. Add all this up. Neither Trump nor congressional Republicans are in an ideal position to govern, and thats an understatement, Sabato said. There are about three dozen members of the House Freedom Caucus, comprising about 15 percent of the 237 House Republicans. But their clout is larger, as Trump and Ryan cannot afford to lose too many House Republicans if they want to try to pass bills, like the Obamacare repeal, that attract zero Democratic support. Dan Meyer, a legislative affairs chief to former Republican President George W. Bush, said that with the Freedom Caucus threatening Trumps agenda, the White House either had to find a way to work with the conservatives, or tack to the left. Some Republicans were so furious they were publicly saying things usually reserved for closed-door meetings. Representative Chris Collins, a Trump ally and part of the Tuesday Group of moderate Republicans, told reporters his group was so angry with the Freedom Caucus that it would never meet with it. He accused its members of trying to shift blame for the healthcare failure to moderates. Senate Republicans expressed alarm and urged efforts at consensus. Senator John McCain, who ran for president in 2008 and was defeated by Obama, said that if he were sitting in the White House, he would try to ease intraparty tensions rather than stoking them.  But thats the president, said McCain who sometimes is at odds with Trump. He added this advice to Trump: Sit down with them and say this is an emergency situation. Senator Cory Gardner, a Republican who served in the House from 2011 to 2014, said his former colleagues needed to quit arguing and come to a consensus sooner rather than later. A senior House Republican aide distanced Ryan from Trumps strategy of upbraiding conservatives. Ryan ... is never going to intentionally alienate a large swath of his caucus, said the aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Publicly, Ryan said he understood Trumps frustration.  The speaker also said he was encouraging Republican lawmakers to keep talking to one another. Republican Senator Bob Corker chided Ryan, however, for his views about courting Democrats on healthcare reform. We have come a long way in our country when the speaker of one party urges a president NOT to work with the other party to solve a problem, Corker wrote on Twitter.

The appeal will be considered by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, which last month upheld a suspension of Trumps first travel order. Trump signed the revised ban earlier this month in a bid to overcome legal problems with a January executive order that caused chaos at airports and sparked mass protests before a Washington judge stopped its enforcement in February. Trump has said the travel ban is needed for national security. U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson on Wednesday turned an earlier temporary restraining order into a preliminary injunction in a lawsuit brought by the state of Hawaii. The case challenged Trumps travel directive as unconstitutional religious discrimination. Hawaii and other opponents of the ban claim it is based on Trumps election campaign promise of a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. The court will not crawl into a corner, pull the shutters closed, and pretend it has not seen what it has, Watson wrote on Wednesday. The Justice Department on Thursday also asked a Seattle federal judge to suspend separate litigation filed by Washington state against Trumps travel restrictions until after the 9th Circuit rules on the Hawaii appeal.

The administration also will seek to eliminate a requirement in the 23-year-old trade deal that anti-dumping and anti-subsidy disputes be settled via a special dispute panel. Some U.S. industries including lumber have complained that the mechanism is ineffective in stopping unfair subsidies. The objectives are contained in a draft notification letter circulated by the U.S. Trade Representatives office to members of Congress for review. The letter, seen by Reuters, is part of  the legal process required to start negotiations to revamp the NAFTA. President Donald Trump called NAFTA a disaster throughout the 2016 election campaign, but the plan outlined in the letter would keep many of its provisions in place, including a settlement system for other disputes that circumvents local courts. The persistent U.S. deficit in goods trade with Canada and Mexico demands that this administration take swift action to revise the relationship to reflect and respond to new 21st century challenges, Acting USTR Stephen Vaughn said in the letter, which is subject to revisions before it is finalized.  The draft negotiating objectives will seek to level the playing field on tax treatment, a broad statement that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told CNBC would be aimed at solving the problem of many countries exempting exports from value-added taxes, while the United States has been unable to offer such credits.  We will be using NAFTA as a partial means of addressing that, he said. Both Canada and Mexico have value-added taxes, while the Trump administration is considering a border adjustment tax levied on imports. Another draft objective says the administration wants to establish rules that require government procurement to be conducted in a manner that is consistent with U.S. law and the administrations policy on domestic procurement preferences, This could allow for Trumps Buy American plan, but also cause U.S. companies to lose business in Mexico and Canada.  The document also calls for protections of digital trade and commerce, tougher intellectual property enforcement and requirements that state-owned companies operate in a commercial fashion.

At a hearing in San Diego, Judge Gonzalo Curiel noted that, under the class action settlement, former Trump University students were expected to recover 80 percent of the money they spent on courses and mentoring programs. That is an extraordinary amount, the judge said, noting the recovery rate in similar lawsuits is usually closer to between 11 and 20 percent. He did not specify when he would rule. A Florida woman objected to the settlement, saying she should have the opportunity to opt out and take Trump to court herself.

Some 3,730 students submitted claim forms in the class action that dates to 2010, according to court papers.

Using the Congressional Review Act, which allows lawmakers to repeal recently minted regulations, senators killed a rule intended to keep federal grants flowing to clinics that provide contraception and other services in states that want to block the funding. The rule was enacted in the final weeks of former President Barack Obamas administration, giving lawmakers the opening to nullify it under the review law. In recent years states such as Texas have kept some healthcare providers from receiving the grants as part of the countrys longstanding fight over abortion.  It was the second time on Thursday that Pence used his role as the chambers president to end a deadlock. He was called to the capitol earlier to carry the resolution through a procedural vote.  Saying the rule usurps states rights, Republicans argued local lawmakers should decide how healthcare money is distributed.  Their main concern is that federal money is being used to provide abortions, although the grants are specifically barred from funding those procedures. Republicans, including President Donald Trump, generally oppose abortion. This regulation is an unnecessary restriction on states that know their residents own needs best, said Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Democrats said the resolution was an attack on womens health, contending the rollback will make it harder for low-income and rural women to obtain screenings for cancer and other diseases, as well as contraception. Most resolutions killing recent Obama-era regulations have sailed through the Republican-controlled Congress. They need to win only simple majorities in both chambers to go to the president for signing. The congressional review law was used only once successfully until this year. The family-planning resolution marked the 13th time it has been deployed effectively since the beginning of February, as well as the first time a resolution has come within a hairs breadth of failing. Republicans didnt listen to us, said Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the senior Democrat on the health committee. They didnt listen to women across the country who made it clear that restricting womens access to the full range of reproductive care is unacceptable.  The nonprofit Planned Parenthood, which provides abortions  and many other health and contraception services, receives some of the federal funding.  Noting the recent collapse of the Republican healthcare bill in the U.S. House of Representatives, Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said Thursdays votes were close because people are sick and tired of politicians making it even harder for them to access healthcare.

In two separate filings to a federal court in Montana, environmental groups argued that the U.S. State Department, which granted the permit needed for the pipeline to cross the Canadian border, relied on an outdated and incomplete environmental impact statement when making its decision earlier this month. By approving the pipeline without public input and an up-to-date environmental assessment, the administration violated the National Environmental Policy Act, groups including the Center for Biological Diversity, Sierra Club and the Northern Plains Resource Council said in their legal filing. They have relied on an arbitrary, stale, and incomplete environmental review completed over three years ago, for a process that ended with the State Departments denial of a cross-border permit, the court filing says. In the other filing, the Indigenous Environmental Network and North Coast Rivers Alliance sought injunctive relief, restraining Transcanada from taking any action that would harm the physical environment in connection with the project pending a full hearing on the merits. U.S. President Donald Trump announced the presidential permit for the Keystone XL at the White House last week. TransCanadas Chief Executive Officer Russ Girling and Sean McGarvey, president of North Americas Building Trades Unions, stood nearby. Trump, a Republican, said the project would lower consumer fuel prices, create jobs and reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil.  His Democratic predecessor, former president Barack Obama, rejected the pipeline, saying it would lead to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions and do nothing to reduce fuel prices for U.S. motorists. This tar sands pipeline poses a direct threat to our climate, our clean water, wildlife, and thousands of landowners and communities along the route of this dirty and dangerous project, and it must and will be stopped, said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, one of the groups that filed the lawsuit. The lawsuits came on the heels of a lawsuit filed on Wednesday challenging other recent moves to undo Obamas climate change regulations.

The determinations of dumping, or selling a product below its fair price, apply to imports of CTL plate from Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, Ross said. In addition, there was a final finding that South Korean imports were subsidized, leading to a countervailing duty of 4.31 percent being slapped on those products, he said at a department event. A healthy steel industry is critical to our economy and manufacturing base, yet our steel industry today is under assault from foreign producers that dump and subsidize their exports, Ross told the audience. In 2015, imports of CTL plate from the seven producers totaled $732 million, with those from Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea and Taiwan valued at an estimated $14.2 million, $19.8 million, $179 million, $196.2 million, $37 million, $54.9 million, $210 million and $21 million, respectively, department figures show. (bit.ly/2mSZM1Z) Cut-to-length steel is used in a wide range of applications, including buildings and bridgework; agricultural, construction and mining equipment; machine parts and tooling; ships, rail cars, tankers and barges; and large-diameter pipe. The finding followed an investigation prompted by a petition from Nucor Corp and U.S. subsidiaries of ArcelorMittal SA and SSAB AB. For Austrian producers and exporters, dumping duties on the Voestalpine group and all others were set at 53.72 percent. They were 5.4 percent for Industeel Belgium, 51.78 percent for the NLMK Belgium group and 5.4 percent for all other Belgium producers and exporters. Among French manufacturers and exporters, duty rates were set at 148.02 percent for Industeel France and 8.62 percent for Dillinger France and all others. In Germany, duties were set at 5.38 percent for AG der Dillinger Httenwerke, 22.90 percent for the Salzgitter group and 21.03 percent for all other exporters and producers. A spokesman for Salzgitter confirmed the company was facing duties, saying the decision to impose the duties and the level of them were incomprehensible.     In Italy, the department set anti-dumping duty rates of 6.08 percent for Officine Tecnosider, 22.19 percent for Marcegaglia SpA and NLMK Verona SpA and 6.08 percent for all other producers and exporters. Among Japanese producers and exporters, Tokyo Steel Manufacturing Co Ltd was hit with a duty rate of 14.79 percent. A rate of 48.67 percent was imposed on JFE Steel Corp and Shimabun Corp, and for all others it was set at 14.79 percent. Taiwanese companies Shang Chen Steel Co Ltd and China Steel Corp had anti-dumping duties of 3.62 percent and 6.95 percent, respectively, imposed on them. The rate for other producers and exporters was set at 5.29 percent. For South Korea, the department imposed an anti-dumping duty of 7.39 percent on POSCO, as well as a countervailing duty of 4.31 percent to account for subsidies. The same rates apply to all other producers and exporters. The findings allow the department to ask U.S. Customs authorities to collect cash deposits from exporters based on those rates. On March 3, in a decision stemming from the same investigation, the U.S. International Trade Commission said it had made a final finding that U.S. industry was being harmed by the dumping and subsidization of imports of carbon and alloy steel CTL plate from China. That allows for the final imposition of duties by the Commerce Department on Chinas producers and exporters of the plate. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

In Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin again denied that Russia tried to influence the election, but in doing so he made reference to the wrong U.S. president in answering a question at an Arctic forum. Once, Reagan, while discussing, I think, taxes, told the Americans: Read my lips: No! His reply recalled what George H.W. Bush told Americans during his 1988 presidential election campaign, Read my lips: No new taxes. Trump has dismissed suggestions of links with Moscow as Democratic Party sour grapes about his surprise November defeat of the partys candidate, Hillary Clinton. U.S. intelligence agencies said Russia hacked emails of senior Democrats and orchestrated the release of embarrassing information to hurt Clintons campaign. I will not prejudge the outcome of our investigation, Senator Mark Warner told an intelligence committee hearing on the allegations. We are seeking to determine if there is an actual fire, but so far there is a great, great deal of smoke. Putin also said on Thursday that contacts Russian diplomats had made in the United States were merely part of routine work. At the hearing, lawmakers warned of the danger that Russia could interfere in elections in France and Germany this year and in future U.S. campaigns. Cyber security experts at the rare day-long public hearing detailed what they described as the dissemination of disinformation and cyber attacks on both Democratic political operatives and Republicans. Lawmakers and cyber experts mentioned stories that were being spread to discredit German Chancellor Angela Merkel. And they said Britains Brexit vote last year on leaving the European Union should be examined. Clinton Watts, a security consultant and former FBI agent, told Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican committee member, that he may have been a victim of Russian activity during his unsuccessful campaign for the 2016 Republican nomination against Trump. Rubio later said he would not comment. But he told the hearing that in July 2016, after he announced he would run for re-election to the Senate, former members of his presidential campaign team were targeted by an unsuccessful cyber attack from Russia. He said former campaign staffers were also targeted unsuccessfully from within Russia within the past 24 hours. Were all targets of a sophisticated and capable adversary, said Senator Richard Burr, a Republican who heads the intelligence committee. Democrat Warner, who was a technology executive before entering politics, described a sweeping Russian campaign using trolls and botnets, or networks of hacked or infected devices, to spread large amounts of disinformation. The campaign of fake news was particularly targeted at traditionally Democratic-leaning states such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, where Trump defeated Clinton by narrow margins that were not predicted by opinion polls, he said. This Russian propaganda on steroids was designed to poison the national conversation in America, Warner said.     Citing concerns to be addressed in the committees probe, Warner listed the prediction by a Trump associate about the release of hacked emails weeks before they were released, a change in the Republican Partys platform to water down language on Ukraine, and Trumps campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and other Trump associates being forced to step down over ties to Russia. A separate investigation in the House of Representatives into the intelligence agencies allegations of a Russian role in the U.S. election has become mired in controversy over accusations that its Republican chairman, Trump ally Devin Nunes, is not impartial. Nunes and Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House committee, met on Thursday to discuss their investigation. Schiff said the two had discussed obtaining documents before deciding which witnesses to call in. The New York Times reported on Thursday that two White House officials played a role in providing Nunes with documents the Republican committee chairman cited to show Trump and his associates were swept up in surveillance by U.S. intelligence. Trump said Nunes comments about the surveillance helped justify his insistence, made without evidence, that former President Barack Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower in New York, his campaign headquarters.

Buried in a federal notice on Wednesday about an investigation into alleged dumping of Chinese aluminum foil into the U.S. market, the department said it is seeking public comments on Chinas non-market economy status. The review comes as the White House prepares for the first face-to-face meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinas President Xi Jinping on April 6-7 at Trumps Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida. Chinas non-market economy status is considered an irritant for Beijing as the Trump administration works on trade policies aimed at reducing the flow of Chinese imports in to the United States. When China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, its accession terms allowed other WTO members to treat it as a non-market economy and use a third countrys prices to assess whether Chinese goods were being sold below cost. But part of that clause expired on Dec. 11, 2016, which China says means WTO trading partners must drop their use of such surrogate pricing, which has led to higher U.S. anti-dumping duties on imported Chinese goods. The United States and European Union failed to change their view of Chinas status. A day later, Beijing launched a formal complaint against them before the WTO.  The Commerce Department last conducted a review of Chinas non-market economy status in 2006, determining that China failed on all six determining criteria, which are: * the extent to which the countrys currency is convertible into other currencies; * the extent to which wage rates are determined by free bargaining by labor and management; * the extent to which joint ventures or other investments by foreign firms are permitted in the country; * the extent of government ownership or control of the means of production; * the extent of government control over allocation of resources and over price and output decisions of enterprises, and * other factors the administering authority considers appropriate.

Utah Republican Orrin Hatch, the resolutions sponsor, has said he expects the Senate to soon repeal a related rule on state-operated retirement plans.  That resolution may face a tougher time than the one on municipal plans, which barely passed in a 50-49 vote. States are farther along establishing retirement programs for people who do not have workplace savings plans, and Republicans who advocate for states rights are more skeptical of the resolution. The House of Representatives has already passed both resolutions. Thursdays vote marked the 12th time the Republican-controlled Congress has successfully killed an Obama-era regulation through the use of an obscure 1996 law known as the Congressional Review Act. The law lets Congress repeal a newly minted rule through  simple majority votes in the House and Senate, and a signature from the president. A substantially similar rule can never be enacted in its place. The Labor Department rule was finalized after May 2016, putting it into the window of time set by the law when Congress can repeal it. Using the resolutions, Republicans have sent rules spanning a variety of areas to the chopping block in hopes of loosening regulation they say constricts economic growth.  Thursdays resolution and its near-twin for state plans counters the trend by maintaining regulatory requirements. Toward the end of President Barack Obamas tenure, his Labor Department exempted both state and city-run retirement plans from the 1974 Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA, a law designed to protect workers savings with detailed compliance requirements. Private-sector workers whose employers do not offer 401(k) or other retirement benefits, and who often have low incomes, are automatically enrolled in the plans being launched in states such as California, Illinois and Oregon.  States say the ERISA exemption lets employers pass workers money into plans without footing compliance costs. They also say Wall Street wants to block the plans because they create competition. But the Investment Company Institute, a mutual funds trade group, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and others in financial services say the exemptions shortchange workers from important federal pension protections that other workers receive.

White House spokesman Sean Spicer declined to comment on the details of the report during a briefing on Thursday. The New York Times reported that Cohen-Watnick began reviewing highly classified reports about intercepted communications of foreign officials after Trump said on Twitter earlier this month that he was wiretapped by his predecessor, President Barack Obama.

FBI Director James Comey told Congress he had seen no evidence to support the wiretapping claim. Obama has denied the accusation through a spokesman. Nunes, who was a member of Trumps transition team, has faced criticism from Democrats and some prominent Republicans, for the way he handled the allegations about U.S. spy agency surveillance of Trumps team.

City Comptroller Scott Stringer said Trumps overall plan, as proposed during the Republican presidents campaign, would give more than $5 billion of tax cuts to city dwellers. But almost two-thirds of that would go to those earning more than $500,000, even though they bear just over one-half of the total tax burden.  We already have astounding wealth gaps across the city and across the country, Stringer told a news conference. The Trump tax code, if implemented, would only exacerbate it. The lower taxes for wealthier residents would be achieved through lower marginal tax rates on ordinary and capital gains income and the elimination of the alternative minimum tax (AMT). Last week, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Trumps objective is a tax cut for the middle class, not the top 1 percent. He said he is aiming for passage of a comprehensive tax overhaul by the time Congress takes its August recess.  Stringers office analyzed tax returns of 365,000 New York City households. It found that 92 percent of the citys millionaires would receive, on average, a tax cut of at least $113,000. Nearly half of single parents who make $25,000 to $50,000 would experience a tax increase, it said. The tax cuts, which would reduce federal revenue by more than $2 trillion over 10 years, are driving proposed budget cuts that would leave the city, home to 60,000 homeless people, with a weakened social safety net, Stringer said. I find it incredible that this guy, who comes from New York City, who has major investments here, cant see what his proposal will do to his hometown, he said. And then when you scratch the surface, you realize that part of his agenda and who benefits from it is Donald Trump himself. Based on the limited information available from Trumps now-public 2005 federal tax return, his proposal to eliminate the AMT would have benefited him by $31 million that year. In contrast, under his tax plan, a single mother raising two children on less than $50,000 a year would face a tax increase of $464.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trumps Supreme Court nominee could help decide the fate of his moves to undo climate-related U.S. regulations, but legal experts said Neil Gorsuchs judicial record makes it hard to predict whether as a justice he would back a sweeping rollback. If confirmed to the lifetime job by the Senate, the Colorado-based federal appeals court judge would restore the courts 5-4 conservative majority. The Senate is planning an April 7 confirmation vote although many Democrats are fighting to block Gorsuch. On the court, Gorsuch could become a pivotal vote on the Republican presidents deregulation agenda, along with fellow conservative Anthony Kennedy, who sometimes joins the courts four liberals in close cases. That agenda includes Trumps effort to kill Democratic former President Barack Obamas so-called Clean Power Plan, blocked by the high court last year, aimed at reducing climate-warming carbon emissions from mainly coal-fired power plants. Trump on Tuesday signed an executive order kicking off a lengthy review process that environmental groups and Democratic-governed U.S. states have promised to challenge in court. Gorsuchs views on issues related to climate change are unclear. His mother headed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under Republican former President Ronald Reagan for two years in the 1980s. Gorsuch was not asked about climate issues during his Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing last week. In his 11 years as a judge, the only major ruling touching upon climate policy came in 2015 when he was on a three-judge panel that upheld a Colorado measure requiring power generators to ensure a fifth of their electricity came from renewable sources. A 2016 case on federal agency power is potentially more instructive on how he might approach broad moves to slash current regulation, according to experts. In that case, Gorsuch questioned a 1984 Supreme Court precedent giving federal agencies broad deference to interpret laws. Gorsuch called the doctrine, enshrined in the Chevron v. Natural Resource Defense Council ruling, an elephant in the room that concentrates federal power in a way that seems more than a little difficult to square with the Constitution. Questions remain over how that approach would manifest itself if applied to efforts by Trumps EPA to weaken or rescind existing agency regulations on fighting climate change. Some environmental lawyers say it could mean Gorsuch would be skeptical of any big changes at the agency level. The EPA under Obama compiled detailed scientific data to support its efforts to curb carbon emissions. That could hamper the Trump administration, said Jonathan Adler, a conservative law professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law in Cleveland. Sean Donahue, a lawyer who represents environmental groups, agreed, saying if the EPA were to advance fancy interpretive footwork to try to make greenhouse gases not a Clean Air Act pollutant, the administration may not get the deference it wants. The extent to which the U.S. Clean Air Act, the law that tackles air pollution, applies to carbon emissions is heavily contested in the courts. The Supreme Court, in the landmark 2007 decision Massachusetts v. EPA, held that carbon is a pollutant that could be subject to regulation under the law. In a 2014 case, the court largely upheld the Obama administrations first batch of greenhouse gas regulations. Environmental groups including the Sierra Club have said they are ready to pounce if they see signs that Trumps EPA, headed by fossil fuels industry ally Scott Pruitt, is ignoring science in making climate-related regulatory changes. I think the bottom line is that we hope any anti-regulatory rule-making should be so unscientific ... almost any federal judge should see through the Trump administration maneuvering, said Pat Gallagher, a Sierra Club lawyer.

My hope is ... that is either late this year or early next year. Im not looking further than that, Crapo said. Crapos agenda is being intensely watched on Wall Street, as his committee is widely seen as playing a critical role in crafting any rewrite of Dodd Frank.  That 2010 law was enacted after the financial crisis, and the industry is eager to see if Republicans now in charge of the White House and Congress can significantly relax its requirements. Some of the Dodd Frank provisions that are most contentious prohibit banks from some higher risk investments and require higher capital requirements of the biggest banks.  A bill that attacks Dodd Frank directly is set to be introduced in the House of Representatives soon by Jeb Hensarling, the Texas Republican who chairs the Financial Services Committee. But that bill is seen as a tough Republican approach that may not garner enough support in the Senate to be passed. Crapo said meaningful reforms would require a bipartisan approach, and he is working closely with Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat on the committee, to find areas of common ground. He also said he wants to go beyond simply revisiting Dodd Franks provisions and look more broadly at all rules and policies that impact economic growth, an approach he said might encourage Democrats to vote with him. He said he expects Congress to address financial regulatory reform after it finishes work on a tax reform bill.  Crapo did concede that the current political environment is tough for passing controversial legislation in the Senate, and others in his party said they intend to push some of their favored Dodd Frank revisions through a budget process that would not require much Democratic support.

State lawmakers in the Republican-controlled senate voted in favor of the measure on Tuesday, just days after President Donald Trumps efforts to repeal and replace the ACA, also known as Obamacare, ended with the bill being pulled from a vote. Republican Governor Sam Brownback said the bill also failed to eliminate waiting lists for disability services, did not add work requirements and was not budget neutral. The cost of expanding Medicaid under Obamacare is irresponsible and unsustainable, he said.  He added it was unwise to undertake such a drastic change to the states Medicaid program while work on an ACA overhaul was underway in Washington. I will not support this legislation that continues to fund organizations that undermine a culture of life, he said, referring to groups such as Planned Parenthood, which provides a range of reproductive services including abortions. Planned Parenthood said in a statement that the overwhelming majority of Kansans support the health care provider and the expansion of Medicaid in the state.  The Republican-controlled House, which passed the bill last month 81-44, quickly took up a debate on overriding Brownbacks veto on Thursday, but a vote was postponed. You are going to put a dagger right through the heart of our small communities, Republican Representative Leonard Mastroni, who voted in support of expansion, told the House in Topeka after Brownbacks veto.  In the House, 84 lawmakers would need to vote in favor of the override for it to advance. The failed Obamacare replacement bill in Washington, pushed by House Speaker Paul Ryan, would have ended the ACAs expansion of Medicaid, the federal and state funded insurance program for the poor and disabled. Kansas was not among the 31 states that in 2016 had opted to expand Medicaid, with the federal government footing much of the cost under Obamacare. With the ACAs enhanced federal funding, Medicaid expansion in Kansas, effective Jan. 1, 2018, would cost the state an estimated $31 million in fiscal 2018, which begins July 1, and $67 million in fiscal 2019 with more than 180,000 additional recipients, according to estimates cited in a legislative report on the bill.

Committee Chairman Richard Burr and Mark Warner, its top Democrat, pledged at a joint news conference that they would work together, in contrast with the partisan discord roiling a similar probe by the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee. Burr was asked if the Senate panel wanted to determine if there was anything suggesting a direct link to Trump, and responded: We know that our challenge is to answer that question for the American people. Trumps young presidency has been clouded by allegations from U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia sought to help him win, while connections between his campaign personnel and Russia also are under scrutiny. Trump dismisses such assertions and Russia denies the allegations. The Senate committee intends to begin interviewing as many as 20 people, including Jared Kushner, Trumps son-in-law and one of his closest advisers, beginning as early as Monday. Burr served as a security adviser to Trumps campaign but said he had not coordinated with him on the scope of the committees investigation. He insisted he could remain objective. Burr declined to go along with the White Houses denial of collusion between the campaign and Russian hackers, who U.S. intelligence officials believe favored Trump in last years campaign at the expense of Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton. We would be crazy to try to draw conclusions from where we are in the investigation, Burr said. Let us go a little deeper into this before you ask us to write the conclusions. Thats clearly something we intend to do down the road. Burr and Warner would not comment on the investigation in the House, where the chairman of the intelligence committee, Trump ally Devin Nunes, has been under fire over his handling of the matter. Many Democrats, including Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence panel, called for Nunes to recuse himself from the investigation after he met last week with an unidentified source at the White House complex, accusing him of colluding with the White House. Before telling his committee colleagues, Nunes met with House Speaker Paul Ryan, and then Trump, and told reporters the source provided him with evidence that information on Trumps transition team had been collected during legal surveillance of other targets. Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have said the discord surrounding the House committee has made the Senate investigation more important than ever. Clearly in the Senate, it appears that both Democrats and Republicans are acting like adults and taking this matter seriously, Democratic Representative Jim McGovern told Reuters. Warner and Burr both stressed the importance of exposing the activity of Russian hackers, which Warner said included reports of upwards of 1,000 paid Internet trolls who spread false negative stories about Clinton. Warner and Burr did disagree slightly, with Warner alluding to some difficulties getting particular documents from intelligence agencies, and Burr defending them. The two senators also indicated they had communicated with Michael Flynn, Trumps former national security adviser, who was fired last month after misrepresenting meetings with the Russian ambassador. It would be safe to say we have had conversations with a lot of people and it would be safe to say General Flynn is a part of that list, Burr said.

The new projections show steeper 30-year debt growth than last years long-term forecast by the non-partisan budget analysis agency, and could make it harder for some members of Congress to support a tax reform plan that is partly financed with higher deficits. Last year, the CBO estimated U.S. public debt would grow to 141 percent of gross domestic product by 2046, while the record was 106 percent of GDP in 1946. That level would be reached in 2035, the CBO said. Under this years projection, CBO predicts public debt for 2017 to be about 77 percent of GDP, growing to 89 percent in 2027, and 113 percent in 2037. The new forecasts assume that the Affordable Care Act, the healthcare law known as Obamacare that House Republicans failed to replace last week, stays in place for the long term. The projected debt growth reflects CBOs estimates of the rising costs of caring for a growing population of people over 65, growth in interest costs, and assumptions of slower economic growth due to reduced assumptions about productivity gains. Annual deficits are expected to average 8.6 percent of GDP in the 2038-2047 period versus 2.9 percent expected for 2017 and 4.0 percent for the 2018-2027 period. The long-term projections extend CBOs assumptions made in its 10-year budget outlook in January, which showed falling deficits for the next two years, but growth thereafter. Net interest costs in 2047 are expected to be 6.2 percent of GDP, compared with 1.4 percent in 2017 and about 1.2 percent in 1967, the CBO said.   But the wild card in the CBO 30-year projections are real interest rates. Real interest yields on 10-year Treasury notes are assumed to average 1.5 percent over 30 years, rising to 2.3 percent in 2047. Much higher interest rates, coupled with different assumptions in productivity and healthcare cost growth, could  produce significantly different outcomes, CBO said.  The CBO said that its debt-to-GDP ratio could range from 85 percent with low rates and strong growth, to 244 percent with weaker growth and higher rates.

The compromise, reached with Democratic Governor Roy Cooper and set to go before the legislature for a vote Thursday morning, would still ban local municipalities, schools and others from regulating bathroom access. It would also effectively forbid cities from offering their own job and restroom protections to vulnerable groups for nearly four years. Compromise requires give and take from all sides, and we are pleased this proposal fully protects bathroom safety and privacy, the states top Republican lawmakers, Senate leader Phil Berger and House of Representatives Speaker Tim Moore, said in a statement released late Wednesday. The pair announced the deal at an impromptu news conference. The compromise with Cooper, a staunch opponent of the bathroom law, was reached hours before the state was reportedly set to lose its ability to host any NCAA basketball championships.  The college athletic association is one of numerous organizations to sanction or boycott North Carolina in the wake of the laws passage last year. Cooper said earlier this week that the measure could end up costing the state nearly $4 billion. He said he supported the compromise. Its not a perfect deal, but it repeals House Bill 2 and begins to repair our reputation. But it remained unclear whether the compromise would be acceptable to those who believe North Carolina was unfriendly to the rights of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people. In an impassioned news conference before the deal was announced, several leading LGBT activists decried its provisions, including the bar on municipalities regulating employment practices and public accommodations. This is a dirty deal, said Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign. He vowed to continue fighting North Carolina in court and in the public sphere if the new measure passes and is signed by Cooper. On Twitter Wednesday night, San Francisco-based Levi Strauss & Co., which has publicly opposed North Carolinas transgender bathroom law, urged lawmakers to reject what it called a backroom deal.

Republicans in Congress on Tuesday narrowly passed the repeal of the privacy rules with no Democratic support and over the strong objections of privacy advocates. The fight over privacy sets the stage for an even larger battle later this year over Republican plans to overturn the net neutrality provisions adopted by the administration of former President Barack Obama in 2015. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said he did not know when Trump would sign the bill. The privacy bill would repeal regulations adopted in October by the Federal Communications Commission under the Obama administration requiring internet service providers to do more to protect customers privacy than websites like Alphabet Incs Google or Facebook Inc. Under the rules, internet providers would need to obtain consumer consent before using precise geolocation, financial information, health information, childrens information and web browsing history for advertising and marketing. The reversal is a win for AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc. Websites are governed by a less restrictive set of privacy rules overseen by the Federal Trade Commission. Republican commissioners have said the rules would unfairly give websites the ability to harvest more data than internet service providers.  Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said in a tweet the vote was Terrible for American ppl, great for big biz. Republicans next plan to overturn net neutrality provisions that in 2015 reclassified broadband providers and treated them like a public utility.     FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, a Republican, in December said he believes that net neutralitys days are numbered. The rules bar internet providers from obstructing or slowing down consumer access to web content and prohibit giving or selling access to speedy internet, essentially a fast lane on the webs information superhighway, to certain internet services. Critics say the rules opened the door to potential government rate regulation, tighter oversight and would provide fewer incentives to invest billions in broadband infrastructure. Pai told Reuters in February be backs a free and open internet and the only question is what regulatory framework best secures that but has steadfastly declined to disclose his plans.  Trump has not talked as president about net neutrality but in 2014 tweeted he opposed net neutrality. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Participants of the dialogue, led by Pence and Japanese Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso, will hold their first round of talks in Tokyo on April 18 to discuss issues ranging from macroeconomic policy, infrastructure investment and trade. The dialogue will be a major test of U.S. President Donald Trumps confrontational approach to trade. Senior administration officials, including Ross, have signaled they would press Japan to remove non-tarrif trade barriers and buy more U.S. products. Japan, which proposed the dialogue, had hoped to keep contentious issues like auto and agriculture trade out of the talks by proposing an agenda focused on infrastructure investment and energy. One of Tokyos strategy was to keep the bilateral dialogue as informal as possible so Aso can deal directly with Pence, who is regarded as having a less confrontational view on trade compared with others in the Trump administration, Japanese government officials said. The agenda is vague now, but if friction comes up in the future, our plan is to say lets discuss that in the Aso-Pence dialogue and then use the dialogue to diffuse any problems, one of the officials said on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to speak publicly. The participation of Ross heightens the chance the dialogue would serve as a venue to discuss a bilateral trade deal, which could put Japan under U.S. pressure to open up heavily-protected areas like agriculture and pharmaceuticals, the officials said. Hiroshige Seko, Japans ministry of economy, trade and industry, and Foreign Minister Fumiko Kishida will also join the dialogue, the government officials said. Ross has been known to have close ties with Japan, having led a firm investing in the country since 1997 and serving as chairman of the Japan Society - a non-profit organization promoting bilateral relations, since 2010.

Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch said levies imposed by Obamacare, including taxes on medical devices and benefit-rich health insurance polices known as Cadillac plans, could be tackled through tax reform or a revised healthcare bill. Either, as far as Im concerned, Hatch told reporters.  Any way we can get rid of those, I think itd be a good thing. Americans for Tax Reform, a political group in Washington that opposes all tax increases, said 21 tax hikes emerged from the 2010 Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. Democrats say the taxes are necessary to help moderate-to-low-income consumers obtain health coverage through private insurance and the Medicaid program for the poor and disabled.  The prospects for using tax reform to repeal Obamacares taxes dimmed earlier this week in the House of Representatives, when House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady said he would not include the Obamacare items in tax reform legislation his panel is expected to disclose later this year. Hatchs comments suggested the Senate could take a different approach on the taxes once a House tax reform bill reaches his chamber, unless a new healthcare bill surfaces first.    The House Republican healthcare bill, which would have repealed nearly $900 billion in Obamacare taxes over a decade, was pulled from consideration last Friday because Republicans lacked the votes to pass it.

The March 25-28 poll asked who should take responsibility for the failure of the American Health Care Act (AHCA), which Republican leaders pulled from consideration last week without a vote.  Besides Trump, who backed the bill, and House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, who was expected to shepherd it through Congress, the poll asked if people blamed House Republicans, House Democrats or the media.  Republicans were most likely to blame Congress. Some 26 percent said House Democrats were most responsible and 23 percent blamed House Republicans. Another 13 percent blamed Trump and 10 percent blamed Ryan. Only 8 percent blamed the media.  Their assessment appeared to align with Trumps criticism of Democratic leaders and the conservative Freedom Caucus, whom he blamed for the bills failure.  Overall, nearly one in four Americans, including Democrats and independents, blamed Trump. Ryan, Congress and the media received less criticism.  The Republican reform was widely criticized after estimates by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office showed 24 million people could lose their health insurance over the next 10 years.  Trump said on Tuesday he still thinks healthcare reform can happen very quickly in Washington, but he did not offer any specifics on how it could get done, or what would be changed from the previous bill.  Nearly half of all Americans said they would like to see that happen, though the response was split along party lines. Some 80 percent of Republicans said they would like to see their party take another swing at a bill, compared with only 25 percent of Democrats.  In a separate poll conducted between Jan.7-23, 46 percent of Americans wanted to keep Obamacare, the popular name for President Barack Obamas healthcare reform, while fixing problem areas, and another 8 percent wanted to keep it exactly as it is.  The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English in all 50 states. The March 25-28 poll included 1,332 people, including 456 Republicans and 558 Democrats.

U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson turned an earlier temporary restraining order into a preliminary injunction in a lawsuit brought by the state of Hawaii challenging Trumps travel directive as unconstitutional religious discrimination.  Trump signed the new ban on March 6 in a bid to overcome legal problems with a January executive order that caused chaos at airports and sparked mass protests before a Washington judge stopped its enforcement in February. Trump has said the travel ban is needed for national security. In its challenge to the travel ban, Hawaii claims its state universities would be harmed by the order because they would have trouble recruiting students and faculty. It also says the island states economy would be hit by a decline in tourism. The court papers cite reports that travel to the United States took a nosedive after Trumps actions. The state was joined by a new plaintiff named Ismail Elshikh, an American citizen from Egypt who is an imam at the Muslim Association of Hawaii and whose mother-in-law lives in Syria, according to the lawsuit. Hawaii and other opponents of the ban claim that the motivation behind it is based on religion and Trumps election campaign promise of a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. The court will not crawl into a corner, pull the shutters closed, and pretend it has not seen what it has, Watson wrote on Wednesday. Watson wrote that his decision to grant the preliminary injunction was based on the likelihood that the state would succeed in proving that the travel ban violated the U.S. Constitutions religious freedom protection. Trump has vowed to take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, which is currently split 4-4 between liberals and conservatives with the presidents pick - appeals court judge Neil Gorsuch - still awaiting confirmation.

The proposal will cover more than transportation infrastructure, it will include energy, water and potentially broadband and veterans hospitals as well. Chaos comments were the most detailed timetable from the administration about its plans to unveil a plan to modernize U.S. roads, bridges, airports, electrical grid and water systems.

Trump has accused the Freedom Caucus lawmakers of snatching a defeat from the jaws of victory with their rejection of the White House-backed healthcare bill to replace President Barack Obamas 2010 healthcare reform bill. In interviews with 10 of the roughly three dozen House Freedom Caucus members, the lawmakers said they were eager to put aside tensions over the healthcare debacle and seek common ground on tax reform. But there is no consensus, even within the conservative faction, on details of a tax-reform bill, with some members open to discussing ideas such as the border tax plan supported by House leaders and others opposed to it. Representative Warren Davidson, a Freedom Caucus member from Ohio, said Republicans should leave aside the blame game and work through their policy differences before launching tax reform legislation. Some people are still in that hurt-feelings and frustration stage, Davidson said. I do think its smart to take the time to get it right. Republican Representative David Schweikert of Arizona, a Freedom Caucus lawmaker who sits on the tax-writing House of Representative Ways and Means Committee, could emerge as a bridge between the conservative faction and House leaders. The panel will work closely with House leadership on the tax bill. Schweikert said he planned to consult with rank-and-file members to discuss plans and listen to their priorities. He said giving companies incentives to invest in plants and equipment was one of the items on his own wish list. My personal fixation is very simple: What maximizes economicgrowth? Schweikert said. Representative Mark Meadows, chairman of the Freedom Caucus, said the group has no formal position on the structure of tax reform legislation. But Meadows listed the top priorities on his own wish list: Lower taxes, lower taxes and lower taxes. A 35-page blueprint developed by House Republican leaders, known as a Better Way, will serve as a starting point for the tax-reform discussions. The plan calls for streamlining the income tax system and cutting the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. It would exclude export revenue from taxable income and impose a 20 percent tax on imports.  The border tax proposal has divided the business community and is a top flashpoint for lawmakers. Big exporters such as General Electric Co say the tax would boost manufacturing and jobs. But retailers like Target Corp have said the border tax would hike consumer prices and hurt the economy. Trump, a businessman who had never been in public office until he took over at the White House on Jan. 20, has at times praised the border tax idea but at other times has been noncommittal. Virginia Congressman Dave Brat said he would insist that the tax bill not add to the deficit, while Meadows said he would not necessarily insist on that. Other conservatives said they needed more information about the tax bill to form an opinion - and some space from the contentious health care debate. We just had a major battle on a Republican welfare plan and that has consumed to a large degree my time and mental effort, said Alabama Representative Mo Brooks. When we have a tax reform bill I can evaluate, thats when Ill start voting on it, Brooks said. As a sign of tensions that have lingered after the collapse of the healthcare bill, Freedom Caucus lawmakers faced tough questioning from their colleagues during a closed-door meeting of House Republicans on Tuesday, said Representative Randy Weber of Texas. But Weber said some of the friction eased by the end of the meeting, prompting House Speaker Paul Ryan to say that more give and take might have been useful in the healthcare effort. Ryan said: This is what we should have been doing, Weber told Reuters. Republican Representative Ken Buck of Colorado, a member of the Freedom Caucus, said he thinks lawmakers learned lessons from the healthcare defeat that could apply to tax reform.

FCC Chairman Ajit Pai is set to announce reforms but will not propose completely deregulating the market, two officials briefed on the plan said. The proposal is set to be discussed at the FCCs April meeting. An FCC spokesman declined to comment. Small businesses, schools, libraries and others rely on business data services, or special-access lines, to transmit large amounts of data quickly, for instance connecting banks to ATM machines or gasoline pump credit card readers. Special-access lines are used by offices, retailers, banks, manufacturers, schools and hospitals to move large amounts of data, and wireless carriers rely on them for the backhaul of mobile traffic. Major telecommunications and cable companies have met with FCC staff in recent weeks to talk about the issue, according to FCC records. Under President Barack Obama, then-FCC chairman Tom Wheeler in April 2016 proposed a sweeping reform plan for business data services that aimed to reduce prices paid for services. Wheeler abandoned the proposal in November after Donald Trump was elected president. The data services market is an important business for AT&T Inc, CenturyLink Inc (CTL.N), Frontier Communications Corp and Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), while Sprint Corp and other companies that use the lines say they are being overcharged. Wheeler had proposed maintaining and lowering lower price caps using legacy data systems with a one-time 11 percent reduction in prices phased in over three years. The proposal came under criticism from AT&T and the Communications Workers of America union. Sprint, which backed Wheelers proposal, told the FCC in a March 22 letter that thousands of large and small businesses across the country are paying far too much for broadband because of inadequate competition. Sprint argued a small handful of companies are overcharging the very investors and employers that are critical to our economic growth and are using anticompetitive tactics to ensure that these businesses never have access to competitive alternatives. AT&T argued Wheelers plan was little more than a wealth transfer to companies that have chosen not to invest in last mile fiber infrastructure. In a March 13 letter, AT&T suggested the FCC largely deregulate the market but leave rules in place where there is no competition. CenturyLink and Frontier in a March 20 filing urged the FCC to completely deregulate the market. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

It is alarming and unacceptable for the United States, which has a solemn obligation as the Northern Cheyennes trustee, to sign up for many decades of harmful coal mining near and around our homeland without first consulting with our Nation, Tribal Council Chairman and President Jace Killsback said in a statement. The Northern Cheyenne Tribe in southern Montana said the administration had lifted the moratorium without hearing the tribes concerns about the coal-leasing programs impact on its members and lands. The tribe sent a letter earlier this month to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke requesting a meeting to discuss the issue. Zinke did not respond, and signed the order lifting the moratorium on Tuesday. In a press call on Wednesday, Zinke did not respond to a query about the Northern Cheyenne lawsuit. Killsback said the tribe, which filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Great Falls, would be harmed by lifting the ban. The Northern Cheyenne rarely shares in the economic benefits to the region generated by coal industry and other energy development projects, he said.  About 426 million tons of federal coal are located near the Northern Cheyenne Reservation at the Decker and Spring Creek mines in Montana, the tribe said. However, neighboring tribe, the Crow, relies on coal production as its predominant industry and has called for the relaxation of coal regulations for years. A war on coal is a war on the Crow people, Zinke said on the call. Legal group Earthjustice argued that lifting the coal moratorium imperils public health for the benefit of coal companies. No one voted to pollute our public lands, air or drinking water in the last election, yet the Trump administration is doing the bidding of powerful polluters as nearly its first order of business, Earthjustice attorney Jenny Harbine said in a statement.

(Reuters) - Two former associates of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie were sentenced to federal prison on Wednesday for their part in the Bridgegate lane closure scandal that helped scuttle the Republicans presidential bid. Bill Baroni, 45, the former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, will serve two years, while Bridget Kelly, 44, a former deputy chief of staff for Christie, received a sentence of 1-1/2 years. The defendants were found guilty in November of plotting to close down access lanes at the George Washington Bridge linking New York City and northern New Jersey, the worlds busiest span, for nearly a week in 2013 in an act of political retribution. Prosecutors said the resulting traffic jams in the town of Fort Lee, New Jersey, were intended to punish its Democratic mayor for refusing to back Christies re-election bid, as the governors aides tried to burnish his bipartisan credentials before his 2016 presidential campaign. Christie has denied any involvement and was not charged. But the scandal tarnished his national profile and contributed to record-low approval ratings in his home state. In an NBC interview before the hearing, Christie deflected questions about the appropriate penalty. A spokesman for the governor, Brian Murray, said Christie would have no comment on the sentences.  U.S. District Judge Susan Wigenton in Newark rejected defense pleas that she sentence Baroni and Kelly to probation rather than prison, citing an outrageous display of abuse of power. But she agreed with prosecutors that Kelly bore slightly less responsibility than Baroni, New Jerseys highest-ranking Port Authority official. The agency oversees operations for major bridges, ports and airports in the New York City area and is run by officials appointed by New Jersey and New York states governors. Both defendants told Wigenton they felt remorse. I respectfully ask that you allow me the opportunity to reconnect with my children and rebuild our lives, said a tearful Kelly, a single mother of four. Baroni and Kelly will be allowed to remain free on bail while they appeal their convictions. Following the sentencings, Kelly struck a defiant note outside the courthouse. This fight is far from over, she said. I will not allow myself to be the scapegoat in this case. The plot to use the bridge to inflict political payback was out of the playbook of some dictator of a banana republic, Assistant U.S. Attorney Lee Cortes said in court. During the trial, Kelly and Baroni testified that another Port Authority executive, David Wildstein, convinced them the lane realignment was part of a legitimate traffic study. But Wildstein, who pleaded guilty and was the governments star witness, told jurors the defendants were fully aware the study was a cover story. It was Kellys infamous email to Wildstein saying, Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee, that set the plan in motion, prosecutors said. The three officials selected the first day of school to maximize gridlock and ignored increasingly desperate pleas for help from Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich. No other officials have been charged over Bridgegate, though evidence at trial suggested Christie and numerous members of his inner circle knew about the closures earlier than they had publicly acknowledged. While a number of people outside of this courtroom were involved in what happened in Fort Lee that day, some charged, some not, that does not change the fact that I failed, Baroni said in court. After his White House bid fizzled early in 2016, Christie became one of the staunchest supporters of his former rival, Donald Trump, who went on to win the presidency. Christie headed Trumps transition team and was considered a candidate for a Cabinet post. But he was replaced as transition team chief soon after the election Nov. 8 and passed over for an administration job. State law bars the governor from running for a third term this year. The Bridgegate case indirectly led to one other conviction, after authorities investigating the plot uncovered an unrelated bribery scheme orchestrated by a Christie confidante, former Port Authority Chairman David Samson. Samson pleaded guilty to pressuring United Airlines into operating an unprofitable flight so he could visit a vacation home more easily. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said the committee would advise him on whether the government is getting a fair price from companies that lease public land for energy and natural resource development.  The committee will replace the process put in place by former Interior Secretary Sally Jewell to review and overhaul the federal coal leasing program.

It also ordered a moratorium on new coal leases for at least three years during the review, which Republican President Donald Trump officially rescinded in the executive order on energy he signed Tuesday.  Zinkes committee will instead get recommendations on adjusting royalty rates for coal, as well as oil and gas, from a panel of up to 28 members.

Federal coal, primarily from Wyomings Powder River Basin, accounts for more than 40 percent of all of that fuel mined in the United States and produces for 10 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Zinkes predecessor Jewell said a review of the program was three decades overdue and necessary after reports called for more transparency in the leasing process. Environmental groups raised concerns that replacing the more comprehensive review with a committee approach will mean that other core problems with federal energy leasing will not be addressed, such as transparency and boosting competition in lease sales. Cancelling the coal program review is a serious mistake that only harms American taxpayers, coal states and communities, said Dan Bucks, former director of revenue for the state of Montana.

Sherri Simpson of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, who paid $19,000 to learn Trumps investing secrets, filed court papers earlier this month arguing the class action settlement should not have contained a provision barring her and other students from opting out and suing Trump on their own.   The objection raises the possibility the litigation could continue to dog Trumps presidency. During the campaign, Trump vowed to fight the fraud claims but agreed to the settlement soon after the election. Under the deal, Trump admitted no wrongdoing. Lawyers for Trump and those representing thousands of other students in two class actions will urge U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel in San Diego to overrule the objection and approve the deal.  The students, who paid as much as $35,000 for the seminars, are expected to recover more than 80 percent of the money they paid.  Though Simpsons lawyer, Gary Friedman, called the settlement laudable, he said his client wanted to press for a full recovery, as well as punitive damages and other relief. He is planning to argue the deal should be rejected unless she is allowed to do so. What Ms. Simpson seeks is her day in court, Friedman said in court papers. Simpson and other students claim they were lured into the seminars by false promises that they would learn Trumps investment strategies from his hand-picked instructors. Trump admitted he did not personally select the instructors but said the claim was sales puffery. Rachel Jensen, a class action lawyer for the students, said in a court filing that some 3,730 students submitted claim forms. Two filed objections but only Simpsons lawyers are expected at the hearing.  In court papers, both Jensen and Daniel Petrocelli, a lawyer for Trump, suggested Simpsons objection might be politically motivated. They noted she appeared in an anti-Trump political ad  in February 2016. Defendants paid $25 million to avoid the uncertainty that political opponents might solicit opt-outs to force a high-profile trial, Jensen said. Friedman denied any political motive and said he would appeal if the judge overruled the objection.  Trump accused Curiel of bias last year based on the Indiana-born judges Mexican ancestry.

In a letter to the SECs internal watchdog, Inspector General Carl Hoecker, the Democrats said acting SEC Chairman Mike Piwowar should not have ordered staff to review the SECs rules on conflict minerals and CEO pay ratios because they are mandated by Congress.  Both rules are part of Dodd-Frank, which was passed in 2010 to prevent a repeat of the financial crisis. Republicans have been highly critical of the law, saying its regulatory requirements are too burdensome for businesses. We ask that you conduct an investigation into each of these decisions to determine whether they are legally permissible, and in keeping with the SECs core mission, wrote the lawmakers, which include Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Robert Menendez of New Jersey and Brian Schatz of Hawaii. Brown is the top Democrat on the committee, which has 12 Republicans and 11 Democrats. Christopher Carofine, a spokesman for Piwowars office, declined to comment. A spokesman for the inspector generals office could not be immediately reached for comment. In Wednesdays letter, the lawmakers also complained because Piwowar recently revoked the power of certain mid-level managers in the enforcement division to issue subpoenas, and vested the power solely with the units director. Decisions on how to delegate such authority rest with the SEC chair and do not require a commission vote.  Similarly, while the SEC chair cannot adopt rules unilaterally, SEC rules give the chairman fairly broad latitude to take other actions, such as hiring or directing staff to review rules. Piwowar, a Republican, became the temporary head of the SEC in January. President Donald Trumps choice for SEC chairman, Jay Clayton, is awaiting Senate confirmation. Piwowar announced in late January he had asked staff to review prior compliance guidance on the conflict minerals rule to determine if additional relief is appropriate. He took similar steps with the CEO pay rule a few days later. The conflict minerals rule requires companies to tell investors if their products contain certain minerals from a war torn part of Africa.  The CEO pay ratio rule requires companies to provide a ratio comparing their chief executive officers pay to the median workforce, and is set to start appearing in corporate filings during the 2018 proxy season.

The negotiations involving Jeff Yin, who was arrested along with billionaire Ng Lap Seng in 2015, were disclosed in a letter filed in Manhattan federal court by his attorney, who said prosecutors had extended him a plea offer. The lawyer, Sabrina Shroff, sought to extend court deadlines so that Yin, 31, could consider the plea offer, which is complex and involves civil tax assessments and liabilities, according to her letter. The plea talks come ahead of a jury trial scheduled for May 15, in which Yin and his boss could face substantial prison time if convicted. It was unclear what charges Yin would have to plead guilty to if he accepted the offer. He had faced bribery, money laundering and tax-related charges, and was also accused of violating the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Shroff declined comment. The U.S. Attorneys Office in Manhattan, which is pursuing the case, also declined comment. Ng, who was once linked to a campaign fundraising investigation during former U.S. President Bill Clintons administration, is one of seven individuals charged since October 2015 in the U.N.-related probe. Prosecutors accuse Ng and Yin of paying more than $500,000 in bribes to John Ashe, a former U.N. ambassador from Antigua and Barbuda who served as General Assembly president from 2013 to 2014. Ashe died in June awaiting trial. The indictment said Ng and Yin also paid bribes to Francis Lorenzo, a then-deputy U.N. ambassador from the Dominican Republic who pleaded guilty in March 2016 to bribery and money laundering charges as part of a deal to cooperate in the probe. The main goal of the bribes, according to the indictment, was to have both ambassadors take steps to help obtain United Nations support for a multibillion-dollar U.N.-backed conference center in Macau that Sun Kian Ip Group would develop. Yin, a U.S. citizen who currently lives in California, also faces charges for taking steps to evade paying income taxes and helping Lorenzo conceal portions of his income from U.S. tax authorities.

In a formal written request made to the leaders of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, Wyden said financial relationships between Trump, a real estate developer with properties around the world, and Russia are deserving of scrutiny because of resistance by Trump and some in his orbit have not been forthcoming about their finances. Efforts to understand these relationships and to separate fact from speculation have been hampered by the opacity of the finances of President Trump and his associates, Wyden, who also sits on the intelligence panel, wrote to Republican Richard Burr and Democrat Mark Warner.  The letter, though devoid of new details, is the latest piece of evidence suggesting Trumps business dealings are attracting expanded interest from investigators amid a raft of new reports scrutinizing potential financial entanglements between the president and Russia.  Trump has declined to release his tax returns, bucking decades of precedent for presidents and presidential candidates. The letter followed new disclosures in recent weeks of previously unknown meetings and financial arrangements between Trumps associates and wealthy Russians, and came as Democrats attempt to focus public attention on questions about Trumps connections to Russia. On Monday, the state development bank Vnesheconombank disclosed that its executives had met Jared Kushner, Trumps son-in-law and a top White House adviser, in December. And last week Paul Manafort, Trumps former campaign chairman, admitted he had done business work for Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska. Trump has repeatedly insisted allegations that he or members of his administration have an untoward relationship with Russia as fake news. He has also said that he has no business deals in Russia.     A Reuters investigation published earlier this month found that dozens of members of the Russian elite have bought at least $98.4 million worth of property in seven Trump-branded luxury towers in southern Florida, according to public documents, interviews and corporate records. Wyden has repeatedly tried to push into public light more information about U.S. investigations into Russias role in the 2016 election. He organized a two-sentence letter from seven senators to the White House last November asking the outgoing Obama administration to declassify additional information about Russias interference in the election. Then-president Barack Obama announced a review of Russias activities soon after. U.S. intelligence agencies later released a review of its assessment of Russias multi-pronged influence campaign, concluding Moscows actions were intended to help Trump win and discredit his opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton. Russia has denied the allegations. Wyden in January also asked Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey if his agency was investigating links between Russia and associates of Trump. Comey declined to answer, but last week confirmed the FBI was probing possible ties. Examining finances has long been within the purview of the oversight role of the intelligence panel, Wyden wrote, citing a recent committee report said that financial intelligence has emerged as a significant area of (intelligence community) activity, aiming to follow the money of adversaries.

In a move that concerned the Fraternal Order of Police, one of Trumps  biggest supporters in the 2016 election campaign, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said on Monday that the Justice Department would restrict grants to jurisdictions that do not cooperate with federal immigration authorities. Sanctuary cities, such as San Francisco and New York, refuse to cooperate sometimes by not notifying Department of Homeland Security agents when illegal immigrants are being released from incarceration. Dozens of local governments and cities have joined a  sanctuary movement aimed at protecting immigrants. Trump has vowed to crack down on illegal immigration and in general, these cities offer safe harbor and often do not use municipal funds or resources to advance the enforcement of federal immigration laws. Trump met on Tuesday with police union leaders. Sessions was at the meeting, too, along with Vice President Mike Pence, said Jim Pasco, executive director of the union. The Justice Department plans to restrict sanctuary cities from using grants from the departments Office of Justice Programs and Community Oriented Policing Services, both of which send grant money to local and state police departments.  Pasco said the union does not support the policies of sanctuary cities, but its executives are concerned that cuts in funding could hurt police departments in those areas.  Trump told the group that the policy on sanctuary cities was a work in progress and that he would work with the union to make sure public safety would not be affected, Pasco said.  Trumps reassurances clashed with Sessions announcement, when he said, The Department of Justice will require jurisdictions seeking or applying for department grants to certify compliance with federal immigration law as a condition for receiving these awards. Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 25 seeking to crackdown on sanctuary cities. The order excluded restrictions on funding deemed necessary for law enforcement purposes. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment when asked about the discrepancy between the executive order and Sessions announcement. The spokesman also declined to comment on Pascos account of the meeting.  The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Pasco said he met with Sessions last month and told him the union would oppose any move to restrict federal funding for police. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The White House said earlier Tuesday that President Donald Trump strongly supports the repeal of the rules approved by the Federal Communications Commission in October under then-President Barack Obama. Under the rules, internet providers would need to obtain consumer consent before using precise geolocation, financial information, health information, childrens information and web browsing history for advertising and marketing. Last week, the Senate voted 50-48 to reverse the rules in a win for AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc. The White House in its statement said internet providers would need to obtain affirmative opt-in consent from consumers to use and share certain information, but noted that websites are not required to get the same consent. This results in rules that apply very different regulatory regimes based on the identity of the online actor, the White House said. Websites are governed by a less restrictive set of privacy rules overseen by the Federal Trade Commission. FCC chairman Ajit Pai in a statement praised the decision of  Congress to overturn privacy regulations designed to benefit one group of favored companies over another group of disfavored companies. Last week, Pai said consumers would have privacy protections even without the Obama internet provider rules, but critics say they will weaker. The American Civil Liberties Union, which opposes the measure, said companies should not be able to use and sell the sensitive data they collect from you without your permission. An Internet & Television Association statement called the repeal an important step toward restoring consumer privacy protections that apply consistently. One critic of the repeal, Craig Aaron, president of Free Press advocacy group, said major Silicon Valley companies shied away from the fight over the rules because they profit from consumer data. There are a lot of companies that are very concerned about drawing attention to themselves and being regulated on privacy issues, and are sitting this out in a way that they havent sat out previous privacy issues, Aaron said.  Representative Michael Capuano, a Massachusetts Democrat, said Tuesday that Comcast could know his personal information because he looked up his mothers medical condition and his purchase history. Just last week I bought underwear on the internet. Why should you know what size I take? Or the color? Capuano asked. They are going to sell it to the underwear companies. Comcast declined to comment. Representative Michael Burgess, a Texas Republican, said the rules unfairly skews the market in favor of websites that are free to collect data without consent. Republican commissioners, including Pai, said in October that the rules would unfairly give websites like Facebook, Twitter Inc or Google the ability to harvest more data than internet service providers and thus further dominate digital advertising. The FCC earlier this month delayed the data rules from taking effect. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

McConnell added that Gorsuch will be confirmed on Friday of next week. Senate Republicans continued to put the pressure on Democrats to lend enough support to Colorado appeals court judge Gorsuch to avoid a showdown that in turn could trigger McConnell to seek a change in Senate rules that would clear away a Democratic blockade against the nomination. So far, about 26 of the 48 Democratic senators have publicly announced opposition to Gorsuch. Most of that group backs a growing effort to block a confirmation vote through the use of a procedural hurdle called a filibuster. Sixty votes in the 100-seat Senate would be needed to stop a filibuster and allow a confirmation vote on Gorsuch. The confirmation would require a simple majority in favor. Republicans control the Senate 52-48. Some Senate Republican aides suggested that if Democrats block a confirmation vote, McConnell might move quickly to change the rules. It was unclear, however, if he had enough votes to do so Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer told reporters that Gorsuch will face an uphill climb to get the 60 votes he would need to avoid a showdown over Senate rules.

Democrats and some prominent Republicans have criticized Nunes, a Trump ally, since he announced last week that U.S. security agencies had collected information on Trumps transition team while conducting legal surveillance on other targets. Democrats see the surveillance accusations, which Nunes said were based on unspecified intelligence reports, as a distraction from the probe into possible Russian influence on last years election in Trumps favor that has cast a shadow over the presidents first two months in office.  They have demanded Nunes step aside from his committees investigations into the Russia ties.  House Speaker Paul Ryan, asked at a news conference whether Nunes should step aside from the investigation and if he knew the source of Nunes claims about surveillance, said: No and no. Trump, at an event in the White House, declined to comment on whether Nunes should step back. Nunes had acknowledged visiting the White House grounds to meet a source and review the intelligence reports before making his announcement that Trump and his associates may have been ensnared in incidental intelligence collection. However, he told ABC News on Tuesday he would not divulge who gave him intelligence reports, even to other members of his panel, saying: We will never reveal those sources and methods. Critics say Nunes statements were an effort to justify Trumps unfounded accusations this month that his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, had directed surveillance on Trump Tower during the election campaign. The Senate Intelligence Committee, which is also investigating Russias role in the election, wants to question Trumps son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, about meetings he held with the Russian ambassador and a Russian banker in December.

The 25-14 Senate vote followed the Houses 81-44 passage of the bill last month, with the vote totals falling short of veto-proof margins in both Republican-controlled chambers. In a tweet on Monday, Melika Willoughby, the governors spokeswoman, said instead of addressing the health care needs of vulnerable residents in a sustainable way, the legislature was choosing to expand a failing entitlement program. To expand Obamacare when the program is in a death spiral is not responsible policy, she tweeted. After legislation to replace and repeal the act championed by former President Barack Obama was pulled in the U.S. House last week, President Donald Trump warned Obamacare would collapse. The replacement bill pushed by House Speaker Paul Ryan would have ended the ACAs expansion of Medicaid, the federal and state funded insurance program for the poor and disabled. Kansas was not among the 31 states as of 2016 that had opted to expand Medicaid with the federal government footing much of the cost under Obamacare. With the ACAs enhanced federal funding, Kansas expansion effective Jan. 1, 2018 would cost the state an estimated $31 million in fiscal 2018, which begins July 1, and $67 million in fiscal 2019 with the addition of more than 180,000 recipients, according to estimates cited in a legislative report on the bill. Without enhanced federal matching funds, the states costs would balloon to $465 million by fiscal 2019. Kansas is already struggling with a structural budget deficit largely due to tax cuts enacted in 2012.

That hands-off stance ended this month when Republican AGs voted to abandon the agreement and spend money to help unseat Democrats in other states, according to the Republican Attorneys General Association. The decision has not been previously reported.  The move comes as Democratic attorneys general in states across the country have assumed lead roles in opposing some of Republican President Donald Trumps policies. State AGs in Washington and Hawaii successfully sued to block Trumps executive orders restricting travel from some Muslim-majority countries, and Californias attorney general has pledged to defend the states environmental standards.  Republican attorneys general who supported the change reasoned that AGs should join other national political campaigns which target incumbents, two sources familiar with the closed door process said. Additionally, a desire by some to roll back same-sex marriage and the potential for increased corporate contributions played a role in the decision, said the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss the deliberations.  The so-called incumbency rule observed by the state attorneys party fundraising arms reflected a rare bit of bipartisanship in the polarized environment of U.S. politics, aimed at promoting cooperation across state lines on issues of common interest, such as consumer protection.  Attorneys general are the top public lawyer in each state, charged with defending state agencies from lawsuits as well as initiating litigation on their own. AGs took tobacco companies to court in the 1990s, and pursued mortgage lenders in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. In larger states, an attorney general commands hundreds of lawyers and other resources.  Twelve Republican state AGs on Monday filed a federal appeals court brief supporting Trumps revised travel restrictions.  Scott Will, executive director of the Republican Attorneys General Association, confirmed the decision to abolish the incumbency rule, but declined to discuss specifics of the vote.  The stakes are too high for us to leave winnable races on the table, Will said in a statement to Reuters.  The vote was taken over the phone with a tally of 15-8, the two sources said. Not every Republican AG participated.  Some of those who supported the change argued that every other national campaign committee targets incumbents, so AGs shouldnt be any different, the sources said.  Those opposed expressed fears about threats to bipartisanship, and noted that Republican AGs had grown their ranks under the current system, showing there was no need to change the rules now, the sources said.  In 2000, Republicans held 12 of the 51 state AG positions, including the District of Columbia, but that number is about to hit 29, if a nomination made by New Hampshires Republican governor this month is confirmed.  One of the first fights after the rule change will likely come in Virginia, where Attorney General Mark Herring, a Democrat, is seeking reelection this November. In all, 31 AG elections are scheduled for 2018. Republicans currently hold 18 of those seats, compared to 13 for Democrats, but some of the incumbents may not run for re-election.  Karl Racine, attorney general for the District of Columbia and current co-chair of the Democratic Attorneys General Association, said the Republican groups decision likely means Democrats will follow suit.  Whats good for the goose is good for the gander, Racine said in an interview.  Colorado attorney general Cynthia Coffman, a Republican, is up for election next year in a state that has been trending Democrat. A well-funded push to unseat her, something the Democratic AG group wouldnt have participated in under the incumbency agreement, could spell trouble.  Coffman opposed the incumbency rule change, the sources said. Her office did not respond to a request for comment.  In laying out the reasons for the rule change, Will pointed to the key role Republican AGs played in opposing some of President Barack Obamas policies.  Rolling back same-sex marriage was another issue cited during deliberations, said the two people familiar with the discussion. More Republican state AGs could help further that effort, though the current composition of the U.S. Supreme Court would make any sweeping rollback unlikely.  Additionally, the group discussed a pledge from corporate interests to pour money into unseating Democratic AGs, the two sources said.  Participants in the vote were told that the group had received pledges totaling millions of dollars from organizations including from the company that makes the caffeinated beverage 5-Hour Energy, the sources said. The money depended on the Republican group changing its rules to target incumbent Democrats.  The company that manufactures 5-Hour Energy, Innovation Ventures, declined to comment. A spokesman for the Republican AG group declined to answer questions about the debate, including the role of 5-Hours pledge.  Innovation Ventures has been sued by attorneys general in at least five states for alleged deceptive advertising of its energy drink, with varied outcomes.  Last month a Washington state judge issued a judgment against the company for nearly $4.3 million in one such case, brought by Bob Ferguson, the Democratic attorney general whose lawsuit caused a judge to block Trumps first travel restrictions. The company has said it would appeal the ruling. In at least two other cases, in Oregon and Indiana, Innovation Ventures prevailed. Oregon has appealed.  The precise dollar amount of the companys pledge to Republican AGs could not be determined, nor is it clear if it is the only company that promised a contribution to target Democrats.  Already, the Republican Attorneys General Association has built a fundraising advantage. In 2016, it raised about $14.5 million, including donations from companies and conservative interest groups like the Judicial Crisis Network and Koch Industries, according to tax filings.  Sean Rankin, executive director of the Democratic AG group, said it raised about $5.2 million in 2016. The groups tax filings show a mix of contributors including companies, plaintiff law firms and labor unions.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

At a sometimes fiery 2-1/2-hour hearing that careened from lawmaker concerns over political corruption and national security to privacy rights and tax accounting, the House Ways and Means Committee voted 24-16 along party lines to oppose a Democratic resolution that sought the release of 10 years of Trumps tax returns to the House of Representatives. While the hearing was under way, House Republicans separately turned back a Democratic attempt to force a floor vote on Trumps tax returns.   Committee Republicans accused Democrats of using the tax-writing committee for political grandstanding. This resolution is a procedural tool being utilized and I think, abused for obvious political purposes, panel Chairman Kevin Brady said.   Democrats said they were exercising proper congressional oversight and accused Republicans of protecting Trump. Trump has defied decades of precedent by refusing to release his returns, saying his tax affairs are under federal audit. The Internal Revenue Service says audits pose no obstacle to releasing tax returns. What is he hiding? asked Democratic Representative Bill Pascrell, who introduced the measure. It is our responsibility under the Constitution - very clear, very clear - to provide oversight and root out conflicts of interest.  The rejected measure was part of a Democratic campaign in Congress to force Republicans to confront the issue of Trumps tax returns in hopes of gradually gaining Republican support for their release.  Some Republicans say Trump should release his tax returns. A Ways and Means Republican joined the list on Tuesday. I wish he would, said Representative Pat Meehan, who otherwise argued against the Democratic resolution. Trumps critics say the documents would help determine whether Trumps investments and sprawling business empire pose conflicts of interest on policies involving tax, regulation, China, Russia and other issues.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Tuesday signed an order to undo Obama-era climate change regulations, keeping a campaign promise to support the coal industry and calling into question U.S. support for an international deal to fight global warming. Flanked by coal miners and coal company executives, Trump proclaimed his Energy Independence executive order at the headquarters of the Environmental Protection Agency.  The move drew swift backlash from a coalition of 23 states and local governments, as well as environmental groups, which called the decree a threat to public health and vowed to fight it in court. The orders main target is former President Barack Obamas Clean Power Plan, which required states to slash carbon emissions from power plants - a key factor in the United States ability to meet its commitments under a climate change accord reached by nearly 200 countries in Paris in 2015.  Trumps decree also reverses a ban on coal leasing on federal lands, undoes rules to curb methane emissions from oil and gas production and reduces the weight of climate change and carbon emissions in policy and infrastructure permitting decisions. Carbon dioxide and methane are two of the main greenhouse gases blamed by scientists for heating the earth. I am taking historic steps to lift restrictions on American energy, to reverse government intrusion and to cancel job-killing regulations, Trump said at the EPA.  The room was filled with miners, coal company executives and staff from industry groups, who applauded loudly as Trump spoke. Shares in U.S. coal companies edged higher in response.   The wide-ranging order is the boldest yet in Trumps broader push to cut environmental regulation to revive the drilling and mining industries, a promise he made repeatedly during the 2016 presidential campaign.  Energy analysts and executives have questioned whether the moves will have a big effect on their industries, and environmentalists have called them reckless. I cannot tell you how many jobs the executive order is going to create, but I can tell you that it provides confidence in this administrations commitment to the coal industry, Kentucky Coal Association president Tyler White told Reuters. Environmental groups heaped scorn on Trumps order, arguing it was dangerous and went against the broader global trend toward cleaner energy technologies. A coalition of mostly Democrat-led states and local governments issued a statement saying they would oppose the order in court. We wont hesitate to protect those we serve  including by aggressively opposing in court President Trumps actions that ignore both the law and the critical importance of confronting the very real threat of climate change, the coalition, led by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, said in a statement.  The coalition includes states such as California, Massachusetts and Virginia, as well as cities including Chicago, Philadelphia and Boulder, Colorado. U.S. presidents have aimed to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil since the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s, which triggered soaring prices. But the United States still imports about 7.9 million barrels of crude oil a day, almost enough to meet total oil demand in Japan and India combined. An overwhelming majority of scientists believe that human use of oil and coal for energy is a main driver of climate change, causing a damaging rise in sea levels, droughts and more frequent violent storms.  But Trump and several members of his administration have doubts about climate change, and Trump promised during his campaign to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord, arguing it would hurt U.S. business.  Since being elected, Trump has been mum on the Paris deal and the executive order does not address it. Christiana Figueres, former executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change who helped broker the Paris accord, lamented Trumps order. Trying to make fossil fuels remain competitive in the face of a booming clean renewable power sector, with the clean air and plentiful jobs it continues to generate, is going against the flow of economics, she said. The order directs the EPA to start a formal process to undo the Clean Power Plan, which was introduced by Obama in 2014 but was never implemented in part because of legal challenges brought by Republican-controlled states.  The Clean Power Plan required states to collectively cut carbon emissions from power plants by 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. Some 85 percent of U.S. states are on track to meet the targets despite the fact the rule has not been implemented, according to Bill Becker, director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies, a group of state and local air pollution control agencies. Trumps order also lifts the Interior Departments Bureau of Land Management temporary ban on coal leasing on federal property put in place by Obama in 2016 as part of a review to study the programs impact on climate change and ensure royalty revenues were fair to taxpayers. It also asks federal agencies to discount the cost of carbon in policy decisions and the weight of climate change considerations in infrastructure permitting, and it reverses rules limiting methane leakage from oil and gas facilities.

The long-delayed vote was 97-2 in favor of Montenegros accession to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. That was well above the two-thirds majority needed in the 100-member Senate to ratify Montenegros membership. There was no immediate confirmation of whether President Donald Trump would formally deposit the instrument of ratification, the last step in the U.S. ratification process. However, his administration had supported NATO membership for the tiny Balkan nation, one of Europes smallest, despite Trump at times criticizing the alliance as he campaigned for president last year. While campaigning, Trump accused other NATO members of  failing to pay their fair share while adopting a conciliatory tone toward Russia. But as president, Trump has pledged his support for the alliance. Reuters reported last week that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson wrote to the leaders of the Senate this month to say Montenegros membership in NATO was strongly in the interests of the United States. On Tuesday, the only two no votes came from Republican Senators Rand Paul and Mike Lee, who had delayed the vote for months by refusing to allow a quick vote. Senate leaders held the more time-consuming roll call vote this week after receiving Tillersons letter. Paul had questioned the wisdom of allowing a country with just 650,000 residents and an army of just 2,000 to join the alliance, saying American taxpayers should not be forced to pay if Montenegro were attacked. Russia opposes NATOs enlargement in the western Balkans. Backers said it was important to support countries like Montenegro to promote western values and push back against Moscow, which Montenegrin officials said was partly behind an alleged plot to overthrow their government during an election in October 2016. Moscow dismissed that accusation. With a nearly unanimous vote, the Senate has sent a clear message that it stands firmly with Montenegro and against the Kremlins bullying, said Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a Democratic member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. All 28 NATO members must ratify Montenegros accession in order for the country to join the alliance. Washington is among  the last to do so.

Republican Senator Roy Blunt, a member of his partys leadership, told reporters on Tuesday that money for the wall likely would not be coupled with a spending bill that must pass by April 28 to avoid shutting down federal agencies whose funding expires then. Blunt said the must-do funding comes together better without Trumps additional request for the border wall and military programs and could be considered at a later time. Democrats are threatening to block the bill funding federal agencies from April 29 to Sept. 30, the end of the current fiscal year, if money for the border wall is included. They object to one of Trumps premier 2016 campaign promises, saying it is poorly planned and that there are other border security measures already constructed or under consideration. When he ran for president, Trump pledged Mexico would pay to build the wall, designed to keep illegal immigrants and drugs from entering the United States. The Mexican government has said it will not do so. The initiative has also faced resistance among Republicans, including lawmakers representing some border towns. The federal government would have to purchase land in many locations in order to construct the edifice, which could make construction costs soar. Reuters reported the wall could end up costing as much as $21.6 billion, far more than the $12 billion Trump cited. Representative Mario Diaz-Balart also expressed skepticism about Congress ability to approve funds for the wall, given the super-majority vote needed in the Senate for most major legislation. Asked about the wall, Diaz-Balart, a senior member of the House of Representatives Appropriations Committee and a leading voice on immigration policy, said: Im always willing to look at other things we can do to try to get that 60-vote threshold on border and interior security. Lawmakers said progress was being made on legislation to keep the government running beyond April 28.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": "" WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trumps administration has billed his move to re-open federal lands to new coal leases as a win for miners seeking to expand production. But a review of company filings shows that coal miners with the most to gain already have enough leases in hand to last well over a decade.  Trump will sign a decree on Tuesday to reverse former President Barack Obamas 2016 ban on new federal coal leases, part of a wide-ranging executive order to sweep away green regulations his administration says have hobbled the drilling and mining industries.  When we evaluate energy, lets look at the social cost of not having a job, Trumps Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said in a Twitter post on Tuesday ahead of the executive order.  But companies focused on coal deposits below federal lands, such as Peabody Energy, Arch Coal, and Cloud Peak, have enough coal in the ground on existing leases to last an average of more than 17 years at 2015 sales levels, earnings reports show.  That suggests miners could already ramp up production levels immediately if the market demanded more coal. Energy experts say that is unlikely on a large scale due to stiff competition from cheap and abundant natural gas.  These initiatives prevent things from getting worse for coal, but they wont help much, said Charles Dayton, vice president of market analytics at Doyle Trading Consultants in Colorado, which has been tracking reserve levels on public lands.  Shares in Cloud Peak were up about 3 percent in early trading on Tuesday, ahead of the executive order, with Peabody up 1.5 percent and Arch down 0.3 percent.  The current level of reserves appeared to be within historical norms. A decade ago, under Republican President George W. Bush when there were no bans on federal coal leasing, the industry had about 18 years worth of leases on federal lands, according to a Reuters examination of securities filings.  Arch Coal and Peabody confirmed they have substantial reserves on their federal leases already, but nonetheless welcomed Trumps move.  Peabody has a comfortable amount of reserves in the Powder River Basin, although we recognize the poor public policy represented by the leasing moratorium put into place by the prior administration, Peabody spokesman Vic Svec told Reuters in an email.  Arch Coal has sufficient permitted reserves to sustain our operations on federal lands for a number of years to come, spokeswoman Logan Bonacorsi said. But as with all producers we will need to add reserves over time, and the ability to obtain those reserves when needed is important.  Officials at Peak and Contura did not respond to requests for comment.  Trumps executive order will also seek to undo Obama-era rules limiting carbon emissions. One example is the Clean Power Plan, a regulation that would have increased pressure on states to replace coal-fired power stations with ones using cleaner fuels like natural gas, wind and solar.  Obamas administration imposed the temporary ban on new federal coal leases in January 2016 as part of a broad environmental and economic review to ensure royalties from lease deals provide fair returns to taxpayers.  It was not immediately clear whether the royalty review would continue even with the ban on leases lifted. Some analysts said this scenario could trigger a near-term land rush by companies fearing higher royalty rates in the future.  Coal accounts for about a third of U.S. electricity production, down from about half a decade ago. About 40 percent of all U.S. coal comes from federal lands, mainly in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming and Montana.  Luke Popovich, a spokesman for the National Mining Association industry group, said he expected Trumps executive order to have symbolic impact, at least.  Lifting the moratorium would strengthen the signal to markets that the federal government is not any longer standing in the way of fossil energy, he said.  He added that re-opening federal lands to new leases could also play into a production upswing if demand ultimately increases. The U.S. Energy Information Administration has forecast a 9 percent increase in western coal production to 443.4 million short tons by 2018, driven mainly by higher natural gas prices.  Others were less optimistic about the U.S. coal industrys outlook, saying the best Trump could do is slow the sectors decline. Since 2012, coal production has plunged more than 25 percent to the lowest levels since 1978 due to falling prices. The industry has been hit with massive layoffs and bankruptcies.

Mehmet Hakan Atilla, a deputy general manager of Halkbank, is accused of conspiring with wealthy Turkish gold trader Reza Zarrab to conduct hundreds of millions of dollars of illegal transactions through U.S. banks on behalf of Irans government and other entities in that country. Atilla, a 47-year-old Turkish citizen, looked somber as he appeared at a brief hearing before U.S. Magistrate Judge James Francis in Manhattan, a day after being arrested at John F. Kennedy International Airport. It was unclear whether Atilla has hired a lawyer or made any bail application. He will remain in federal custody for now.  The charges expand a case that has drawn criticism from Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who has said he believed U.S. authorities had ulterior motives in prosecuting Zarrab. Atilla was arrested on the same day it was revealed that Zarrab, the gold trader, had added former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a confidante of President Donald Trump, to his legal team. Turkeys relations with the United States deteriorated under former President Barack Obama, and officials in Ankara had been hoping for improvement under Trump. Turkish officials contacted by Reuters on Tuesday said they had no information on the arrest. According to a criminal complaint, Atilla worked with Zarrab and others from 2010 to 2015 to conceal Zarrabs ability to supply currency and gold to Iran through a Turkish bank, without subjecting the bank to U.S. sanctions. As part of that scheme, Atilla and Zarrab used front companies and fake invoices to trick U.S. banks into processing transactions disguised to appear as though they involved food, and thus were exempt from U.S. sanctions, prosecutors said. United States sanctions are not mere requests or suggestions; they are the law, Acting U.S. Attorney Joon Kim in Manhattan said in a statement. Atilla was charged with conspiring to commit bank fraud, which carries a maximum 30-year prison term, and violating U.S. sanctions, which carries a maximum 20-year term. Atilla had been in New York for the latest in a series of investor meetings ahead of a planned Halkbank dollar-denominated subordinated bond issue, Turkish bankers said. Zarrab, a dual national of Iran and Turkey, had been arrested in 2013 in a corruption probe of people with close ties to Erdogan, who was then Turkeys prime minister. In questioning that case, Erdogan said in September that prosecutors were trying to implicate him by referring in the indictment to Zarrabs donations to an educational charity with which Erdogan and his wife were affiliated. Zarrab has denied the charges in his case, and faces an Aug. 21 trial. He was arrested on March 21, 2016 in Miami while en route to Disney World with his wife and daughter. Ties between the United States and Turkey have been strained by U.S. support for Kurdish militia fighters in Syria, and the presence in the United States of Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Ankara blames for last Julys failed military coup. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is scheduled this week to make a one-day visit to Ankara, where talks with Erdogan will focus on Syria, senior U.S. officials said on Monday. In a court filing on Monday, Kim questioned whether Zarrabs legal team could include Giuliani and former U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey, who work for law firms that also represent some of the alleged U.S. bank victims. Another lawyer for Zarrab said Giulianis and Mukaseys roles would not require them to appear in court. Kim later said his understanding was that both will remain involved in efforts to explore a potential disposition of the criminal charges in this matter. The case is U.S. v.

The current designation process lacks transparency and accountability, insufficiently tracks data, and does not have a consistent methodology for determinations, wrote 10 Republican senators to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, who chairs the Financial Stability Oversight Council.  The council has created substantial new regulatory costs while putting taxpayers on the hook for any future bailout to these firms, said the letter, signed by Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton and Idaho Senator Mike Crapo, who chairs the Senates banking committee.  Treasury did not immediately comment on the letter. The Financial Stability Oversight Council was created by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law, which former Democratic President Barack Obama signed in 2010 to prevent a repeat of the 2007-09 financial crisis. Republicans consider the designations of non-banks one of the most egregious extensions of federal power included in the law. Only two insurers, American International Group Inc and Prudential Financial Inc currently have the label, which triggers tougher oversight and requires them to hold more capital in case they come into crisis. A judge last year struck down the designation of MetLife Inc, and the government under Obama appealed the ruling. Until the appeal is decided, MetLife is not considered systemically important. While an overhaul of Dodd-Frank is progressing in the House of Representatives, reform efforts are moving slowly in the Senate. Representative Ann Wagner, a Republican from Missouri, on Tuesday said the Republican plan, called the CHOICE Act, would make the council more accountable. As chair of the council, Mnuchin may be able to make changes faster than lawmakers. He has said he would like to review the councils work and Republican President Donald Trump has said he wants to cut a lot out of Dodd-Frank. A spokeswoman for Cotton said there were moves Mnuchin, appointed by Trump, could make without legislation, such as dropping the MetLife appeal, releasing FSOCs criteria for labeling non-banks as systemically important, or providing steps that designated companies can follow to have the label lifted.

Members of the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee met with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and acting U.S. Trade Representative Stephen Vaughn to discuss the administrations plans for renegotiating the 23-year-old trade deal.  Representative Bill Pascrell, a New Jersey Democrat, said Ross told lawmakers in the closed-door session that the administration was still aiming to complete NAFTA renegotiations by the end of 2017. That time frame is viewed by some members as ambitious, especially because it is not clear when the administration will formally notify Congress of its intention to launch NAFTA renegotiations, Pascrell said. The notification will trigger a 90-day consultation period before substantial talks can begin. Tuesdays meeting was a legal requirement to prepare the notification and preserve the fast track authority for approving a renegotiated deal with only an up-or-down vote in Congress. President Donald Trump has long vilified NAFTA as draining millions of manufacturing jobs to Mexico, and he has vowed to quit the trade pact unless it can be renegotiated to shrink U.S. trade deficits.  Lawmakers said Ross and Vaughn discussed broad negotiating objectives, but did not get into specific issues such as U.S. access to Canadas dairy sector or rules of origin for parts used on North American-assembled vehicles. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady told reporters that market access, modernizing NAFTA and holding trading partners accountable were key objectives articulated by Ross and Vaughn They were very clear, they want to open access in ag, manufacturing and services as well, so they want this to be a 21st century agreement, Brady said. Spokesmen for the Commerce Department and USTR were not immediately available for comment on the meeting.

Tillerson will hold his first meeting with NATO foreign ministers in Brussels on March 31. He will push allies on how they plan to meet a defense spending goal of 2 percent of gross domestic product, and press NATO to increase its role in the fight against terrorism, the official said. It is no longer sustainable for the United States to maintain a disproportionate share of NATOs deterrence and defense spending, the official said in a briefing with reporters, on condition of anonymity. President Donald Trump has unsettled European allies with demands they increase defense spending and talk of establishing an alliance with Russia to counter Islamic State militants. Tillersons initial decision to skip his first meeting with NATO foreign ministers to attend expected talks in the United States with Chinese President Xi Jinping also reopened questions about the Trump administrations commitment to the alliance. The State Department later said the meeting in Brussels had been rescheduled and Tillerson would attend. Five NATO members - Britain, Estonia, Greece, Poland and the United States - currently meet the 2 percent spending threshold, according to 2016 NATO figures. Members of the alliance have until 2024 to meet the targets. The Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian foreign ministers met with Tillerson at the State Department on Tuesday. The Baltic states have felt especially vulnerable since Russia annexed Ukraines Crimea region in 2014. Asked if they were confident in U.S. support for NATO, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius responded No doubts about that and Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics and Estonian Foreign Minister Sven Mikser nodded in agreement. The senior State Department official said Trump administration officials are pushing allies to do more, faster, absolutely no apology for that. The United States also wants allies to give a clear path on how they would meet the threshold, such as timelines and budgetary commitments, he said. But the official declined to state any specifics on what the United States would do if allies did not meet the targets. Our joint security requires it, thats the main leverage that we have, the official said.

In a letter to Office of Government Ethics Director Walter Shaub, Senator Ron Wyden said he was concerned that Mnuchin had violated his ethics agreement signed in January in his comments on Friday at the end of a live interview with the Axios news website. Mnuchin had agreed to divest his interests in Ratpac-Dune Entertainment Holdings LLC within 120 days of his confirmation, and not participate personally and substantially in any matter that has a direct and predictable effect on the financial interests of the entity unless first obtaining a waiver. RatPac-Dune, co-founded by Mnuchin with producer-director Brett Rattner and media billionaire James Packer, has produced and financed a number of Hollywood hits in recent years, including Avatar, Mad Max: Fury Road and The Lego Batman Movie. At the Axios event, Mnuchin was asked in a question from a reader for a movie recommendation. Im not allowed to promote anything that Im involved in.  So I just want to have the legal disclosure, youve asked me the question, and I am not promoting any product, Mnuchin said. But you should send all your kids to Lego Batman. The comment drew laughter from the audience at the Washington event. Wyden said the Finance Committee had received no notifications regarding Mnuchins holdings in RatPac-Dune and assumed the Treasury chief still held that interest. I am concerned that Sec. Mnuchins comments, may be seen to have a predictable effect on the financial interests of RatPac-Dune, Wyden said in his letter. In a statement, a Treasury spokesman said: As his statement reflects, the Secretary clearly recognized that he generally may not promote private interests and specifically gave the legal disclosure that he was not promoting a movie, but answering a question he was asked directly. The OGE recommended last month that the White House should consider disciplinary action against President Donald Trumps adviser Kellyanne Conway for her on-air comment on Fox News Channel promoting the clothing and jewelry line of Trumps daughter Ivanka Trump. Conway said people should go buy Ivankas stuff. The White House later told the ethics watchdog that Conway had acted inadvertently and without nefarious motive or intent to benefit personally.

Democrats uniformly spoke against the proposal during a meeting of the House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, suggesting the bill would face stronger resistance than in the past.  We should not in any way hinder their independence, said Representative Carolyn Maloney, a New York Democrat, echoing the sentiment of Fed policymakers who say they could come under political pressure to avoid making unpopular decisions such as raising interest rates to slow growth and control inflation.  The next step for the bill would be a floor vote by the entire House, where Republicans hold a solid majority. Republican President Donald Trump expressed support for audits of the U.S. central bank during his election campaign, but it remained unclear whether the White House would back the proposal. Republicans proposed numerous bills during the Obama administration to open the Fed up to deeper scrutiny, arguing the added transparency would ensure the Fed was accountable and free of outside influence.  Currently, the Fed publishes detailed audits of its finances but it keeps the inner workings of its monetary policy deliberations secret, publishing transcripts of policy meetings only with a five-year lag. The proposal approved on Tuesday would put an end to that reign of secrecy, said Representative Thomas Massie, the Kentucky Republican who submitted the bill. The House has already passed versions of the bill twice, with dozens of Democrats joining nearly unanimous Republican support in 2012 and 2014. Those versions of the legislation died in the Senate. Republicans control both houses of Congress but only have a narrow majority in the Senate.  Representative Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts was among Democrats who voted in favor of similar legislation in 2012 and 2014 but came out against the current proposal, saying it could lead to political interference at the Fed. Lynch said he hoped a compromise could be found that increased transparency at the Fed, such as by requiring it to publish transcripts of policy meetings two years after they take place.

Kushner, who is married to Trumps daughter Ivanka Trump, will lead a White House Office of American Innovation to leverage business ideas and potentially privatize some government functions as the White House pushes to shrink government, cut federal employees and eliminate regulations. This office will bring together the best ideas from government, the private sector, and other thought leaders to ensure that America is ready to solve todays most intractable problems, Trump said in a memorandum creating the office that includes about a dozen White House officials. Trump, who campaigned on a pledge to drain the swamp, has enacted a hiring freeze for most civilian federal jobs and proposed massive cuts in U.S. domestic agencies that could shrink the size of government by thousands of workers The Republican president has also proposed sweeping cuts in government regulations and plans to sign an order on Tuesday rolling back some energy regulations. We have a lot more coming, he said on Monday at a ceremony signing bills to repeal four regulations, vowing to eliminate every job-killing regulation that we can find. A number of recent presidents including Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama had mixed success with their own initiatives to reinvent or streamline government using suggestions from the private sector. Kushner has been a regular presence at his father-in-laws side and was earlier cleared by the Justice Department to serve as a White House senior adviser even as Democrats raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest. He has been given a wide range of domestic and foreign policy responsibilities, including working on a Middle East peace deal. He will continue to serve in the other roles even as he takes up the new duties, the White House said.     Last week, Ivanka Trump received her own office in the White House along with access to classified information and a government-issued phone. Aides had said earlier she would not take on a role in her fathers White House. The Washington Post quoted aides as saying she would collaborate with Kushners innovation office but would not have an official role. Among past efforts to overhaul the way Washington works, Clinton in 1993 called for reinventing government. His reforms led to a slower pace of federal hiring, reducing the federal workforce by 240,000 jobs and closing small offices. Congress did not agree to some of the more aggressive cuts. Bush proposed government management reforms, but ended up focusing largely on restructuring national security agencies after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, folding many agencies into the new Department of Homeland Security. Obama in 2012 proposed closing the Commerce Department and creating a new export agency, saving $3 billion over 10 years and cutting 1,000 plus jobs. His plans failed to get congressional approval.

A U.S. Senate committee investigating suspected Russian interference in the election wants to interview Trump associates, including Kushner, 36, who is married to Trumps daughter Ivanka Trump and has agreed to testify.  Kushner previously acknowledged meeting the Russian ambassador to Washington last December and only on Monday did it emerge that executives of Russian state development bank Vnesheconombank (VEB) had talks with Kushner during a bank roadshow last year.  The bank said in an emailed statement that as part of its preparing a new strategy, its executives met representatives of financial institutes in Europe, Asia and America.  It said roadshow meetings took place with a number of representatives of the largest banks and business establishments of the United States, including Jared Kushner, the head of Kushner Companies. VEB declined to say where the meetings took place or the dates.  There was no immediate comment from Kushner.  Allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russian actors were behind hacking of senior Democratic Party operatives and spreading disinformation linger over Trumps young presidency. Democrats charge the Russians wanted to tilt the election toward the Republican, a claim dismissed by Trump. Russia denies the allegations.  MORE FROM REUTERS *Breakingviews TV: Kushner's business *Poll shows Macron win in French election *U.S. shale enlists genetics to boost output But there has been no doubt that the Russian ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kislyak, developed contacts among the Trump team. Trumps first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, was forced to resign on Feb. 13 after revelations that he had discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia with Kislyak and misled Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations.  U.S. officials said that after meeting with Russian Kislyak at Trump Tower last December, a meeting also attended by Flynn, Kushner met later in December with Sergei Gorkov, chairman of Vnesheconombank.  White House spokeswoman Hope Hicks confirmed the meetings, saying nothing of consequence was discussed.  Gorkov was appointed head of VEB in early 2016 by Russian President Vladimir Putin. He graduated from the Federal Security Service, or FSB, Russias internal security agency. He was awarded the Medal of the Order of Merit for Services to the Fatherland, according to the banks website.  According to two congressional staffers, some Senate investigators want to question Kushner and Flynn about whether they discussed with Gorkov or other Russian officials or financial executives the possibility of investing in 666 Fifth Avenue in New York or other Kushner Co or Trump properties if the new administration lifted the sanctions.  VEB, aside from being under sanctions, has been grappling with bad debt after financing politically expedient projects such as construction for the Sochi Winter Olympics.  It received 150 billion rubles ($2.6 billion) in support from the Russian budget in 2016, when its senior management was sacked and replaced by a team of executives from Russias biggest lender Sberbank.  In an article posted on Dec. 18, Forbes estimated that Jared Kushner, his brother Josh and his parents, Charles and Seryl, have a fortune of at least $1.8 billion, more than half of which Forbes estimates is held in real estate.  Forbes did not provide a specific estimate for Jared Kushners net worth on his own.  On Monday, White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters that Kushner is willing to testify to the Senate Intelligence Committee chaired by U.S. Senator Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican.  Throughout the campaign and the transition, Jared served as the official primary point of contact with foreign governments and officials ... and so, given this role, he volunteered to speak with Chairman Burrs committee, Spicer told reporters at his daily briefing.  The Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate panel also said Kushner had agreed to be interviewed but no date had yet been scheduled.  Simply meeting with representatives of a U.S.-sanctioned entity is not a violation of sanctions or against the law.  Evgeny Buryakov, 41, a Russian citizen who worked at Vnesheconombank and whom U.S. authorities accused of posing as a banker while participating in a New York spy ring, pleaded guilty to a criminal conspiracy charge in March 2016. Buryakov admitted in federal court in Manhattan to acting as an agent for the Russian government without notifying U.S. authorities.  He was prosecuted by the office of the U.S. attorney in Manhattan under Preet Bharara, who was among several chief prosecutors fired or asked to resign earlier this month by the new administration.  Also on Monday, a mystery rooted in Trumps claim that he was wiretapped by then President Barack Obama during the election campaign deepened with the disclosure that a top congressional Republican reviewed classified information on the White House grounds about potential surveillance of some Trump campaign associates.  U.S. Representative Devin Nunes, chairman of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, visited the White House the night before he announced on Wednesday that he had information that indicated some Trump associates may have been subjected to some level of intelligence activity before Trump took office on Jan. 20.  Democrats have said Nunes, who was a member of Trumps transition team, can no longer run a credible investigation of Russian hacking, the U.S. election and any potential involvement by Trump associates.  House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, have urged Nunes to recuse himself from the Russia probe.  Nunes told CNN on Monday that he went to the White House grounds because the intelligence information was not available to Congress. He said he did not meet with Trump or his aides at that time and did not coordinate the release of information with the Trump administration.  Nunes spokesman Jack Langer said in a statement that Nunes met with his source at the White House grounds in order to have proximity to a secure location where he could view the information provided by the source.  White House spokesman Spicer did not shed any light on who at the White House helped Nunes gain access to a secure location.  It was the latest twist in a saga that began on March 4 when Trump said on Twitter without providing evidence that he just found out that Obama had my wires tapped in Trump Tower just before the victory.  FBI Director James Comey told Congress last Monday he had seen no evidence to support the claim.  (This version of the story corrects paragraph 1 to show that meeting was in December, not during 2016 presidential campaign. Paragraph 22 has also been corrected to show Buryakov pleaded guilty in March 2016, not Friday.)  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Four more Democratic senators added their support to a growing effort to block a confirmation vote through the use of a filibuster. That procedural hurdle requires 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate to allow a confirmation vote by a simple majority. Republicans control the Senate 52-48. There are now 20 senators who have backed Democratic leader Chuck Schumers filibuster call - up from 16 on Friday.  Senator Joe Manchin, however, announced on Monday that he opposes a filibuster, according to an aide, and Senator Heidi Heitkamp also indicated she would oppose it. Its my duty to fully consider any Supreme Court nominee, regardless of which party is in the White House, she said in a statement. Democratic opposition to Gorsuch could prompt a Senate showdown over the confirmation of the conservative appeals court judge from Colorado, but Republicans could change the Senates rules to disallow filibusters against Supreme Court nominees. Trump is seeking to avoid another setback in Congress after major healthcare legislation he supported was pulled from the House of Representatives floor amid Republican opposition on Friday.  The confirmation of Gorsuch, 49, to replace Antonin Scalia, who died in February 2016, would restore the nine-seat courts conservative majority, a major campaign promise for Trump. The latest Senate Democrats to join the fight include Bill Nelson, who said there are real concerns that Gorsuch would be hostile to voting rights and support businesses over workers and consumers. The other three Democratic senators to have newly announced their opposition were Judiciary Committee members Mazie Hirono, Al Franken and Jack Reed. Manchin and Nelson are among 10 Democrats who conservative activists had hoped would join Republicans in preventing any attempt to block a Gorsuch vote. They are all up for re-election in 2018 in states Trump won in the 2016 presidential election. Democrat Patrick Leahy of Vermont, also a Judiciary Committee member, said he generally opposes filibusters but added that Gorsuch would face one if he does not adequately answer written questions. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said any attempted filibuster would be nothing short of obstructionism. The committee is due to vote next Monday on sending the nomination to the full Senate.

Sessions statements were aimed at a dozens of cities and other local governments, including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, that have joined a growing sanctuary movement aimed at shielding illegal immigrants from stepped-up deportation efforts. Police agencies in those jurisdictions have barred their officers from routinely checking on immigration status when making arrests or traffic stops. And they have refused to lock up individuals longer than otherwise warranted at the request of federal agents seeking to deport them. Trump administration officials says the deportation crackdown is focused on illegal immigrants convicted of serious crimes. They insist public safety is jeopardized when police refuse to notify U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement of plans to release such a person from local custody. Failure to deport aliens who are convicted of criminal offenses puts whole communities at risk, especially immigrant communities in the very sanctuary jurisdictions that seek to protect the perpetrators, Sessions said at a White House news briefing. His threat to withhold grants as punishment drew swift condemnation from California and New York officials. California Senate leader Kevin de Leon, a Los Angeles Democrat, called Sessions threat nothing short of blackmail, accusing of race-based scapegoating in its crackdown on immigrants.  Critics also argue that enlisting police cooperation in rounding up immigrants for removal undermines communities trust in local police, particularly among Latinos. And they question whether the administration is really targeting dangerous criminals. President Donald Trump, who made tougher immigration enforcement a cornerstone of his campaign, directed the government to cut off funding to sanctuary jurisdictions in a Jan. 25 executive order. That order has yet to be put into effect, but Sessions announcement seemed to be the first step in doing so.    The Justice Department grants typically are used to help police improve crime-fighting techniques, buy new equipment and assist victims of crime. Sessions may find his ability to sway local decision-making through the Justice Departments purse is limited, because only a fraction of its grant dollars flow directly to city and county governments.  Federal records show the Justice Department doled out $1 billion to state governments and $430 million to nonprofits, but only $136 million directly to cities and counties last year.  New York state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said his office would continue helping local governments have the tools they need to protect their immigrant communities. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, whose city is home to one of the largest U.S. immigrant communities, also denounced Sessions threat to use funding as a form of coercion. L.A.s values are not for sale, Garcetti said. Slashing funds for first responders, for our port and airport, for counterterrorism, crime-fighting and community-building serves no one. So far no state has adopted policies barring cooperation with immigration authorities, though Marylands Democratic-controlled House of Delegates approved such legislation last week. The states Republican governor, Larry Hogan, has said he would veto the bill. Californias De Leon is backing a bill that would essentially make all of the most populous U.S. state a sanctuary, but he does not currently have the votes to pass it. Sessions sought to frame the debate as a public-safety issue, citing the case of a woman shot to death in San Francisco two years ago by illegal immigrant who had already been deported five times and had seven felony convictions. San Francisco may not be affected by the new restrictions, as the city and county received no funding from the department in the most recent fiscal year. However, Sessions order could impact other jurisdictions. New Orleans, Philadelphia, Chicago and New York City - all singled out as possibly noncompliant by an inspector generals report last year - collectively received $15 million in Justice Department grants. According to Trumps executive order, Sessions would have to wait until the Homeland Security Department determines what constitutes a sanctuary city before funding is restricted. DHS last week reported roughly 120 cities and counties that it deems uncooperative, though the agency has not finalized the list. Sal Tinajero, council member of the California sanctuary city of Santa Ana, questioned whether Sessions even had the authority to make good on his threat. How do you take money away that Congress has already voted to allocate? You cant. Congress has to take another vote, he said.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The decree, dubbed the Energy Independence order, will seek to undo former President Barack Obamas Clean Power Plan requiring states to slash carbon emissions from power plants - a critical element in helping the United States meet its commitments to a global climate change accord agreed by nearly 200 countries in Paris in December 2015.  It will also rescind a ban on coal leasing on federal lands, reverse rules to curb methane emissions from oil and gas production, and reduce the weight of climate change in federal agencies assessments of new regulations. Were going to go in a different direction, a senior White House official told reporters ahead of Tuesdays order. The previous administration devalued workers with their policies. We can protect the environment while providing people with work. Trump will sign the order at the EPA with the agencys Administrator Scott Pruitt, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and Energy Secretary Rick Perry on Tuesday afternoon.  The wide-ranging order is the boldest yet in Trumps broader push to cut environmental regulation to revive the oil and gas drilling and coal mining industries, a promise he made repeatedly during his campaign for the presidency. I cannot tell you how many jobs the executive order is going to create but I can tell you that it provides confidence in this administrations commitment to the coal industry, Kentucky Coal Association president Tyler White told Reuters. Environmental groups have promised to challenge the orders. These actions are an assault on American values and they endanger the health, safety and prosperity of every American, said billionaire environmental activist Tom Steyer, the head of activist group NextGen Climate.  Green group Earthjustice said it will fight the order both in and out of court. This order ignores the law and scientific reality, said the groups president Trip Van Noppen.  Trump campaigned on a promise to sweep aside green regulations he said hurt the economy, and vowed to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord. Since being elected, however, he has been mum on the Paris deal and the executive order does not address it. The White House official said Trumps administration was discussing its approach to the accord, meant to limit the planets warming by reducing carbon emissions. The order will direct the EPA to start a formal review process to undo the Clean Power Plan, which was introduced by Obama in 2014 but has never been implemented in part because of legal challenges brought by Republican states.  The review is likely to trigger legal challenges by environmental groups and some state attorneys general that could last years. The Clean Power Plan would have required states to collectively cut carbon emissions from power plants by 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.

Delrahim is expected to move to the Justice Department after finishing up in the White House counsels office, where he has worked to steer Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch through the Senate confirmation process. The Senate must vote to confirm Delrahim once the nomination is formalized.   As the proposed chief of the Antitrust Division, Delrahim would review corporate mergers at a time when many investors and corporate executives are anticipating a more relaxed view of deal-making after years of tough oversight by the administration of former President Barack Obama.       Antitrust experts who have followed Delrahims career have said that when it comes to merger approvals he would follow in the footsteps of a former boss, Hewitt Pate, who was assistant attorney general of antitrust from 2003 to 2005. Delrahim was Pates deputy, specializing in international antitrust. Under Pate, the division was criticized for allowing too many deals, but it sued to stop US Airways from merging with United Airlines and blocked a deal to combine DirecTV and EchoStar. It tried but failed to stop Oracle Corp from buying PeopleSoft. I know Makan Delrahim to be smart, energetic and expert in antitrust. He is certainly no pushover, said Seth Bloom, a former general counsel of the Senate antitrust subcommittee who knew Delrahim when both worked on Capitol Hill.     Reuters first exclusively reported on March 17 that Delrahim was expected to be nominated to head the Justice Departments Antitrust Division. If confirmed, Delrahim would oversee the Justice Departments assessment of AT&Ts Inc plan to buy Time Warner Inc, the owner of HBO, Warner Brothers and news network CNN.     The department is reviewing a number of major transactions in seeds and agricultural chemicals, like the mergers of Dow Chemical Co and Dupont, and of Bayer  and Monsanto. Those proposed deals, along with ChemChinas purchase of Syngenta, would consolidate six agricultural chemical companies into three.Before going to work at the White House after Trumps inauguration in January, Delrahim was a lobbyist with the law firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, LLP. One client in 2016 was health insurer Anthem Inc, which this year lost a court fight with the Justice Department over whether it would be allowed to merge with Cigna. Anthem has appealed the loss.

The Trump administration slams China on a range of trade issues from its chronic industrial overcapacity to forced technology transfers and longstanding bans on U.S. beef and electronic payment services. Beijing seeks to play down tensions with the United States and put on a positive face ahead of President Xi Jinpings first meeting with Trump next week. Senate Democrats step closer to having enough votes to block a confirmation vote on Trumps Supreme Court nominee with three more Democratic senators coming out against Neil Gorsuch for the lifetime job as a justice. Trump seeks to push his plan for fair trade and more manufacturing jobs back to the top of his agenda by ordering a study into the causes of U.S. trade deficits and a clampdown on import duty evasion. Trump has neither a clear White House tax plan nor adequate staff yet to see through a planned tax overhaul, according to interviews with people in the administration, in Congress and among U.S. tax experts. Democrats are trying to counter Trumps boldest move yet to defang the U.S. consumer financial watchdog, with 40 current and former lawmakers defending the agency in court. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agencys scientific integrity watchdog is reviewing whether EPA chief Scott Pruitt violated the agencys policies when he said in a television interview he does not believe carbon dioxide is driving global climate change, according to an email seen by Reuters. Trump will seek to rebuild the U.S. relationship with Egypt at a meeting on Monday with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi focused on security issues and military aid, a senior White House official says. Trump will host Jordans King Abdullah at the White House next week to discuss the fight against Islamic State militants, the Syria crisis and advancing peace between Israelis and Palestinians, the White House says.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House will take a lead role in crafting legislation to overhaul the U.S. tax code, eyeing an August target date as President Donald Trump seeks his first legislative victory following the failure last week of a long-promised bill to undo Obamacare. Trumps pledge to cut taxes, including a lowering of the rates paid by corporations, was a pillar of his 2016 presidential campaign and provided much of the fuel for the heady stock market rally that followed his Nov. 8 victory. The White House said on Monday it was moving ahead with tax reform, calling it a huge priority for the Republican president and something that he feels very strongly about. Obviously, were driving the train on this, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said during a briefing, adding, Were going to work with Congress on this. Spicer noted that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has talked about August as a target date for tax legislation, but said the timetable could slip depending on how quickly a consensus could be reached. Getting a broad tax bill passed by Congress and on Trumps desk to be signed into law will not be easy, especially after intra-party differences torpedoed the healthcare legislation, after the Trump administration fiercely lobbied for it. Republicans for seven years had promised to dismantle  Democratic former President Barack Obamas Affordable Care Act, dubbed Obamacare, and the Trump administration made it its top priority when Trump took office in January. But the effort collapsed on Friday when members of the Freedom Caucus, the most conservative lawmakers of the House of Representatives, refused to support the bill, which was also backed by House Speaker Paul Ryan. The stinging defeat alarmed investors who began reassessing the chances for passage of the tax agenda this year. Major U.S. stock indexes opened sharply lower on Monday before paring losses, with the Dow Jones and the S&P 500 ending only moderately down.  House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, the top House Republican tasked with tax reform, said over the weekend that the White House should start with proposals already in the House instead of crafting a separate bill. My point is that the Trump tax plan and the House Republican plan started at 80 percent the same. It think its grown to 90 percent or better, Brady told reporters on Monday. I think its critical for the White House and Republicans in Congress to agree on pro-growth tax reform together and move forward together as well, he added.  Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch predicted in a research note that a tax bill, if passed at all, could be a very watered-down version of current proposals. The White House over the weekend dangled the idea of a compromise tax restructuring that could win support from moderate Democrats. White House chief of staff Reince Priebus on Sunday said such a package could include middle-class tax cuts. Spicer on Monday remained vague on how much Trump would allow the federal deficit to grow as a result of the tax cuts. Its a really early question to be asking at this point, Spicer said. The U.S. tax code has not undergone a major overhaul since 1986, during the administration of Republican President Ronald Reagan. Democratic Senator Christopher Coons signaled his party would be open to discussing tax legislation if it was not merely a giveaway to the rich. Democrats had fought former President George W. Bushs tax policies for that reason.  If we have a move toward tax reform that could strengthen manufacturing, strengthen our exports and provide tax relief to the middle-class - not overwhelmingly to the wealthiest - theres a menu for us to start talking about it, the Delaware senator told MSNBCs Morning Joe program. Although winning over Democrats may be tough, the alternative - getting Republicans to vote as a bloc - could be a hard road in light of the healthcare rebellion by Republican lawmakers. Trump is stuck. He cant cajole the arch conservatives in the Republican Party, and at the same time, my sense is the Democrats dont want to throw him a bone either, so it is going to be difficult, said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago. One Republican lawmaker, Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, suggested Congress focus first on such things as getting a realistic budget done and passing legislation to raise the national debt ceiling. And then start on tax reform, Cole told MSNBCs Morning Joe program. But start with real hearings and start in a way that everybody at least at the outset is a potential player.  Representative Ted Poe of Texas, who resigned from the Freedom Caucus after the healthcare debacle, said that getting an infrastructure spending package - another key piece of Trumps legislative agenda intended to spur economic growth - through Congress will be no slam dunk. Its going to be very, very difficult, Poe told CNNs New Day program. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Netanyahu made the pledge in a speech to the largest U.S. pro-Israel lobbying group at a time when the Trump administration is seeking agreement with his right-wing government on limiting settlement construction on land the Palestinians want for a state, part of a U.S. bid to resume long-stalled peace negotiations. But Netanyahu, speaking via satellite link from Jerusalem, avoided any mention of the delicate discussions and stopped short of reiterating a commitment to a two-state solution to the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israels hand and my hand is extended to all of our neighbors in peace, Netanyahu told the annual convention of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC. Israel is committed to working with President Trump to advance peace with the Palestinians and with all our neighbors. But he repeated his demand that the Palestinians recognize Israel as a Jewish state, something they have refused to do. Netanyahu heaped praise on Trump, who has set a more positive tone with Israel than his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, who often clashed with the Israeli leader. He thanked the new Republican president for a recent U.S. budget request that leaves military aid to Israel fully funded. He also expressed confidence in a U.S.-Israeli partnership for preventing Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon, following its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, and  for confronting Irans aggression in the region. Addressing AIPAC later on Monday, Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, vowed that the Trump administration would watch Iran like a hawk to be sure it sticks to the nuclear deal. The accord, which Netanyahu opposed and Trump denounced during his campaign, gave Tehran sanctions relief in return for limits on its nuclear program. On the settlements issue, a round of U.S.-Israeli talks ended last Thursday without agreement. Gaps remain over how far the building restrictions could go, according to people close to the talks. Netanyahus coalition is grappling with divisions that have sparked speculation that he could seek early elections. Many Israelis had expected Trump, because of his pro-Israel campaign rhetoric, to give a green light for settlement expansion in the occupied West Bank. But Trump unexpectedly urged Netanyahu last month to hold back on settlements for a little bit. There is skepticism in the United States and Middle East over the chances for restarting Israeli-Palestinian diplomacy.    Peace talks have been frozen since 2014. Most countries consider Israeli settlements, built on land captured in a 1967 war, to be illegal. Israel disagrees, citing historical and political links to the land, as well as security interests. Trump has expressed ambivalence about a two-state solution, the mainstay of U.S. policy for the past two decades, but he recently invited Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to visit.

Thursdays visit comes at a politically sensitive time in Turkey as the country prepares for a referendum on April 16 that proposes to change the constitution to give Erdogan new powers. A senior State Department official said Tillerson will meet with Erdogan and government ministers involved in the fight against Islamic State in Syria. It is certainly something we are very acutely aware of and the secretary will be mindful of while he is there, one State Department official told a conference call with reporters, referring to political sensitivities ahead of the referendum.  American officials expect Erdogan and others to raise the case of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom the government accuses of orchestrating a failed coup last July. The focus of the Ankara talks is the U.S.-led offensive to retake Raqqa from Islamic State and to stabilize areas in which militants have been forced out, allowing refugees to return home, officials said. A major sticking point between the United States and Turkey is U.S. backing for the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, which Turkey considers part of the Kurdistan Workers Party that has been fighting an insurgency for three decades in Turkey. But the United States has long viewed Kurdish fighters as key to retaking Raqqa alongside Arab fighters in the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). We are very mindful of Turkeys concerns and it is something that will continue to be a topic of conversation, a second U.S. official said. Turkey, Russia and Iran have held Syrian peace talks in Astana, Kazakhstan, on a ceasefire in Syria. The United States has proposed areas of stability where Islamic State has been pushed out and refugees can be returned. Six years since the start of the uprising against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, he is winning on the battlefield although the war is far from over. The once stable country is broken into fiefdoms ruled by rebels and warlords.

At least eight big banks allegedly victimized by the trader, Reza Zarrab, are current or former clients of Giuliani and Mukaseys law firms, acting U.S. Attorney Joon Kim in Manhattan said in a letter dated Monday to the federal judge hearing the case. The banks relationships with the law firms require a special hearing, known as a Curcio hearing, to make sure Zarrab understands the potential conflict, Kim said. Giuliani is a lawyer for Greenberg Traurig, while Mukasey, who is also a former federal judge, is a lawyer for Debevoise & Plimpton. Neither firm had an immediate comment. The eight banks are Bank of America Corp, Citigroup Inc, Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Standard Chartered Plc, UBS Group AG and Wells Fargo & Co. Through various deceptive acts, including layering the transactions and omitting information concerning the Iranian nexus, Zarrab and his co-conspirators allegedly tricked numerous U.S. financial institutions into processing barred transactions, thus exposing them to significant potential loss, Kim said in a letter to U.S. District Judge Richard Berman, explaining the potential conflict of interest. Prosecutors accused the Iranian-born Zarrab and two others of engaging in hundreds of millions of dollars of transactions for Irans government and Iranian entities from 2010 to 2015, in a scheme to evade U.S. sanctions. A trial is scheduled for Aug. 21. Zarrab has been in federal custody since his March 21, 2016, arrest in Miami, while en route to Disney World with his wife and daughter. Holding a Curcio hearing now could eliminate one ground for appeal if the case goes against Zarrab. The case has been closely watched in Turkey, where Zarrab was arrested in 2013 in a corruption probe into individuals with close ties to Tayyip Erdogan, then Turkeys prime minister and now its president. Zarrab is a dual national of Iran and Turkey. Another lawyer for Zarrab, Benjamin Brafman, said in a letter on Monday that Giuliani and Mukaseys roles will not require any appearance in court and, accordingly, a hearing is not required.

The senators, led by Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, sent a letter to Icahn pointing out that, as a Trump adviser on regulation, he has made policy proposals that benefit his own investments - which range from an oil refinery to an nutritional supplement manufacturer. We write because we are increasingly concerned about the role you are playing in the Trump Administration and the possibility that you are breaking federal conflict of interest laws, the seven senators wrote in the letter, seen by Reuters. Calls to Icahns office and lawyer were not immediately answered.  Icahn has been thrust into the limelight in recent weeks after the Renewable Fuels Association said he had informed them that Trump was preparing an executive order to overhaul the U.S. biofuels program in a way that benefited refiners. The White House quickly denied it had an executive order in the works, and pointed out that Icahn held an informal, unpaid role as adviser to Trump.  The senators said that despite the administration downplaying his role, Icahn has disclosed to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that he was a special adviser, meaning it is important to shareholders of the companies in which he holds stakes in.  Icahn owns an 82 percent stake in CVR Energy, which along with other refining companies, has called for changes to the Renewable Fuel Program to shift the burden of blending biofuels into gasoline away from refiners and further down stream to marketers. Icahn has said the change would help the entire refining industry, not just CVR.  Icahn also owns stakes in Herbalife and Bristol Meyers-Squib. The senators said Icahn had helped Trump pick the heads of the Treasury, Commerce, and the SEC, which have some oversight over the companies in which he has a stake. Your ownership of each of these companies  and others  raises alarming questions about how you, and the Trump Administration, are handling your many conflicts of interest, the senators wrote. In their letter, the senators said Icahn should be re-classified by the Trump administration as a special government employee, making him subject to ethics requirements.  When Trump announced in December that Icahn would be a special adviser, Trump made clear he would not be serving as a federal employee or a Special Government Employee and will not have any specific duties.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": "" OSLO (Reuters) - A 2015 global pact for fighting climate change will benefit in some ways at least if U.S. President Donald Trump carries out a threat to pull out, backers say, in a shift from gloom about the fate of a deal that took two decades to negotiate.  The Paris Agreement requires consensus for all decisions, meaning the withdrawal of a recalcitrant United States would make it easier for emitters such as China and the European Union to design details of a trillion-dollar shift from fossil fuels.  Trump has called man-made climate change a hoax and made a so-far unfulfilled campaign pledge to cancel the agreement, saying he wants to promote the domestic fossil fuel industry.  In a step to undo environmental regulations introduced under former President Barack Obama, Trump will sign an order on Tuesday aimed at making it easier for companies to produce energy in the United States.  There will be some advantages for other countries and there will also be extraordinary disadvantages, if the U.S. ends up quitting Paris, said Christiana Figueres, an architect of the agreement who was the U.N.s climate chief in Paris.  Its not a black and white scenario, she said.  She said the ideal outcome, both for the United States and other nations, was for Washington to stay and make deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. There were better investment prospects for renewable energies such as solar power than coal, she added.  The fear has long been that a pullout of the worlds top economy would drain other nations willingness to cut greenhouse gas emissions under an agreement ratified by nations as diverse as China, Saudi Arabia and African countries.  But there is an emerging rival view that Paris might be better off.  The Achilles heel of the Paris Agreement is that its built on consensus, said Johan Rockstrom, director of the Stockholm Resilience Center at Stockholm University.  Its very difficult to have a negative giant in the room able to obstruct all decisions, he said, adding that he had swung in recent weeks to reckon that a U.S. pullout would be better overall from an earlier view that it would be a big failure.  The Paris Agreement has few binding obligations. It lets all nations set their own goals for fighting climate change and has no penalties for non-compliance.  Governments have set a 2018 deadline to work out a rule book for the Paris Agreement, filling in details, for instance, of how nations will report and monitor their curbs on emissions.  Maldives Environment Minister Thoriq Ibrahim - chair of the Alliance of Small Island States whose members fear they are at risk from rising sea levels - urged continued U.S. participation in Paris.  The closer you look at it, the clearer it becomes that it (the Paris Agreement) also promotes important strategic, economic, and security benefits as well, he said.  Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg also said it would be better for the United States to stay. But I dont think that its the end of the Paris Agreement if the United States decides to leave, she said.  Oliver Geden, of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, disagreed. A U.S. withdrawal would badly undermine the Paris Agreement and any decisions would be largely irrelevant without the worlds biggest economy, he said. The momentum could fade away pretty soon, he predicted.  Still, almost 200 nations agreed after Trumps election in November that the world had an urgent duty to combat an alarming and unprecedented rate of global warming.  The pace and scale of change already underway in the global economy is remarkable and irreversible, said Stephanie Pfeifer, head of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, a forum with 18 trillion euros ($20 trillion) in assets under management.  Renewables have already overtaken coal as a global power source, electric vehicles are the growth segment of the auto industry and jobs are being created very rapidly in clean energy, she said.  The U.S. target under Paris, set by Obama, is to cut emissions by between 26 and 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 as part of global efforts to avert more downpours, droughts, heatwaves and floods.  Trumps pro-coal policies are likely to make U.S. emissions cuts less ambitious.  By staying in the Paris Agreement, Trump would also undermine a demand in its Article 4 that successive national climate plans have to be ever deeper cuts. A U.S. pullout would make it easier for backers to argue that the principle has not been violated.  The Paris Agreement sets an over-riding goal of limiting global warming to well below two degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. The United Nations says that current pledges are insufficient to meet that goal.  ($1 = 0.9179 euros)  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

MORE FROM REUTERS More Democrats oppose Trump's Supreme Court pick After healthcare flop, White House looks to Congress for help on tax reform Obamacare exploding? Maybe just a slow burn The election of Trump has been a clarion call to progressives in the Protestant and Catholic churches in America to move out of a place of primarily professing progressive policies to really taking action, she said.  Although not as powerful as the religious right, which has been credited with helping elect Republican presidents and boasts well-known leaders such as Christian Broadcasting Network founder Pat Robertson, the religious left is now slowly coming together as a force in U.S. politics.  This disparate group, traditionally seen as lacking clout, has been propelled into political activism by Trumps policies on immigration, healthcare and social welfare, according to clergy members, activists and academics. A key test will be how well it will be able to translate its mobilization into votes in the 2018 midterm congressional elections.  Its one of the dirty little secrets of American politics that there has been a religious left all along and it just hasnt done a good job of organizing, said J. Patrick Hornbeck II, chairman of the theology department at Fordham University, a Jesuit school in New York.  It has taken a crisis, or perceived crisis, like Trumps election to cause folks on the religious left to really own their religion in the public square, Hornbeck said.  Religious progressive activism has been part of American history. Religious leaders and their followers played key roles in campaigns to abolish slavery, promote civil rights and end the Vietnam War, among others. The latest upwelling of left-leaning religious activism has accompanied the dawn of the Trump presidency.  Some in the religious left are inspired by Pope Francis, the Roman Catholic leader who has been an outspoken critic of anti-immigrant policies and a champion of helping the needy.  Although support for the religious left is difficult to measure, leaders point to several examples, such as a surge of congregations offering to provide sanctuary to immigrants seeking asylum, churches urging Republicans to reconsider repealing the Obamacare health law and calls to preserve federal spending on foreign aid.  The number of churches volunteering to offer sanctuary to asylum seekers doubled to 800 in 45 of the 50 U.S. states after the election, said the Elkhart, Indiana-based Church World Service, a coalition of Christian denominations which helps refugees settle in the United States - and the number of new churches offering help has grown so quickly that the group has lost count.  The religious community, the religious left is getting out, hitting the streets, taking action, raising their voices, said Reverend Noel Anderson, its national grassroots coordinator.  In one well-publicized case, a Quaker church in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on March 14 took in a Honduran woman who has been living illegally in the United States for 25 years and feared she would be targeted for deportation.  Leaders of Faith in Public Life, a progressive policy group, were astounded when 300 clergy members turned out at a January rally at the U.S. Senate attempting to block confirmation of Trumps attorney general nominee, Jeff Sessions, because of his history of controversial statements on race.  Ive never seen hundreds of clergy turning up like that to oppose a Cabinet nominee, said Reverend Jennifer Butler, the groups chief executive.  The group on Wednesday convened a Capitol Hill rally of hundreds of pastors from as far away as Ohio, North Carolina and Texas to urge Congress to ensure that no people lose their health insurance as a result of a vote to repeal Obamacare.  Financial support is also picking up. Donations to the Christian activist group Sojourners have picked up by 30 percent since Trumps election, the group said.  But some observers were skeptical that the religious left could equal the religious right politically any time soon.  It really took decades of activism for the religious right to become the force that it is today, said Peter Ubertaccio, chairman of the political science department at Stonehill College, a Catholic school outside Boston.  But the power potential of the religious left is not negligible. The Moral Mondays movement, launched in 2013 by the North Carolina NAACPs Reverend William Barber, is credited with contributing to last years election defeat of Republican Governor Pat McCrory by Democrat Roy Cooper.  The new political climate is also spurring new alliances, with churches, synagogues and mosques speaking out against the recent spike in bias incidents, including threats against mosques and Jewish community centers.  The Sisterhood of Salaam Shalom, which encourages alliances between Jewish and Muslim women, has tripled its number of U.S. chapters to nearly 170 since November, said founder Sheryl Olitzky.  This is not about partisanship, but about vulnerable populations who need protection, whether its the LGBT community, the refugee community, the undocumented community, said Rabbi Jonah Pesner, director of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, using the acronym for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender.  More than 1,000 people have already signed up for the centers annual Washington meeting on political activism, about three times as many as normal, Pesner said.  Leaders of the religious right who supported Trump say they see him delivering on his promises and welcomed plans to defund Planned Parenthood, whose healthcare services for women include abortion, through the proposed repeal of Obamacare.  We have not seen any policy proposals that run counter to our faith, said Lance Lemmonds, a spokesman for the Faith & Freedom Coalition, a nonprofit group based in Duluth, Georgia.

The threat by White House chief of staff Reince Priebus to build a broad coalition on tax reform that could include moderate Democrats came as the Republican head of the tax-writing committee in the House of Representatives said he hoped to move a tax bill through his panel this spring. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady said his committee had been working on tax reform in parallel with the failed healthcare reform push.  Weve never stopped working, Brady told Fox News Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo. We will continue to make improvements. Brady said the committee planned to move on the bill in the spring. He said he wanted the House blueprint to be the basis for Trumps tax reform plan rather than have competing versions from Treasury and the White House. Investors on Wall Street worry the healthcare bills defeat bodes poorly for tax reform. Equities have rallied since Trumps election partly on expectations of tax cuts. Economic growth would be more modest without fiscal stimulus and U.S. equity index futures fell to a six-week low on Sunday. Both Trump and Priebus have scolded hardline conservatives who rejected legislation backed by the White House to replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. Speaking on Fox News Sunday, Priebus held out the possibility of working with moderate Democrats as well as Republicans to pass other aspects of Trumps agenda, such as his proposed budget, the revamp of the tax code and a renewed effort at healthcare reform. If we can come up with a bill that accomplishes the goals of the president with Republicans alone, well take it and well move forward with it, Priebus said. But he added: I think its more or less a warning shot that were willing to talk to anyone. We always have been and I think more so now than ever. In an embarrassment for Trump, who had campaigned for the White House on what he said were his skills as a dealmaker, the healthcare bill was pulled from the floor of the House of Representatives on Friday because it failed to draw enough support from within Trumps Republican Party. Objections from members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus and from moderate Republicans left leaders short of the votes needed for passage, with Democrats unified in opposition. Trump failed to win over the Freedom Caucus lawmakers despite courting them intensively. Outside conservative groups such as the Club for Growth and Heritage Action for America that are closely aligned with the Freedom Caucus had strongly opposed the Republican healthcare bill and urged lawmakers to reject it. In a tweet on Sunday morning, Trump lashed out at both the Freedom Caucus and the conservative groups, saying their actions had left Democrats smiling in D.C. Priebus said it was a real shame that conservative lawmakers decided not to get behind the healthcare bill. And I think the president is disappointed in the number of people he thought were loyal to him that werent, he said. MIDDLE-CLASS TAX CUT Trump has put tax reform at the top of his legislative agenda now that the healthcare bill has failed. Priebus said Trump was not backing off his view that the tax reform bill needed a border tax. He also said that the measure would include a middle-class tax cut that he said might help to attract votes from moderate Democrats.     In a sign that not everyone in the Freedom Caucus was in line with its approach and a positive signal for Trump as he looked ahead to tax reform, U.S. Representative Ted Poe, a Texas Republican, said he had resigned from the group. In order to deliver on the conservative agenda we have promised the American people for eight years, we must come together to find solutions to move this country forward, Poe said in a brief statement. Saying no is easy, leading is hard. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer criticized Trump over his handling of the healthcare bill and said Republicans would face roadblocks from conservatives on other issues. Theyre going to repeat the same mistake they made on Trumpcare with tax reform, Schumer told ABCs This Week. He urged Trump to go a different path: Reject the Freedom Caucus and work with Democrats.  If he changes, he could have a different presidency, Schumer said. Hes going to have to tell them he cant work with them and well certainly look at his proposals. But its going to be guided on our values. Republican Representative Mark Meadows, chairman of the Freedom Caucus, said on Sunday he was optimistic on tax reform and that his group could support a plan that is not revenue neutral.  So, tax reform and lowering taxes, you know, will create and generate more income, he said. And so were looking at those, where the fine balance is. But does it have to be fully offset?

Speaking to a group of small business owners in Charleston, West Virginia, Pence said President Donald Trump is ready to move on to his next priority: simplifying the tax code and cutting tax rates. Were going to roll our sleeves up and were going to cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses and family farms, Pence said. Working with this Congress, President Trump is going to pass the largest tax cut since the days of Ronald Reagan, and were going to get this American economy moving again, he said. Comprehensive tax reform has eluded previous Congresses and administrations since 1986 when it was last accomplished under former President Ronald Reagan. Pence made his comments the day after the Republican-controlled House of Representatives failed to find enough support within its own ranks to pass legislation to roll back Obamacare  a setback that raised doubts about Trumps ability to deliver on other big promises requiring help from Congress. Trump and Republicans had campaigned to overhaul former President Barack Obamas health care law, which they have argued is too intrusive and expensive. As we all learned yesterday, Congress just wasnt ready, said Pence, who spent a dozen years in Congress starting in 2001, and has been a key emissary for Trump on Capitol Hill. With 100 percent of House Democrats  every single one  and a handful of Republicans actually standing in the way of President Trumps plan to repeal and replace Obamacare, were back to the drawing board, Pence said. On tax reform, Pence said Trump wants to cut the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent to spur investment. The House of Representatives tax committee is working on legislation that would cut the corporate rate to 20 percent. Pence said the White House also would seek to work with Congress to boost funding for the military, roll back regulations on the energy sector, and confirm Judge Neil Gorsuch, Trumps pick to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""CHICAGO (Reuters) - Republicans may have failed to overthrow Obamacare this week, but there are plenty of ways they can chip away at it. The Trump administration has already begun using its regulatory authority to water down less prominent aspects of the 2010 healthcare law.  Earlier this week, newly confirmed Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price stalled the rollout of mandatory Medicare payment reform programs for heart attack treatment, bypass surgery and joint replacements finalized by the Obama administration in December. The delays offer a glimpse at how President Donald Trump can use his administrative power to undercut aspects of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), including the insurance exchanges and Medicaid expansion that Republicans had sought to overturn. The Republicans failure to repeal Obamacare, at least for now, means it remains federal law. Prices power resides in how to interpret that law, and which programs to emphasize and fund. Hospitals and physician groups have been counting on support from Medicare - the federal insurance program for the elderly and disabled - to continue driving payment reform policies built into Obamacare that reward doctors and hospitals for providing high quality care at a lower cost. The Obama Administration had committed to shifting half of all Medicare payments to these alternative payment models by 2018. Although he has voiced general support for innovative payment programs, Price has been a loud critic of mandatory federal programs that dictate how doctors should deliver healthcare. Providers such as Dr. Richard Gilfillan, chief executive of Trinity Healthcare, a $15.9 billion Catholic health system, say they will press on with these alternative payment plans with or without the governments blessing. But they have been actively lobbying Trump officials for support, according to interviews with more than a dozen hospital executives, physicians and policy experts. Without the backing of Medicare, the biggest payer in the U.S. healthcare system which Price now oversees, the nascent payment reform movement could lose momentum, sidelining a transformation many experts believe is vital to reining in runaway U.S. healthcare spending. Price cant change the legislation, but of course hes supposed to implement it. He could impact it, said John Rother, chief executive of the National Coalition on Health Care, a broad alliance of healthcare stakeholders that has been lobbying the new administration for support of value-based care. The move Friday to pull the Republican bill only reinforces the risk to the existing law, which Trump said on Friday will soon explode.  It seems that the Trump Administration now faces a choice whether to actively undermine the ACA or reshape it administratively, Larry Levitt, senior vice president at Kaiser Family Foundation, wrote on Twitter. The ACA marketplaces werent collapsing, but they could be made to collapse through administrative actions, he added. The United States spends $3 trillion a year on healthcare - more by far than 10 other wealthy countries - yet has the lowest life expectancy and the highest infant mortality rate, according to a 2013 Commonwealth Fund report. Link to Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2nkTWoC Health costs have soared thanks in part to the traditional way doctors and hospitals get paid, namely by receiving a fee for each service they provide. So the more advanced imaging tests a doctor orders or pricey procedures they perform, the more money he or she makes, regardless of whether the patients health improves. We have a completely broken economy in healthcare, said Blair Childs, senior vice president at hospital purchasing group Premier Inc. Literally, all of the incentives in fee-for-service are for higher cost. Alternative payment models are designed to remove incentives that reward overtreatment of patients. Private insurers are on board, with Aetna Inc, Anthem Inc, UnitedHealth Group and most Blue Cross insurers announcing plans to shift half of their reimbursement to alternative payment models to control costs. To promote the shift to alternative payments, the ACA created an incubator program at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). The CMS innovation center is funded by $10 billion over 10 years to test payment schemes aimed at improving quality and cutting the cost of care.  The Obama administrations decision to make some of these payment programs mandatory has drawn the ire of Price, a former U.S. senator and orthopedic surgeon. In response to a mandatory payment program for joint replacements last September, for example, Price charged that the CMS innovation center was experimenting with Americans health. In his January 17 confirmation, Price said he was a strong supporter of innovation, but said he believed the CMS innovation center has gotten a bit off track. President Trump has already signed an executive order directing the HHS to begin unraveling Obamacare. In the early hours of his presidency, Trump directed government agencies to freeze regulations and take steps to weaken the healthcare law. The order directed departments to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of provisions that imposed fiscal burdens on states, companies or individuals. These moves were meant to minimize the costs and regulatory burdens imposed on states, private entities and individuals. David Cutler, the Harvard health economist who helped the Obama Administration shape the ACA, said Price could do all sorts of things to undermine the law. If he wants to blow it up, he can, Cutler said in an email. But if they do, he added, they alone will own the failure.   ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Stone, an informal adviser to Trump, told ABCs This Week he had not received a reply from the House of Representatives intelligence committee on his offer of public testimony. Along with former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, who has also offered to appear before the panel, Stone was among the Trump associates whose communications and financial transactions were being examined by the FBI and others as part of a larger investigation into possible links with Russian officials, according to a Jan. 20 report in the New York Times. Without citing any names, FBI Director James Comey confirmed at the committees public hearing last week that the FBI was investigating possible Russian ties to Trumps campaign as Moscow sought to influence the 2016 election. Stone said he was anxious to testify in public. I reiterate again, I have had no contacts or collusions with the Russians, he told ABC, adding later, There is no collusion, none, at least none that I know about, in Donald Trumps campaign for president.  At Mondays intelligence committee hearing, Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the panel, cited concern over Stones communications with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and Guccifer 2, who claimed responsibility for hacking the Democratic groups. Stone said he had spoken to Assange through an intermediary and to Guccifer on Twitter in an exchange he made public. Stone also cast doubt on whether Guccifer was a Russian agent. Just because the intelligence services say something, as we know from history, does not make it true, he said, reflecting the doubts that Trump himself has sown about U.S. spy agencies. Carter Page, another Trump campaign adviser whose contacts with Russians were mentioned by Schiff at Mondays hearing, also has offered to appear before the committee, according to multiple media reports. The U.S. intelligence community has concluded that Russia sponsored the hacking of Democratic Party groups during the 2016 campaign to benefit Republican Trump over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Russia has denied the allegations of meddling. Trump has dismissed the idea of any coordination between his campaign and Russia and has accused Democrats and the media of using the issue to attack him. The House committee investigation was marred on Wednesday after its Republican chairman, Representative Devin Nunes, announced to the public and briefed Trump that U.S. intelligence may have swept up communications by Trump associates before telling the committee. Nunes apologized to the intelligence panel the next day. However, he further alienated Democrats on the committee on Friday when he canceled a hearing with intelligence officials from former Democratic President Barack Obamas administration in order to have a classified briefing with the directors of the National Security Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation. The committees top Democrat, Adam Schiff, suggested the cancellation came after pressure from the White House. Schiff and other Democrats said last weeks actions raised more doubts about whether Nunes, a Trump ally who served on the presidents transition team, can conduct a credible investigation. I think the chairman has to make a decision whether to act as a surrogate of the White House as he did during the campaign and the transition or to lead an independent and credible, investigation, Schiff told CBS Face the Nation.

During the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, Trumps team spoke often about moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem. But since taking office, the contentious issue appears to have moved to the backburner. After decades of simply talking about it, the president of the United States is giving serious consideration to moving the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, Pence said in a speech to the influential, pro-Israel U.S. lobbying group AIPAC. Israel regards Jerusalem as its eternal and indivisible capital and wants all countries to base their embassies there, though Israeli politicians also understand that moving the U.S. embassy there could be destabilizing. The relocation is strongly opposed by many U.S. allies as the Palestinians also claim the city as their capital. The final status of Jerusalem is supposed to be determined via direct negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians. If the United States were to relocate its embassy, it would be seen as an explicit recognition of Jerusalem belonging to Israel, potentially pre-determining the outcome of eventual peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.

Only Trump himself was spared their wrath.  Many voters who elected him appeared largely willing to give him a pass on the collapse of his campaign promise to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system, stressing his short time in office.

Maybe just a slow burn Being a businessman, hell not take no for an answer, said Tony Nappi, a 71-year-old from Trinity, Florida, one of the many disappointed Republicans on his weekend softball team. Hell get the job done.  Support for Trump appeared unflagging, from the playing fields of a Republican stronghold in central Florida to the small town diners of North Carolina, the suburbs of Arkansas and the streets of working-class Staten Island in New York City.  Rebellion among members of his own party sealed the failure of Trumps effort to repeal and replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act - known as Obamacare - the signature domestic policy achievement of Democratic former President Barack Obama.  Despite casting himself on the campaign trail asthe bestdealmaker there is, Trump could not save the healthcare bill yanked by Republican leaders in the House of Representatives on Friday in an embarrassing turn of events for them and Trump. Objections among Republican moderates and the partys most conservative lawmakers left leaders short of the votes needed for passage, with Democrats unified in opposition.  He cant wave a magic wand, said Ramona Bourdo, 70, a retired nurse, eating breakfast at a McDonalds in suburban Little Rock, Arkansas. Ive not lost confidence in him.  Still, the barista at the Grind Cafe in Morganton, North Carolina, who cannot afford his own insurance and remains on his parents plan, felt Trump shared responsibility in the debacle.  I think its partially his fault, said Joel Martin, a 21-year-old Republican and Trump supporter. I dont think he has enough personal knowledge to do what he needs to do to get a healthcare bill through Congress.  His hometown, population 17,000, sits within the heavily rural congressional district of Representative Mark Meadows, a North Carolina Republican whose opposition as the head of the conservative House Freedom Caucus helped sink the bill.  Sharing in the frustration of loyal Republicans was 82-year-old Jeanette Madison, a registered independent in the New York City borough of Staten Island, who voted for Trump.  I blame the Democrats and Republicans in Congress. They are a bunch of bastards. Im just fed up, she said, apologizing for colorful language as she walked her dog down a city street.  In Floridas Pasco County, where Trumps stronger-than-expected showing helped to seal his victory in the largest U.S. battleground state, some fans seized on the silver lining.  Neighbors Patti Niehaus, a Democrat, and Margie Hahne, a Republican, agreed that Trump may have needed last weeks crash course in governing, having never before held elected office.  You cant just go and tell people what to do like hes used to doing, said Hahne, 74. Trumps got to learn a lot.  Bridging Tampas booming suburbs and still rural parts of central Florida, Pasco County lies in a politically decisive swing region of the state along the Interstate 4 highway corridor linking Tampa and Orlando.  Trump won 58.4 percent of the vote in the mostly white, working- and middle-class county, surpassing the past two Republican presidential candidates by tens of thousands of votes.  His pledge to end Obamacare helped to sway Kelle DeGroat, a 37-year-old nurse, a Republican who is open to other parties.  I thought there was a good plan the way he talked, said DeGroat, still confident in Trumps ability to make reform happen. I was shocked that it didnt pass.  Other Republicans applauded their leaders for returning to the drawing board, with polls showing the derailed healthcare plan to be unpopular following predictions that it would jeopardize or increase the cost of insurance for millions.  Lisa Collins, a 53-year-old teacher with two adult children benefiting from Obamacare, for the first time started calling the regions elected representatives to voice her opposition.  This is a success that the party listened, said Collins, a Republican who did not support Trump. To me, thats amazing. They represented the average normal guy, the small guy.

We learned a lot about the vote-getting process, Trump told reporters at the White House, although he sought to shift the blame to the Democrats even though his party controls the White House, the House and the Senate. With Fridays legislative collapse, Democratic former President Barack Obamas signature domestic policy achievement, the 2010 Affordable Care Act - known as Obamacare - remains in place despite seven years of Republican promises to dismantle it. The healthcare failure called into question not only Trumps ability to get other key parts of his agenda, including tax cuts and a boost in infrastructure spending, through Congress, but the Republican Partys capacity to govern effectively. Neither Trump nor Ryan indicated any plans to try to tackle healthcare legislation again anytime soon. Trump said he would turn his attention to getting big tax cuts through Congress, another tricky proposition. Republican supporters said the legislation would achieve their goal of rolling back the governments nanny state role in healthcare. The White House made undoing Obamacare its top priority when Trump took office two months ago. But the White House and House leaders were unable to come up with a plan that satisfied the clashing interests of moderates and conservatives, despite Trumps vaunted image as a deal maker. Amid a chaotic scramble for votes, Ryan, who championed the bill, met with Trump at the White House. Ryan said he recommended that it be withdrawn from the House floor because he did not have the votes to pass it, and Trump agreed. We were just probably anywhere from 10 to 15 votes short, Trump said. With no Democrat support we couldnt quite get there.  Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said the bill failed because of two traits that have plagued the Trump presidency since he took office: incompetence and broken promises. Democrats said the bill would take away medical insurance from millions of Americans and leave the more-than-$3 trillion U.S. healthcare system in disarray. And some moderate Republicans opposed the bill because of worries that millions of America would be hurt. There were things in this bill that I didnt particularly like, Trump added, without specifying what those were, but expressed confidence in Ryans leadership. Perhaps the best thing that could happen is exactly what happened today, because well end up with a truly great healthcare bill in the future after this mess known as Obamacare explodes, said Trump, who had posted multiple tweets throughout March proclaiming that Obamacare is imploding and repeatedly saying that Republicans were coming together to pass the bill. Fridays events cast doubt on whether Ryan can get major legislation approved by fractious Republican lawmakers. I will not sugarcoat this. This is a disappointing day for us. Doing big things is hard, Ryan said at a news conference, adding that his fellow Republicans are experiencing what he called growing pains transitioning from an opposition party to a governing party. Obamacares the law of the land, Ryan added. Were going to be living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future. Members of the Freedom Caucus, the Houses most conservative members, were instrumental in the bills failure, opposing it among other reasons because they considered parts too similar to Obamacare. Trump said he was disappointed and a little surprised with the Freedom Caucus opposition. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said under the Republican legislation 14 million people would lose medical coverage by next year and more than 24 million would be uninsured in 2026. News that the bill had been pulled before a final vote was greeted initially with a small sigh of relief by U.S. equity investors, who earlier in the week had been fretful that an outright defeat would damage Trumps other priorities, such as tax cuts and infrastructure spending.     Benchmark U.S. stock market indexes ended the session mixed after rallying back from session lows following the news. The S&P 500 Index ended fractionally lower, the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped about 0.3 percent and the Nasdaq Composite Index rose about 0.2 percent.  Shares of hospital operators finished sharply higher, with the S&P healthcare facilities index up 2.7 percent, while the S&P 500 healthcare sector edged down 0.03 percent. The dollar strengthened modestly on the news, and U.S. Treasury bond yields edged up from session lows. Trump said he would be totally open to working with Democrats on healthcare when they all become civilized. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said working to lower prescription drug prices was one area of possible cooperation with Republicans. Republican Representative Dana Rohrabacher said before the bill was pulled that voting it down would be neutering Trump while empowering his opponents. You dont cut the balls off a bull and then expect that he can go out and get the job done, Rohrabacher told Reuters. This will emasculate Trump and we cant do that. ... If we bring this down now, Trump will have lost all of his leverage to pass whatever bill it is, whether its the tax bill or whatever reforms that he wants. Representative Joe Barton of Texas, when asked why his fellow Republicans were so united over the past seven years to dump Obamacare only to fall apart when they actually do something about it, said, Sometimes youre playing fantasy football and sometimes youre in the real game. Obamacare boosted the number of Americans with health insurance through mandates on individuals and employers, and income-based subsidies. About 20 million Americans gained insurance coverage through the law. The House plan would have rescinded a range of taxes created by Obamacare, ended a penalty on people who refuse to obtain health insurance, and ended Obamacares income-based subsidies to help people buy insurance while creating less-generous age-based tax credits It also would have ended Obamacares expansion of the Medicaid state-federal insurance program for the poor, cut future federal Medicaid funding and let states impose work requirements on some Medicaid recipients.  House leaders agreed to a series of last-minute changes to try to win over disgruntled conservatives, including ending the Obamacare requirement that insurers cover certain essential benefits such as maternity care, mental health services and prescription drug coverage.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON/CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trumps administration approved TransCanada Corps (TRP.TO) Keystone XL pipeline on Friday, cheering the oil industry and angering environmentalists even as further hurdles for the controversial project loom. The approval reverses a decision by former President Barack Obama to reject the project, but the company still needs to win financing, acquire local permits, and fend off likely legal challenges for the pipeline to be built. TransCanada will finally be allowed to complete this long-overdue project with efficiency and with speed, Trump said in the Oval Office before turning to ask TransCanada Chief Executive Officer Russell Girling when construction would start. Weve got some work to do in Nebraska to get our permits there, Girling replied. Nebraska? Trump said. Ill call Nebraska. Trump announced the presidential permit for Keystone XL at the White House with Girling and Sean McGarvey, president of North Americas Building Trades Unions, standing nearby. He said the project would lower consumer fuel prices, create jobs and reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil. The pipeline linking Canadian oil sands to U.S. refiners had been blocked by Obama, who said it would do nothing to reduce fuel prices for U.S. motorists and would contribute to emissions linked to global warming. Trump, however, campaigned on a promise to approve it, and he signed an executive order soon after taking office in January to advance the project. TransCanadas U.S.-listed shares (TRP.N) dipped 5 cents to close at $46.21 on Friday.  Trump has claimed the project would create 28,000 jobs in the United States. But a 2014 State Department study predicted just 3,900 construction jobs and 35 permanent jobs.  The president said he would get in touch with Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts later in the day. TransCanada applied to the Nebraska Public Service Commission in February for approval of the pipelines route through the state. The company said it expects that process to conclude this year. Ricketts said in a statement posted on Twitter that the project would help his state.  I have full confidence that the Public Service Commission will conduct a thorough and fair review of the application, he said. The White House has said the pipeline is exempt from a Trump executive order requiring new pipelines to be made from U.S. steel, because much of the pipe for the project has already been built and stockpiled. As we move forward, well continue to look to buy the rest of the materials we need from ... American manufacturers. Well put American workers to work, Girling told reporters.   Environmental groups vowed to fight it.  Greenpeace said it would pressure banks to withhold financing for the multibillion-dollar project, and others said they would fight the pipeline in court. Well use every tool in the kit, said Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council.     Since Obama had nixed the pipeline based on an environmental assessment commissioned by the State Departmentin early 2014, opponents will likely argue in court that Trump cannot reverse the decision without conducting a new assessment. Fred Jauss, partner at the international law firm Dorsey & Whitney and a former attorney with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said local permitting would also be a challenge. The Presidential Permit is only one part of a web of federal, state, and local permits that must be obtained prior to starting construction, he said. Other federal agencies, such as the Army Corps of Engineers, state regulatory commissions, and even local planning boards may have requirements that need to be fulfilled by Keystone prior to construction. In addition, TransCanada may still need to reach deals with hundreds of potentially affected landowners on the pipelines route. There is a lot of work ahead for TransCanada. The Keystone XL pipeline would bring more than 800,000 barrels per day of heavy crude from Canadas oil sands in Alberta into Nebraska, linking to an existing pipeline network feeding U.S. refineries and ports along the Gulf of Mexico.  The project could be a boon for Canada, which has struggled to bring its vast oil reserves to market. Our government has always been supportive of the Keystone XL pipeline and we are pleased with the U.S. decision, said a spokesman for Canadas minister of natural resources. The importance of a common, continental energy market cannot be overstated. The president of the American Petroleum Institute, Jack Gerard, said the approval was welcome news and would bolster U.S. energy security. Expedited approval of projects is part of Trumps approach to a 10-year, $1 trillion infrastructure package he promised on the campaign trail. The White House is looking for ways to speed up approvals and permits for other infrastructure projects, which can sometimes take years to go through a regulatory maze. TransCanada tried for more than five years to build the 1,179-mile (1,897-km) pipeline, until Obama rejected it in 2015. The company resubmitted its application for the project in January, after Trump signed the executive order smoothing its path. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"
"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday that Obamacare was exploding after Republican lawmakers shelved legislation that would have dismantled the healthcare law.  Thats not going to happen this month. Probably not even this year. The more than 12 million people who bought 2017 health insurance plans on HealthCare.gov and other websites the law created are not in danger of losing their healthcare or having their premiums go up right now, experts say. But 2018 is another story. Republicans could choose to pass a budget that defunds Obamacares cost-sharing subsidies, which help low-income people cover out-of-pocket and other medical costs. But that would be highly unpopular among consumers who would likely blame the president and Congress for skyrocketing healthcare costs, experts said.  That is one of the ways that is available to monkey wrench the Affordable Care Act, said Morgan Tilleman, an associate with the law firm Foley & Lardner, who represents insurers. Obamacare, former Democratic President Barack Obamas signature legislation created by the Affordable Care Act of 2010, has had a tough beginning. The mix of sick and healthy customers has been worse than expected, and premium rates on the individual insurance market went up 25 percent this year. Other parts of the law, like the expansion of Medicaid to enhance coverage for the poor, and changes to allow young people to stay on their parents health plans, have been popular. And the defeat of the bill is a win for the hospitals that have benefited from those increased Medicaid dollars. But many counties across the country have only one insurer, after Humana Inc, Aetna Inc and UnitedHealth Group Inc pulled out after reporting hundreds of millions of dollars of losses.      The insurers who are left, Anthem Inc and other BlueCross BlueShield insurers across the country, as well as smaller players like Centene Corp and Molina Healthcare Inc need to decide in the next few months where to sell insurance and how much to charge.  And that is where the markets slow burn takes off, with insurers leaving and premiums rising. Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds who focuses on health care, said that for consumers, 2018 looks uncertain, with a death spiral of decreasing competition and increasing premium rates ramping up.  After the failed Republican effort to push through the bill, insurers are looking at changes to help 2018, Americas Health Insurance Plans spokeswoman Kristine Grow said. That includes the markets cost-sharing subsidies as well as other government payments for sicker-than-usual customers and finalizing a rule the Trump administration proposed that addresses issues insurers say drives up costs.  The Trump administration could do some of that itself if it wants to, such as using its regulatory authority to adjust the formula for how it compensates insurers for the sickest people, Elizabeth Carpenter at healthcare consultancy and research firm Avalere Health said.  But it is unknown if the administration will try to work within the laws existing framework or take actions to undermine it and blame the Democrats for its failure. If they fail to act and they dont act in an appropriate way, that will further destabilize the marketplace, Dr. Mario Molina, CEO of Molina Healthcare, said. Molinas enrollment ballooned to 1 million exchange enrollees this year and the company is weighing if it will submit plans for next year. The administration could also decide to not enforce the individual mandate, which requires that everyone purchase health insurance or pay a fine. It already took steps to erode that provision last month, when it backed off implementing tougher oversight that was due to go into effect for 2016 taxes. Experts said the individual mandate still cost less than purchasing insurance, but as it increases each year more young and healthy people would have incentive to join the healthcare market, helping to offset the cost of sicker patients.  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that 14 million more people would be uninsured under the Republican bill next year, with most of the increase coming from the repeal of the penalty associated with the individual mandate. Its unclear what the Republicans will do. Trump said this bill had been shelved but that Republicans would end up with a great healthcare bill in the future, but for now that they are moving onto tax reform.  Until they do that, they will have to work within the 2010 Affordable Care Act. It can also undercut the healthcare law through regulatory authority at the Department of Health and Human Services.     ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

DANIEL MORGAN, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, SYNOVUS TRUST COMPANY, ATLANTA, GEORGIA: Theres a bit of a relief rally. There were worries going into it... but its a mixed bag. It does now open the door for maybe they table the whole thing and just move on, and I would think the next thing on the docket would have to be tax reform. The market, to me, is more interested in tax reform than it is in changing Obamacare. In a way, for me, sitting on $600 million worth of investments, I think its great. Lets move and get into tax reform, and then get into the infrastructure bill. PETER JANKOVSKIS, CO-CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, OAKBROOK INVESTMENTS LLC, LISLE, ILLINOIS: The market is relieved its not going to go down to a defeat, and its hopeful theyll come to some sort of agreement over the weekend. The market is hoping for an agreement as a stepping stone to additional agreements. News report suggested that the likely outcome was they were going to lose. I would think the expectations are that theyre pulling it so they can work on it. The last few days, market has sort of traded on the back foot on anticipation of the vote that would happen at some point this week. Generally, risk sentiment has been undermined off of that, especially with this steady drip of news that indicated lacking support for the bill. And now, I think, it sort of lifted that uncertainty, at least temporarily, for the rest of the day. Maybe just lifting the uncertainty premium has markets breathing a sigh of relief for now. PARESH UPADHYAYA, DIRECTOR OF CURRENCY STRATEGY, PIONEER INVESTMENTS, BOSTON: The initial market interpretation is a positive sign. It seems like it is taking that Trump wants to instead of sinking it, he wants to give it another shot. It seems like they think he is working to get something on his agenda to be passed by Congress. Or perhaps its a sign that if healthcare reform is shelved, Trump will focus on tax reform. Its more a knee jerk reaction.  There are still a lot of hard questions regardless to tax reform. He cant force people to change their vote on social media. Good old fashion politicking is needed to build consensus.  If this stronger dollar has legs, it depends on the next step. If there is a pivot to taxes from healthcare, the market has to see the plan. RAHUL SHAH, CHIEF EXECUTIVE, IDEAL ASSET MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK: From an investor viewpoint, it shows that Trump will not be able to easily pass his agenda. That being said, healthcare is more difficult to pass than tax cuts and the infrastructure bill that hes proposing. In one sense thats a negative, but on the other hand it also might give some relief to investors who are concerned about some of Trumps more controversial proposals like increased tariffs and a border adjustment tax.  You could see this as a glass half empty or a glass half-full, gridlock is not something thats unheard of on Wall Street, so I think stocks should be OK going forward. I think the most important thing is that this changes the perception of the relationship between Trump and Congress. For the last few months the assumption has been that Congress would do whatever the Trump plan called for, and that apparently is not going to be the case. PETER KENNY, SENIOR MARKET STRATEGIST, GLOBAL MARKETS ADVISORY GROUP, NEW YORK: I dont think its going to have a huge impact on equities, although it may have more of an impact on biotech and healthcare.  This is now an indication that the presidents agenda is probably going to be more ambitious than Congress can manage. It is probably going to mean that equity markets are going to have to factor in a degree of dysfunction that investors were hoping they wouldnt have to. Which means it will likely have a muted impact on equity performance moving forward.  There is very little on the horizon as of right now, as a result of this thing being pulled, that is going to fuel a significant move higher in prices. This is largely going to homogenize any sort of volatility moving forward and is probably going to be a cap on any near-term performance in terms of the upside. The fact this bill, which the President has said flat-out he will make it work for all Americans in general, cant pass is an indication this agenda is going to be more ambitious than this Congress can work with. This doesnt even include the Democrats.It is not just divided between Democrats and Republicans, it is divided between progressives, Democrats, Republicans and Libertarians. It is an indication that investors should not expect the kind of velocity in terms of agenda accomplishments they were expecting when he was elected. MARGARET PATEL, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, WELLS FARGO ASSET MANAGEMENT, BOSTON: It looked like the market was worried that the Trump agenda would get completely bogged down in the healthcare issue, and now that theyve taken the healthcare issue off the table, I think the market is more optimistic that they can do other things that are more doable that are not so complicated, such as regulatory reform and lowering taxes. It does seem like a positive move to shelve an issue thats so complex and very expensive no matter what the plan, move on to something that is a little bit easier, which would be lowering taxes.

Speaker Joe Straus, who sets the Republican-dominated Houses legislative agenda, stopped short of saying the measure was doomed. He made his remarks at a University of Texas forum in Austin.  I dont feel a great deal of fervor to promote that bill in the House, Straus said.  Analysts expect Straus to send Senate Bill 6 (SB 6) to a committee led by one of his political supporters, who will keep it tucked away. The measure would then die when the current session ends in late May. Straus is signaling very clearly that SB 6 is dead, said Mark Jones, a professor of political science at Rice University in Houston.  Straus reiterated his opposition to the legislation, which was approved by the Republican-controlled state Senate this month on a mostly party-line vote. The bill would require people to use restrooms in public schools and government-run buildings that correspond with the gender on their birth certificate rather than the gender with which they identify. The speaker called it manufactured and unnecessary. The bill is one of several similar measures before various state legislatures this year on the issue.  A similar law enacted a year ago in North Carolina prompted  the relocation of sporting events and economic boycotts that were estimated to have cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars. The Texas Association of Business, the states largest employers group, has said such a law there would cost the state billions of dollars in lost revenue a year. The bills main backer, Republican Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, has said it would keep sexual predators out of bathrooms and changing rooms, and he has labeled as fiction reports that there would be economic effects on the state.

Nevertheless, Ryans job did not seem to be under immediate threat, at least not in the House of Representatives he leads.   Ryans long-time news media nemesis, the website Breitbart, said Republicans were openly discussing finding a replacement for him after he pulled a bill to roll back Obamacare from the House floor just minutes before an intensely awaited final vote. The Breitbart article did not quote anyone by name. In the House, just after the bill was pulled, several lawmakers brushed aside suggestions that the failure spelled trouble for Ryan, the 2012 Republican vice presidential candidate, who many have speculated has presidential ambitions. Ryan, 47, has been speaker since October 2015. Under the law, he is next in line to the presidency after Vice President Mike Pence. Republican Representative Justin Amash, a harsh critic of the ill-fated healthcare bill, told reporters, We can do better with the legislative process. But, he added, Nobody is talking about trying to oust Ryan as speaker. Amash had disparagingly dubbed the Republican healthcare bill Obamacare 2.0, after Democratic former President Barack Obamas signature domestic policy achievement, the 2010 Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. Amash is a member of the hard-line conservative Freedom Caucus, which in 2015 ousted Ryans predecessor as speaker, John Boehner, from the post. The caucus played a key role in the demise of the healthcare bill. Ryan chose to make healthcare reform the first target on a list of legislative goals for the new Republican-majority Congress. He admitted on Friday that he was disappointed by the outcome.  Republicans faced resistance to the healthcare bill from both conservatives and moderates, making the process of winning passage difficult for the leadership.

Republican Representative Barry Loudermilk, who backed the healthcare bill, said he didnt think the loss weakened the speakers hand. One Republican lawmaker who has been considered potential speaker material, Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, effusively praised Ryan, saying he had shown phenomenal leadership.

The Republican bill, the American Health Care Act (AHCA), which is up for a vote in the House of Representatives later on Friday, is expected to cut the federal deficit while greatly increasing the number of Americans without health insurance.  Democratic leaders are unified against the bill while some conservative Republicans have criticized it for not doing enough to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, the measure familiarly known as Obamacare which was passed in 2010 and was the signature domestic achievement of former President Barack Obama.  According to the March 13-23 poll, 49 percent of American adults said the AHCA was not an improvement over Obamacare, which helped about 20 million people get insurance coverage. Another 33 percent said the Republican bill was an improvement over Obamacare, and the remaining 18 percent did not know.  The responses were largely split along party lines. Some 19 percent of Democrats and 53 percent of Republicans said the AHCA was better than Obamacare, while 73 percent of Democrats and 22 percent of Republicans said it was not an improvement.  The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English in all 50 states. It first asked if people were familiar with the Republican reform. Those who said they were familiar were then asked whether they thought it was an improvement.  Altogether, some 1,741 people responded to both questions.

For President Donald Trump, the collapse on Friday of his first legislative priority, a healthcare reform bill, was an embarrassing loss of face after he and his administration insisted up until the time of the vote by the U.S. House of Representatives that there was enough Republican support. It brings into question the neophyte presidents ability to move big-ticket legislation through Congress. And for a celebrity businessman who brands himself a deal-maker and fixer, it casts doubt over his ability to deliver on his bold drain-the-swamp promises to shake up Washington. The White House wants to advance, among other things, tax reform and a massive infrastructure package this year, but now it must address whether a change of approach is needed and whether congressional allies such as House Speaker Paul Ryan can be counted on to deliver. This is the most consequential day of Trumps presidency and its not just a failure, its a stunning failure, Charlie Sykes, an influential Wisconsin Republican political commentator and frequent Trump critic, said on Twitter.  Trump appeared to chalk up the loss in part to his own inexperience after House leaders pulled their bill to repeal and replace Obamacare following defections by both moderate and far-right Republican members who were unmoved by Trumps ultimatum to vote for the plan or live with the current system. We learned a lot about loyalty. We learned a lot about the vote-getting process, Trump said after the bill was withdrawn, adding that he would move forward with other priorities. It was yet another setback for an administration barely two months in office that has already seen its national security adviser resign, had its immigration restrictions struck down in courts, and faces a barrage of questions about the Trump campaigns ties to Russia. Trumps hallmark salesmanship seemed to abandon him this week. Although he furiously courted the hard-line conservatives opposed to the reform bill, they largely refused to yield, and in the process he alienated moderates who initially supported the bill. The president then switched tactics and gave up trying to bring the conservative opponents into the fold, instead delivering an ultimatum that all Republicans needed to back the bill. That did not work either.  Trump also failed to persuade the American public that the bill was an improvement over the one it would have repealed and replaced: the Affordable Care Act - the signature domestic achievement of former Democratic President Barack Obama. Polls showed the replacement bill to be deeply unpopular, and conservative Republicans complained that their offices were being deluged by calls from constituents opposing it.  This demonstrates that campaigning and legislating are two different things, said Jim Manley, once a top aide to former Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.  Representative Joe Barton of Texas blamed the failure on Republicans who control the White House, Senate and the House still learning how to govern after eight years of Obama.  Sometimes youre playing fantasy football and sometimes youre in the real game, Barton told Reuters. Representative Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida called it a big blow for the Republican agenda. Trumps efforts to engage the bills opponents at times seemed to muddy the process further, as he largely cut Ryan out of negotiations. (Ryan didnt seem to mind, calling Trump a great closer.)  But even as Trump offered concessions, conservatives did not budge and moderates were angered. Stuart Diamond, a professor who teaches negotiation at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, said Trumps strong-arm tactics backfired.  Threats dont work in general, he said. They cause damage to relationships. They definitely dont work in a situation with a lot of different stakeholders, where the power is distributed. After the bill was revised along Trumps specifications, the Congressional Budget Office, which analyzes the financial impact of proposed legislation, determined that the bill would deprive 24 million Americans of health insurance over the next decade and slice about $150 billion off the budget deficit.  The CBO said the bill would not affect the number of uninsured but it would reduce the budget deficit significantly less than the original bill, troubling fiscal hawks. Even as Trump and the White House pushed harder, opposition to the bill among the rank and file rose. Representative Bill Huizenga, a Michigan Republican who is also a small-business owner, said Trump was still getting used to governing. There are parallels between government and business, but they are not exactly the same. The lesson from the debacle, said John Feehery, a Republican strategist who was an aide to former House Speaker Dennis Hastert, is that the White House needs to take a firmer hand in crafting legislative strategy. On healthcare, Trump largely deferred to Ryans office, which drafted the bill in secret, sowing mistrust among conservatives.  Congress now faces arguably an even tougher legislative reform: overhauling the tax code, which has not been done since 1986 and involves navigating a snake pit of competing special interests. Like Trumps healthcare proposal, it could struggle against public opinion, with Democrats likely to cast it as a Republican giveaway to the rich. There was also a feeling among some Republicans that they had escaped a looming disaster. Even if the bill had passed the House, it faced a radical overhaul in the Senate, meaning both chambers would have been tied up battling over the bill for weeks, perhaps months. And if it became law and millions of voters lost health insurance, some Republicans feared they could suffer at the polls.  Instead, those Republicans have to hope voters will not punish them for failing to deliver on a promise they had been making since Obamacare was passed in 2010, and that they will  still believe this president when he says he can strike a deal. This is a promise the GOP made to voters. They need to get it right, said Rachel Bovard, a policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, as she urged Republicans to start over. It is unclear when that could happen. This bill is dead, said Representative Greg Walden of Oregon, a member of the House leadership team. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""NEW YORK (Reuters) - Planned Parenthood, the national health organization that would have lost federal funding under sweeping healthcare overhaul legislation, views the withdrawal of the bill on Friday as a temporary reprieve, not the end of a threat to its existence. Officials of the organization - long a target of those who oppose its abortion services - anticipate further attempts by Republicans to curb its participation in federally funded public health programs, a major source of its funding. In a major setback for Republican President Donald Trump, U.S. House of Representatives leaders pulled the healthcare bill after a rebellion by Republican moderates and the partys most conservative lawmakers left them short of votes. Democrats were unified against it.  Planned Parenthood leaders will meet in Washington next week to plan their strategy for coming rounds in what they see as a protracted fight. Its one good nights sleep, and then we have to see what they are going to cook up, Chris Charbonneau, chief executive of Planned Parenthood of the Great Northwest and the Hawaiian Islands, said in a phone interview. Theyre trying to find some vehicle that they could hook some Planned Parenthood defund(ing) to. Many Republicans oppose the organization, some on religious grounds, because its healthcare services include abortions, although it receives no federal funding or reimbursement for abortions, as stipulated by federal law.  The federal funding it receives is primarily through reimbursement via Medicaid and the Title X Family Planning grant program for its care for low-income patients. Abortion opponents said Republican leaders had promised for years to end federal reimbursement for Planned Parenthood, and that voters would continue to hold them to this. Before winning the presidential election in November, Trump had also promised to defund Planned Parenthood, and fought to get the healthcare bill passed. Im confident the Republicans in Congress and the president will move ahead and defund Planned Parenthood, said Joe Pojman, executive director of the anti-abortion Texas Alliance for Life. The issue is so dear to the electorate who put the Republicans and president in office, he said after the bill was pulled. On the other side of the issue, Georges Benjamin, the American Public Health Associations executive director, welcomed the withdrawal of the legislation, and said the renewed public attention on Planned Parenthood may make future efforts to limit its funding more difficult. I think in many ways its going to be harder for them to go after Planned Parenthood, not that they wont, he said in a telephone interview.  I hope people recognize that Planned Parenthood did more than abortions, that they recognize it has a broader portfolio, he said, referring to services such as cancer screenings provided by the organization. The proposed American Health Care Act (AHCA) would have repealed many parts of the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, which Democratic President Barack Obama signed into law in 2010.  Charbonneau and other Planned Parenthood officials pointed to a widespread outpouring of public opposition to AHCA as one of the reasons that its moderate Republican backers could not reach a compromise with members of the conservative Freedom Caucus, who demanded a complete evisceration of Obamacare.    The irony is that the Freedom Caucus, which is very pro-life and against Planned Parenthood, allows P.P. to continue if they stop this plan! Trump wrote in a message on Twitter on Friday morning.Public opinion polls found the AHCA bill was unpopular among Americans, including Republican voters, and that there was broad public support for funding some of Planned Parenthoods work. In a Reuters-Ipsos poll conducted last month, almost half of 5,459 American adults surveyed said Planned Parenthood should receive federal funding; about a third said they should not. Even so, about 70 percent of those people said Planned Parenthood should get the money when they were asked about specific services such as free cancer screenings, contraception and prenatal care.Women were significantly more likely than men to think the organization deserved funding. The Planned Parenthood Federation of America had described the Republicans proposed law as containing a long list of anti-womens health provisions in a statement earlier this week. The federations president, Cecile Richards, cheered its withdrawal on Friday.  The organization said that 2.5 million men, women and children rely on Planned Parenthood for cancer screenings, medical testing, contraception, abortions and other healthcare services each year at around 700 health centers around the country.  The warnings were echoed by two dozen national public health organizations, including the American Public Health Association, the American Nurses Association and the American College of Nurse-Midwives, in a letter to U.S. lawmakers in February. They argued that in some parts of the country, particularly rural areas, Planned Parenthood was the only nearby provider of health services. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - After failing to repeal Obamacare, Republicans in the U.S. Congress quickly pivoted on Friday to President Donald Trumps next priority: overhauling the federal tax code, but their plan has already split the business community. Division among Republicans was the chief cause of the embarrassing setback on Obamacare, and similar fault lines have been evident for months in the Republicans tax plan, mainly over an untested proposal to use the tax code to boost exports. House of Representatives tax committee Chairman Kevin Brady conceded the demise of a Republican plan to roll back Obamacare could make the path to tax reform harder. This made a big challenge more challenging. But its not insurmountable, he told Fox News after Ryan canceled a vote on an Obamacare rollback bill. But Brady said he and House Speaker Paul Ryan are all-in on tax reform. Brady said House Republicans plan to begin moving on tax reform this spring and to pass legislation before Congresss summer recess in late July. Were going to work with the administration to get this done, he said. Trump has been unclear about his position on the most problematic feature of the House Republicans tax blueprint, a proposal known as the border adjustment tax that would cut taxes on exports and raise them on imports.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Friday that tax reform in many ways is a lot simpler than healthcare reform. Were able to take the tax code and redesign things and I think there is very, very strong support, Mnuchin said at an event hosted by news website Axios. Comprehensive tax reform is a policy goal so complex that it has defied successive Congresses and presidents since 1986 when it was last accomplished under former President Ronald Reagan. The U.S. tax code is riddled with narrow subsidies and loopholes, many of them deeply embedded in the economy and defended by the interests they benefit, such as the mortgage interest deduction and the business interest deductibility. Bradys panel has been working on a plan since mid-2016 that would cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, end taxing foreign profits for U.S.-based multinationals and cut other tax rates for businesses and investors. The plan has divided businesses, prompting import-dependent industries to warn of higher prices for consumer goods from clothing and electronics to gasoline. Brady has been adamant that border adjustment will be part of the House tax reform, saying earlier this week that the provision was a given for final legislation but would include a transition period for import-heavy industries.

Trump says the healthcare legislation he supported had been very, very close to getting enough support in the House of Representatives and that now he probably will move on to tax reform. Wall Streets predilection for a glass-half-full view of Trump is on full display as investors back off fears that a failure to repeal Obamacare would endanger his entire agenda in favor of optimism that he will simply get on with tax cuts and infrastructure spending.

The partisan divide over the House Intelligence Committees probe of Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election deepens when the committees top Democrat suggested its Republican chairman canceled a public hearing after pressure from the White House. A third of Democratic senators have so far announced they will vote against confirming Trumps Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, adding to a chorus of opposition from the left, but leaving questions over whether there will be a concerted effort to block a vote in the Senate.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""CHICAGO (Reuters) - Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner on Friday vetoed a legislative fix favored by Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel for two of the citys struggling pension funds and castigated it as a kick-the-can approach. The financial footing and credit ratings for the nations third-largest city have slipped precipitously as its unfunded pension liabilities grew to $33.8 billion for Chicagos four retirement systems in the most recent accounting. The plan that passed the Illinois Senate unanimously in January and cleared the House overwhelmingly last December would have granted the states blessing to alter the citys pension repayment schedule for its municipal and laborers retirement systems. The systems are projected to run out of money in the coming decade and were depending on legislative sign-off of the citys enactment of a water and sewer usage tax and telephone surcharge designed to help get them 90 percent funded in 40 years. City officials have acknowledged that more money will be needed starting in 2023 when payments will reach actuarially required levels. But Rauner rejected the package, saying it created a payment schedule that eventually would necessitate a tax increase for Chicago. He said it needed to be part of a broader, statewide pension funding strategy to address Illinois $129.8 billion unfunded pension liability. This is another kick-the-can approach to pension funding that landed Chicago in fiscal crisis in the first place, Rauner said in a prepared statement. This bill will create an unsustainable funding schedule that will lead to tax increases without solving the real problem. A spokesman for the Democratic mayor slammed the Republican governors action as an irresponsible and irrational decision. Instead of helping secure the future of our taxpayers and middle-class retirees, the governor chose to hold them hostage  just as he has done to social service providers, schoolchildren and universities across the state, Emanuel spokesman Adam Collins said in a statement, referring to Rauners inability to broker a state budget deal for 21 months. Rauners action left Democrats with no ability to block his veto because the pension bailout passed in the previous session of the state General Assembly, which ended in mid-January, and the governors only options were to approve or reject the measure. But the city is pinning its hopes on an identical piece of legislation that passed the newly seated state Senate in late January and is awaiting action in the House, Collins said.

Turkey has been pressing the United States to drop its military alliance with the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, which it considers part of the Kurdistan Workers Party that has been fighting an insurgency for three decades in Turkey.  But U.S. officials have long viewed Kurdish fighters as key to an approaching assault on Raqqa, Islamic States de facto capital. It would work alongside Arab fighters in the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). Instead, Turkey wants the United States to draw from Syrian Arab rebel groups backed by Ankara for the final assault on Raqqa, a predominantly Arab city, proposals that so far have failed to convince U.S. officials who are not certain that the Turkish-backed Arab force is large and well-trained enough. We first need to work out details with Turkey, one senior official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The decision sets President Donald Trumps wish for quick battlefield victories against the need to maintain the United States longstanding strategic alliance with Turkey, a NATO ally which provides the United States access to a base critical for the air war in Syria. The Raqqa campaign appears to be gathering steam as an overlapping U.S.-backed effort in Iraq is drawing closer to driving Islamic State from the city of Mosul. French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Friday that the battle for Raqqa would likely start in the coming days. The head of the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia told Reuters last week that the assault would begin at the start of April, and that the YPG would be taking part. Some U.S. officials think that timeline is too optimistic, noting that a major battle underway for Tabqa dam, about 25 miles (40 km) west of Raqqa, could take weeks to complete. The Pentagon also has said the United States has not decided on the composition of an American-backed assault force in Raqqa. The United States has about 1,000 troops in Syria at the moment, and the Raqqa campaign could involve hundreds more. Senator John McCain, the Senate Armed Services Committees chairman, suggested to reporters earlier this week that it would be hard to convince Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan of the merits of backing Kurdish fighters, even if they are the most effective weapon against Islamic State. The conundrum is that if you dont use the Kurds, it will take a lot longer while (Islamic State is) sending streams of terrorists out of Raqqa, McCain said. But if you do, you have an enormous challenge as far as relations with Turkey is concerned, he added.  McCain said the relationship with Erdogan was particularly important and cited an April 16 referendum on constitutional changes to extend his powers. Tillersons meeting in Ankara also closely follows a meeting of 68 coalition partners this week in Washington, where they agreed to intensify the fight against Islamic State, including in Syria. At Wednesdays meeting, Tillerson said the United States would create interim zones of stability through ceasefires to help refugees return home in the next phase of the fight against Islamic State and al Qaeda in Syria and Iraq. He did not elaborate, although one U.S. official said there was not yet agreement among all American agencies on where and how such zones would be set up. The U.S. military has long been skeptical of creating safe zones inside Syria or Iraq, partly because any safe zone guaranteed by the United States almost certainly would require some American military protection. Securing the ground alone would require thousands of troops, former U.S. officials and experts say. The top U.S. commander on the ground, Lieutenant General Stephen Townsend, said earlier in March that, We are building safe zones right now for all Iraqis and all Syrians to be safe from (Islamic State).  Increased U.S. or allied air power would be required if Trump chooses to enforce no fly restrictions and ground forces might also be needed to protect civilians in those areas. The State Department did not provide more details of Tillersons trip to Turkey, but said he will visit Brussels on March 31 to participate in a rescheduled meeting of NATO foreign ministers. The NATO meeting had been set for April 5-6, but it was rescheduled after Tillerson decided instead to attend a summit with China. That caused unease among European allies already worried about Trumps commitment to the Western military alliance.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

At a White House event with the second-largest U.S. cable companys Chief Executive Thomas Rutledge and Texas Governor Greg Abbott, Trump praised Charter for planning to close its offshore call centers and move them to the United States. Much of the announcement was not new. Charter said last May that it planned to add 20,000 jobs as part of its merger with Time Warner Cable and acquisition of Bright House Networks. As early as June 2015, Rutledge said Charter would need an additional 20,000 employees after those deals. On a number of occasions, Trump has touted job announcements at the White House that had been previously planned or announced  The company said more than a year ago in February 2016 that it planned to close foreign Time Warner Cable call centers and move the jobs to the United States. On Friday, Trump said, Were embracing a new economic model - the American Model. Were going to massively eliminate job-killing regulations - that has started already, big league - reduce government burdens, and lower taxes that are crushing American businesses and American workers. Youre going to see thousands and thousands and thousands of jobs, of companies, and everything coming back into our country. Charter, which has 24 million residential and business customers in 41 states, said on Friday it had committed to Trump to hiring those workers within four years. It plans to invest $25 billion in broadband infrastructure and technology in the next four years. In May 2016 Rutledge said in a recorded interview there would be some overlap in management positions (after the TWC merger) but said the company would hire about 20,000 people over four years.     Rutledge said the broadband investment was being made in the right regulatory climate and right tax climate ... Were committed to spending that predicated on the kind of regulatory consistency and efficiency that we expect as a country. Charter agreed in May 2016 to make significant broadband  investment under a deal with the Federal Communications Commission that was part of winning approval to acquire the cable networks. At that time Charter agreed to extend high-speed internet access to another two million customers within five years, with one million served by a broadband competitor. Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement on Friday that the commission was working to set rules of the road that encourage companies to build and upgrade broadband networks across the country. He credited the FCCs investment-friendly policies in part for Charters commitments. The agency is considering a petition by the American Cable Association to strike the requirement Charter extend service to areas already served by companies because it could harm smaller competitors. Charter also touted its plans to open a new bilingual call center in McAllen, Texas and said it expects to employ 600 there by the end of 2018. Plans to open a call center in Texas were announced last October.   In December, Trump announced that telecommunications group Sprint Corp and U.S. satellite company OneWeb would bring 8,000 jobs to the United States, and the companies said the positions were part of a previously disclosed pledge by Japans SoftBank Group Corp. In January, Sprint Chief Executive Marcelo Claure said of its decision to shift 5,000 call center jobs to the United States that the company had plans to do this for a while.

To date, 16 of the 48 Democratic senators have publicly backed their leader, Chuck Schumer, who said on Thursday he opposes confirming appeals court judge Neil Gorsuch. Others have yet to announce their intentions.  Gorsuch is headed toward a Senate Judiciary Committee vote, likely on April 3, on his nomination to the high court after a marathon four-day confirmation hearing this week.  After that, it is not yet clear how much of a fight Democrats will put up when the nomination is due for a final vote in the 100-member Senate, where there are 52 Republicans.   The Democratic opposition to Gorsuch could prompt a showdown in the Senate and delay the judges confirmation but ultimately the Republicans are likely to win that fight and avoid another setback in Congress for Trump who suffered a blow on Friday when lawmakers pulled a major healthcare bill. Senate rules enable Democrats to insist on 60 votes to overcome a procedural move called a filibuster to allow a final up-or-down vote on confirming Gorsuch, 49, to the lifetime job on the nation's highest court. (GRAPHIC - Confirming Gorsuch: How it works tmsnrt.rs/2nANgEj)  But the Senates Republican leadership could adopt a rule change allowing a vote that would only require a simple majority of the chamber. If eventually confirmed, Gorsuch would restore a conservative majority on the nine-seat high court. For Democrats, putting up a fight would at least frustrate Trump and placate liberal activists sore about the Republican-led Senates refusal to vote on President Barack Obamas nominee to the same open seat on the court last year.  If eventually confirmed, Gorsuch would restore a conservative majority on the nine-seat high court.  Conservative activists were targeting ten Democrats running for reelection in 2018 in states Trump won in the presidential election as possible yes votes for Gorsuch among Democrats.  Of that number, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin have already announced their opposition to the nomination. The other seven, including Joe Manchin of West Virginia, have yet to announce their plans. Another Democratic senator under pressure from both sides on Gorsuch is Michael Bennet, who represents Gorsuchs home state of Colorado. Bennet has yet to announce his position. Republicans are also hopeful that some Democratic members of the judiciary committee, including Chris Coons of Delaware and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, might be wary of blocking a vote on the nominee. Their spokesmen did not respond to requests seeking comment. Don Stewart, a spokesman for Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said it would be an unprecedented, even nuclear step to require a 60-vote threshold before the Senate can vote on the nominee. There has never, in the history of the Republic, ever been a successful partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee, he added. The last attempt to filibuster a nominee was a Democratic bid to block a vote on Justice Samuel Alito, who was nominated by President George W. Bush in 2005. Democrats failed to gather enough support and the Senate voted 72-25 to proceed to an up-or-down vote. Alito was eventually confirmed by 58-42.  Sarah Binder, a political scientist at George Washington University, said Democrats may be able to gather enough support to block a vote because so few of them are moderates from Republican-leaning states, meaning they may feel they have little to lose. If Trumps popularity drops, that could embolden them further, she added.    ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

As the clock ticked down to a close vote in the House of Representatives set tentatively for Friday afternoon, U.S. stocks were little changed even as it appeared that the Republican leadership had yet to secure the support needed to pass the measure.  That was in stark contrast with earlier in the week when equities suffered their biggest one-day drop since the November election on grounds that the shaky prospects for a successful repeal of the Affordable Care Act - known popularly as Obamacare - was a litmus test for everything championed by Trump. I think investors are of the belief that Trump is just going to pivot to taxes, said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. I think its a pivot from what we saw on Tuesday. Indeed, Trump delivered lawmakers an ultimatum late Thursday, saying the time for negotiation had ended and that he was willing to leave the ACA in place and get on with his other priorities. S&P E-mini futures rallied about 0.25 percent in overnight trading following the statement. If this goes on the back burner, and they start addressing corporate tax rates or infrastructure, that would be a positive for the market because the administration is not going to look at this and say, Hey, this thing is going to take a while. They want to win, said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.  So they will go on to something that they could get through more quickly, which will be beneficial to the market, Hellwig said. U.S. stocks have rallied hard since Trump was elected on Nov. 8, with the benchmark S&P 500 gaining around 10 percent in that span. Most of the gains have come as investors embraced prospects for the pro-growth and pro-business agenda Trump touted during his campaign. But more recently, doubts have arisen over Trumps ability to deliver on the agenda as the effort to repeal Obamacare grew more rancorous. Stocks have drifted sideways for the last several weeks. Even amid the more sanguine mood on Friday as the vote approached, not all investors were ready to embrace the notion that a failure to repeal Obamacare could be so readily overlooked given how far the market has come since the election. If the Republicans cannot settle their own conservative-moderate division on healthcare then that divide will be exacerbated for any other issue they attempt, said Joseph Trevisani, chief market strategist at Worldwide Markets in Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey. Still, with less than about 90 minutes to go to the House vote, there was little evidence of the angst evident earlier in the week when investors saw the vote as a clear pass-fail test for Trumps agenda.\t I think what Trump did by saying that they are going to take a vote and if it doesnt go they will move on to the next item is kind of a positive thing, because I think the more important things are fiscal stimulus and tax reform, Tom Tucci, head of Treasuries trading at CIBC in New York said. I know a lot of people are saying this will foreshadow the battle there, but I think theres a lot more support on that end.     ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Panel chairman Devin Nunes said he had to cancel next Tuesdays hearing with officials from former Democratic President Barack Obamas administration in order to have a classified briefing with the directors of the National Security Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation. The committee seeks additional information ... that can only be addressed in closed session, Representative Nunes told reporters. FBI Director James Comey and NSA head Admiral Mike Rogers testified at a public hearing on Monday at which Comey confirmed for the first time that the FBI is investigating possible ties between Republican President Donald Trumps campaign as Moscow sought to influence the 2016 election. Representative Adam Schiff, the intelligence committees top Democrat, said the cancellation was not in the public interest. I think that there must have been a very strong pushback from the White House about the nature of Mondays hearing. Its hard for me to come to any other conclusion about why an agreed upon hearing would be suddenly canceled, Schiff told a separate news conference.  The scheduled witnesses, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, former Central Intelligence Agency Director John Brennan and former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, were in office when the purported hacking and disinformation by Russia to influence the election took place. Russia has denied allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that it sought to influence the election, and Trump, a Republican, has said the controversy was cooked up by Democrats and fanned by hostile media. Nunes also said on Friday that former Trump campaign manager Paul Manaforts lawyers told the committee that he is volunteering to be interviewed, and that the panel would work with his lawyers to decide whether the interview would be open or closed to the public. The New York Times reported last month Manafort was one of several Trump advisers whose contacts with Russian operatives were monitored by U.S. law enforcement and intelligence. Manafort, who was Trumps campaign chairman for several months last year, dismissed the report, the newspaper said. Many Democrats, including Schiff, have questioned whether a committee led by Nunes, a close Trump ally who served on the presidents transition team, can still be relied on to conduct a credible investigation. They have called for a special prosecutor or select committee. Nunes apologized to the intelligence panel on Thursday for announcing to the public and briefing Trump that U.S. intelligence may have swept up communications by Trump associates before telling the committee. Schiff said Democrats had no intention of giving up on the investigation. From my point of view, that would be irresponsible of us. So, I think were going to do our best to investigate this regardless of the obstacles were encountering, Schiff said. Trump, who in early March tweeted without giving evidence that Obama had wiretapped his campaign while the businessman competed against Democrat Hillary Clinton, said he was somewhat vindicated by Nunes statement about the surveillance.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge in Virginia ruled on Friday that President Donald Trumps travel ban was justified, increasing the likelihood the measure will go before the Supreme Court as the decision took an opposing view to courts in Maryland and Hawaii that have halted the order. U.S. District Court Judge Anthony Trenga rejected arguments by Muslim plaintiffs who claimed Trumps March 6 executive order temporarily banning the entry of all refugees and travelers from six Muslim-majority countries was discriminatory.  The decision went against two previous court rulings that put an emergency halt to the order before it was set to take effect on March 16. The order remains halted. Trump has said he plans to appeal those unfavorable rulings to the U.S. Supreme Court if needed, and differing opinions by lower courts give more grounds for the highest court to take up the case.    Trenga, an appointee of Republican President George W. Bush, said the complaint backed by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a Muslim civil rights group, found that more than 20 individuals who brought the suit had been able to show they were harmed by the travel ban since they might be unable to reunite with their relatives. But he also ruled that Trumps revised order, which replaced  a more sweeping version signed on Jan. 27 and rejected by courts, fell within the presidents authority to make decisions about immigration.  He said that since the order did not mention religion, the court could not look behind it at Trumps statements about a Muslim ban to determine what was in the drafters heart of hearts.  Trump has said the ban is necessary to protect the country from terrorist attacks, but his first order was halted by a federal judge in Seattle and a U.S. appeals court in San Francisco due to concerns it violated the U.S. Constitutions prohibition against religious bias.    Were confident that the presidents fully lawful and necessary action will ultimately be allowed to move forward through the rest of the court systems, said White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer at a briefing. CAIR said it would appeal the decision to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Lena Masri, CAIRs national litigation director, said the 4th Circuit and the Supreme Court are the judicial bodies that will ultimately decide whether the Constitution protects the rights of Muslim Americans. A ruling by U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Hawaii - an appointee of Democratic President Barack Obama - put a stop to the two central sections of the revised ban that blocked travelers from six countries and refugees, while leaving other parts of the order in place.  U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang in Maryland, also an Obama appointee, only put a halt to the section on travelers. The Virginia lawsuit sought to strike down the revised ban in its entirety.  Watson scheduled a hearing for Wednesday to decide whether his temporary order blocking the travel and refugee restrictions should be converted into a more formal preliminary injunction. The Justice Department has said it would oppose that bid.  The government has appealed Chuangs decision in Maryland, also to the 4th circuit, and a hearing in that case is scheduled for May 8.  Other lawsuits against the ban continue to move forward around the country. Also on Friday, the Southern Poverty Law Center and other groups filed a new complaint in U.S. District Court in Washington D.C. on behalf of Muslim community organizations.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top U.S. Senate Democrat on Thursday pledged to pursue a procedural hurdle to try to block the confirmation of Republican President Donald Trumps Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, a move that could provoke a nasty partisan fight and change the way the Senate does business. Republicans hold a 52-48 majority in the 100-member Senate, leaving Democrats with an uphill battle to prevent Gorsuchs confirmation. But Senate rules enable Democrats to insist on 60 votes to overcome a procedural move called a filibuster to allow a final up-or-down vote on confirming Gorsuch, 49, to the lifetime job on the nations highest court. Trump has called on Senate Republicans to change the long-standing rules in order to allow a simple majority vote on confirmation if Democrats mount a filibuster. If eventually confirmed as expected, the federal appeals court judge from Colorado would restore a conservative majority on the nine-seat high court, fulfilling one of Trumps top campaign promises. As the Judiciary Committee completed its fourth and final day of Gorsuchs confirmation hearing, the spotlight turned to whether he gains the support of vulnerable Democratic senators facing re-election in 2018. The support of eight Democrats would short-circuit a filibuster. After careful deliberation, I have concluded that I cannot support Judge Neil Gorsuchs nomination to the Supreme Court, Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor, a day after Gorsuch finished marathon Judiciary Committee testimony.  He will have to earn 60 votes for confirmation. My vote will be no, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. White House spokesman Sean Spicer called Schumers remarks truly disappointing and urged him to abandon the filibuster threat, saying it was the type of partisanship Americans have grown tired of. Spicer said Trump, in light of Schumers comments, would discuss Senate confirmation strategy with Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Conservative activists have said they have identified 10 possible yes votes for Gorsuch among Democrats seeking 2018 re-election in states Trump won in the 2016 presidential  election. Democratic Senator Bob Casey, up for re-election in 2018 in one of those states, Pennsylvania, announced he would vote against Gorsuch and support a filibuster. I dont believe that Judge Gorsuch, his judicial approach, would ensure fairness for workers and families in Pennsylvania, Casey said, expressing serious concerns about Judge Gorsuchs rigid and restrictive judicial philosophy. Casey said he was unaware of any discussions among Democrats about a deal to advance Gorsuchs nomination in return for a guarantee from Republicans that the next Supreme Court nomination would need 60 votes to proceed to a Senate confirmation vote. Democratic Senator Tammy Baldwin, facing re-election in Wisconsin next year, also opposes the nomination, a spokesman said. West Virginias Joe Manchin and Floridas Bill Nelson, Democrats facing voters next year, remain undecided on Gorsuch, their spokesmen told Reuters. Several Judiciary Committee Democrats, including its top Democrat Dianne Feinstein, declined to comment on whether they would support a filibuster. Another vote potentially up for grabs is that of Michael Bennet, a Democrat from Gorsuchs home state of Colorado. He is not up for re-election next year and his state voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016. He introduced Gorsuch to the Judiciary Committee on Monday, but did not commit to supporting confirmation, promising an open mind. Schumer said if Gorsuch cannot attract 60 votes, the answer isnt to change the rules. Its to change the nominee. Schumer said Gorsuch failed to convince him he would be an independent check on a president who has shown almost no restraint from executive overreach or that he would be a neutral justice free from the biases of politics and ideology. Democratic committee members on Tuesday and Wednesday pressed Gorsuch on rulings he participated in that they said showed a inclination to decide in favor of corporate interests and against what they called the little guy. Democrats  expressed frustration about his refusal to answer questions on whether Supreme Court rulings favoring abortion, contraception and gay rights were correctly decided.  The Judiciary Committee was due to vote on the nomination on April 3. McConnell planned a full Senate confirmation vote before senators begin a recess on April 7. On Thursday, the committee heard about six hours of testimony from witnesses supporting and opposing Gorsuch, including representatives of the American Bar Association, the lawyers group that evaluates such nominees and gave Gorsuch its highest rating of well qualified.  Feinstein noted that Merrick Garland, Democratic former President Barack Obamas Supreme Court nominee who the Republican-led Senate last year refused to consider for confirmation, also earned the ABAs highest rating.  Another witness was Jeff Perkins, father of an autistic son who Gorsuch ruled against in 2008 in a special-education dispute using legal reasoning repudiated by the Supreme Court in a related case on Wednesday. Perkins said Gorsuch set a new low standard for educational benefits school districts must offer disabled students. I was devastated, Perkins said of Gorsuchs ruling.

Mnuchin said at an event sponsored by news website Axios that optimism about U.S. growth from policies such as regulatory reform and tax reform is definitely not all baked in to market valuations. U.S. stock prices and the dollar have strengthened significantly since Trump was elected in November, largely in anticipation of corporate profits rising as regulatory burdens ease and tax rates fall. Some of those gains were retraced this week as Republicans in Congress faced stiff opposition from conservatives in passing a bill to replace the Obamacare health law. I think there is some good news thats baked in, but yet, I think there is further room for significant growth in the economy that would be reflected in the markets, Mnuchin said. The consequence would be that the market could go up significantly, Mnuchin added. Treasury secretaries in the past have shied away from publicly discussing market valuations. But Mnuchin said Trumps policies could produce growth of 3 percent to 3.5 percent, which is significantly higher than the fourth quarter reading of 1.9 percent.

President Donald Trump will make an announcement on the pipeline at 10:15 a.m., White House spokesman Sean Spicer said in a post on Twitter. Trump signed an executive order to advance the project, which will link Canadian oil sands to U.S. refiners, soon after taking office in January, saying it would create thousands of jobs. Obama had said the pipeline would do nothing to reduce fuel prices for U.S. motorists and would contribute emissions linked to global warming. A senior administration official told Reuters that Trump will make the announcement alongside TransCanada Chief Executive Russell Girling and Sean McGarvey, president of North Americas Building Trades Unions. Our Government has always been supportive of the Keystone XL pipeline and we are pleased with the U.S. decision, a spokesman for Canadas minister of natural resources said.

Representative Mark Meadows took the call during a meeting of the Freedom Caucus, a conservative faction of the House of Representatives he chairs. His talk with Trump thrust Meadows into the eye of a legislative storm that led to a pivotal vote on the bill being postponed. Then, late on Thursday after Trump demanded action by the House, a final vote was set for Friday. Through it all, Meadows has been a key player in Trumps first major legislative initiative, an effort as chaotic and unpredictable as his campaign for the White House, with its ultimate outcome still in doubt late on Thursday night. After promising for months as a candidate to repeal and replace Obamacare, Trump has still not produced his own plan to do so, choosing instead to support a rollback bill drafted by senior House Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan. Financial markets have watched the drama over the bill nervously, concerned that defeat or delay for it could undermine Trumps ability to carry through on promises to cut taxes and reduce regulation that have lifted U.S. stocks for weeks. In a schism among Republicans who now control Congress and the White House, moderates oppose Ryans bill, saying it goes too far. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated it would result in 24 million fewer Americans having insurance by 2026 than if Obamacare remained in place intact. Meadows and the Freedom Caucus dont like it either, but for very different reasons, making a compromise challenging. They say it doesnt go far enough to repeal the healthcare law put in place in 2010 by former Democratic President Barack Obama.  To deal with this problem, Trump stepped in personally earlier this week to try to win over Meadows and his maverick conservative faction, according to interviews with dozens of lawmakers and congressional aides. But, even after marathon phone calls and meetings at the White House, Trump, who prides himself as a master negotiator, failed to secure the deal. Meadows told reporters on Thursday night he still opposed the bill, but was optimistic that a deal could be reached. I am still a no, he said, taking basically the same position he took on Wednesday afternoon after his phone call with Trump. When he embraced Ryans bill and then decided to intervene to try to save it, Trump opted for a strategy in which he would concentrate on winning over Meadows and the conservatives. Ryan and House leaders would deal with everybody else, Republican Representative Tom Rooney said Thursday. That strategic approach soon had embarrassing consequences. Trumps push began in earnest on Tuesday, when he visited Capitol Hill seeking support for the plan among Republicans. On Wednesday, the House Rules Committee held marathon meetings to finalize the bill that would go to the floor. After his Wednesday phone call with the president, Meadows spent much of Wednesday night negotiating with Trump, said a Republican lawmaker. Mark Meadows has been at the White House more in the last 48 hours than any other times in his life combined, said one conservative lobbyist with knowledge of internal discussions. As Meadows and other Freedom Caucus members such as Representative Jim Jordan negotiated with Trump, more and more right-wing amendments were added to the bill to placate conservatives. The conservative concessions hurt moderates. The vast majority of us in the Republican conference have been left out of these discussions, Representative Bradley Byrne said Thursday. That is a growing problem for our leadership and I think its a growing problem for the chances of this bill. At some point, Ryan himself balked when he learned of the agreements struck between Trump and the conservatives, according to the conservative lobbyist, setting in motion a frantic push to save a vote on the bill that had been set for Thursday. By late afternoon, that rescue effort had collapsed and the vote was scrapped. Trump responded forcefully, dispatching top White House lieutenants to a meeting with lawmakers with a clear message: the president was done negotiating. The message was its done tomorrow or Obamacare stays, said Republican Representative Chris Collins. With that, lawmakers announced that a decisive vote on the bill would be held on Friday afternoon. Earlier, even as the vote that had been set for Thursday was falling apart, Trump was meeting with trucking industry representatives and gleefully climbed into the cab of an 18-wheeler. He said then that everyone would find out in a couple of hours whether Republicans had enough votes to pass the healthcare bill, unaware that the vote had already been delayed.

Democrats were upset that Nunes made the comments to the media and then briefed Trump in the White House without informing them. They questioned whether the intelligence panel could run a credible investigation. A Republican intelligence committee aide said on Thursday that Nunes had apologized to Democrats on the panel. Yes, he apologized to the minority on the committee today for going public and to the (White House) with his announcement yesterday before sharing the information with the minority. He pledged to work with them on this issue and share information with them about it, the aide told Reuters. The panel is conducting one of the main congressional investigations over allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia sought to influence the 2016 presidential election, including claims of ties between Trumps team and Moscow. Russia denies the allegations. Representative Jackie Speier, a Democrat on the panel, said Nunes had apologized in a generic way. Asked if Nunes knew whether Trumps associates were party to these communications or if they could have been communications between two foreigners talking about Trumps associates, Nunes spokesman said: He (Nunes) said hell have to get all the documents he requested from the IC (intelligence community) about this before he knows for sure.  At a hearing of the committee on Monday, FBI director James Comey confirmed the existence of the investigation for the first time. The top Democrat in the House, Nancy Pelosi, on Thursday described Nunes as a willing stooge of Trump who had committed a stunt at the White House with his comments. The necessity of an independent investigation is increasingly being recognized, she said, referring to the probe involving Russia. The White House had on Wednesday seized on Nunes remarks, which had cited anonymous sources, to bolster Trumps unproven assertion on Twitter this month that President Barack Obama wiretapped his election campaign headquarters in Manhattans Trump Tower. Nunes himself has said that the information he had did not support Trumps allegation. He also said that none of the surveillance he knew about was related to Russia. Democrats said Nunes may have revealed classified information with his comments to reporters but the congressmans spokesman said that he did not. Nunes, who was a member of Trumps transition team, seemed contrite on Thursday for the timing and manner of his statement. There was a lot going on yesterday and it was a judgment call on my part.

Another Democrat on the committee, Representative Eric Swalwell, told MSNBC that its members had not yet seen the material referred to by Nunes.

U.S.-based suppliers to Boeing would face a tax on their imports of these parts. Boeing, the top exporter among U.S. manufacturers, would export its jetliners tax free. Boeing and some of its largest suppliers, such as United Technologies Corp, General Electric Co and Honeywell International Inc, which also have substantial exports, favor the Republican tax package.  The plans, laid out in a blueprint last year and which President Donald Trump has spoken about favorably, aim to boost U.S. manufacturing, and include cutting the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and making capital investments immediately deductible. Lawmakers already are at work drafting a tax bill to introduce by early summer, but it could be delayed if health care changes take longer than expected, according to congressional staff. If the proposed 20 percent tax on imported goods had been in effect last year, Norfil Complex Machining, a 40-employee company in Pacific, Washington, likely would have paid more for titanium it imports from Russia. The metal goes into parts Norfil makes for Boeing landing gear that get assembled in Japan.   A lot of Russian titanium goes into planes, said Doren Spinner, Norfils CEO. His purchase contracts have pricing that adjusts if costs go up, so the tax would end up affecting what the plane would cost, he says. Other companies said it would be tough to pass higher costs on, and some might move production to low-cost locations abroad. If the taxes are ridiculous, wed just have to think of something creative, said Paul Doran, a sales manager at Mifa, a subsidiary of Netherlands-based Aalberts Industries NV that makes precision aluminum parts for aerospace, autos and other industries. I think most companies would be in the same boat.  Colin Frost, chief operating officer at parts and tooling supplier Carr Lane Manufacturing Co in St. Louis, Missouri, said he would consider manufacturing overseas if the tax plan were passed. Wed end up splitting up the company and I dont think thats necessarily good for the U.S. economy, he said.  Boeing said it was too soon to judge the plans effects on suppliers and so far it appeared likely to benefit the industry as a whole rather than disrupt the supply chain. These assessments will vary by company, and its premature to speculate or generalize, Boeing spokeswoman Kate Bernard said.  Boeing was among about 90 companies, including many suppliers, that signed a letter this month from the Aerospace Industries Association urging Congress to overhaul the U.S. tax system. Boeing also is part of the American Made Coalition, an industry group that backs Republican tax proposals. Proponents say tax reform also would strengthen the dollar, offsetting the impact of the import tax for suppliers, and  would encourage companies to invest in the United States. The tax overhaul could have cut Boeings taxable income by an estimated $44.5 billion last year, according to tax experts and a Reuters analysis of Boeings 2016 deliveries. Two-thirds of Boeings jetliners were delivered overseas and would be tax exempt. Worth about $89 billion at list prices, they were likely sold at discounts of about 50 percent typical in the industry. Boeing declined to comment on the estimate. Boeing would face import taxes, too. Its 787 Dreamliner, for example, uses major parts from Japans Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd, Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd, Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd and Italys Leonardo SpA.  Boeing also would still pay tax on sales to U.S. airlines and the new tax regime would affect its defense and space businesses, which source and sell globally. Yet suppliers say Boeings vigorous cost-saving has pressed many to outsource production to low-cost countries, which now exposes them to a potential border tax. U.S. aerospace imports have doubled the past decade, with Mexico the fastest-growing source, up 950 percent since 2006. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2n4A8o1) Supply chains would face renewed pressure under the new tax regime, said David Wireman, managing director and co-head of aerospace and defense at consulting firm AlixPartners.  The tax on imports proposed by the new administration would certainly affect the complex decisions on choosing suppliers, and likely would cause manufacturers to change some supplier relationships.

The four days of high-level meetings in Washington marked the latest step by President Donald Trumps aides aimed at opening the way to renewed peace diplomacy between Israel and the Palestinians, despite deep skepticism in the United States and Middle East over the chances for success. Trumps Middle East envoy, Jason Greenblatt, who recently returned from a visit to the region, led the U.S. delegation in what were described as intensive discussions with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus chief of staff Yoav Horowitz and foreign policy adviser Jonathan Schachter. Despite setting a more positive tone toward Israel than his predecessor Barack Obama, Trump urged Netanyahu during a White House visit last month to hold back on settlements for a little bit. The two then agreed that their aides would seek an accommodation on how much Israel can build and where. The United States delegation reiterated President Trumps concerns regarding settlement activity in the context of moving towards a peace agreement, according to a joint statement released by the White House. The Israeli delegation made clear that Israels intent going forward is to adopt a policy regarding settlement activity that takes those concerns into consideration, it said. The talks were serious and constructive, and they are ongoing. Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians have been frozen since 2014 and settlements are one of the most heated issues. Palestinians want the West Bank and East Jerusalem for their own state, along with the Gaza Strip. Most countries consider Israeli settlements, built on land captured in the 1967 Middle East war, to be illegal. Israel disagrees, citing historical and political links to the land, as well as security interests. Trump has expressed some ambivalence about a two-state solution, the mainstay of U.S. policy for the past two decades. But he recently invited Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to visit. Trump has not publicly detailed what kind of agreement he wants with Israel on settlements. But many supporters of a two-state solution have urged a formula that restricts construction to the large settlement blocs that Israel is expected to retain under any final peace accord. In the talks, officials discussed measures for improving the climate for peace, according  to the joint readout. It said a key focus was on steps that could have a meaningful impact on the economic environment in the West Bank and Gaza, and specifically a desire to advance efforts toward self-sustainability in electricity and water.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump warned House Republican lawmakers that he will leave Obamacare in place and move on to tax reform if they do not get behind new healthcare legislation and support it in a vote on Friday. It was not clear late on Thursday evening that Trump and the Republican leaders who crafted the bill had enough support to pass it, meaning they now risk defeat in their first attempt at major legislation and may fail to deliver on a key campaign pledge. We have been promising the American people that we will repeal and replace this broken law because its collapsing and its failing families, and tomorrow were proceeding, House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters after an evening all-hands meeting. He ignored reporters who asked if he had secured the votes to pass the bill. Ryan and leaders in the House of Representatives were forced to postpone a vote on their healthcare bill, formally called the American Health Care Act, earlier on Thursday, dealing Trump an embarrassing setback. The vote had been symbolically planned for the anniversary of former Democratic President Barack Obama signing his namesake healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act, in 2010. It was supposed to have been Trumps first legislative victory. Trump and his fellow Republicans had pledged to replace Obamacare, which they view as too intrusive and too expensive. But, after a week of calling Republican lawmakers and bringing them into the Oval Office for meetings, Trump failed to close the deal with two different factions within his party on time for the planned Thursday vote. Conservatives felt the bill did not go far enough to repeal Obamacare and moderates felt the plan could hurt their constituents. House Republican leaders had signaled they were ready to work through the weekend to figure out a way to reconcile their differences. As the healthcare drama unfolded on Capitol Hill, Trump played it cool, taking a break from negotiations to hang out with some truckers, climbing into the cab of a long-haul transport truck parked on the back driveway of the White House, and blowing the horn a few times. He told reporters the vote would be close but he remained optimistic. I think were doing well. Well find out in about three hours, he said, just as reports began to surface that the vote had been postponed. By evening, Trump sent his top lieutenants to a dramatic meeting on Capitol Hill on Thursday night with an ultimatum: he was done talking. According to Representative Chris Collins of New York, a top Trump ally, White House budget director Mick Mulvaney told House Republicans that Trump wanted a vote. The president has said he wants a vote tomorrow, up or down, Collins said. If for any reason it is down, we are just going to move forward with additional parts of his agenda such as tax reform, Collins told reporters after leaving the meeting. However, the vote has been seen by financial markets as a crucial test of Trumps ability to work with Congress to deliver on his other priorities, such as tax cuts and infrastructure spending. Even if their replacement plan does eventually get approval from the House, the legislation faces a potentially tough fight in the Republican-controlled Senate. The House and Senate had hoped to deliver a new healthcare bill to Trump by April 8, when Congress is scheduled to begin a two-week spring break. The Republicans have a majority in the House but, because of united Democratic opposition, can afford to lose only 21 Republican votes. By Thursday morning, NBC News said that 30 Republicans had planned to vote no or were leaning that way. North Carolina Congressman Mark Meadows, the chairman of the pivotal conservative bloc known as the Freedom Caucus, said he and others were struggling to support the plan. I am desperately trying to get to yes and I think the president knows that. I told him that personally, Meadows said. However, after Thursday nights meeting, he was still a no. Obamacare aimed to boost the number of Americans with health insurance through mandates on individuals and employers, and income-based subsidies. Some 20 million Americans gained insurance coverage through the law. The House replacement plan would rescind the taxes created by Obamacare, repeal a penalty against people who do not buy coverage, slash funding for the Medicaid program for the poor and disabled, and modify tax subsidies that help individuals buy plans. House leaders agreed to four pages of last-minute amendments to the bill, including allowing states to choose which essential benefits are required in healthcare insurance plans, and keeping a 0.9 percent surcharge on Medicare for high-income Americans for six years. It was unclear whether that was enough. Representative Trent Franks, a Freedom Caucus member who had been undeclared on his position on the bill, said he liked the changes. Its going in the right direction, Franks said outside the House.  The amendments will give states more money for maternal health and mental health, said Representative Jeff Fortenberry, a Nebraska moderate who still has not said how he will vote. Uncertainty over the healthcare bill rattled financial markets this week. The delay in the house vote is likely to extend the ups and downs in the stocks of some hospital groups and health insurers. U.S. stock markets rose steadily in recent months on optimism over a pro-business Trump agenda but fell back sharply on Tuesday as investors worried that failure to push through the healthcare bill could postpone other business-friendly Trump priorities. Delay on healthcare equates to delay on tax cuts. That is why the market turned red when the news flow suggested they didnt have a deal, said David Kotok, chairman and chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors, a money management firm. Others said it was too soon to panic. If this thing gets materially delayed or if we get a no vote, were going to see a horrific market reaction. But if they vote in the morning and it passes, well have a hell of a rally, said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

Hundreds of demonstrators turned out in Washington, Chicago and Los Angeles marking the seventh anniversary of enactment of Obamacare, as the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has become widely known. Many talked about a very personal stake in the outcome of the healthcare debate roiling Capitol Hill. I feel sick today, but I came here because Im terrified, said Steve Martin, 27, an unemployed Los Angeles resident who was diagnosed with cancer a year ago. The legislators have the best healthcare in the world, and we deserve the same. The ACA, considered former Democratic President Barack Obamas premiere domestic achievement, has drawn unrelenting scorn from Republicans, with promises to repeal and replace it a centerpiece of Trumps presidential campaign. Thursdays rallies coincided with planned action in the House of Representatives on a Republican-backed bill to begin dismantling Obamacare, but the vote was indefinitely postponed as Republican leaders and the White House scrambled to muster enough votes for passage. Many moderate Republicans as well as Democrats have raised concerns that repeal-and-replace would leave too many Americans without health coverage. Supporters of the bill say it would lower premiums, but critics counter that those savings would in many cases be more than offset by higher co-pays and other out-of-pocket costs. Obamacare backers also worry about the fate of millions who gained insurance under the bills major expansion of Medicaid, the federal-state program providing coverage for the needy, the elderly and the disabled. In the nations capital, several hundred chanting protesters gathered at Freedom Plaza, a few blocks from the White House, carrying signs with slogans such as We Fight Back and Keep America Healthy.  Robinette Barmer, 61, a former seamstress and caterer from Baltimore now on a disability pension, said that without Obamacareshe could not afford the various medications she takes for ailments such as asthma and high blood pressure. Its co-pay this, co-pay that. I cant pay that. Im struggling as it is right now, she said. After the rally, protesters marched a block to the Trump International Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue, where several dozen sprawled on the sidewalk in a die-in symbolizing the effect of rolling back Obamacare. Some 24 protesters were arrested in front of the White House after they refused get off the ground, organizers said.   Protest organizers said smaller gatherings were also held outside the congressional district offices of various Republican lawmakers around the country.

He spent several years in Japan with the Boston Consulting Group management consultancy and later served in the White House of former President George H.W. Bush. If his nomination is approved by the U.S. Congress, he will replace Caroline Kennedy, who held the position from 2013 until January. Japan is a key U.S. security ally in Asia in the face of a rising China and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe became the first world leader to visit Trump after his Nov. 8 election victory. The two then held summit talks in Washington and Florida in February. However, Trump has criticized Japan, along with China and Germany, for having large trade imbalances with the United States and has worried Tokyo by calling on allies to pay more for their defense.  Trump also disappointed Japan by withdrawing the United States from a 12-nation Trans Pacific Partnership trade pact that was the main economic pillar of former President Barack Obamas pivot of U.S. focus to Asia. Trump and Abe agreed last month to launch a bilateral economic dialogue, which is due to start next month, to discuss issues such as macroeconomic policies, trade and infrastructure investment, but friction is likely over autos and agriculture.

The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Mexico and Canada will top the list of trade deals to be reviewed, which affect 20 countries from the Americas to Asia, the officials told Reuters. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the orders were still being developed. They said on Wednesday that the trade deal and procurement review orders were among several executive actions that the Trump administration is preparing on trade. The timing of the orders is unclear, but they could start to be rolled out next week, the officials said. Politico first reported the plan for the two orders, quoting a senior administration official as saying the trade orders would help shift the White House narrative to a place where the president can really shine. The fate of Trumps first major legislative effort in Congress, a measure to replace the 2010 Obamacare health law, remains uncertain amid stiff opposition from conservative Republicans. The House of Representatives had to delay a vote on the bill on Thursday due to insufficient support for the legislation. The orders to review existing trade deals and public procurement policies would be largely symbolic, as the administration has already announced its intention to renegotiate NAFTA, with plans to formally notify Congress of its intention to launch talks in the coming weeks.  Early last month, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said, Were going to re-examine all the current trade deals, figure out if we can improve them. The U.S. bilateral and multilateral trade deals cover these countries: Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Israel, Jordan, Mexico, Morocco, Nicaragua, Oman, Panama, Peru, Singapore and South Korea. Media representatives for the White House and the U.S. Trade Representatives office declined to comment on any forthcoming executive orders.  Senator Orrin Hatch, the Utah Republican who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, said he would welcome orders to review trade deals if that means it accelerated negotiations on changing them. I think weve got to start moving, Hatch told reporters on Wednesday. If he wants to do these unilaterally or bilaterally, hes got to get going on them.  Trumps trade officials, including White House adviser Peter Navarro, and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, have long said that NAFTAs rules-of-origin provisions need to be tightened to exclude more components from outside the trading bloc. NAFTA requires cars and trucks to have only 62.5 percent North American content, providing significant opportunities for Asian manufacturers to provide parts. The procurement review would be in line with Trumps Buy American, Hire American campaign push and could win some allies among Democrats in Congress. These include Senators Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Jeff Merkley of Oregon, who urged the White House in a recent letter to exclude U.S. government contracts from NAFTA and restrict waivers that allow more foreign companies to bid on public procurements. But news of the potential trade orders did not impress  Republican Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts of Kansas. Im more interested in getting our trade representative passed on the Senate floor, Roberts told reporters, referring to Robert Lighthizer, Trumps choice for U.S. trade representative, whose nomination has been stalled in the Senate. Roberts also said he wanted to impress upon the White House the importance of trade deals to boost agricultural exports, including a glut of Kansas wheat, amid what he views as a preoccupation with manufactured exports in the administration.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""DETROIT (Reuters) - When U.S. President Donald Trump announced a review last week of tough Obama-era vehicle emissions and fuel-efficiency standards, he proclaimed that the assault on the American auto industry is over. But rules set by the Environmental Protection Agency may take a backseat to consumers demanding vehicles that guzzle less gas and automakers having to meet tougher standards if they want to export cars overseas, according to auto industry analysts.  In the end, U.S. carmakers may just gain a few more years to meet the more stringent targets that former President Barack Obamas administration negotiated with the companies in 2012, analysts said. If Europe and China continue to toughen their emissions standards, the U.S. might become an outlier, American Axle President Mike Simonte told Reuters on Thursday.  Trumps move was widely seen leading to a rollback or loosening of more stringent targets, which would slash vehicle exhaust emissions while effectively doubling average fuel economy to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025.  Automakers have argued the rules for 2022-2025 are too expensive and could cost American jobs, so the Trump administrations review was seen as a win for them. On a conference call Thursday with investors, Bob Shanks, Ford Motor Cos chief financial officer, said, We are not seeking a rollback in any way. We just want to have a conversation around the levels we want to achieve. Despite what the EPA may want, California and nine other states in the Zero Emission Vehicle program  eight in the northeast, plus Oregon  are expected to move ahead on Friday with the previously established targets. Those states account for nearly 30 percent of U.S. auto sales. The potential divide with the rest of the country could create a two-tiered environment with two sets of regulations, said Mark Wakefield, managing director of AlixPartners automotive practice. This could drive costs higher if automakers have to build two versions of the same vehicle to meet the two different standards. The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group that sued to overturn the Obama-era rules on behalf of several big automakers, wrote the White House on Thursday urging talks to begin quickly with California to ensure that national standards remain in place.  Automakers seek certainty, predictability and rationality  over time  from the regulatory process, the groups CEO Mitch Bainwol wrote.     Kristin Dziczek, director of the Center for Automotive Researchs labor and industry group, said U.S. automakers could find it hard to export cars to markets such as China and Europe with tougher regulatory regimes if the U.S. targets were rescinded. I dont think were going to see a rollback, she said. At most, I think we may see a slowing of the timetable for implementing the tougher standards. AlixPartners Wakefield said if China, the worlds largest market, continues pushing electric vehicles while America backpedals, it could lead to some movement of investment from the U.S. to China, especially as the latter market continues to grow. General Motors Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV referred Reuters to public comments made by the industrys lobbying group, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, a climate change skeptic, said the Obama administration estimated it would cost $200 billion over 13 years to comply with stricter standards, which he believes will lead to higher prices for consumers and jobs leaving the country.     Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said the auto industry expected to miss the 2022-2025 targets regardless of who occupied the White House, but he believes the EPAs recent move may carry relatively little weight. Of all the things that are likely to drive fuel economy, I would rank the EPA a distant third on the list, behind consumer preferences and the direction of technology, he said. United Auto Workers union President Dennis Williams said while around 60 percent of U.S. auto sales are currently trucks and SUVs, consumers value fuel-economy improvements for those vehicles. The automakers shouldnt make the mistake of sliding backward, Williams said. Were here to protect our (union) members, but we understand that in doing so we also have to look at the future.

The bill has seven Republican and seven Democratic  sponsors, and aides said it has a good chance of eventually becoming law. It would set mandatory sanctions for anyone involved with Irans ballistic missile program. And it would apply sanctions to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), putting into law sanctions imposed via executive order on individuals tied to what the bills sponsors describe as Iranian support for terrorism. The IRGC, an elite military body, is powerful in Iranian politics and the economy. The legislation would also require the U.S. president to block the property of any person or entity involved in specific activities that violate the U.N. arms embargo on Iran. Iran has suggested about past proposed sanctions bills that they would violate the international nuclear agreement reached during the administration of former President Barack Obama. Democratic Senator Robert Menendez, a co-author of the measure, told Reuters the new bill had been written not to interfere with that accord. We assiduously worked to make sure that no provisions actually affect the agreement as it is, he said in an interview. Aides said the bill is expected to pass the Senate because of the breadth of its support. Its lead sponsors include Republican Senator Bob Corker, the foreign relations committee chairman, and Ben Cardin, the panels ranking Democrat. While the legislation would be expected to have strong Republican support, it would also need Democrats backing to advance in the Senate. To become law, the measure would also have to get through the House of Representatives and be signed by Trump. Trump has made clear he wants to take a tough stance against Iran. A spokeswoman for Corker said he had been consulting with the Trump administration. In February, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on 25 individuals and entities in Iran, which it said were just initial steps in its effort to counteract what it sees as provocations. Tehran has angered Washington by supporting Yemens rebel Houthi movement, and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in his countrys six-year-long civil war. It has also conducted repeated tests of ballistic missile technology in violation of a U.N. resolution. Menendez said the bill was intended to take a regional strategy because of the breadth of Irans activities. It calls for a regional strategy because Iran is obviously involved in the region in various ways, whether it be in Yemen or Syria and beyond, he told Reuters. The bill was announced just before Sundays start of the annual conference in Washington of the influential pro-Israel lobbying group AIPAC. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Critics argued that the luxury hotel housed in the historic Old Post Office a few blocks from the White House was a conflict of interest for Republican President Donald Trump because he is both landlord and tenant of the building. Lawyers for the hotel said the claim had no merit. Democratic lawmakers asked the GSA, which oversees federal property, to clarify the status of the lease arrangement. We would like to thank the GSA for their diligent review of this matter, Amanda Miller, a spokeswoman for the hotel, said in an email.  In January, Trump said he would maintain ownership of his global business empire, but hand control to his two oldest sons while president. His eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., subsequently took the reins of the Washington hotel. In a letter from GSA contracting officer Kevin Terry to Donald Trump Jr., the agency said the issue had been resolved by the younger Trump taking over as head of the company that runs the hotel and by changes to its internal operating agreement. The GSA said the company, the Trump Old Post Office LLC, was in full compliance with the section of the lease prohibiting elected federal officials from having any part of it. The hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue has become a rallying point for anti-Trump protesters. Two Democratic U.S. congressmen, Elijah Cummings of Maryland and Peter DeFazio of Oregon, voiced displeasure with the GSA decision. Any elected official can now defy the restriction by following this blueprint, they said in an email statement, calling the agencys letter completely inadequate. This decision allows profits to be reinvested back into the hotel so Donald Trump can reap the financial benefits when he leaves the White House, they added. This is exactly what the lease provision was supposed to prevent.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Jay Clayton, the Wall Street attorney tapped by President Donald Trump to lead the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, on Thursday defended himself against Democrats charges that multiple conflicts of interest would force him to miss too many SEC votes. Clayton, a partner at elite law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, is expected to win confirmation easily, although some Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee raised concerns about his ties to Wall Street and Goldman Sachs, a bank he represented during the financial crisis and that employs his wife, Gretchen.  His wife plans to resign from the bank if Clayton is confirmed, and he said he will recuse himself from matters involving his or the firms clients for two years. Some clients have included Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Bill Ackmans hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management and former Ocwen Financial Corp Executive Chairman William Erbey. Clayton told the panel his Wall Street legal experience is a strength, adding he did not think conflicts of interest would present problems in leading the agency that enforces securities laws and regulates U.S. stock, options and bond markets. As far as the extent of my practice and whether the recusals that would be required for potential conflicts will impair my ability to act as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, I do not believe they will do so, he said. Clayton, a political independent, told the committee the Dodd-Frank financial reform law should be looked at to determine if it has achieved its goals. When pressed on certain parts of the law, such as whether the SEC should delay implementing a rule requiring companies to disclose the ratio of CEO pay to the median pay of workers, Clayton declined to wade into the debate until he could get more information from SEC staff. In their questioning, Republicans led by panel chairman Mike Crapo of Idaho said the SEC should help make it easier for companies to raise money, a goal the Trump administration has embraced. Clayton said that SEC regulations should be clear and lean, saying complexity creates confusion. Companies are taking longer to go public and compliance costs are a deterrent, he said, but he did not offer policy solutions to the problem. Throughout the hearing, Democrats including Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, repeatedly said Claytons Wall Street relationships are a worry. In todays confirmation hearing for Jay Clayton, the matter of conflicts of interests was the skunk at the party, said Lisa Gilbert, a vice president of legislative affairs for Public Citizen, which has criticized Claytons Wall Street ties. Claytons potential recusals could be significant because the commission currently only has two sitting members: Democrat Kara Stein and Republican Michael Piwowar. If Clayton recuses himself and the remaining two disagree, any measure before the commission would fail. He stressed he did not see this as a major concern because most enforcement votes are unanimous. Clayton also said he strongly believes in holding individuals accountable for wrongdoing, adding it could be a greater deterrent than coming down on corporations. The SEC only has civil jurisdiction and cannot bring criminal prosecutions. Democrats also questioned if Clayton is willing to stand up to Trump and his appointees. Warren pointed to billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who is advising Trump on regulation, and asked Clayton about Icahn using his high-profile role to boost his own investments. Icahn has a controlling stake in a refinery that could benefit from a change he has proposed to the U.S. biofuels program and a 24.57 percent stake in Herbalife Ltd, which is under investigation for violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Clayton acknowledged he met with Icahn after he was nominated to discuss the role of activist investors, but was careful not to judge Icahns roles as investor and White House adviser. Violations of insider trading laws generally entail a facts and circumstances analysis, he said. Current and former SEC staff have told Reuters they are confident that Clayton will make a strong SEC chairman. Former Republican SEC Commissioner Daniel Gallagher, who has known Clayton since the financial crisis, attended the hearing Thursday and gave him high marks. His demeanor is perfectly fitting for an SEC chairman, he said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"
"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and fellow Republicans in the House of Representatives have proposed a healthcare law to kick off their promise to repeal and replace Obamacare. Following are some questions and answers about healthcare spending and health insurance coverage in the United States as Republicans try to throw out President Barack Obamas signature piece of domestic policy, the 2010 Affordable Care Act. Who is covered by what insurance?  The majority of Americas 323 million people are covered by either government or private insurance. Less than half of U.S. spending on healthcare is publicly financed, a contrast to the 72 percent average among member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. A core goal of Obamacare was to cut into the numbers of uninsured and some 20 million people gained coverage under the law. - 155 million people are covered by employer-based health plans - 70 million people are in the publicly funded Medicaid program for the poor, including 32 million children - 56 million older or disabled people receive Medicare  - 15 million people are covered by military healthcare - 12 million people buy individual insurance on the online shopping exchanges created by Obamacare - 9 million people purchase unsubsidized health insurance directly - 6 million people are covered by the Indian Health Service, student health plans and other sources - About 28 million Americans remain uninsured The figures are government estimates. They do not add up to a total of 323 million because some people have more than one type of coverage.   How much does the country spend?  Spending on healthcare in the United States is about $3.5 trillion a year, representing about 18 percent of U.S. gross domestic product. Current U.S. government estimates are for that spending to outpace economic growth and rise to 20 percent of GDP by 2025. Healthcare spending has been rising faster than inflation.The government estimated it to have risen 4.8 percent in 2016 and that it will increase at an average rate of 5.6 percent through 2025. What does America get for its money?  While U.S. healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP ranks higher than for any other OECD country, Americans life expectancy is near the bottom in a ranking of other OECD countries, behind countries such as France, Germany and Britain. The countrys obesity rate is the highest.  What was the impact of Obamacare?  As the Affordable Care Act was implemented over the past six years, it made sweeping changes to the health insurance system and implemented new taxes, so gutting the law will affect most Americans at some point. The law set a series of minimum standards. It introduced free preventive care coverage, mandated most employers to offer insurance and individuals to buy it, expanded the Medicaid program to include people with higher incomes and created income-based subsidies for individuals to draw them into buying insurance. It prevented insurers from denying coverage to people based on their health status and allowed young adults to stay on their parents health insurance policies. What sectors are feeling the impact now?  Republicans will tackle repealing Obamacare in multiple steps because while they control both chambers in Congress, they do not have the 60 seats in the 100-seat Senate needed to simply undo the law. The first step focuses on insurance sold to individuals and the Medicaid expansion, which could mean diminished payments to hospitals and doctors who benefited from the 20 million people covered by the ACA. They now face uncertain revenues and the possibility of increased bad debt as they lose paying patients. The impact on insurers is twofold: uncertainty over who will buy insurance could lead to them mispricing insurance plans and suffering financially as soon as this year. In the longer term, the retrenchment is changing the outlook for the growth rate of publicly backed healthcare. Which publicly traded companies does this affect?  There are only a handful of publicly traded hospital companies, and the biggest one, HCA Holdings Inc, is not focused on states where Medicaid expanded, so it tends not to be involved. Tenet Healthcare Corp and Community Health Systems Inc are smaller hospital chains with high debt loads and their shares do tend to be affected by news about potential cuts to the numbers of Americans with publicly funded healthcare.  The insurers that specialize in Medicaid and government healthcare such as WellCare Health Plans, Molina Healthcare Inc and Centene Corp are small but tend to move on news that the Medicaid expansion may be repealed and on proposed changes in how the federal government pays its share of all Medicaid costs to the states. Anthem Inc is one of the biggest insurers selling plans on the individual exchanges and may see shares affected by news of rules that could affect who enrolls in insurance.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and House of Representatives leaders pushed on Wednesday for votes for their plan to overhaul Obamacare and said they were making progress in their efforts to win over conservative Republicans who have demanded changes to the legislation. With a vote on the bill possible as soon as Thursday, members of the House Freedom Caucus, a conservative Republican faction, said they had been negotiating alterations to the plan with the White House.  Much of the discussion hinged on conservatives desire to scrap what are labeled essential health benefits - services that insurance plans are required to cover under the Affordable Care Act, commonly called Obamacare, such as mental health help. I can tell you that were making great progress, Mark Meadows, chairman of the hardline conservative House Freedom Caucus, told reporters. Were not there yet. But were hopeful.  Trump was to meet at the White House with members of the Freedom Caucus on Thursday at 11:30 a.m, the White House said. But while the president courted conservatives, the bill appeared to be losing traction among Republican moderates, some of whom attended a meeting late Wednesday in House Speaker Paul Ryans office. Representative Charlie Dent, a leader of the Tuesday Group of House Republican moderates, issued a statement saying he could not back the bill. I believe this bill, in its current form, will lead to the loss of coverage and make insurance unaffordable for too many Americans, particularly for low- to moderate-income and older individuals, Dent said in the statement. The chairman of the House Rules Committee, which met all day Wednesday to set the rules for the bills consideration on the House floor, said late on Wednesday that the panel would resume its meeting on Thursday, having made no definite decision on the timing of the floor vote. Repealing and replacing Democratic former President Barack Obamas 2010 Affordable Care Act is a first major test of Trumps legislative ability and whether he can keep his big promises to business. Plans aired by Trump during his election campaign and his first two months in office lifted U.S. stock markets to new highs. But stocks fell back sharply on Tuesday as investors worried that a rough ride for the healthcare legislation could affect his ability to deliver on other big pieces of his agenda, from cutting taxes and regulation to boosting infrastructure. Major stock indexes wobbled on Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending slightly down and the S&P 500 slightly higher. Investors are eagerly awaiting Thursdays healthcare vote, which could be pivotal for Trumps broader plans. The Freedom Caucus has objected to the bill because its members believe it is still too close to Obamacare. Representative Steve King, a conservative who was among lawmakers who met Trump on Wednesday morning at the White House,  said he would now vote for the bill because he got a commitment from Trump to publicly advocate a change to the legislation when it reaches the Senate, eliminating the essential benefits, which also include emergency room visits and maternity and newborn care. I have a full and firm commitment with many witnesses from President Trump, King said in a video statement on YouTube. Meadows said the members of the Freedom Caucus had also discussed the essential benefits with the administration. Conservatives say reducing or scrapping the mandates would bring down insurance premiums. On the other side, patient advocates say that not requiring the coverage would hurt both individuals and healthcare providers. It could leave countless people with too little coverage to meet their health care needs and drive higher rates of uncompensated care at hospitals already struggling to cover their costs, Bruce Siegel, president of Americas Essential Hospitals, said in a statement. Earlier on Wednesday, a Freedom Caucus aide said more than 25 of its members were opposed, enough to stop the bill from passing. Republicans cannot afford to lose more than 21 votes from their own party, since Democrats are united in opposition. Democrats, meanwhile, said amending the bill in the Senate would affect procedure, and increase the amount of votes Republicans would need in that chamber. Currently, Republicans intend to pass the plan through budget reconciliation, a process with little room for changes that only requires a simple majority to pass. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders also gave signs negotiations were making headway late on Wednesday. We are continuing to move forward and adding new supporters constantly, she said. As we have indicated previously we are open to changes to the bill that make it better and grow its support. The primary aim of Obamas signature legislation, passed in 2010, was reducing the numbers of Americans with no health coverage. Twenty million people gained insurance under the law. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated 14 million people would lose coverage under the Republican plan by next year. It also said 24 million fewer people would be insured by 2026.     The Republican plan would also rescind taxes created by Obamacare, repeal penalties for not buying coverage, slash funding for the Medicaid program for the poor, and modify subsidies that help individuals buy plans. In the two weeks since it was unveiled, shares of some hospital operators and health insurers have fallen more than 10 percent. If the healthcare bill passes the House, the Senate could take it up next week. Republican leaders hope that if the Senate acts quickly, the bill could go back to the House for a final vote by mid-April, possibly allowing Trump to sign it into law by Easter, April 16.   Opponents of the overhaul have been fiercely vocal, and on Wednesday protesters, many in wheelchairs or with serious medical conditions, blocked the Capitol rotunda for about an hour. Rather go to jail than die without Medicaid, they chanted. Capitol police said they made 54 arrests and later released the protesters.

The vote was 52 to 46, almost exclusively along party lines. Only two Democrats, Senators Robert Menendez and Joe Manchin, joined Trumps fellow Republicans in backing Friedman. That amount of opposition is highly unusual for a nominee for U.S. ambassador to Israel, a close ally of the United States. For decades, nominees from both Democratic and Republican presidents have been approved without objection, via unanimous consent or voice votes. Friedman, who has no diplomatic experience, is a longtime friend of Trump who worked for the Republican former New York businessman as a bankruptcy lawyer. In addition to investing in settlements on land claimed by the Palestinians, Friedman favors moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The relocation is strongly opposed by many U.S. allies because both Israel and the Palestinians claim the city as their capital. Friedman is also known for using inflammatory language against those with whom he has political disagreements, such as describing former President Barack Obama as anti-Semitic. Democrats said his approach could risk security in a volatile region. Our ambassador should not be the kind of person who uses language to fuel violence, hate, instability, Democratic Senator Brian Schatz said on the Senate floor before the final confirmation vote. Trumps selection of Friedman reflects his shift in policy toward Israel after years of friction between Obama and Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu. Unlike Obama, Trump has wavered on the U.S. commitment to a two-state solution, long a bedrock of Washingtons Middle East policy, and backed the embassys relocation. When Friedman was approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also largely along party lines, Republican Senator Bob Corker, the panels chairman, praised him as an impassioned advocate for strong U.S.-Israeli ties. He understands the complexity of issues at stake for the United States and the necessity to support a democratic ally in an important and unstable part of the world, Corker said. Thursdays vote meant that Trump will have an ambassador in place in time for next weeks annual conference in Washington of the powerful pro-Israel lobbying group AIPAC.

The vote was along party lines, with 50 Republicans approving the measure and 48 Democrats rejecting it. The two remaining Republicans in the Senate were absent and did not cast a vote. According to the rules approved by the Federal Communications Commission in October under then-President Barack Obama, internet providers would need to obtain consumer consent before using precise geolocation, financial information, health information, childrens information and web browsing history for advertising and internal marketing. The vote was a victory for internet providers such as AT&T Inc (T.N), Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), which had strongly opposed the rules. The bill next goes to the U.S. House of Representatives, but it was not clear when they would take up the measure. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate was overturning a regulation that makes the internet an uneven playing field, increases complexity, discourages competition, innovation, and infrastructure investment. But Democratic Senator Ed Markey said, Republicans have just made it easier for Americans sensitive information about their health, finances and families to be used, shared, and sold to the highest bidder without their permission. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said consumers would have privacy protections even without the Obama administration internet provider rules. In a joint statement, Democratic members of the FCC and the Federal Trade Commission said the Senate vote creates a massive gap in consumer protection law as broadband and cable companies now have no discernible privacy requirements. Republican commissioners, including Pai, said in October that the rules would unfairly give websites like Facebook, Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) or Google the ability to harvest more data than internet service providers and thus dominate digital advertising. The FCC earlier this month delayed the data rules from taking effect. The Internet and Television Association, a trade group, in a statement praised the vote as a critical step towards re-establishing a balanced framework that is grounded in the long-standing and successful FTC privacy framework that applies equally to all parties operating online. Websites are governed by a less restrictive set of privacy rules overseen by the Federal Trade Commission. Jonathan Schwantes, senior policy counsel for advocacy group Consumers Union, said the vote is a huge step in the wrong direction, and it completely ignores the needs and concerns of consumers.

The Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act requires the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to develop a regulatory framework to enable the licensing of advanced nuclear reactors that could come into development in 10 or 15 years.   The bill passed 18-3 in the Environment and Public Works Committee.  Republican Senator James Inhofe, said the bill is critical for the revitalization and improvement of our nations nuclear energy industry.  The bill has brought together some Republicans eager to prevent the United States from falling behind China and Russia in nuclear innovation and Democrats who want to foster technologies that do not emit gases blamed for climate change. But the legislation faces a cloudy future.  The nuclear industry faces competition from cheap natural gas prices and the growing wind and solar power industries. It was uncertain whether the full Senate would debate the bill or if the measure would be absorbed into broader energy legislation. Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse said the bill would help the United States keep its lead in innovation while finding possible solutions to the waste now kept in pools and in casks at conventional nuclear plant sites.    If we can get there, we will have done this country and the world a vital public service, Whitehouse said of the potential for the advanced reactors to reduce the waste problem.  A fellow Democrat, Senator Kamala Harris of California - one of several lawmakers who want to see the country find comprehensive, permanent solutions to existing nuclear waste from conventional nuclear plants before moving ahead with new reactors - voted against the bill.  Safely disposing of any radioactive material is a key priority of mine to ensure that we leave our environment pristine and unharmed for future generations, Harris said, adding that she is willing to help improve the legislation.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Two months after stepping down as Barack Obamas ambassador to Israel, Dan Shapiro sees some good in the initial peace efforts by the new administration of Donald Trump, even as he voices his grievances against it. So far the approach on the Israeli-Palestinian issue has been more cautious and more responsible than almost anything else, Shapiro told Reuters.  I cant quite explain why on this one issue theyre closer to the norm than theyve been on other issues. Shapiro has gained a following of thousands on his new personal Twitter account, sharing insights gleaned from nearly six years in the Tel Aviv embassy and face-to-face contacts with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and correcting misconceptions he perceives on social media about Obamas diplomacy. In the interview, he said Trump has surprised him by calling for a slowdown in Israeli settlement construction on occupied land Palestinians seek for a state. The former envoy praised the Republican presidents chief negotiator Jason Greenblatt for meeting a cross-section of Israelis and Palestinians during a visit last week that has led to U.S.-Israeli discussions on limiting settlement building. Still, Shapiro cautioned, Trumps government is inconsistent and unpredictable. Im not sure how comfortable the Israelis should be with an administration thats hard to read, thats far from fully staffed, that has a very undeveloped policymaking apparatus and has very divergent voices within it, he said. On other diplomatic fronts, Shapiro said, the Trump administration has been cozying up dangerously to Russia, backtracking from free trade agreements and international organizations and calling into question Washingtons NATO obligations. When news broke earlier this week that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson planned to skip a NATO meeting, Shapiro pointed on Twitter to a failure to fill staff vacancies. Thats OK, hell just send his Dep ... I mean, thats OK, hell send the Underse ... I mean, thats OK, hell send an Assistan ... Oh, never mind, he wrote. Now an adviser at a hedge fund and a distinguished visiting fellow at Israels Institute for National Security Studies, Shapiro took the unorthodox course of staying in Israel after leaving his diplomatic post so that a daughter could finish high school exams. The decision to delay his familys return, Shapiro said in an interview with Reuters, also allows him to avoid what he described as the bleak mood in Washington following Donald Trumps election as president. Shapiro has avoided wading into Israels domestic politics on Twitter, saying that as a guest in the country, it would be unseemly to do so. Looking back on the failures of the Obama administrations Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts, he suggested that former Secretary of State John Kerry may have been too idealistic in pursuing talks that collapsed in 2014. We might have adjusted our approach had we taken a very realistic assessment whether we had the leadership dynamics to achieve a breakthrough in negotiations, said Shapiro. The United States, he said, had been aware after efforts during Obamas first term, of the deep personal mistrust between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. And so its a fair question about whether it was realistic at the beginning of the second term that with a concerted effort we couldachieve an appreciably different result, Shapiro said.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives intelligence committee set off a political firestorm on Wednesday when he said the communications of members of Donald Trumps transition team were caught up in incidental surveillance targeting foreigners. Representative Devin Nunes said at a news conference that it was possible President Trumps own communications were also intercepted and disseminated among U.S. intelligence agencies. The White House seized on Nunes remarks, which had cited anonymous sources, to bolster Trumps unproven assertion that former President Barack Obamas administration spied on the incoming president. Nunes himself said there is no proof of that, as have other lawmakers of both parties and the FBI director. A short while later, Trump spokesman Sean Spicer cited Nunes comments at his White House news briefing. I do think it is a startling revelation, and theres a lot of questions that need to get asked, Spicer said. Democrats denounced Nunes statements as highly unusual from the chairman of an intelligence committee, with the top Democrat on the committee saying its members had not been informed and implying that Nunes was giving political cover to the president. Intelligence reports about the communications appeared to unmask the identity of the Trump associates and the names were widely shared among the agencies, Nunes said. He said it was possible Trumps own communications were also collected. The National Security Agency routinely collects electronic communications on foreigners through a variety of surveillance tools. But information about Americans is also sometimes incidentally gathered, such as when someone is communicating to a foreign target.  Typically the names of Americans are made anonymous, or masked, in foreign intelligence reports unless an intelligence agency determines the identity of that person is relevant to national security or a criminal investigation. It was unclear why the reports Nunes cited contained unmasked names. A U.S. government source said it was logical, if not normal, that communications from Trump aides would have been incidentally intercepted by U.S. agencies after his election, given that they would have an interest in talking to foreign governments. Trump took office on Jan. 20. Two days ago, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, James Comey, told a hearing of Nunes committee that his agency was conducting a criminal investigation of potential links between Trump associates and Russias attempts to influence the 2016 U.S. election to benefit Trump. I recently confirmed that on numerous occasions the intelligence community ... collected information about U.S. citizens involved in the Trump transition, said Nunes, who was himself on Trumps transition team. Nunes said he was referring to intelligence reports of communications collected under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. I want to be clear, none of this surveillance was related to Russia or the investigation of Russian activities or of the Trump team, he said. Trump said he felt somewhat vindicated by Nunes announcement after being briefed by Nunes. FBI head Comey on Monday said that Trumps claims were groundless. According to Nunes, the conversations in question were collected legally in November, December and January. In an interview with CNN, the committees leading Democrat, Adam Schiff said, The chairman will need to decide whether he is the chairman of an independent investigation into conduct which includes allegations of potential coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russians, or hes going to act as a surrogate of the White House, because he cannot do both. Nunes remarks appeared tied to a line of questioning from Republicans during Mondays hearing about the importance of identifying and prosecuting those responsible for intelligence leaks. Republicans have focused much of their discussion of the issue on the release of the names, or unmasking of Trump associates in the investigation. Trump fired his former national security adviser, General Mike Flynn, after the revelation that he had spoken to Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak, during the transition - which was leaked to the press after those calls were caught by surveillance intercepts. Nunes appeared to suggest intelligence reports about intercepts other than Flynns conversations existed.     Former intelligence officials and Democrats said Nunes announcement was highly unusual from the chairman of an intelligence committee. Schiff said he was not consulted by Nunes before his news conference. Nunes decision to share the information with the White House before informing the committee was a profound irregularity, Schiff said, adding that a credible investigation cannot be conducted this way. Schiff said the unmasking of a U.S. person may be appropriate in the context of an investigation. U.S. intelligence agencies have accused Russia of seeking to influence the presidential election in Trumps favor against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton by hacking computer systems and spreading disinformation. Russia denies the allegations. Nunes said he was very concerned about whether U.S. intelligence agencies were spying on Trump. He briefed Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan before the news conference and went to the White House to share the information. Admiral Mike Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, was asked by Republicans at Mondays hearing about the agencys policies for unmasking the names of Americans whose communications were incidentally collected under foreign surveillance programs. Rogers said that 20 NSA employees, including himself, have the authority to unmask the identity of an Americans communications, and that senior officials at the CIA, FBI and Justice Department can make such a request. Asked how many Americans had been unmasked since June 2016, Rogers said he did not know. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Fukumoto, 33, the youngest Hawaii legislator to serve as House minority leader, said divisive campaign rhetoric during the 2016 elections convinced her the Republican Party no longer reflected her political values or the interests of her states diverse population. This election, I saw members of my party marginalizing and condemning minorities, ethnic or otherwise, and making demeaning comments towards women, she said in an open letter of resignation to the Republican Party.  Fukumoto, who is of mixed Japanese and Irish ancestry, said she found Trumps comments about banning Muslim immigrants and the possibility of establishing a registry of Muslim-Americans to be especially troubling. I wanted very badly to see the Republican Party denounce his comments, and that didnt happen, she told Reuters, saying a Muslim registry struck her as one step away from internment camps.  That for me was the issue that really changed how I felt. A self-described political moderate, Fukumoto was the first Republican in 26 years to represent the largely middle-class central Oahu district outside Honolulu, capital of the predominantly Democratic state. She said she originally joined the Republicans out of a sense that Democrats were the status quo party, but she grew gradually disillusioned with the Republicans. She recounted a fellow Republican caucus member admonishing her last year that they should be considered the party of middle America despite Hawaiis diverse demographics. Before making the switch, Fukumoto sent out a questionnaire to constituents seeking their opinions. Of those who replied, 76 percent said they would support her regardless, while most of the remainder opposed her changing parties, she said. First elected to the state legislature in 2012, Fukumoto  became leader of the states tiny House Republican caucus two years later, only to be removed by her peers in February of this year after she spoke out against Trump during the Womens March in Hawaii the day after his inauguration. As of Wednesday, Fukumoto, became the lone independent among 45 Democrats and five remaining Republicans in the states lower House, as she launches a process of applying for membership in the states majority party.

The department, and other U.S. government agencies, had more than four years to meet the deadline under an Aug. 24, 2012, directive that aimed to eliminate the use of paper records as much as possible in favor of electronic record-keeping. That directive was part of an Obama administration effort to update government record-keeping for the digital age and promote accountability for official decisions by ensuring they are properly documented and preserved for future generations. In a report posted by the National Archives on Wednesday, the State Department checked the No box in response to a question on whether it had met the goal of managing all its email records in an electronic format by Dec. 31, 2016. In the report, the State Department said it had met the goal on its main, centralized email systems accounting for the overwhelming majority of its emails. However, the Department does have additional email systems that require further evaluation before we will certify that all email records are managed in an electronic format, it said, saying it was working hard to fully meet the goal. The State Department had no immediate comment on the matter. The departments record-keeping and email archiving practices attracted scrutiny during the 2016 presidential campaign when the New York Times reported that Clinton had used a private email server as secretary of state. The Democrats use of the server to conduct official business throughout her 2009-2013 State Department tenure was criticized by Republican Donald Trump, who defeated her for the presidency in last Novembers election. An internal government watchdog issued a report last year that found Clinton broke government rules by using the private email server for her work as Americas top diplomat without approval. The State Departments Office of the Inspector General said it found no evidence Clinton sought permission to use a server at her Chappaqua, New York, home to handle her work emails and it quoted officials as saying they would have rejected her doing so if they had been asked. The report also found problems in department record-keeping practices before Clintons tenure, and it documented how slowly the department had moved to bring record-keeping into the age of electronic communications.

The Senate began debate on Wednesday evening under a provision that allows Congress to repeal recently approved federal regulations. Under the rules approved by the Federal Communications Commission in October under then-President Barack Obama, internet providers would need to obtain consumer consent before using precise geolocation, financial information, health information, childrens information and web browsing history for advertising and internal marketing. Earlier this month, the FCC temporarily blocked those rules from taking effect, a victory for internet providers such as AT&T Inc Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc that had strongly opposed the measure. A final Senate vote on the measure is expected on Thursday, but it was not clear when the U.S. House of Representatives might take up the measure. Congress needs to repeal these privacy restrictions in order to restore balance to the internet ecosystem and provide certainty to consumers, said Senator Jeff Flake, a Republican who sponsored the measure. But Democratic Senator Bill Nelson said that broadband providers build profiles about our children from birth. This is a gold mine of data  the holy grail so to speak. It is no wonder that broadband providers want to be able to sell this information to the highest bidder without consumers knowledge or consent. And they want to collect and use this information without providing transparency or being held accountable.  The American Civil Liberties Union also criticized the proposal to undo the rules. With this move, Congress is essentially allowing companies like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon to sell consumers private information to the highest bidder, ACLU general counsel Neema Singh Guliani said earlier this month. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, nominated by Republican President Donald Trump to serve a second five-year term on the commission, said earlier this month that consumers would have privacy protections even without the Obama administration internet provider rules.     Republican commissioners, including Pai, said in October that the rules would unfairly give websites like Facebook, Twitter Inc or Google the ability to harvest more data than internet service providers and thus dominate digital advertising. Websites are governed by a less restrictive set of privacy rules overseen by the Federal Trade Commission.  Democratic Senator Edward Markey said just as phone companies cannot sell information about Americans phone calls, an internet service provider should not be allowed to sell sensitive consumer information without affirmative consent.

The top U.S. diplomat did not make clear where these zones were to be set up. He was addressing a meeting of 68 countries and organizations gathered in Washington to discuss accelerating the battle against Islamic State. The United States will increase our pressure on ISIS and al Qaeda and will work to establish interim zones of stability, through ceasefires, to allow refugees to return home, Tillerson told the gathering at the State Department, where the former oil executive was hosting his first major diplomatic event. Although it was unclear how the zones would work, creating any safe havens could ratchet up U.S. military involvement in Syria and mark a major departure from President Barack Obamas more cautious approach.  Asked about Tillersons remarks, coalition spokesman Colonel Joseph Scrocca said the U.S. military had not yet received direction to establish any kind of zones.  Increased U.S. or allied air power would be required if President Donald Trump chooses to enforce no fly restrictions, and ground forces might also be needed to protect civilians in those areas. A final statement at the end of the meeting did not mention the possibility of safe zones. Islamic State has been losing ground in both Iraq and Syria, with three separate forces, backed by the United States, Turkey and Russia, advancing on the groups Syrian stronghold city of Raqqa. U.S. defense officials said on Wednesday the U.S.-led coalition has airlifted Syrian rebel forces in an operation near the Syrian town of Tabqa in Raqqa province.  I recognize there are many pressing challenges in the Middle East, but defeating ISIS is the United States number one goal in the region, Tillerson said. As a coalition we are not in the business of nation building or reconstruction, he said, adding that resources should be focused on preventing the resurgence of ISIS and equipping war-torn communities to rebuild. Wednesdays event was the first meeting of the coalition since the election of Trump, who has pledged to make the fight against Islamic State a priority.  Tillerson called on coalition partners to make good on financial pledges to secure and rebuild areas where Islamic State has been pushed out. The coalition has pledged more than $2 billion in assistance for Iraq and Syria in 2017. Iraqi government forces, backed by the U.S.-led international coalition, retook several Iraqi cities from Islamic State last year and have liberated eastern Mosul.  While the jihadist group is overwhelmingly outnumbered by Iraqi forces, it has been using suicide car bombs and snipers to defend its remaining strongholds. Speaking to the same meeting, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi called for unity in the region to combat Islamic State and outlined Iraqs progress in the fight. He said Iraq was now at the stage of destroying Islamic State, not just containing it. Recounting a Tuesday conversation with the Iraqi leader, Senator Lindsey Graham said Abadi believed reconstruction of Anbar province as well as Mosul in Nineveh province would cost about $50 billion.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch said on Wednesday presidents must obey court orders and expressed uncertainty about language in the Constitution barring U.S. government officials from taking payments from a foreign country as Democrats grilled him on issues involving President Donald Trump. Gorsuch, the conservative appeals court judge from Colorado nominated by Trump on Jan. 31 to a lifetime job on the nations highest court, sparred with Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats on the third day of his confirmation hearing.  He completed his testimony on Wednesday night. The committee will complete its deliberations on Thursday by hearing testimony from outside witnesses. Gorsuch seems assured of winning committee approval, moving his nomination to the full Republican-led Senate. His challenge then would be to gather enough Democratic votes to avoid a prolonged floor fight with the potential, if it gets rocky, of changing how the Senate works. While Gorsuchs confirmation process looked to be proceeding smoothly, Democrats pressed him on matters swirling around Trump, even asking him about the standards for impeachment. Gorsuchs expected Senate confirmation would restore a conservative majority on the court and hand the Republican president his biggest achievement in office. Senator Patrick Leahy cited comments by Trump adviser Stephen Miller after courts blocked the presidents executive action temporarily banning people from several Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States. On Feb. 12, Miller challenged the authority of courts to rule on the issue, saying the presidents power to enforce the ban should not be questioned. Im a judge now. I take that seriously. And you better believe I expect judicial decrees to be obeyed, Gorsuch said. Thats the rule of law in this country, Gorsuch added. Gorsuch declined to say how he would approach an alleged violation of the U.S. Constitutions Emoluments Clause, which prevents American officials from accepting any gifts or favors from foreign governments without congressional approval. The question is: What exactly does that mean? Gorsuch said, noting there was ongoing litigation on the matter. I have to be very careful about expressing any views. Trump has been sued by ethics lawyers, who say his businesses have accepted payments from foreign governments in violation of the Emoluments Clause. On the basis for which an official can be impeached, Gorsuch said historically the focus had been on high crimes rather than misdemeanors. He said the number of criminal misdemeanors on the books had increased substantially since the U.S. Constitution was written in the 18th century.  A unanimous ruling on Wednesday by the Supreme Court justices whom Gorsuch would join, if confirmed, rejected legal reasoning he used as an appellate judge in a 2008 ruling against an autistic child who sought a public education more tailored to his needs. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of another autistic student who argued he was denied an adequate education. Democrats have called Gorsuchs earlier decision an example of how he rules against everyday Americans while favoring corporate interests, an assertion the nominee and his Republicans supporters reject. Gorsuch said he was bound by court precedent in the 2008 decision, adding it would be heartbreaking to suggest he would like ruling against disabled students. He sidestepped answering whether he thought a series of contentious past cases had been decided correctly, including those on abortion, gun rights, political spending and religious rights. What worries me is you have been very much able to avoid any specificity, like no one I have every seen before, Senator Dianne Feinstein, the panels top Democrat, told Gorsuch.  Feinstein asked Gorsuch to explain a document dating from his work in former President George W. Bushs Justice Department related to 2005 anti-torture restrictions. The document asked whether aggressive interrogation techniques used by Bushs administration had yielded valuable intelligence or stopped a terrorist incident, and Gorsuch had written yes. Gorsuch said he was merely doing what he was told by the administration. My recollection of 12 years ago is that was the position that the clients were telling us, he said. Feinstein expressed concern about womens rights and preserving legalized abortion, and asked Gorsuch about his views as an originalist seeing the Constitutions meaning as unaltered since its enactment despite centuries of societal change. No one is looking to return us to horse-and-buggy days, Gorsuch said. Regarding the Constitutions promise of equal protection under the law, Gorsuch said it did not matter that some of the drafters of the language were racists, because they were, or sexists, because they were. Republicans hold 52 seats in the 100-member Senate. The Senate has a 60-vote hurdle for confirmation of Supreme Court justices, meaning Gorsuch would need backing by eight Democrats. If Democrats stand together, Republicans could change Senate rules to allow confirmation by a simple majority vote. A committee vote is expected on April 3. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has said Gorsuch would be confirmed before lawmakers mid-April recess. If confirmed, Gorsuch would replace conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February 2016.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Steven Curtis, 57, who served as state GOP boss from 1997 until 1999, is charged with one felony count of forgery and one misdemeanor count of tampering with a mail-in ballot, according to a criminal complaint filed in Weld County District Court. The case stems from an inquiry lodged with the Weld County Clerk and Recorders Office by Curtiss former spouse, Kelly Ireland, who contacted the agency in October to check on the status of her voter registration after the couple split. Ireland was informed then that a signed mail-in ballot bearing her name and voter information had already been submitted, according to Carly Koppes, an elected Republican who serves as the county clerk.

The Republican healthcare bill he supports was facing resistance from members of his own party, as well as Democrats, ahead of a  vote on it expected in the House of Representatives on Thursday. Market analysts have been expecting Trump and the Republicans to complete confirmation of his Supreme Court nominee by early April; repeal Obamacare by mid-May; pass a budget resolution by late June; and reform the tax code by year-end. Analysts this week expressed doubt about those targets. Here is a look at key 2017 dates coming up on the Washington policy calendar that could influence Trumps agenda. March 23: Vote expected in the House on Republicans Obamacare rollback bill. April 3: Senate Judiciary Committee expected to vote on Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, sending nomination to full Senate. April 7: Start of two-week congressional recess. April 18: Early check on U.S. voters assessment of Trump in special election in Georgia to fill a vacant House seat. April 28: Spending authority for government under continuing budget resolution expires, requiring congressional action. May 25: Trump attends NATO summit in Brussels. May 26: Trump attends G-7 conference in Italy. Congress adjourns for one-week Memorial Day holiday recess. June 14: Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, Chairman Janet Yellen holds news conference. June 20: Georgia special election runoff. June 30: Congress adjourns for one-week Independence Day holiday recess. July 7-8: Trump attends G20 summit in Germany. July 28: Congress adjourns for five-week summer recess. Sept. 20: FOMC meeting and Yellen news conference. Oct. 1: Fiscal 2018 starts, requiring a new government spending resolution from Congress or a shutdown. October-November: Treasury Departments extraordinary measures to avoid the federal debt ceiling are projected to run out. Nov. 7: Election Day for governors races in Virginia and New Jersey. Nov. 25: Trump expected to attend Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Vietnam.         Dec. 13: FOMC meeting and Yellen news conference.

Justice Barry Ostrager of the State Supreme Court in Manhattan also ordered Exxon by March 31 to turn over documents from its management committee that had been subpoenaed by Eric Schneiderman, the attorney general. Schneiderman had issued the subpoena in November, in connection with his probe into whether Exxon misled investors and the public about climate change. At a court hearing on Wednesday, a lawyer for the attorney general said Exxon had just made a bombshell revelation that it had lost a year of emails from an account that Tillerson had used, but under the alias Wayne Tracker.     Tillerson used the alias account to send and receive information about climate change and other matters, Schneiderman said in a March 13 letter to the court. Schneiderman said Exxon failed to disclose the Wayne Tracker account, and that it had been uncovered during the review of other materials. The letter also said Exxon had produced 60 documents bearing the Wayne Tracker email, but had not said the account was Tillersons. Exxon responded that the account was proper, enabling Tillerson to communicate easily with other Exxon officials, and set up because of the flood of email that Tillerson already received. It has also said it does not consider the lost emails significant, and that copies of many would already have been turned over to the attorney general. In December, Tillerson left Exxon, where he had also been chairman, and stepped down as chairman of the American Petroleum Institute trade group.

There were doubts about U.S. participation in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) after Congress killed the resource extraction rule that required companies such as Exxon Mobil to disclose taxes and other fees paid to foreign governments, such as Russia. The EITI, which was founded in 2003, and which the U.S. joined in 2014, sets a global standard for governments to disclose their revenues from oil, gas, and mining assets, and for companies to report payments made to obtain access to publicly owned resources, as well as other donations. The (U.S. Interior) Department remains committed to the principles and goals ofEITIincluding transparency and good governance of the extractive sectors..., Heather Swift, a spokesperson for Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, said in an email to Reuters. Industry sources familiar with EITI implementation said the United States was already pulling out in all but name, but could formally remain a member until its progress assessment scheduled to start in April 2018. Azerbaijan left the group in March after the EITI board, chaired by Swedens former prime minister Fredrik Reinfeldt, suspended its membership over concerns about limits on civic freedoms. The EITI initiative was primarily aimed at developing nations and most of its members are in Africa. But Britain, Germany and Norway also joined, while France and Australia have also expressed interest. Democratic Senator Ben Cardin and former Republican Senator Richard Lugar, authors of legislation encouraging U.S. participation in EITI, said withdrawal would harm national interests. Such a retreat is a retreat from our values, which give America its strength and its moral leadership in the world, they said in a joint statement. Jonas Moberg, head of EITIs secretariat in Oslo, said the United States continued to be the part of the global initiative, but if it decided to leave, it wouldnt be the end of the initiative, now being implemented in 51 countries. Should the administration of President Trump decide to bring an end to EITI implementation, we are not concerned that it would be a decision followed elsewhere, he added in an email to Reuters. The International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM), which represents 23 leading mining companies, has said companies that work in EITI member countries will still have to abide by strict disclosure rules, despite the recent U.S. legal changes.

Alexander Acosta told a Senate committee on Wednesday he would abide by President Donald Trumps directive to review a pending fiduciary rule for retirement investment advisers, indicating he believed it goes too far. Acosta told the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions that the fiduciary rule, slated to take effect on April 10 but which the department has proposed delaying, goes far beyond regulating the conduct of investment advisers. The Trump administration directed the department last month to review whether the Obama-era rule, which requires brokers offering retirement investment advice to put their clients interest first, was burdensome and out of step with current White House policies. Acosta likewise expressed reservations about another Obama administration rule issued last year that more than doubled the salary ceiling under which employees would be eligible for overtime pay, from $23,660 to $47,476 a year. Acosta said he had serious questions as to whether the secretary of labor had the power to enact this in the first place. A federal judge in November blocked the rule, which extended mandatory overtime pay to more than 4 million salaried workers. The Trump administration must decide whether to defend the rule, and Acostas statements indicated that, if confirmed, he may decline to do so. However, Acosta told senators he was sensitive to the fact that overtime rules have not been updated in more than a decade. During the three-hour hearing, Acosta said that while he felt both Republicans and Democrats had the shared goal of protecting the interests of U.S. workers, they may disagree about the best courses of action. Ultimately, Acosta told the panel, Cabinet secretaries are selected by Trump and tasked with deploying his administrations vision. We work for the president, he is our boss, and so all Cabinet officials ... will ultimately follow his direction unless we feel that we cant and if we cant, we resign, Acosta said. Acosta, a former member of the National Labor Relations Board and dean of the Florida International University College of Law in Miami, was nominated to be labor secretary in February, one day after Trumps original choice, Andrew Puzder, withdrew.  Acosta has had a decades-long career in public service and has been through multiple Senate vettings for previous appointments, making it is unlikely his nomination will be derailed.

Jeb Hensarling, head of the House Financial Services Committee, told Reuters that he has assurances from the White House and congressional leaders that they want to revisit the Dodd-Frank financial reform law sometime in 2017. Every conversation Ive had with the president, the vice president and the speaker is that this remains a this year priority, Hensarling said in an interview shortly after he addressed the American Bankers Association conference in Washington. The Dodd-Frank law was enacted in 2010 in the wake of the financial crisis, and it implemented a host of new rules and restrictions on the financial industry.  The banking industry is hopeful that its years-long efforts to water down the legislations requirements can gain traction now that Republicans control both chambers of Congress and the White House. However, Hensarling told the ABA that there were major tests ahead for his efforts to significantly alter the regulatory landscape for financial institutions. He noted that his counterpart, Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, a Republican, faces the task of attracting enough Democratic backers to clear legislation there. The support of at least eight Democrats would be needed to pass any major changes to Dodd-Frank. However, Hensarling noted that some of the most prominent voices in that party, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, have honed an acute message critical of Wall Street that makes it more difficult to muster that backing. He has challenges that I do not have, said Hensarling, who can move legislation through the House with solely Republican support. Right now, I fear that a lot of Democratic senators are intimidated, frankly, by their political base. Some banking lobbyists have expressed concern that the White Houses ambitious legislative agenda, including massive reforms to health care and the tax code, could complicate their efforts to win support for broad Dodd-Frank changes in Congress. Hensarling said he plans to re-introduce his ambitious rewrite of financial rules, the Financial CHOICE Act, sometime soon.  But in a nod to the uphill climb his legislation faces in the Senate,  he also said his committee would be considering smaller parts of the measure in separate bills as well. Keep hope alive; I think provisions of the CHOICE Act will be able to survive, he told the ABA conference. Under Hensarlings bill, the largest U.S. banks would face less oversight. It would also dilute the powers of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Ive let Secretary Tillerson know theres a lot of concern about the budget issue, Senator Bob Corker, the committees Republican chairman, said at a hearing on the global humanitarian crisis. Members of the Senate panel will have lunch with Tillerson at the State Department on Thursday, he said. Corker also made clear that when Congress takes up agriculture-related legislation next year he would push to reform current rules for distributing U.S. food aid, which make it more expensive and time-consuming to provide assistance after international crises. We could feed 4 to 6 million more people each year, he said, saying some interest groups pushing to keep current rules are extorting us. Yves Daccord, director-general of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, South Sudan, northeastern Nigeria and Somalia, plus Ethiopia and Kenya, may be among the worst in recent history. Were talking about 20 million directly affected, plus ... several other dozen millions possibly affected, Daccord told the hearing. The ICRC said on Wednesday the world has just a few months to save millions in Yemen and Somalia from starvation, as war and drought ruin crops and block deliveries of food and medical care. Many of Trumps fellow Republicans, as well as Democrats, objected to his first budget outline last week, which boosted military spending and cut international programs by 28 percent. They said humanitarian assistance and diplomacy are at least as important to security as weapons. Its essential that we maintain our international affairs budget, from this senators perspective, Republican Senator Todd Young told the hearing.  The budget as presented by Trump is unlikely to pass. Congress, not the White House, determines government spending.  Corker told reporters on Tuesday that he supported efforts to make State Department programs more efficient, but wanted a more thorough review of various programs. I think every department of government should be looked at continuously, and so Im all for us looking into that, Corker said. But I would like to walk through some of the areas that he (Tillerson) feels he wants to stress and obviously Congress ultimately will have the say (on the budget).

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""GARNER, Iowa/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Farmers in the U.S. agricultural heartland that helped elect Donald Trump are now pushing his administration to avoid a trade dispute with Mexico, fearing retaliatory tariffs that could hit over $3 billion in U.S. exports. The value of exports at risk is based on a Reuters analysis of a tariff list which Mexico used in a trucking dispute six years ago and which Mexican officials have said could serve as a model if President Trump sets new barriers to Mexican goods.      Pork producers contacted Trumps transition team soon after the Nov. 8 election to stress that tariff-free access to Mexico has made it their top export market by volume, said John Weber, president of the National Pork Producers Council. The council has sent the administration multiple letters, including one signed in January by 133 agricultural organizations, and is arranging for several hog farmers to fly to Washington next month to talk to officials. We just keep pounding them on how critical trade is to us, said Weber, who fears Mexico could revive the list of mostly agricultural products it successfully used to push Washington into letting Mexican truckers on U.S. highways in 2011.  Pork products topped that list and, if revived, the tariffs would apply to over $800 million of annual pork exports, according to data compiled by IHS Markits Global Trade Atlas. Well be the first to take the hit, Weber said.  The lobbying effort by U.S. businesses which rely on the Mexican market shows how Mexico can press its case in Washington despite having an economy 1/17 the size of Americas and relying on the U.S. market for nearly 80 percent if its exports. In Iowa, where pigs outnumber people seven to one, hog and grain farmer Jamie Schmidt voted for Trump in part on his promise to cut regulatory burdens for businesses. Now he and others who farm the flat, rich land around Garner, Iowa, worry about trade. Schmidt gets about half of his income from hogs, earning $4-5 for each of the 425 pigs he sells per week, usually to a Tyson Foods (TSN.N) packing plant in nearby Perry, Iowa.  Tariffs from Mexico could depress U.S. wholesale prices and wipe out his profits, Schmidt said. It would be devastating.  In December, after fears of a trade dispute fueled a deep peso MXN= slump, Mexico started mapping out U.S. states that are most reliant on its market, replicating the strategy it used in the trucking dispute, said two senior Mexican officials. Mexican officials also prepared briefs, seen by Reuters, on Mexicos own risks in a dispute, including losing much of its cost advantage in building cars, such as the Ford Fusion (F.N) made in Hermosillo, Mexico.  Reuters could not verify a complete list of products and states Mexico considered targeting this time around. But the countrys foreign minister said last month tariffs could target Iowa, which raises a third of U.S. hogs and exports about a quarter of its pork production, $100 million of which went to Mexico last year. The minister also said tariffs could aim at Wisconsin, the center of U.S. cheese production, and has singled out Texas for its notable trade surplus with Mexico. All three states voted for Trump in the 2016 election, with the president taking Iowa and Wisconsin by slim margins. Trump has accused Mexico of destroying U.S. jobs and has vowed to leave the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico if he cannot renegotiate better terms with Mexico. United States went from running a small trade surplus with Mexico in the early 1990s to a $63 billion deficit in 2016. Besides pork, cheese was also a top target in the trucking dispute in which Mexico retaliated with tariffs against rules that banned its trucks from U.S. roads. Some $200 million in current annual exports of cheese would be targeted if the tariff list were revived, according to the IHS database, which the U.S. government uses to measure the impact of trade disputes. The full tariff list would apply to $3.25 billion in current U.S. exports. John Holevoet, the director of government affairs at Wisconsins Dairy Business Association, said he has attended multiple meetings with Wisconsin federal lawmakers this year where risks of Mexican trade were discussed. Weber of the pork producers group said he believed the Trump administration gets it when it comes to the vulnerability of U.S. farm exports. Republican Congressman Steve King, who represents Iowas agriculture-focused fourth district, also pointed out that Iowas role as the first state to hold presidential primaries helps keep farm interests in Washingtons view. But King told Reuters he was worried the White House is still not taking trade risks seriously enough.  A possible 20 percent tax on Mexican imports, which White House spokesman Sean Spicer has said could also pay for Trumps proposed border wall, would cause a trade war, he said. King said he has been in contact with the White House on the matter but has yet to secure a one-on-one meeting with the president. Im making sure that here in Washington they know what this means.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - Bank lobbyists who opened the Trump era with great expectations for sweeping regulatory reform are privately striking an increasingly dismal tone as hopes for a quick and thorough rewrite of Dodd-Frank legislation dim.   Lobbyists say they are facing the reality that bank deregulation legislation will have to wait in line behind other bigger priorities such as healthcare reform and taxes. Its so disheartening, said one financial industry representative. I was excited for this year, and Im not anymore.  Even if Congress does look to rewrite the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, it is unlikely to muster enough votes in the Senate for the strong across-the-board overhaul industry leaders had hoped for, roughly a half dozen lobbyists told Reuters in recent interviews. Banks say that Dodd-Frank, which was conceived in response to the financial crisis, hobbles their growth. Among Dodd-Frank measures that banks want to see changed are the laws ban on proprietary trading, heightened oversight for some of the nations largest institutions, and stricter capital requirements. But they see short-term hopes for less stringent oversight by agencies like the Federal Reserve or the Securities and Exchange Commission stymied by the slow pace of Trump appointments for those agencies. The private dejection is in contrast to the upbeat message being delivered to some 1,500 bankers gathered in Washington this week for visits to Congress and speeches from policymakers at an American Bankers Association (ABA) conference.This year poses the biggest opportunity that we have seen in a long time to see some action on much-needed regulatory relief, Rob Nichols, the ABAs president and chief executive officer, said at the conference. Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, the Idaho Republican who will play a key role in any regulatory rewrite, has downplayed immediate expectations. He has emphasized that work in the Senate is slow going. Crapo announced Monday he wanted public input on proposals, underlining the deliberate pace of the panels work. And the Republican chairman of the House of Representative Financial Services Committee, Jeb Hensarling, has yet to move on his prepared Dodd-Frank overhaul. Industry advocates say they have hoped sympathetic regulators could take major steps absent Congressional action. But the Trump administration has lagged in naming people for key roles, such as Federal Reserves vice chair for supervision.  For instance, a sympathetic Federal Reserve could relax the living wills process applied to large banks to determine how they could be dissolved if necessary. And a friendlier SEC could act to roll back rules on industry-opposed measures like requiring companies to disclose the pay ratio between their CEO and the average employee. To be sure, there likely will be some action this year to help banks, though it is likely to be much more limited than the Trump transition team led bankers to expect when it said one day after the November election that it would dismantle Dodd-Frank. There appears to be bipartisan appetite for easing capital formation rules or reducing the regulations that smaller banks and credit unions must comply with. Republicans in Congress could attack specific parts of Dodd-Frank, such as gaining control over funding of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau - which was created to help guard individuals from fraud in mortgages, student loans and other financial products - through a budget process that would eliminate the need for Democratic support. Bankers preparing on Tuesday to head to Capitol Hill to make their case heard James Ballentine, a lobbyist for the ABA, emphasize the need to stay on message with stories about the impact of regulation on their banks. He noted they would be competing with wiretapping allegations, Federal Bureau of Investigation probes, Supreme Court confirmation hearings, and a massive healthcare push all at once. None of those things should be topics of your conversation when you go to meet with your members of Congress, he cautioned the conference crowd.

That opens up the possibility that some Republicans who vote in favor of the bill could face a primary challenge in next years congressional elections and may not be able to count on help from the Kochs and others.  Trump himself warned House Republicans in a meeting on Tuesday that their seats will be at risk next year if they do not support his healthcare bill, which would modify but not eliminate Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, Democratic former President Barack Obamas signature healthcare legislation passed in 2010. He warned us that there are consequences if we dont come together for us as a party and also for individuals, Representative Richard Hudson of North Carolina said after the meeting. He wasnt threatening in any way. He was just giving us a pretty clear warning. Trump also told Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, an outspoken critic of the bill, that he was coming after him, according to people in the meeting. Meadows later said the president was joking.  Some Conservatives believe the bill does not go far enough in dismantling Obamacare and have not been satisfied by the White Houses attempts to mollify them. NBC News reported on Tuesday that 26 House Republicans oppose the bill, which would leave House Speaker Paul Ryan short of the 216 votes he needs. No Democrat is expected to support the bill.  The conflict has created an odd dynamic: Trump, who ran as an outsider candidate siding with the Republican political establishment against the hard-line conservatives who were some of his most ardent supporters. At the same time, Trump has never been a favorite of libertarian conservatives such as the Kochs, or of groups such as the Club for Growth, because, among other things, he has never taken a strong stand on reining in federal spending. They opposed him during the Republican presidential campaign.  For them, the healthcare vote is a test of their continued relevance in a party seized by Trump. The Koch network spent an estimated $250 million on last years election. The Koch-run Americans for Prosperity, which has chapters in more than 30 states and boasts that it can deploy 3.2 million citizen activists, spent almost $14 million on the 2016 elections, according to federal records. Freedom Partners, another Koch entity which largely targeted Democrats with attack ads, spent $30 million.  Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity, would not say directly that Republicans who support the bill will face consequences next year, but noted, Members of Congress know how serious we take a vote like this.  James Davis, a spokesman for Freedom Partners, said network organizations will stand with principled lawmakers who will oppose the House healthcare proposal. Davis said the Koch network would spend between $300 million and $400 million ahead of the 2018 elections.  Last year, Americans for Prosperity and the Club for Growth targeted an incumbent House Republican, then-Representative Renee Ellmers of North Carolina, for being too close with House leadership and not holding the line on government spending. Ellmers lost in a primary fight.  House Republicans have been nervous about primary challenges since 2014 when Eric Cantor, then the majority leader, lost to a little-known conservative named David Brat.  Phillips said his organization last year was instrumental in getting Republican incumbents Senators Rob Portman of Ohio and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania re-elected. The two leading Koch groups sat out then-Senator Kelly Ayottes tight race in New Hampshire. Ayotte lost by 0.1 percent of the vote.  Groups such as the Kochs have been an important part of a coalition of outside Republican money, said Nathan Gonzales, a congressional political analyst in Washington. If that coalition falters, that could contribute to Democratic gains. But several lawmakers interviewed by Reuters were dismissive of the opposition by conservative groups.  For me, this healthcare bill is an absolute no-brainer, said Representative Devin Nunes of California, a close Trump ally. Any conservative group who opposes it, I dont even understand how they can categorize themselves as being a conservative group. The bills supporters have argued that voters are more likely to punish Republicans who do not act to replace Obamacare when given the chance. If it fails there are going to be a lot of people who are looking for work in 2018, said Representative Mike Conaway of Texas.  The political implications of the bill, though, remain largely unclear.  Even if it passes the House, the bill faces a difficult path in the Senate, where several conservatives have declared their opposition. Veteran House members recall in 2009, when then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi forced a vote on a bill that would cap carbon emissions. The bill did not pass the Senate, and many Democrats from coal states lost their seats in the 2010 elections for their votes. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An overhaul of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is highly unlikely to make it into this years legislative calendar, Congressional staffers say, possibly shifting the new administrations immediate focus to allowing the mortgage financing institutions to rebuild depleted capital. Fannie and Freddie stocks soared late last year when President Donald Trumps pick for Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said the companies that have been in government conservatorship since the 2008 financial crisis should be privatized. Hedge funds and other investors have been lobbying for the removal of government controls over the mortgage giants profits, which since 2012 have been transferred to the Treasury, and their eventual privatization. The shares dipped when Mnuchin seemed to backpedal on the privatization pledge during his January confirmation hearing and suffered another setback last month when a court rejected investors suit against the dividend transfers. Congressional staffers say the Senate Banking Committee has begun weekly bipartisan staff briefings on Freddie and Fannie reforms, but it is starting from scratch. The House Financial Services Committee is focused on other legislation, such as renewing the flood insurance program and rolling back parts of the Dodd-Frank financial reform, pushing the mortgage giants revamp down the to-do list, they say.  Instead, investors focus is shifting to how Mnuchin and Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Mel Watt, an Obama Administration holdover, will manage the dividends transfers.  Analysts expect the two institutions to make a full $10 billion dividend payment for the fourth quarter on March 31.  But investors will be looking for any indication from Watt or Mnuchin about whether they plan to allow the mortgage firms to retain profits later on and begin the slow recapitalization process. Though rebuilding an adequate capital buffer would take years - as long as two to three presidential administrations, according to one analyst - it would eventually allow Fannie and Freddie to leave government conservatorship, returning value to their investors.  Watt has warned the mortgage giants have a dangerously thin capital buffer. Mnuchin said during his confirmation hearing he favored finding a bipartisan fix. The two will likely wait for congressional inaction to become a de facto impasse before letting Freddie and Fannie hold on to their profits, analysts said, estimating a decision could be made two or three quarters out. Mnuchin has been out there talking about a bipartisan agreement, Heights Securities analyst Edwin Groshans told Reuters. That process will have to play out until it in essence fails. When that process fails, that would open the opportunity for Mnuchin and Watts to act. Tim Pagliara, an investor who founded Investors Unite, a coalition of more than 1,000 Fannie and Freddie investors, told Reuters he did not expect an imminent legislative fix and called the situation in Congress fluid. The focus is going to continue to be on the court cases and what the administration is going to do  and what theyve said theyre going to do, Pagliara added.  President Donald Trumps administration generally supports transferring government programs to the private sector. Trump donor John Paulson runs three hedge funds in which the president has invested and which held stakes in the mortgage institutions. Mnuchin, under the terms of a government ethics agreement, divested between $1 million and $2 million he had in Paulsons funds. Fannie and Freddie provide stability to the U.S. housing market by buying mortgages and bundling them into government-backed securities. During the financial crisis, they received $187 billion in government aid and by now have repaid $265 billion via dividend payments to the Treasury. FHFAs Watt has warned the payments have depleted the companies capital buffer and that by January 2018 they will have no ability to weather quarterly losses. Fannie was required by law to keep a minimum capital reserve of about $33 billion and Freddie $29 billion headed into the 2008 bailout, which suspended those requirements. Industry analysts, shareholders and advocacy groups - both conservative and liberal - all believe that the same 2008 bailout law gives Watt the authority to allow the companies to begin rebuilding capital, without waiting for Congress.

Trump is trying to win the first major legislative battle of his presidency. Pressure is growing on the businessman-turned politician to deliver as investors become worried that a failed healthcare push could also portend trouble for promised tax cuts and relaxed regulation that have propelled the market to record highs in recent months. In one of the few visits he has made to the U.S. Capitol since taking office two months ago, Trump told fellow Republicans in the House of Representatives on Tuesday morning they would face political problems for opposing the bill that takes apart Obamacare and partially replaces it. Later in the day, Trump hosted roughly a dozen lawmakers in the Oval Office to listen to their concerns. The president was really clear: He laid it on the line for everybody, House Speaker Paul Ryan, the leading proponent of the bill, told reporters. We made a promise. Now is our time to keep that promise. ... If we dont keep our promise, it will be very hard to manage this. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average lost over 1 percent in their worst one-day performances since before Trumps election victory on Nov. 8. The S&P financial index sank 2.87 percent, its biggest daily fall since June. You have this back and forth in Congress with the new healthcare plan and you have this belief that if the healthcare plan cant pass, then they cant move on to taxes. Theres this feeling that if things dont get done, then maybe what the market has been anticipating gets held up, said Mark Kepner, managing director at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.  Some conservative lawmakers believe the healthcare bill does not go far enough, while moderate Republicans worry that millions of Americans will be hurt by the dismantling of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, Democratic former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare legislation. (For a graphic on how U.S. healthcare stacks up under the ACA and AHCA click tmsnrt.rs/2n0ZMKf)  Party leaders hope to move the bill to the House floor for debate as early as Thursday. But the administration and House leadership can afford to lose only about 20 Republican votes or risk the bill failing since Democrats are united against it. Republican Representative Mark Meadows, chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said the roughly three dozen members have decided not to vote as a bloc. As many as 21 currently plan to vote no on the legislation, according to a CNN report. Republican Representative Walter Jones said Trump told lawmakers in the closed-door meeting at the Capitol that if the Republican bill does not pass, they would face political problems. Jones said he thought Trump meant lawmakers could lose their seats. Repealing and replacing Obamacare was one of Trumps main campaign promises and has been a goal of Republicans since it was enacted.  While Trump predicted that Republicans could face challenges in primary contests ahead of the 2018 midterm elections if they do not gut Obamacare, there is also danger to them in doing so. If the Republican bill is passed, millions of voters might lose their healthcare coverage. The Congressional Budget Office said last week that 14 million people would forfeit coverage under the House bill over the next year, although that number could change based on the most current version of the legislation.  Nancy Nielsen, associate dean for health policy at the University at Buffalos Jacobs School of Medicine, said Republican leaders were in a tough spot. It is a not-so-delicate balancing act, as they have to win over the most conservative House and Senate members without causing an outrageous backlash from voters now or in the next election, Nielsen said.  Democrats oppose the Republicans plan, saying it would hurt the elderly, poor and working families while giving tax cuts to the wealthy.     Republican leaders tweaked the bill this week to try to satisfy critics, mainly from their own party.  Republican chairmen for two key committees said late Monday they proposed more funding for tax credits, which conservatives have opposed, that would give the Senate flexibility to help older people afford health insurance. Additionally, Obamacares taxes would be eliminated in 2017 instead of 2018. The amendments also addressed Medicaid, which is the countrys largest health insurance program and covers about 70 million people, mostly the poor. The changes would allow states to implement work requirements for certain adults, an idea championed by many conservatives, and to decide how they receive federal funds.     Congressman Dan Donovan, who attended the Oval Office meeting on Tuesday, said Trump did more listening than directing. There was some political talk but no threats, he said. Donovan, who has not announced whether he will support the bill, cited people losing Medicaid and the defunding of womens healthcare provider Planned Parenthood as concerns in his New York district.  The Club for Growth, an influential conservative lobby group, said it would spend at least $500,000 for ads on television and digital platforms urging Congress members to defeat the bill. The Senate also will vote on the legislation, and more changes could be made. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that if the House approved a healthcare bill, he would try to bring it to the Senate floor next week.

In a speech before the National Republican Congressional Committee, Trump sprinkled his remarks with jokes, mocked his critics and expressed optimism that a healthcare proposal he backs will a survive a close vote in the House of Representatives on Thursday. Were doing well, Trump said of his efforts to persuade lawmakers to vote for the legislation. I think were going to have some great surprises. I hope that its all going to work out. Trumps first two months have been dominated by controversies from the firing of national security adviser Michael Flynn to tweets in which he accused his predecessor, Barack Obama, of wiretapping Trump Tower, a charge that FBI Director James Comey declared without foundation on Monday. Trumps approval rating has sagged to 37 percent, according to a Gallup poll this week. But Trump looked at the sunny side in his speech, saying he has taken steps to strengthen the U.S. border with Mexico and is eager to launch into a tax overhaul and pursue a deal to fund infrastructure once he overhauls Obamas healthcare law. He said his corporate tax effort would seek to clear the way for companies with profits overseas to bring back as much as $3 trillion to $5 trillion. The American people gave us clear instructions. Its time to get busy, get to work and get the job done, Trump said. The event raised a record $30 million for the committees that help pay for Senate and House election campaigns, more than the $20 million brought in at the same event a year ago. Trump made reference to a controversy that he has been embroiled in: his efforts to suspend temporarily people traveling from several Muslim-majority nations. His original Jan. 27 executive order applying to people from seven countries was blocked by federal judges. A subsequent rewritten version has been blocked as well.

Answering questions from senators during a more than 11-hour session on the second day of his Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing, Gorsuch said Trump never asked him to overturn the 1973 Supreme Court ruling legalizing abortion nationwide, saying if the Republican president had done so, I would have walked out the door. Trump promised during last years presidential campaign to appoint an anti-abortion justice who would overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling, which many conservatives want reversed. If confirmed by the Senate as expected to fill a 13-month-old vacancy, Gorsuch would restore the nine-seat court's conservative majority at a time when Republicans control Congress and the White House. But the conservative federal appeals court judge from Colorado repeatedly said he was beyond politics. (GRAPHIC - Confirming Gorsuch: How it works tmsnrt.rs/2mB9WPR)  When I became a judge, they gave me a gavel not a rubber stamp, Gorsuch said. I am my own man, he added. Trump has assailed the judiciary both as a candidate and since taking office on Jan. 20. He condemned federal judges who put on hold his two executive orders to ban the entry into the United States of people from several Muslim-majority countries, calling one a so-called judge and suggesting that blame for a future terrorist attack should go to the courts. When anyone criticizes the honesty or integrity or the motives of a federal judge, well I find that disheartening, I find that demoralizing, because I know the truth, Gorsuch said. When Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal asked if that included Trump, Gorsuch said, Anyone is anyone. Gorsuch previously made similar remarks in private to senators including Blumenthal, but Trump at the time accused Blumenthal of misrepresenting Gorsuchs comments. Trump indicated in a speech on Tuesday night that his approach was unlikely to change. The courts are not helping us, to be honest, its ridiculous. Somebody said I should not criticize judges, OK, Ill criticize judges, he said. Gorsuchs steady, measured performance during the marathon session, marked by a few moments of indignation under Democratic questioning, indicated he was on track for confirmation. Democrats probed Gorsuch on whether he would be willing to hold Trump accountable. Asked by Senator Patrick Leahy whether a president has the power to violate a law on surveillance of Americans, Gorsuch said, Nobody is above the law in this country, and that includes the president of the United States. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said if Trump resumes the use of waterboarding, a prohibited form of simulated drowning, on detainees, he may get impeached. Gorsuch said he would not speculate on whether Trump could be prosecuted if he authorized waterboarding, but repeated, No man is above the law. Republicans have praised Gorsuch, 49, as highly qualified for a lifetime appointment as a justice. Democrats, who have slim chances of blocking his nomination, have questioned his suitability, with some portraying him as favoring corporate interests and insufficiently independent from Trump. Chuck Grassley, the panels Republican chairman, asked Gorsuch whether youd have any trouble ruling against a president who appointed you. Thats a softball, Mr. Chairman, Gorsuch said. I have no difficulty ruling against or for any party, other than based on what the law and facts in the particular case require. And Im heartened by the support I have received from people who recognize that theres no such thing as a Republican judge or a Democratic judge. We just have judges in this country. I have offered no promises on how Id rule in any case to anyone. And I dont think its appropriate for a judge to do so, no matter whos doing the asking, Gorsuch added. Gorsuch refused to offer his opinion of Trumps travel ban, saying it was an ongoing case. When Leahy brought up a Republican lawmakers suggestion that Gorsuch would uphold Trumps ban, the nominee said, A lot of people say a lot of silly things and that lawmaker has no idea how Id rule. Gorsuch said rulings should be based on the law and not politics, adding, A good judge doesnt give a whit about politics or the political implications of his or her decision. Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse pressed Gorsuch to call for the anonymous financial backers behind the Judicial Crisis Network conservative legal advocacy groups $10 million campaign supporting his nomination to identify themselves, but the nominee refused, saying he would not engage in politics. But Gorsuch added, Nobody speaks for me. The seat Gorsuch was nominated to fill has been vacant since the February 2016 death of conservative justice Antonin Scalia. Some Democrats have said Republicans stole a Supreme Court seat last year when the Senate refused to consider former Democratic President Barack Obamas nominee to replace Scalia, appellate judge Merrick Garland. Questioned by Leahy, Gorsuch called Garland an outstanding judge, but refused to answer whether Obamas nominee had been treated fairly by Senate Republicans. Gorsuch said Supreme Court precedents deserve respect, even as he sidestepped answering whether he thought a series of contentious cases from the past had been decided correctly, including Roe v. Wade and cases on gun rights, political spending, religious rights and the ruling tipping the 2000 presidential election to Republican George W. Bush. Gorsuch did say that the issue of gay marriage, which the Supreme Court legalized in 2015, was absolutely settled law. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told reporters Gorsuch looked like hes playing dodge ball, saying the nominee has bent over backwards to avoid revealing anything. The confirmation hearing resumes on Wednesday morning and is scheduled to last through Thursday. Grassley has said the committee is likely to vote on Gorsuchs nomination on April 3. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the full Senate would vote on confirming Gorsuch before lawmakers mid-April recess. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Here are seven that offer insights into his legal views as he faces questioning this week in a U.S. Senate hearing on his nomination to become a Supreme Court justice. Frozen trucker         Transam Trucking Inc v. Department of Labor, 2016 (bit.ly/2aUK2Ub) This case shows, liberals say, that Gorsuch rules for employers at the expense of workers. In it, he dissented from a three-judge panel that ruled in favor of truck driver Alphonse Maddin. He was fired after he disobeyed a supervisor and abandoned his trailer at roadside after its brakes froze. The panel ruled he was wrongly terminated. Gorsuch disagreed. Chevron deference Gutierrez-Brizuela v. Lynch (2016) (bit.ly/2bLfVgE) In an immigration case, Gorsuch criticized the Chevron deference legal doctrine that says courts should defer to federal agencies on interpreting the law. Gorsuch said it concentrates federal power in a way that seems more than a little difficult to square with the Constitution. If the court were to roll back the doctrine, presidents would have less leeway to interpret the law when issuing regulations through agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency. Class clown     A.M. v Holmes, 2016 (bit.ly/29VN4Jy) Republicans say Gorsuch does not put politics above the law and follows his own path. In some criminal cases, he has come down hard on prosecutors or government officials, while also sometimes defying colleagues on the bench. In this case, he decried the handcuffing and arrest of a seventh-grade class clown in Albuquerque who refused to stop burping in class, saying the police officer involved should not have gotten immunity from suit. Paraphrasing Charles Dickens, he said the law is not as much of an ass as to allow for that.  No trespassing U.S. v Carloss 2016  (bit.ly/2nLGzw3) Standing up for homeowners property rights, Gorsuch dissented from a decision to admit evidence discovered by police officers who approached, and later entered, a home despite several No trespassing signs outside. He lampooned the idea that the government can knock on anyones door, at any time, saying homeowners might be surprised to learn that No trespassing signs have become little more than lawn art. Transgender rights Druley v Patton (2015) (bit.ly/2ntFcEV) In a ruling highlighted by liberal activists as a sign he may be hostile to gay and transgender rights, Gorsuch joined a ruling against a transgender Oklahoma state prisoner who claimed prison officials violated her rights by denying her adequate hormone therapy and housing her with men. The court rejected her claims, saying she had not proved she would be irreparably harmed without her requested hormone treatment.  Employee rights Hwang v. Kansas State University, 2014 (bit.ly/SsXD8J) In a case criticized by liberals, Gorsuch wrote the opinion when a three-judge panel ruled against Kansas State University professor Grace Hwang. She got six months of sick leave from the school when she was diagnosed with cancer. When she asked for more time, Kansas State refused. Hwang alleged illegal disability discrimination. Gorsuch said Hwang was a capable teacher and was legally disabled. But he wrote: Theres also no question she wasnt able to perform the essential functions of her job even with a reasonable accommodation. He said the law was not intended to turn employers into safety net providers for those who cannot work. Hwang has since died. Religious freedom Hobby Lobby v. Sebelius, 2013 (bit.ly/2func5k) Liberals say this case shows Gorsuch sides with corporations over people and favors religious liberty over other interests, including womens contraceptive rights. Retailer Hobby Lobby argued it should not have to provide insurance coverage for female employees birth control, defying a rule by the administration of former President Barack Obama. Gorsuch concurred in an opinion favoring the company and expressed sympathy for evangelical Christian business owners. The Supreme Court later upheld the decision for the company.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has written to the leaders of the U.S. Senate urging the ratification of Montenegro as the newest member of the NATO alliance, saying it is strongly in the interests of the United States. In a letter dated March 7 and seen by Reuters on Tuesday, Tillerson argued that Montenegros membership in the alliance would support greater integration, democratic reform, trade, security and stability among its neighbors. Moscow opposes any further expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and the delay in U.S. approval of Montenegros accession has fueled questions about whether President Donald Trumps administration and his Republican Party will stand up to Russia despite Trumps desire for better relations. The letter emerged amid a flap over the new secretary of states relationship with the alliance. Reuters reported on Monday that Tillerson planned to skip a meeting with NATO foreign ministers next month in order to stay home for a visit by Chinas president, while planning a visit to Russia later in April. On Tuesday, the administration reversed course and proposed new dates for the meeting, which had been set for April 5 and 6 in Brussels. Montenegro, a former Yugoslav republic with a population of 650,000, hopes to win the required approval of all 28 NATO allies in time to become a full member at a summit in May. By early this month, it had been approved by 24. NATO members see Montenegros accession as a way to counter Russias efforts to expand its influence in the Balkans. Objections from at least two Republican senators, Rand Paul and Mike Lee, have blocked a quick vote in the full U.S. Senate for months and Senate leaders have not scheduled a more time-consuming roll-call vote. Paul has questioned the wisdom of angering Russia and taking on the potential expense of approving NATO membership for a tiny country that could not play a significant role in defending the United States. In his letter to the Senates Republican majority leader, Mitch McConnell, and copied to Chuck Schumer, the chambers top Democrat, Tillerson said it would be immeasurably helpful if the Senate scheduled a floor vote to complete ratification procedures in time for Trumps participation in the May NATO summit. Montenegros participation in the May NATO Summit as full member, not as an observer, will send a strong signal of transatlantic unity, Tillerson added. It is strongly in the interests of the United States that Montenegros membership in NATO be ratified, he wrote. A spokesman for McConnell said on Monday that no vote had yet been scheduled. Montenegros NATO membership has already been approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Paul and Senator John McCain, one of the leading Russia hawks in the U.S. Congress, had a heated exchange about the issue in the Senate last week. McCain said Paul was working for Russian President Vladimir Putin by blocking a quick vote on Montenegro. Paul called McCain unhinged and past his prime.

(Reuters) - The U.S. government should have publicized the existence of a program that vacuumed up in bulk Americans telephone call data before its existence was leaked by former contractor Edward Snowden, the National Security Agencys deputy director said on Tuesday. Richard Ledgett, who is retiring next month, said in an interview with Reuters that disclosing the secret program would have been difficult. But, he said, doing so might have mitigated the damage done by Snowden. Thats one where I might have to say, yes, Ledgett said in his office at NSA headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland. Thats one where maybe it would have been less shocking when Snowden did what he did. Ledgetts comments, which echo the sentiments of some former top U.S. officials, come as the U.S. intelligence community is stepping up efforts to convince Congress to reauthorize other controversial surveillance programs. Those programs allow intelligence agencies to collect vast amounts of digital communications from foreigners living overseas, but incidentally scoops up the communications of an unknown number of Americans. The programs, authorized by Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, expire on Dec. 31 unless Congress takes action. Ledgett said that the NSA, whose mission is to intercept adversaries communications while protecting sensitive U.S. government networks, had learned from the Snowden experience. Were being very open about the (Section 702) program, and will be, he said. Privacy advocates have repeatedly demanded that the government share an estimate of how many Americans are ensnared by programs authorized under Section 702. Intelligence officials have declined to do so. But Ledgett, in remarks earlier Tuesday at a forum sponsored by the Aspen Institute, said yes when asked if an estimate would be provided before year end. Snowdens revelation of the bulk telephone data program - which captured information about calls such as the numbers and time stamp, but not their actual content - prompted congressional hearings and court battles. In 2015, Congress passed a law replacing it with a more limited system while installing new transparency measures over U.S. surveillance activity.  U.S. officials argued that the program was lawful, and aimed at finding violent militants or other adversaries in communication with allies inside the United States. In the 50-minute interview at the NSAs large campus outside Washington, Ledgett expressed concern about the vulnerability of U.S. critical infrastructure to cyber attack by another nation. All of the major cyber threat actors that we worry about have efforts in place, have that capability, he said. Can you take out a traffic system? Absolutely. Can you take out comm(unication)s systems? Absolutely. Can you take out gas and oil distribution, and energy distribution systems? Absolutely you can. ... Were more vulnerable than most. He also gave a small insight into the secret cyber battles playing out globally, around-the-clock.  In late 2015, he said, an unclassified U.S. government computer network was penetrated by another nation, and the NSA was called in to help. In the past, when an adversary realized they had been discovered, they would withdraw. Like a turtle, touch them and they pull in their shell, Ledgett said. What happened here was, they fought back. So it kind of became a hand-to-hand combat thing, he said. Wed remove their malware. They would deploy new malware, even though they knew we were in the system. They were just trying to get around us. He declined to name the attacker or the computer system involved.    ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Tillersons decision to miss his first meeting with NATO foreign ministers, set for April 5-6 in Brussels, unsettled European allies who worried it reopened questions about U.S. President Donald Trumps commitment to the alliance. Reuters exclusively reported on Monday that Tillerson would stay in the United States to attend Trumps expected April 6-7 talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Florida. U.S. officials also said Tillerson would visit Russia later in April. The alliance had offered to change the meeting dates so Tillerson could attend both it and the Xi talks but the U.S. State Department rebuffed the idea, a former U.S. official and a former NATO diplomat, both speaking on condition of anonymity, said on Monday. On Tuesday, State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the department put forward new dates for a meeting when Tillerson could come, noting that such a decision would have to be made by consensus among the 28 NATO members. We are certainly appreciative of the effort to accommodate Secretary Tillerson, Toner told reporters. We have offered alternative dates that the secretary could attend. He also sought to allay European concerns by saying that the United States remains 100 percent committed to NATO. It was not yet clear if the NATO meeting would be rescheduled to accommodate Tillerson. During his election campaign and on the eve of taking office in January, Trump called the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation obsolete, although he has since said he strongly supports the alliance. No matter how you spin it, this is unfortunate symbolism, said one senior European diplomat of Tillersons plan to skip the April 5-6 NATO Brussels meeting, saying it undid the work of Trumps vice president and defense minister, who visited NATO headquarters in February to provide reassurances after Trumps criticism of the alliance. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg was in Washington on Tuesday. Posing for photographs with Defense Secretary James Mattis, he declined to answer a reporters questions on what signal it sent that Tillerson did not plan to attend the meeting, according to a reporter who attended the session.     Some allies, particularly in the former Soviet bloc, are acutely sensitive to any sign of waning U.S. interest in their defense as they deal with a more assertive Russia. Concerns that Trump is too close to Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom the West has sought to isolate for annexing Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, made Tillersons expected visit to Brussels all the more pressing, European allies said.  Tillerson worked with Russias government for years as a top executive at Exxon Mobil Corp, and has questioned sanctions against Moscow that he said could harm U.S. businesses. We needed to hear his vision for the alliance, said a diplomat due to attend the April ministerial meeting. NATOs quarterly meetings are closed-door sessions over about two days in which governments discuss security strategies and approve top secret documents designed to guide the nuclear-armed alliance in areas ranging from training in Afghanistan to defenses against Iranian missiles. Given the U.S. role as the de facto head of the alliance, it is rare for the countrys top diplomat to miss a NATO meeting. The last time was during the Iraq war in 2003, when Colin Powell was forced to cancel at the last moment. Trump himself is expected in Brussels for a NATO summit in May, although the date is still under discussion. NATO has proposed holding that meeting on May 25, a NATO diplomat said. Several diplomats said they were unhappy that Tillerson had not offered to hold a NATO meeting in Washington later this week, given that most alliance foreign ministers and Stoltenberg will be there for a meeting of an international coalition against the Islamic State militant group. A State Department spokeswoman said on Monday night that all NATO members except Croatia would be at those talks. On Tuesday, Toner said Croatia would in fact attend, saying the department had made a late night gaffe and adding, in no way do we want to diminish Croatias valuable role within the alliance.

The hearing by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), created by the 35-nation Organization of American States (OAS) to protect human rights in the Americas, follows concerns over the impact of three executive orders signed by Trump, including plans to build a wall on the border with Mexico. The U.S. government has appealed a federal judges halt on Trumps ban on refugees and travelers from six predominantly Muslim countries. Trump said the ban was needed to protect the country from Islamist militants but immigration advocates said it discriminated against Muslims. Maria Isabel Rivero, a spokeswoman for the IACHR, said the United States advised the commission on Monday it would not attend the panel, which includes representatives from a number of regional human rights and immigration groups. If the member state doesnt want to be represented there is nothing we can do about it but the hearing goes ahead anyway, Rivero said. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said government lawyers felt it would not have been appropriate to discuss the executive orders while some are under review by U.S. courts. We did inform the IACHR of our inability to attend these particular hearings because of ongoing litigation around some of these executive orders, Toner told a conference call with reporters. We did not feel we could address concerns in an open hearing, he added. Marselha Goncalves Margerin, advocacy director at Amnesty International, said the lack of U.S. representation at the panel showed  a total disregard of its commitment to human rights. She said while it was not unprecedented that member states that are the focus of a hearing do not attend, the panel was an opportunity for the United States to explain the executive orders.  The U.S. has attended these hearings for the last eight years, said Goncalves Margerin. By failing to be present at this hearing, the U.S. joinsCuba and Venezuela in turning its back on people in the Americas who seek justice for human rights abuses.

The development posed another problem for Republican leaders in the U.S. House of Representatives and President Donald Trump, who are trying to win congressional approval of the wider bill, the first big legislative test for Trump since taking office. The provision would have allowed the Treasury Department to access data at the Department of Homeland Security to verify that healthcare tax credits went only to U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents, not to illegal immigrants. In a largely procedural move, it was dropped from the bill after the Senate Parliamentarian determined that the Senate Finance Committee, which handles tax credits under the bill, does not have purview over the Department of Homeland Security. Republican Representative Lou Barletta issued a statement on Monday evening, after the change was made, saying he could no longer support the bill, citing the obscure provision.  I am concerned that the bill lacks sufficient safeguards for verifying whether or not an individual applying for health care tax credits is lawfully in this country and eligible to receive them, said the Pennsylvania lawmaker. The provision had been a key issue for conservative groups  the Trump administration is trying to win over in its efforts to pass the bill known as the American Health Care Act, Trumps plan to repeal and partly replace Obamacare. Some conservatives have criticized the bill since Republican House leadership unveiled it earlier this month, dubbing it Obamacare Lite because they say it falls short in repealing Democratic former President Barack Obamas 2010 healthcare law. Republican leaders recrafted the bill on Monday in hopes of satisfying conservative and moderate critics. Trump visited Capitol Hill Tuesday seeking to win more support for the bill. Lauren Aronson, spokeswoman for the tax-writing House Committee on Ways and Means, said the bill keeps the underlying policies of Obamacare that specify only U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents are eligible for the tax credits. The bill was expected to go before the full House for a vote on Thursday. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Tillerson intends to miss what would have been his first meeting of the 28 NATO allies on April 5-6 in Brussels so that he can attend President Donald Trumps expected April 6-7 talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping at Trumps Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, four current and former U.S. officials said.  Skipping the NATO meeting and visiting Moscow could risk feeding a perception that Trump may be putting U.S. dealings with big powers first, while leaving waiting those smaller nations that depend on Washington for security, two former U.S. officials said. Trump has often praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Tillerson worked with Russias government for years as a top executive at Exxon Mobil Corp, and has questioned the wisdom of sanctions against Russia that he said could harm U.S. businesses. A State Department spokeswoman said Tillerson would meet on Wednesday with foreign ministers from 26 of the 27 other NATO countries  all but Croatia  at a gathering of the coalition working to defeat the Islamic State militant group. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg was due to have arrived in Washington on Monday for a three-day visit that was to include talks with U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis and to take part in the counter-Islamic State meetings. The State Department spokeswoman said Tillerson would not have a separate, NATO-focused meeting the 26 foreign ministers in Washington but rather that they would meet in the counter-Islamic State talks. After these consultations and meetings, in April he will travel to a meeting of the G7 (Group of Seven) in Italy and then on to meetings in Russia, she added, saying U.S. Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Tom Shannon would represent the United States at the NATO foreign ministers meeting. Representative Eliot Engel, the senior Democrat on the U.S. House of Representatives foreign affairs committee, said that  Tillerson was making a mistake by skipping the Brussels talks. Donald Trumps Administration is making a grave error that will shake the confidence of Americas most important alliance and feed the concern that this Administration simply too cozy with (Russian President) Vladimir Putin, Engel said in a written statement. I cannot fathom why the Administration would pursue this course except to signal a change in American foreign policy that draws our country away from western democracys most important institutions and aligns the United States more closely with the autocratic regime in the Kremlin, he added. A former U.S. official echoed the view.  It feeds this narrative that somehow the Trump administration is playing footsie with Russia, said the former U.S. official on condition of anonymity.     You dont want to do your early business with the worlds great autocrats. You want to start with the great democracies, and NATO is the security instrument of the transatlantic group of great democracies, he added. Any Russian visit by a senior Trump administration official may be carefully scrutinized after the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation on Monday publicly confirmed his agency was investigating any collusion between the Russian government and Trumps 2016 presidential election campaign. Trump has already worried NATO allies by referring to the Western security alliance as obsolete and by pressing other members to meet their commitments to spend at least 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense.  Last week, he dismayed British officials by shrugging off a media report, forcefully denied by Britain, that the administration of former President Barack Obama tapped his phones during the 2016 White House race with the aid of Britains GCHQ spy agency. A former U.S. official and a former NATO diplomat, both speaking on condition of anonymity, said the alliance offered to change the meeting dates so Tillerson could attend it and the Xi Jinping talks but the State Department had rebuffed the idea. The former diplomat said it was vital to present a united front toward Moscow. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization was created in 1949 to serve as a bulwark against the Soviet Union. Given the challenge that Russia poses, not just to the United States but to Europe, its critical to engage on the basis of a united front if at all possible, the diplomat said.

Christopher Ford, the National Security Councils senior director for weapons of mass destruction and counter-proliferation, said an examination of whether global nuclear disarmament is a realistic goal, would be conducted as part of a wider assessment called the Nuclear Policy Review. Ford also said the administration is reviewing responses to Russias deployment of nuclear-capable cruise missiles, which  Washington has denounced as a violation of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty. He downplayed the chances of new U.S.-Russia strategic nuclear arms cuts and said Washington would for now adhere to the Iran nuclear deal. In negotiations scheduled to open next week, the administration also will oppose - as the Obama administration did - an international treaty abolishing nuclear weapons, he said.  Ford, the only senior nuclear policy official appointed by President Donald Trump since he took office in January, spoke to a nuclear policy conference put on annually by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington-based think tank. His comments were the first by a top administration official that gave some indication of White House thinking on nuclear arms policy following a series of provocative comments and tweets that Trump made during and after the 2016 presidential campaign. NUCLEAR-FREE WORLD Trump has said that while would like to see nuclear weapons abolished, he wants the United States to have an unrivaled arsenal. He also said that the United States has fallen behind in its nuclear capabilities, even though it is in the midst of a 30-year, $1.3 trillion drive to modernize what most experts agree is the worlds most powerful nuclear force. Trump has supported the development of nuclear weapons by Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia, called for using nuclear arms against the Islamic State militant group and denounced the Iran nuclear deal as a disaster that he would rip up. Ford, a lawyer who has served as a Republican congressional staffer and a State Department arms control official, said he could not comment on many issues until the Nuclear Posture Review, or NPR, and other security and foreign policies reviews are completed. Experts expect the review to take as long as a year. He also stressed that the reviews may result in continuing to follow policies pursued by former President Barack Obama. But he said one issue being examined is whether the administration would reaffirm U.S. adherence to the goal of eventual global nuclear disarmament, an objective reaffirmed by Obama in an April 2009 speech in Prague. We are reviewing policy across the board, Ford said. That necessarily includes reviewing, among many other things, whether the goal of a world without nuclear weapons is in fact a realistic objective in the near-to-medium term in light of current trends in the international security environment. For decades, Ford said, there has been tension between the U.S. desire for nuclear arms abolition and the need to maintain a robust and effective arsenal that is capable of ensuring our security and that of our allies in Europe and the broader Asia-Pacific region against both nuclear and non-nuclear threats. An increasingly unstable world and growing threats to U.S. national security demand a review of whether traditional U.S. fidelity to that visionary end-state of abolition and demonstrating fidelity to it by pointing to rapid progress in reducing arsenals is still a viable strategy, he said. Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, a Washington think tank, said the United States is legally bound to that goal as a signatory of the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty, the bedrock accord of the international system for halting the spread of nuclear weapons.

Trump is trying to win the first major legislative battle of his presidency. Pressure is growing on the businessman-turned politician to deliver as investors become worried that a failed healthcare push could also portend trouble for promised tax cuts and relaxed regulation that have propelled the market to record highs in recent months. In one of the few visits he has made to the U.S. Capitol since taking office two months ago, Trump told fellow Republicans in the House of Representatives on Tuesday morning they would face political problems for opposing the bill that takes apart Obamacare and partially replaces it. Later in the day, Trump hosted roughly a dozen lawmakers in the Oval Office to listen to their concerns. The president was really clear: He laid it on the line for everybody, House Speaker Paul Ryan, the leading proponent of the bill, told reporters. We made a promise. Now is our time to keep that promise. ... If we dont keep our promise, it will be very hard to manage this. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average lost over 1 percent in their worst one-day performances since before Trumps election victory on Nov. 8. The S&P financial index sank 2.87 percent, its biggest daily fall since June. You have this back and forth in Congress with the new healthcare plan and you have this belief that if the healthcare plan cant pass, then they cant move on to taxes. Theres this feeling that if things dont get done, then maybe what the market has been anticipating gets held up, said Mark Kepner, managing director at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.  Some conservative lawmakers believe the healthcare bill does not go far enough, while moderate Republicans worry that millions of Americans will be hurt by the dismantling of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, Democratic former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare legislation. (For a graphic on how U.S. healthcare stacks up under the ACA and AHCA click tmsnrt.rs/2n0ZMKf)  Party leaders hope to move the bill to the House floor for debate as early as Thursday. But the administration and House leadership can afford to lose only about 20 Republican votes or risk the bill failing since Democrats are united against it. Republican Representative Mark Meadows, chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said the roughly three dozen members have decided not to vote as a bloc. As many as 21 currently plan to vote no on the legislation, according to a CNN report. Republican Representative Walter Jones said Trump told lawmakers in the closed-door meeting at the Capitol that if the Republican bill does not pass, they would face political problems. Jones said he thought Trump meant lawmakers could lose their seats. Repealing and replacing Obamacare was one of Trumps main campaign promises and has been a goal of Republicans since it was enacted.  While Trump predicted that Republicans could face challenges in primary contests ahead of the 2018 midterm elections if they do not gut Obamacare, there is also danger to them in doing so. If the Republican bill is passed, millions of voters might lose their healthcare coverage. The Congressional Budget Office said last week that 14 million people would forfeit coverage under the House bill over the next year, although that number could change based on the most current version of the legislation.  Nancy Nielsen, associate dean for health policy at the University at Buffalos Jacobs School of Medicine, said Republican leaders were in a tough spot. It is a not-so-delicate balancing act, as they have to win over the most conservative House and Senate members without causing an outrageous backlash from voters now or in the next election, Nielsen said.  Democrats oppose the Republicans plan, saying it would hurt the elderly, poor and working families while giving tax cuts to the wealthy.     Republican leaders tweaked the bill this week to try to satisfy critics, mainly from their own party.  Republican chairmen for two key committees said late Monday they proposed more funding for tax credits, which conservatives have opposed, that would give the Senate flexibility to help older people afford health insurance. Additionally, Obamacares taxes would be eliminated in 2017 instead of 2018. The amendments also addressed Medicaid, which is the countrys largest health insurance program and covers about 70 million people, mostly the poor. The changes would allow states to implement work requirements for certain adults, an idea championed by many conservatives, and to decide how they receive federal funds.     Congressman Dan Donovan, who attended the Oval Office meeting on Tuesday, said Trump did more listening than directing. There was some political talk but no threats, he said. Donovan, who has not announced whether he will support the bill, cited people losing Medicaid and the defunding of womens healthcare provider Planned Parenthood as concerns in his New York district.  The Club for Growth, an influential conservative lobby group, said it would spend at least $500,000 for ads on television and digital platforms urging Congress members to defeat the bill. The Senate also will vote on the legislation, and more changes could be made. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that if the House approved a healthcare bill, he would try to bring it to the Senate floor next week.

The court decided 6-2 to uphold a lower courts ruling that then-President Barack Obama exceeded his legal authority with his temporary appointment of an NLRB general counsel in 2011. In an opinion by Chief Justice John Roberts, the court said that under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, a person cannot serve as the acting head of a federal agency once the president nominates him or her to permanently serve in the role if it is a position that requires U.S. Senate confirmation. SW General Inc, a Scottsdale, Arizona-based private ambulance company and a subsidiary of Envision Healthcare Holdings Inc (EVHC.N),  had challenged the makeup of the NLRB as it sought to invalidate a board ruling that said it violated federal labor law by discontinuing bonus payments for longtime employees. The NLRB had argued that the laws restriction applied only to politically appointed first assistants who are first in line for acting positions when the heads of agencies leave office, and not to other officials. The ruling will give President Donald Trump and future presidents less flexibility in filling jobs that require Senate confirmation. Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented, saying the court ignored the fact that since the law governing vacancies was adopted in 1998, more than 100 people have served in acting roles while the U.S. Senate considered their nominations for permanent jobs.      The case focused on Obamas appointment of Lafe Solomon as the NLRBs acting general counsel to fill a vacancy in the job. The position requires Senate confirmation.     Obama nominated Solomon to fill the position permanently but also named him to fill in for former general counsel Ronald Meisburg, who resigned in 2010, in the interim while awaiting Senate action. Obama eventually withdrew Solomons nomination after it stalled for more than two years. The Senate ultimately confirmed Richard Griffin to the post in 2013.     SW General argued that Solomon should not have continued to fill the position on a temporary basis pending Senate confirmation, and the Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed.

What we will not do is a wholesale rollback of Dodd-Frank, he said at an American Bankers Association conference. That would be counterproductive... the law is working. Brown argued that significant changes to the 2010 law, which Republicans are seeking, would actually be problematic for the banking industry, even as he expressed a willingness to revisit specific parts of financial rules. Big changes create uncertainty, which is bad for everyone, he said. Shortly after President Donald Trump was elected, his transition team said it would dismantle the Dodd-Frank legislation. As president, Trump has voiced support for efforts by the Republican chair of the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, Jeb Hensarling, to rewrite the law. He has also directed agencies to review how Dodd-Frank regulations affect banks and other financial services companies.  Brown said he would not resist any and all efforts to revisit rules on the financial sector, expressing fondness for the new Republican chairman of the banking panel, Sen. Mike Crapo. The days of the Senate Banking Committee and its dysfunction and, lets just say less than busy work ethic, I hope is behind us, he said. We both have a commitment to work on issues we can come together on. On Monday, Crapo and Brown jointly announced they were seeking public input on policy changes that could foster economic growth. Efforts to relax certain rules, particularly for smaller community banks and credit unions, could be an area of common ground for the two. Crapo took control of the panel from Sen.

Its time for U.S. political elites to figure out if Russian hackers have once again got into State Department servers or if the threat to U.S. cyber security has an American origin after all, Zakharova said.  Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said later he was unaware of plans by Tillerson to visit Moscow. Skipping the NATO meeting and visiting Moscow could risk feeding a perception that Trumps administration may be prioritizing U.S. dealings with big powers over smaller nations that depend on Washington for security. Tillerson worked with Russias government for years in his former role as a top executive at Exxon Mobil Corp.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - FBI Director James Comey on Monday confirmed for the first time that the bureau is investigating possible ties between Republican Donald Trumps presidential campaign and Russia as Moscow sought to influence the 2016 U.S. election. Comey and Admiral Mike Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, made clear that their investigation of Moscow and Novembers U.S. elections could last for months. Appearing before a congressional panel, Comey also publicly challenged Trumps claim that former President Barack Obama wiretapped his 2016 campaign headquarters in Manhattans Trump Tower. The two officials spent 5-1/2 hours before the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee in testimony marked by starkly partisan divides between the panels majority Republicans and Democrats. Comey refused to back away from his claim that Russian President Vladimir Putin did not simply want Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to lose the election; he wanted Donald Trump to win. Trump created a controversy in early March when he tweeted without giving evidence that Obama had wiretapped his campaign while the businessman competed against Clinton. With respect to the presidents tweets about alleged wiretapping directed at him by the prior administration, I have no information that supports those tweets, Comey said. Leon Panetta, a former U.S. defense secretary and CIA director during the Obama administration, said in an interview that Trump should acknowledge that he made a mistake, apologize to President Obama. The committee is one of several in the U.S. Congress  investigating whether Russia tried to influence the election, mostly by hacking Democratic operatives emails and releasing embarrassing information. Russia denies the allegations.  Comey confirmed the FBI has been investigating since July possible Russian efforts to interfere in the election, including any cooperation between Trumps campaign and Moscow. He said that while the Russian government wanted to hurt Clintons campaign and help Trumps, intelligence agencies made no judgment on whether the efforts influenced the outcome. Comey gave no details of the classified investigation and said the fact that it exists does not mean charges would be filed. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia tried to help Trump by hacking leading Democrats. I think that was a fairly easy judgment for the (intelligence) community, he said. Putin hated Secretary Clinton so much that the flip side of that coin was he had a clear preference for the person running against the person he hated so much.         Asked about Comey, White House spokesman Sean Spicer read a series of quotes from officials - some from the Obama administration - who have said they have seen no signs of collusion between Trumps campaign and Russia. In a tweet before the hearing, Trump wrote: The Democrats made up and pushed the Russian story as an excuse for running a      terrible campaign. Spicer said he was unaware of any White House official being under investigation by the FBI. Trump has frequently urged better relations with Russia, which has been at odds with the United States over Ukraine and the Syrian civil war.  Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee, detailed activities by Trump associates with ties to Russia, including former campaign manager Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn, who was forced out as Trumps national security adviser after talking to the Russian ambassador and then misrepresenting the conversation to Vice President Mike Pence.  Is it possible that all of these events and reports are completely unrelated and nothing more than an entirely unhappy coincidence? Yes, it is possible, Schiff said. But it is also possible, maybe more than possible, that they are not coincidental, not disconnected and not unrelated. Trumps March 4 tweet about wiretapping pulled attention away from the claims of Russian election interference. He issued his tweet two days after Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who met with Russias U.S. ambassador at least twice last year, said he would recuse himself from any investigation of the matter. The White House has contended in recent days that Trumps claim of wiretapping referred to general surveillance of the campaign. The White House has not provided evidence of surveillance of any kind. Let me be clear: We know there was not a physical wiretap on Trump Tower. However, its still possible that other surveillance activities were used against President Trump and his associates, said Representative Devin Nunes, the committees Republican chairman. Last week, Trumps spokesman cited a media report that British intelligence was behind the surveillance, prompting ridicule in London. Rogers said the allegation had strained relations with London. I think it clearly frustrates a key ally of ours, Rogers said. Comey warned that Russia would attempt to influence the next U.S. presidential election in 2020 and perhaps congressional elections next year.  Theyll be back in 2020. They may be back in 2018. And one of the lessons they may draw from this is that they were successful because they introduced chaos and division and discord and sowed doubt about the nature of this amazing country of ours and our democratic process, he said. Clintons fellow Democrats feel Comey played an inappropriate role in the 2016 presidential contest by issuing a statement shortly before Election Day reviving an investigation of Clintons use of a private email server. Then, just two days before the election, Comey announced the FBI was sticking by a decision made months earlier that no criminal charges were warranted.

The state Senate in Annapolis, which like the lower house of the General Assembly is controlled by Democrats, has yet to consider the bill, and Republican Governor Larry Hogan issued a statement vowing to veto the measure if it reached his desk. This legislation would interfere with our state and local law enforcements ability to cooperate with federal law enforcement authorities, Hogan said. Supporters say the measure, which cleared the House of Delegates on a largely party-line vote of 83-55, is designed in large part to maintain the trust of immigrant communities in local law enforcement and government agencies. It would prohibit state and local police officers from stopping, arresting, searching or detaining an individual for purposes of suspected immigration violations.  It would also bar police from honoring administrative detainer requests from federal immigration authorities seeking to keep jailed individuals in custody after they should otherwise be released on bond. Other provisions would require the state attorney general to issue guidelines to public schools, courthouses and hospitals on limiting immigration enforcement in those places. And it would restrict state funds from being used to create a registry of people on the basis of immigration status, nationality, religion or ethnic origin. The measure follows in the footsteps of dozens of municipalities and local jurisdictions across the country that have declared themselves sanctuary cities, including San Francisco, Chicago, Boston, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Seattle and Washington. So far no such statewide designations have been enacted. Republican President Donald Trump in January signed an executive order seeking to withhold federal funds from local governments that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities.  At the time, he said local jurisdictions put U.S. citizens at risk by releasing criminals who should be deported and who, in some cases, commit additional offenses after being released from jail.

Abadis remarks followed his first face-to-face meeting at the White House with Trump, who took office on Jan. 20 pledging a new strategy to defeat the hardline militant group that seized large swaths of Iraq and Syria in 2014. Even before Trump took office, Iraqi forces recaptured a string of major cities from Islamic State, shrank the militant groups finances and significantly stemmed the flow of foreign fighters, all with the support of U.S.-led coalition air strikes and military advisers.  Abadi said Trump appeared more enthusiastic about battling Islamist extremists than Barack Obamas administration had been. I think theyre prepared to do more to fight terrorism and be more engaged, Abadi told a forum in Washington hours after his meeting with Trump, adding he had been told U.S. support will not only continue but will accelerate.   But of course we have to be careful here, Abadi said. We are not talking about military confrontation as such. Committing troops is one thing, while fighting terrorism is another thing.  Abadi, who leads the Shiite majority government in Baghdad, said it would be crucial to win over the local population in Sunni-dominated Mosul to achieve lasting peace. A White House statement about the meeting said both Trump and Abadi agreed that terrorism cannot be defeated by military might alone, and the two leaders called for deepening commercial ties, including in the energy sector. At the forum, Abadi called for more financial contributions from the international community. We (would) love to see more funds so that we can quickly (regain) prosperity and stabilization in these areas, he said. Abadi spoke as Iraqi forces made steady progress in seizing back Mosul, Iraqs second largest city, from Islamic State, which officials expect will become a more classic insurgency once it loses its last major strongholds. In a sign of the threat, a car bomb killed at least 23 people and wounded more than 45 in a mainly Shiite southern district, police and medical sources said. There was no claim of responsibility, but Islamic State has carried out similar attacks in Baghdad and other cities as its hold on Mosul weakens.  Earlier in the day, as the two men met, Trump told Abadi that he knew his forces were fighting hard. Its not an easy job, Trump said. Its a very tough job. Your soldiers are fighting hard. I know Mosul is moving along. ... We will figure something out. Our main thrust is we have to get rid of ISIS. Were going to get rid of ISIS. It will happen. Its happening right now, Trump added, using an acronym for Islamic State. Asked whether he had seen the Trump administrations plan to wipe out Islamic State, Abadi said: I havent seen a full plan. I know there is a plan. I havent seen it. Abadi is in Washington this week ahead of a gathering of world leaders of a coalition fighting Islamic State.  In many ways, his visit comes at a high point for him after successfully appealing to Trump to remove Iraq from a list of countries included in a revamped travel ban. Trump decided this months revised order temporarily banning the entry of travelers from several Muslim-majority nations would not include Iraq because of its cooperation with the United States. Both the initial Jan. 27 travel ban and the revised version have been blocked by federal courts. Detractors argue the ban discriminated against Muslims in violation of the U.S. Constitutions guarantee of religious freedom. Trump says the measure is necessary for national security to protect the country from terrorist attacks. I thank you for removing Iraq from the presidential order ... this was a positive response to the Iraqi request that betters the relationship with Iraq and the value of Iraq as far as Iraqi-American relations, Abadi told Trump.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Some Republican lawmakers appear to be reassessing whether to make changes to a surveillance law that allows broad snooping of Internet communications, citing concerns over the handling of classified intercepts after leaks of conversations between Russian officials and American associates of President Donald Trump. The law, known as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, allows U.S. intelligence agencies to collect vast amounts of communications from foreigners, but often incidentally scoops up the communications of Americans. Until recently most Republicans have been quick to defend Section 702 and Congress had been expected to renew it without major changes before it expires at the end of the year. Though long criticized by privacy advocates, a new front of potential opposition to Section 702 has emerged as Republicans sputter about what they view as politically motivated leaks by the agencies amid probes of any collusion between the Russian government and Trumps 2016 presidential election campaign.  The tensions burst into full view on Monday at a U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee hearing, during which FBI Director James Comey confirmed his agency was investigating those ties.  Republican Representative Tom Rooney told Comey and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers, who also testified, that concern over leaks would undermine support for Section 702, even though it appears to not have led directly to the leaks Republicans are fuming over. When we try to retain this tool this year and try to convince some of our colleagues that this is really important for national security and somebody in the intelligence community says, You know what, the hell with it, Im going to release this persons name because Im going to get something out of it, were all going to be hurt by that, Rooney said as he removed his glasses in apparent exasperation. While Democrats on the committee focused their questioning of Comey and Rogers on whether Trump aides may have suspicious ties to Russian officials, Republicans repeatedly redirected the conversation to focus on whether enough safeguards were in place to prevent leaks about Americans. U.S. intelligence agencies accused Moscow of attempts to influence the election in favor of Republican Trump, in part by hacking emails of Democratic Party operatives. Russia denies the allegations. Trump has criticized the intelligence agencies and has denied he has had anything to do with Russia. Section 702 surveillance is intended to apply only to foreigners living overseas. Elaborate rules govern incidental coverage of Americans, but the information can sometimes be used  nonetheless. Privacy advocates have said that communications belonging to as many as tens of millions of Americans could be caught up in the searches. Despite the concern about leaks, a White House official told Reuters earlier this month that the Trump administration favored a reauthorization this year of the expiring portions of the FISA without any changes to address privacy concerns. On Monday, several Republicans sought to directly link media reports revealing that Trumps former national security advisor, Michael Flynn, exchanged calls during the presidential transition with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak about sanctions to the debate about Section 702.  Flynn had told Vice President Mike Pence he did not speak to Kislyak about sanctions, an assertion contradicted by news articles, which cited transcripts of surveillance intercepts and led to Flynns ouster. Comey and Rogers both said that Section 702 surveillance was unrelated to how intercepts of Flynns calls were collected or leaked to the press, and that such information would have most likely been gathered under a different part of FISA or a wholly separate authority. That is a distinction that doesnt make a difference to people watching on television, Representative Trey Gowdy responded, adding that renewal of Section 702 was in jeopardy if we dont get this resolved. The hearing echoed conversations that took place during a closed meeting with senior intelligence officials this month with the House Judiciary Committee, which is expected to take the lead on writing legislation that will seek reform and renewal of Section 702.  Two sources familiar with the meeting said several lawmakers sought clarity on how many intelligence officials had access to classified surveillance information but were frustrated by the lack of clear answers. Rogers said Monday that 20 people at NSA, including himself, possessed the authority to unmask Americans whose communications are ensnared via foreign intelligence programs. A select few officials at other agencies also have the authority, including some at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice and the CIA. Section 702 enables sweeping surveillance programs known as Prism and Upstream, which were revealed publicly in 2013 by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. Prism gathers messaging data from Alphabet Incs Google , Facebook Inc , Microsoft Corp, Apple Inc and other major tech companies that is sent to and from a foreign target under surveillance. Upstream allows the NSA to copy Web traffic flowing along the internet backbone located inside the United States and search that data. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Neil Gorsuch, President Donald Trumps U.S. Supreme Court nominee, on Monday emphasized the need for judicial independence even as Trump castigates jurists who have ruled against him, while Democrats questioned whether he would rule against abortion rights and gun control while favoring corporations. With the ideological balance of the Supreme Court at stake, the Senate Judiciary Committee opened its confirmation hearing for Gorsuch, a conservative federal appeals court judge from Colorado. Republicans praised Gorsuch, 49, as highly qualified for a lifetime appointment as a justice. I think were off to a good start, Republican Chuck Grassley, the committees chairman, said afterward, with senators getting their first shot at questioning Gorsuch on Tuesday. Committee Democrats noted Gorsuch has the chance to join the court only because Senate Republicans last year refused to consider Democratic former President Barack Obamas nomination of federal appellate judge Merrick Garland. Despite slim chances of blocking his nomination in the Republican-led Senate, Democrats raised questions about Gorsuchs suitability for the job. Our job is to determine whether Judge Gorsuch is a reasonable, mainstream conservative or is he not, said the panels top Democrat, Dianne Feinstein. Speaking publicly for the first time since Trump nominated him on Jan. 31, Gorsuch defended his judicial record in the face of Democratic criticism of his rulings.  Gorsuch, speaking mostly in generalities that could not cause him any trouble, emphasized the need for neutral and independent judges to apply the law, warned against judicial overreach, and referred to the modest station we judges are meant to occupy in a democracy. If judges were just secret legislators, declaring not what the law is but what they would like it to be, the very idea of a government by the people and for the people would be at risk, Gorsuch said in comments in harmony with conservative criticism of unelected activist judges. Gorsuch, a cool-headed and amiable jurist, gave Democrats very little ammunition to use against him, although there could be more drama when he takes questions. The hearing could last four days, providing classic Washington political theater. Grassley said the panel is likely to vote on the nomination on April 3, with the full Senate vote likely soon after. If Gorsuch is confirmed by the Senate, as expected, he would restore a narrow 5-4 conservative court majority. The seat has been vacant for 13 months, since the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia in February 2016. Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal underscored the importance of judicial independence at a time when Trump has excoriated federal judges who have ruled against him on matters including two executive orders, put on hold by courts, to block people from several Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States. Blumenthal said it was not idle speculation to suggest the Supreme Court might be asked to enforce a subpoena against Trump, citing FBI Director James Comeys testimony before Congress on Monday confirming an ongoing investigation into alleged collusion between Trumps presidential campaign and Russia.  Republican Ted Cruz said there is no reason for Gorsuch to be questioned about Trump, noting that previous nominees have not had to speak about allegations made against the president who nominated them. Democrats highlighted cases on which Gorsuch has ruled and questioned the influence of conservative interest groups in advising Trump on his selection. Feinstein emphasized abortion. Conservatives have long opposed the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling legalizing abortion nationwide. Feinstein called that ruling and others since then buttressing abortion rights super precedents deserving special deference. Feinstein cited two Gorsuch legal opinions in which she said he argued in favor of making it harder to convict felons who possess guns. Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy said he was worried that Gorsuchs conservative method of interpreting the Constitution goes beyond being a philosophy and becomes an agenda that is anti-abortion, anti-environment and pro-business. Will you allow the government to intrude on Americans personal privacy and freedoms? Will you elevate the rights of corporations over those of real people? Will you rubberstamp a president whose administration has asserted that executive power is not subject to judicial review? Leahy said. Many Democrats contend Trumps party stole a Supreme Court seat by freezing out Garland. Your nomination is part of a Republican strategy to capture our judicial branch of government, Senator Dick Durbin told Gorsuch. That is why the Senate Republicans kept this Supreme Court seat vacant for more than a year and why they left 30 judicial nominees who had received bipartisan approval of this committee to die on the Senate calendar as President Obama left office. Gorsuch said he has tried to treat all who come to court fairly and with respect. I have decided cases for Native Americans seeking to protect tribal lands, for class actions like one that ensured compensation for victims of nuclear waste pollution by corporations in Colorado, he said. He also said he has ruled for disabled students, prisoners and workers alleging civil rights violations, and for immigrants who entered the country illegally. The courts ideological leaning could help determine the outcome of cases involving the death penalty, abortion, gun control, environmental regulations, transgender rights, voting rights, immigration, religious liberty, presidential powers and more. Republicans hold 52 of the Senates 100 seats. Under present rules, Gorsuch would need 60 votes to secure confirmation. If Gorsuch cannot muster 60, Republicans could change the rules to allow confirmation by a simple majority. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

In a memo to his staff on Monday, Schneiderman said he had hired former federal prosecutor Howard Master as senior enforcement counsel. Master was previously deputy chief of the criminal division of the U.S. attorneys office in Manhattan. He left the U.S. attorneys office on March 8.  In addition, Eric Haren, chief counsel to Sen. Dianne Feinstein, will join the office as special counsel and senior adviser on Monday, the memo said. Feinstein is the ranking member on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Master will lead complex affirmative investigations and litigation as well as advise on important investigations and prosecutions in the criminal division, Schneiderman wrote. A person familiar with the matter said that includes issues involving the Trump administration. Under U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, Master prosecuted public integrity cases, including the case against former New York assembly speaker Sheldon Silver on corruption charges. Bharara was fired by Trump earlier this month.  Haren has experience in civil rights, constitutional law, data privacy, and security and criminal law, Schneidermans memo said. He will provide experience in federal law and the internal workings of Congress and federal agencies, according to the memo. Master did not return a call for comment and Haren could not be reached. A White House spokeswoman did not immediately comment Monday. Schneiderman last month told reporters in Washington that his office was researching Trumps business investments. As a general matter, it is not sustainable for him to refuse to divest from all of these vast holdings and refuse to disclose what those holdings are, the attorney general said. It is so far beyond the bounds of anything that anyone has ever attempted that people are having trouble coming up with a clear legal strategy to address it, Schneiderman said.Schneiderman also has joined lawsuits against Trumps travel ban, which temporarily bars the entry of people from six Muslim-majority countries and refugees to the United States. In addition, he has been probing Trumps charitable foundation, which came under increased scrutiny following reports by The Washington Post of possible improprieties. In November, the foundation filed forms saying it violated a ban on so-called self-dealing. In 2013, Schneiderman brought a fraud case against Trump over Trump University, a series of real estate seminars. Trump agreed to settle that case in November.

Flood-mapping provides important details about where it is safe to build, whether flood insurance is needed and how to price coverage, Robert Hunter, director of insurance for the Consumer Federation of America, said in a statement. Slashing funding for the National Flood Insurance Programs (NFIP) retooling of U.S. flood maps will lead to relying on old maps and construction in areas that are now flood prone, or hiking insurance premiums to pay for new maps, Hunter said. The White House 2018 budget, unveiled last Thursday, would eliminate a $190 million discretionary appropriation for the National Flood Insurance Programs (NFIP) updating of U.S. flood maps and explore other more effective and fair means of funding flood mapping efforts. Costs for mapping have been shared by insurance policyholders and the federal government for the past 15 years, said a spokeswoman for the Federal Emergency Management (FEMA), which operates the flood insurance program.  The presidents budget directs us to explore avenues to shift these costs away from general appropriations, the FEMA spokeswoman said. Updating U.S. flood maps is seen by consumer and insurance industry advocates as a necessary step toward modernizing the U.S. flood insurance market. The White House 2018 budget is the first step in a long process that will be debated by U.S. lawmakers.  The NFIP, whose authorization is set to expire in September, could face other sweeping changes. The program is $24.6 billion in debt to the U.S. Treasury Department, the FEMA spokeswoman said.  Insurance industry groups are also concerned about the mapping proposal. Understandably, were all concerned about the potential to undermine efforts to modernize the maps, said Leigh Ann Pusey, president and chief executive officer of the American Insurance Association.

But interviews with ship-builders, unions and a review of public and internal documents show major obstacles to that plan.  The initiative could cost nearly $700 billion in government funding, take 30 years to complete and require hiring tens of thousands of skilled shipyard workers - many of whom dont exist yet because they still need to be hired and trained, according to the interviews and the documents reviewed.  Trump has vowed a huge build-up of the U.S. military to project American power in the face of an emboldened China and Russia. That includes expanding the Navy to 350 warships from 275 today. He has provided no specifics, including how soon he wants the larger fleet. (For graphics on projected strength of U.S. Navy, shipyard employment see: tmsnrt.rs/2n3vOr0)  The Navy has given Defense Secretary Jim Mattis a report that exploreshow the countrys industrial base could support higher ship production, Admiral Bill Moran, the vice chief of Naval Operations with oversight of the Navys shipbuilding outlook, told Reuters.  He declined to give further details. But those interviewed for this story say there are clearly two big issues - there are not enough skilled workers in the market, from electricians to welders, and after years of historically low production, shipyards and their suppliers, including nuclear fuel producers, will struggle to ramp up for years.  To be sure, the first, and biggest, hurdle for Trump to overcome is to persuade a cost-conscious Congress to fund the military buildup.  The White House declined to comment. A Navy spokeswoman said increases being considered beyond the current shipbuilding plan would require sufficient time to allow companies to ramp up capacity.  The two largest U.S. shipbuilders, General Dynamics Corp (GD.N) and Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc (HII.N), told Reuters they are planning to hire a total of 6,000 workers in 2017 just to meet current orders, such as the Columbia class ballistic missile submarine.  General Dynamics hopes to hire 2,000 workers at Electric Boat this year. Currently projected order levels would already require the shipyard to grow from less than 15,000 workers, to nearly 20,000 by the early 2030s, company documents reviewed by Reuters show.  Huntington Ingalls, the largest U.S. military shipbuilder, plans to hire 3,000 at its Newport News shipyard in Norfolk, Virginia, and another 1,000 at the Ingalls shipyard in Mississippi this year to fulfill current orders, spokeswoman Beci Brenton said.  Companies say they are eager to work with Trump to build his bigger Navy. But expanding hiring, for now, is difficult to do until they receive new orders, officials say.  Its hard to look beyond current orders, Brenton said.  Smaller shipbuilders and suppliers are also cautious.  You cant hire people to do nothing, said Jill Mackie, spokeswoman for Portland, Oregon-based Vigor Industrial LLC, which makes combat craft for the Navys Special Warfare units. Until funding is there ... you cant bring on more workers.  Because companies wont hire excess workers in advance, they will have a huge challenge in expanding their workforces rapidly if a shipbuilding boom materializes, said Bryan Clark, who led strategic planning for the Navy as special assistant to the chief of Naval Operations until 2013.  Union and shipyard officials say finding skilled labor just for the work they already have is challenging. Demand for pipeline welders is so strong that some can make as much as $300,000 per year, including overtime and benefits, said Danny Hendrix, the business manager at Pipeliners Local 798, a union representing 6,500 metal workers in 42 states.  Much of the work at the submarine yards also requires a security clearance that many cant get, said Jimmy Hart, president of the Metal Trades Department at the AFL-CIO union, which represents 100,000 boilermakers, machinists, and pipefitters, among others.  To help grow a larger labor force from the ground up, General Dynamics Electric Boat has partnered with seven high schools and trade schools in Connecticut and Rhode Island to develop a curriculum to train a next generation of welders and engineers.  It has historically taken five years to get someone proficient in shipbuilding, said Maura Dunn, vice president of human resources at Electric Boat.  It can take as many as seven years to train a welder skilled enough to make the most complex type of welds, radiographic structural welds needed on a nuclear-powered submarine, said Will Lennon, vice president of the shipyards Columbia Class submarine program.  The Navy envisioned by Trump could create more than 50,000 jobs, the Shipbuilders Council of America, a trade group representing U.S. shipbuilders, repairers and suppliers, told Reuters.  The U.S. shipbuilding and repairing industry employed nearly 100,000 in 2016, Labor Department statistics show. The industry had as many as 176,000 workers at the height of the Cold War in the early 1980s as the United States built up a fleet of nearly 600 warships by the end of that decade.  Apart from the labor shortage, there are also serious capacity and supply chain issues that would be severely strained by any plan to expand the Navy, especially its submarine fleet.  Expanding the Navy to 350 ships is not as simple as just adding 75 ships. Many ships in the current 275-vessel fleet need to be replaced, which means the Navy would have to buy 321 ships between now and 2046 to reach Trumps goal, the Congressional Budget Office said in a report in February.  The shipyards that make nuclear submarines - General Dynamics Electric Boat in Groton, Connecticut, and Huntingtons Newport News - produced as many as seven submarines per year between them in the early 1980s. But for more than a decade now, the yards have not built more than two per year.  The nuclear-powered Virginia class and Columbia class submarines are among the largest and most complex vessels to build. The first Columbia submarine, which is set to begin construction in 2021, will take seven years to build, and two to three additional years to test.  Retooling the long-dormant shipyard space will take several years and significant capital investments, but a bigger problem is expanding the supply chain, said Clark, the former strategist for the Navy and now a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments.  Makers of submarine components such as reactor cores, big castings, and forgers of propellers and shafts would need five years to double production, said a congressional official with knowledge of the Navys long-term planning.  We have been sizing the industrial base for two submarines a year. You cant then just throw one or two more on top of that and say, Oh here, dial the switch and produce four reactor cores a year instead of two. You just cant, the official said.  In his first budget proposal to Congress on Thursday, Trump proposed boosting defense spending by $54 billion for the fiscal 2018 year  a 10 percent increase from last year. He is also seeking $30 billion for the Defense Department in a supplemental budget for fiscal 2017, of which at least $433 million is earmarked for military shipbuilding.  A 350-ship Navy would cost $690 billion over the 30-year period, or $23 billion per year - 60 percent more than the average funding the Navy has received for shipbuilding in the past three decades, the Congressional Budget Office said.  Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, who will have a major say in approving the defense budget, said in a statement to Reuters that he supported Trumps vision to increase the size of the Navy to deter adversaries.  \""However, this is not a blank check,\"" he said.

The measures, outlined by Governor Ricardo Rossello in a letter to the board, include transferring to the university some of the savings generated by upcoming cuts to healthcare spending; allowing the university to earn revenue by training public employees; and working with the islands Science and Technology Trust to monetize the universitys patents, which UPR has historically struggled to do. The schools fate is a sensitive issue locally, with student groups threatening strikes over the cuts. UPRs budget has already been slashed by $348 million over the last three fiscal years, according to Rossellos letter.     Its troubles are entangled with broad economic distress in the U.S. territory, where almost half the population lives in poverty and unemployment is more than twice the U.S. average. As the island buckles under $70 billion in debt, public healthcare and pension systems edge toward insolvency, and locals flock to the mainland United States. The territorys finances are under the oversight of a federally appointed board, which some local critics condemn as  an extension of its colonial legacy. The boards recommended austerity measures have drawn protests on the island. The board has urged reduced government subsidies, staff cuts and tuition fee hikes at UPR, the 11-campus, 70,000-student university that has produced four of the islands ex-governors. The full $450 million cut would be a dramatic negative that would be difficult for the university to absorb, leaving it with a $157 million operating deficit, Moodys Investors Service said in a note on Monday.  Hiking tuition is hard given the highly price-sensitive student population, Moodys said. It added that while it expects UPR to make its $32 million debt payment on June 1, subsequent payments could be missed because the university stopped transferring money into trusts for debt payments under Puerto Ricos 2016 emergency debt moratorium. Some economists say the school has room to trim fat.  Arnaldo Cruz, co-founder of the San Juan-based think tank Center for Integrity and Public Policy, said UPR spends too much on non-faculty positions and that its 11 campuses are too many on an island of 3.5 million. We think that does not make sense on such a small island with a population in decline, Cruz said.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Trump tumbled more than 100 spots to No. 544 on the magazines 31st annual list, largely because of the impact of the slumping New York real estate market on his holdings.  Midtown Manhattan real estate is down; therefore, so is Donald Trumps fortune, the business magazine said in a statement. The developer-turned-politician, who ranked No. 205 last year, fell further behind to Bill Gates, the lists perennial leader.  Gates, the philanthropic co-founder of Microsoft Corp, was followed this year by Berkshire Hathaway Inc Chairman Warren Buffett at No. 2 and Amazon.com Inc founder Jeff Bezos at No. 3. While Trumps net worth slipped, more people were qualifying for the list. This year Forbes ranked a record 2,043 billionaires. Booming stock markets, higher commodities prices and plain old-fashioned entrepreneurship helped make this a record year in terms of wealth creation around the globe, Forbes editors Luisa Kroll and Kerry Dolan said. Trumps current $3.5 billion net worth compares with $3.7 billion in October, when Forbes published its list of the 400 wealthiest Americans and a month before his Election Day upset against Democrat Hillary Clinton. While campaigning for the Republican presidential nomination in May, Trumps team filed a personal financial disclosure form that said his net worth was more than $10 billion.  Critics have said he has inflated the true value of his wealth, saying his tax returns would provide a more accurate snapshot of his financial status.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Donald Trumps outspoken doubts about climate change and his administrations efforts to roll back regulation to combat it have stirred a sleepy faction in U.S. politics: the Republican environmental movement.  The various groups represent conservatives, Catholics and the younger generation of Republicans who, unlike Trump, not only recognize the science of climate change but want to see their party wrest the initiative from Democrats and lead efforts to combat global warming.  Conservative green groups such as ConservAmerica and republicEn, along with politically neutral religious groups such as Catholic Climate Covenant and bipartisan groups such as the Citizens Climate Lobby, have ramped up efforts to recruit more congressional Republicans to work on addressing climate change since Trumps election. Conservative environmental advocates promote what they call free enterprise solutions to climate change, like a carbon tax. That stands in contrast to the approach of liberal environmentalists under former President Barack Obama, who backed bans on certain kinds of oil drilling and regulations aimed at discouraging petroleum use. But whatever their differences, the conservative groups say they have an important role to play. Conservatives now have a chance to earn back the trust of Americans on environmental issues, said Alex Bozmoski, director of strategy for republicEn. They can lead in a completely different direction that actually grows the economy while cutting greenhouse gasses. The activists efforts have not swayed anywhere near a majority yet on Capitol Hill. Only 20 or so of the 237 Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives have spoken out on climate change this year. But they hope to build a big enough bloc in Congress, or enough influence at the White House, to temper Trumps agenda. Lobbying has yielded some early results: a pro-environment voting bloc in Congress, the Climate Solutions Caucus, for example, has signed on more Republicans in the last two months than in it had in the final year of Obamas administration - its first year in existence. Urged on by a coalition of conservative and religious groups, including the Catholic Climate Covenant, a handful of additional Republicans have also signed a congressional resolution pledging to address climate change.  The resolution was non-binding, but it represented a direct challenge to Trumps climate stance, a high-profile signal of dissent within his party. Its like Alcoholics Anonymous  youve got to first recognize youve got a problem before you can deal with it, said Mark Sanford, a Republican Congressman from South Carolina who signed the resolution. Melinda Pierce, legislative director for the more than 100-year-old Sierra Club environmental group, said she was happy to see enlightened Republicans beginning to act on climate change. But Pierce added, Legislative action is a long time away based on, at least, the Republican leadership.   Pierce also said she was skeptical of free enterprise solutions advocated by conservative environmental groups like republicEn, which she said sounded to her like we have to pay them not to pollute. Jose Aguto, associate director of the Catholic Climate Covenant, said Republicans are the only major political party in the world not convinced by climate change. Once they accept the reality and science of climate change, we will have reached a tipping point in the political will for solutions. Trump has raised the hackles of many environmentalists since taking office. He has overturned several Obama-era environmental regulations, and last week he proposed slashing the Environmental Protection Agency budget by 31 percent. During his presidential campaign Trump called climate change a hoax and vowed to pull the United States out of the Paris accord, a global pact to fight it  tapping into a well of Republican concern that the United States energy habits would be policed by the United Nations. But Republican bias against climate science is out of step with the majority of Americans. A Reuters/Ipsos poll shows a majority of Republican supporters agree the United States should play a leading role in combating climate change. It shouldnt surprise anyone that more and more Republicans are interested in this issue, said Republican Representative Carlos Curbelo of Florida. This issue was regrettably politicized some 20 or so years ago, and we are in the process of taking some of the politics out. On Feb. 8, representatives from a newly formed group of Republican statesmen, the Climate Leadership Council, including former Treasury secretaries Henry Paulson and James A. Baker, met with senior administration officials to push a carbon tax. We got a very respectful hearing, said the councils CEO, Ted Halstead. Weve also been meeting with Republicans on the Hill and have found open minds. The White House did not comment on the meetings. Billionaire Republican donor and environmental advocate Andy Sabin, meanwhile, said he has been speaking directly with White House officials in hope of becoming Trumps unpaid climate change adviser  modeled on the role of fellow billionaire Carl Icahn in advising Trump on regulation.  Focusing on health concerns would be the most effective way to get Trump to try to slow climate change, said Sabin, a precious metals magnate. When asked about the chances of Sabin getting the position, a White House spokeswoman said, We dont have an announcement at this time. Republican Senator James Inhofe incurred public ridicule two years ago after marching into the Capitol Building with a snowball, claiming the cold weather disproved Obamas climate change claims. This year, republicEn used the incident as part of a humorous rallying call on Valentines Day. Volunteers delivered greeting cards to lawmakers quoting Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, in his former role as chief executive officer of Exxon, declaring climate change to be a serious risk warranting thoughtful action.  Along with the card were coconut-coated cakes called Sno Balls, a photograph of Inhofe and a poem: Roses are red, snowballs are white, together well get the solution right.

Ryan said Republican leaders still planned to bring the healthcare bill to a vote on the House of Representatives floor on Thursday. Speaking on the Fox News Sunday television program, he said leaders were working to address concerns that had been raised by rank-and-file Republicans to the legislation. Republicans remain deeply divided over the healthcare overhaul, which is President Donald Trumps first major legislative initiative. It aims to fulfill his campaign pledge to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, the signature healthcare program of his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama. Democrats say the Republican plan could throw millions off health insurance and hurt the elderly, poor and working families while giving tax cuts to the rich. We think we should be offering even more assistance than the bill currently does for lower-income people age 50 to 64, Ryan, the top Republican in Congress, said of the tax credits for health insurance that are proposed in the legislation. Ryan also said Republicans were working on changes that would allow federal block grants to states for Medicaid and permit states to impose a work requirement for able-bodied Medicaid recipients. Trump told reporters in a brief conversation aboard Air Force One that he had meetings about healthcare reform in Florida at the weekend and that the effort to sell the proposal was going well. He has been wooing lawmakers to vote for the bill and won the backing of a dozen conservative lawmakers on Friday after an Oval Office meeting in which the president endorsed a work requirement and block-grant option for Medicaid. Trump is set to meet Ezekiel Emanuel, a health policy special adviser under Obama who helped shape the Affordable Care Acton, at the White House on Monday, along with Ryan and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price. Block grants would give states a set amount of money to cover people on the Medicaid program and provide flexibility in spending decisions. However, there is no guarantee funding would keep up with future demands. While Ryan said he felt very good about the health bills prospects in the House, a leading conservative lawmaker, Representative Mark Meadows, told the C-Span Newsmakers program that there were currently 40 Republican no votes in the House. Republicans hold a majority in the chamber but cannot afford to have more than 21 defections for the measure to pass.  Meadows and two other Republican opponents of the bill, Senators Mike Lee of Utah and Ted Cruz of Texas, met at Trumps Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Saturday negotiating with the presidents team, trying to fix this bill, Cruz told CBS Face the Nation. North Carolina Republican Meadows said the changes being considered for the Medicaid program would not go far enough if they left it up to states to decide whether to put in place a work requirement. Price acknowledged the tough negotiations, telling ABCs This Week: Its a fine needle that needs to be thread, theres no doubt about it.   The healthcare bill would face significant challenges in the Senate even if it were to pass the House. Senator Tom Cotton, a conservative Arkansas Republican, said the bill would not reduce premiums for people on the private insurance market. Its fixable, but its going to take a lot of work, Cotton said on CNNs State of the Union. Moderate Republicans have also expressed concerns about the bill, and their worries are often not the same as that of conservatives. Speaking on NBCs Meet the Press, Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine worried the bill would harm older Americans, and shift Medicaid costs to states - something critics say a block-grant approach would only make worse. Collins said coverage issues must also be dealt with, citing a report from the Congressional Budget Office that said 14 million people would lose health coverage under the House bill over the next year and 24 million over the next decade. Affordability has been one of the bigger concerns that insurers and hospital groups have raised about the legislation. To the extent that a change in tax credits makes healthcare more affordable for some people, insurers and hospitals could stand to benefit. The BlueCross BlueShield Association emphasized the need for the replacement to be affordable when the draft of the healthcare bill was released earlier this month.

In 2015, a grand jury indicted Menendez on charges of bribery, fraud and with making false statements in his annual financial disclosure forms by failing to list gifts he received from a wealthy friend, Florida ophthalmologist Salomon Melgen.  Prosecutors allege Menendez accepted campaign donations and gifts, including a stay at a Caribbean villa and private jet flights, from Melgen in exchange for interceding in various matters on his friends behalf, including an $8.9 million Medicare billing dispute. Menendez and Melgen have pleaded not guilty to the charges they faced in the 22-count indictment. Menendez argued that his actions were protected by the Constitutions speech or debate clause, which offers broad protection to members of Congress against prosecution for actions they undertake as legislators. Last July, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia ruled that Menendezs actions amounted to essentially lobbying on behalf of a particular party, and thus outside the safe harbor provided in the Constitution.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""BADEN BADEN, Germany (Reuters) - Wary of their first official encounter with U.S. President Donald Trumps blustery trade agenda, the worlds top finance officials were relieved to find new Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin polite and business-like over the weekend. But they yielded ground to the newcomers push for the Group of 20 major economies to abandon a decade-old pledge to resist protectionism and to delete communique language on financing the fight against climate change. According to G20 officials who interacted with Mnuchin at the meeting in the spa and casino town of Baden-Baden, Germany, many opted not to challenge Mnuchin on protectionism language. Instead they chose to give some space to him and Trumps new administration to refine their trade views in the hopes for moderation by the time Germany hosts a G20 leaders summit in July. Five weeks into his new job, the former Goldman Sachs and commercial banker is currently the only Senate-confirmed Trump appointee working at Treasury. And the Trump administration has not yet decided on the specific policies it will use to make good on campaign pledges to shrink U.S. trade deficits and grow American manufacturing jobs. Options under consideration range from more aggressive anti-dumping enforcement efforts to renegotiating trade deals and enacting a proposed border tax levied on imports. During his campaign, Trump threatened unilateral tariffs on Mexican and Chinese goods and said he would quit the North American Free Trade agreement unless it is renegotiated to his liking.     We have a new administration in Washington which still has to define precisely its narrative, especially in the context of what was said in the campaign, said Pierre Moscovici, European Commission Economic Affairs Minister.  I think Mnuchin is an articulate, constructive and pragmatic man, Moscovici said. More work needs to be done to find common ground. It was not ready here. It is not a total surprise. Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso, who tangled with Mnuchins predecessor, Jack Lew, last year over dollar-yen exchange rate volatility, said he was impressed with Mnuchins understanding of economics and financial markets. Thats why I think we can do good business together, Aso told reporters.  In the G20 plenary sessions, Mnuchin took to the floor only once, reading from a prepared statement, according to a G20 official, while counterparts from China and France argued forcefully in favor of keeping the anti-protectionism pledge.   While Mnuchin concentrated on making good first impressions with his G20 counterparts, U.S. negotiators behind the scenes insisted that they could no longer accept previous language vowing to resist all forms of protectionism. This was replaced with a watered-down pledge to strengthen the contribution of trade to our economies - language viewed by some participants as preserving U.S. flexibility on trade policy. German Finance Minster Wolfgang Schaeuble, who met with Mnuchin in Berlin before the Baden Baden meeting, said consensus could not be reached on the meaning of protectionism.. He suggested at a news conference that Mnuchin may not have had a clear mandate to negotiate on trade issues. Asked about this, Mnuchin said he knows Trumps desires on trade and negotiated them from Baden Baden, adding: the new language makes sense. The deletion of a ritualistic phrase in the G20s core language could over time diminish U.S. influence, said Eswar Prasad, a former International Monetary Fund official and  trade policy professor at Cornell University. The U.S. may have won this battle by forcefully imposing its will on the rest of the G20, but the outcome represents a step backward in U.S. global leadership on issues such as the promotion of free trade and tackling climate change, said Prasad.  But the Baden Baden meeting established Mnuchin as a pragmatic operator in the Trump administrations drive for a more level playing field on trade, said Domenico Lombardi, another former IMF official now with the Centre for International Governance Innovation, a Canadian think-tank.   Itd be in the interest of Germany and Europe to establish a strong, bilateral relationship with the new Treasury secretary rather than questioning his authority, Lombardi said. The alternative for them would be to negotiate directly with Trump and that would be worse.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Australia agreed with former U.S. President Barack Obama late last year for the United States to resettle up to 1,250 asylum seekers held in much criticized processing camps on Papua New Guinea and Nauru. In return, Australia would resettle refugees from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Trump labeled the agreement a dumb deal in a Tweet, but said he would stand by it. Interviews with more than half a dozen detainees on Nauru confirmed the U.S. Homeland Security officials arrived on Saturday, with meetings with detainees beginning on Monday. Two asylum seekers, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of fears of jeopardizing their applications to settle in the United States, told Reuters by phone Homeland Security officials did not ask any specific questions. It was not a normal interview, they just collected fingerprints and took my height and weight, the Iranian refugee told Reuters. Other refugees showed Reuters appointment slips to meet U.S. officials. Similar biometric data collection would begin at the Australian-run detention center in Papua New Guinea in early April, detainees were told by immigration officials last week. Australia maintains a strict policy of not allowing anyone who tries to reach the country by boat to settle there, instead detaining them in the camps on Nauru and PNG in conditions that have been harshly criticized by rights groups. Some asylum seekers have spent years in the camps, with numerous reports of sexual abuse and self-harm among detainees, including children. One 36-year-old woman told Reuters by phone from Nauru she did not want to be too hopeful about resettlement. For me, I really dont believe anything (about) when I get out from this hell, she said. I heard too many lies like this in this three and half years. A spokeswoman for Australian Immigration Minister Peter Dutton declined to comment. The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment. The U.S. security interviews with asylum seekers on Nauru were canceled last month amid uncertainty about what constituted extreme vetting Trump promised to apply to the 1,250 refugees it agreed to accept.      Some asylum seekers said the latest developments gave them hope. I think the deal will happen, but the question we dont know is how many people will be taken by the U.S., Behrouz Boochani, an Iranian refugee held on PNGs Manus Island for nearly four years, told Reuters. With mounting international pressure, officials at Manus Island center are increasing pressure on asylum seekers to return to their home countries voluntarily, including offering large sums of money.

It was the latest public works plan announced by Cuomo at a time when such projects are increasingly on the national agenda. Republican President Donald Trump has vowed to spend $1 trillion on infrastructure, which the American Society of Civil Engineers has given a near-failing grade. Cuomos highway project in the Bronx, the poorest of New Yorks five boroughs, would rebuild the Bruckner-Sheridan highway interchange to allow the areas largely black and Hispanic residents easier access to parkland and the Bronx River on the other side, Cuomo said. The plan also calls for new highway ramps to give vehicles direct access to the Hunts Point Market, one of the biggest food distribution sites in the world. Residents have long complained of respiratory problems from the 13,000 trucks daily that spew exhaust as they rumble through local streets. The best future for the Bronx is ahead and were going to lead a Bronx that is better than any Bronx that has ever been, Cuomo said in announcing the project. The project is expected to generate 4,250 jobs and will be completed in multiple phases, he said. Cuomo has earmarked the $700 million needed for the first stage in this years state budget, which is expected to be voted on April 1. Cuomos emphasis on public works projects includes a stage of New Yorks Second Avenue Subway, renovation of LaGuardia Airport and replacement of the Tappan Zee Bridge across the Hudson River. Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic Party strategist, said in a telephone interview that the South Bronx project would boost Cuomo at the local, state and national levels. The second-term governor faces re-election in 2018 and has been floated as a potential presidential candidate in 2020. It makes him the guy people have to pay attention to nationally on urban issues, Sheinkopf said of Cuomo, son of former New York Governor Mario Cuomo. New stores and housing have helped the South Bronx recover somewhat from its reputation in the 1970s for crime and urban decay.

Several Republicans last week urged Trump to apologize for the allegations he made in a series of tweets on March 4. The maelstrom also caused tension with key U.S. allies and threatens to distract Republicans from campaign promises on health care and taxes. I dont know the basis for President Trumps assertion, U.S. Senator Susan Collins, a Republican, said on NBCs Meet the Press. I do believe he owes us that explanation. Collins said she supported Trump as president, but she wouldnt side with him if he misstated what the facts are.     FBI Director James Comey is expected to be asked about Trumps claims when he testifies at a rare public hearing on Monday about alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Russia has denied the assertion it was involved in hacked emails and other attempts to influence the race. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee holding the hearing, called Trumps claims patently false and said he expected Comey to say as much on Monday. The Justice Department on Friday delivered documents to congressional committees to help clear up whether the Obama administration spied on Trump. Republican Representative Devin Nunes, who leads the House intelligence panel, said after receiving the material, he saw no evidence of wiretapping. But Nunes, who served on Trumps transition team, joined the White House in seeking to shift attention away from the controversies by calling for investigations of leaks to the news media.  Nunes said on Fox News Sunday that leaks to reporters about former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn were criminal and that his panel was probing whether other names were leaked. Trump has been dogged by allegations that his associates had ties to Russian officials. He fired Flynn last month after reports he had discussed sanctions with Russias ambassador before Trump took office, without telling other White House officials. The one crime we know thats been committed is that one: the leaking of someones name, Nunes said. Were there any other names that were ... leaked out? Nunes also said ahead of Mondays hearing he had seen no evidence of collusion between Russia and Trumps team. But Schiff, the panels top Democrat, said there was enough circumstantial evidence that he still had questions. Meanwhile, the White House has not backed down on Trumps surveillance claims.  The administration was forced to reassure key ally Britain after White House press secretary Sean Spicer repeated a Fox News analysts claim that a British intelligence agency helped Obama wiretap Trump. The British government strongly denied it. The issue led to an awkward moment on Friday at a joint press conference with visiting German Chancellor Angela Merkel when Trump was asked about the wiretap claims by a German reporter. Trump said he and Merkel had something in common, apparently referring to reports during the Obama administration that Merkels phone was bugged. The quip left the German leader looking bewildered. Senior Republican Representative Tom Cole told reporters on Friday that Trump owed Obama an apology. Representatives Charlie Dent and Will Hurd, also Republicans, made similar comments. I see no indication that thats true, Cole said of the wiretapping charge.  Unless Trump produces convincing proof, Cole added, President Obama is owed an apology.

We wont be able to balance the budget this year, but were working on trying to get it to balance within the 10-year budget window, which is what Republicans in the House and the Senate have traditionally done in the last couple of years, Mulvaney said.

China has been irritated at being repeatedly told by Washington to rein in North Koreas nuclear and missile programs and the U.S. decision to base an advanced missile defense system in South Korea. Beijing is also deeply suspicious of U.S. intentions toward self-ruled Taiwan, which China claims as its own, with the Trump administration crafting a big new arms package for the island that is bound to anger China. But meeting in Beijings Great Hall of the People, those issues were brushed aside by Xi and Tillerson, at least in front of reporters, with Xi saying Tillerson had made a lot of efforts to achieve a smooth transition in a new era of relations.  You said that China-U.S. relations can only be friendly. I express my appreciation for this, Xi said.  Xi said he had communicated with President Donald Trump several times through telephone conversations and messages.  We both believe that China-U.S. cooperation henceforth is the direction we are both striving for. We are both expecting a new era for constructive development, Xi said. The joint interests of China and the United States far outweigh the differences, and cooperation is the only correct choice for us both, Xi added, in comments carried by Chinas Foreign Ministry. China and the United States must strengthen coordination of hot regional issues, respect each others core interests and major concerns, and protect the broad stability of ties, Xi said. Tillerson replied that Trump looks forward to enhancing understanding with China and the opportunity for a visit in the future. Tillerson said Trump places a very high value on the communications that have already occurred between Xi and Trump. And he looks forward to enhancing that understanding in the opportunity for a visit in the future, Tillerson said. We know that through further dialogue we will achieve a greater understanding that will lead to a strengthened, strengthening of the ties between China and the United States and set the tone for our future relationship of cooperation. Trump has so far been an unpredictable partner for China,  attacking Beijing on issues ranging from trade to the South China Sea and in December by talking to Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen. Before Tillerson arrived in Beijing on Saturday, Trump said North Korea was behaving very badly and accused China of doing little to resolve the crisis over the Norths weapons programs. Speaking in Seoul on Friday, Tillerson issued the Trump administrations starkest warning yet to North Korea, saying in Seoul that a military response would be on the table if Pyongyang took action to threaten South Korean and U.S. forces. Still, China and the United States appeared to have made some progress or put aside differences on difficult issues, at least in advance of a planned summit between Xi and Trump. Both Tillerson and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi struck a more conciliatory tone in their meeting, with Tillerson saying the United States and China would work together to get nuclear-armed North Korea take a different course. Underscoring the tensions, North Korea conducted a test of a new high-thrust engine at its Tongchang-ri rocket launch station and leader Kim Jong Un said the successful test was a new birth of its rocket industry, Pyongyangs official media said on Sunday. North Korea has conducted five nuclear tests and a series of missile launches, in defiance of U.N. sanctions, and is believed by experts and government officials to be working to develop nuclear-warhead missiles that could reach the United States. Washington wants China, the Norths neighbor and main trading partner, to use its influence to rein in the weapons programs. China says it is committed to enforcing U.N. sanctions on North Korea, but all sides have a responsibility to lessen tensions and get back to the negotiating table. Chinese official also repeatedly say they do not have the influence over North Korea that Washington and others believe, and express fears poverty-struck North Korea could collapse if it were cut off completely, pushing destabilizing waves of refugees into northeastern China.

But Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi described the talks with Tillerson as candid, pragmatic and productive. The two sides appeared to have made some progress or put aside differences on difficult issues, at least in advance of a planned summit between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump.  On Friday, Tillerson issued the Trump administrations starkest warning yet to North Korea, saying in Seoul that a military response would be on the table if Pyongyang took action to threaten South Korean and U.S. forces. Tillerson took a softer line after the meeting with Wang. He told reporters both China and the United States noted efforts over the last two decades had not succeeded in curbing the threat posed by North Koreas weapons programmes. We share a common view and a sense that tensions on the peninsula are quite high right now and that things have reached a rather dangerous level, and weve committed ourselves to doing everything we can to prevent any type of conflict from breaking out, Tillerson said. He said Wang and he agreed to work together to persuade North Korea make a course correction and move away from the development of their nuclear weapons. Wang said U.N. resolutions on North Korea both mapped out sanctions and called for efforts to resume efforts for a negotiated settlement. No matter what happens, we have to stay committed to diplomatic means as a way to seek peaceful settlement, he said. Wang said he and Tillerson both hope to find ways to restart the talks. Neither of us are ready to give up the hope for peace, he said. Tillerson had said on Friday that any talks on North Korea could only take place after it began the process of unwinding its weapons programmes. A U.S. official had told Reuters in Washington earlier this week that Tillerson may raise the prospect of imposing secondary sanctions on Chinese banks and other firms doing business with North Korea in defiance of U.N. sanctions. Trump said in a tweet on Friday that North Korea was behaving very badly and accused China, Pyongyangs neighbour and only major ally, of doing little to resolve the crisis. XI-TRUMP SUMMIT However, the two sides appear to have toned down differences as they work on finalising a trip by Xi to the United States, possibly next month, for his first summit with Trump. Wang said the two countries were in close communication on arranging the meeting, but gave no details.      The state-run Chinese tabloid the Global Times said on Saturday that it was in Chinas interests to stop North Koreas nuclear ambitions but to suggest China cut the country off completely was ridiculous as it would be fraught with danger. Once there is chaos in North Korea, it would first bring disaster to China. Im sorry, but the United States and South Korea dont have the right to demand this of China, it said in an editorial.  A former oil executive with no prior diplomatic experience, Tillerson will meet Xi on Sunday. North Korea has conducted two nuclear tests and a series of missile launches since the beginning of last year. Last week, it launched four more ballistic missiles and is working to develop nuclear-tipped missiles that can reach the United States. Washington has been pressing Beijing to do more to stop North Koreas nuclear and missile programmes.  China has called for a dual track approach, urging North Korea to suspend its tests and the United States and South Korea to suspend military drills, so both sides can return to talks. China has also been infuriated by the deployment of the  THAAD, or Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, missile defence system in South Korea, which it says will both harm Chinas own security and do nothing to ease tensions. China says the systems powerful radar will extend into the countrys northeast and potentially track Chinese missile launches, and maybe even intercept them. Russia also opposes THAAD, for the same reasons. There are other tricky issues too, including the self-ruled island of Taiwan which China claims as its own. The Trump administration is crafting a big new arms package for Taiwan that could include advanced rocket systems and anti-ship missiles to defend against China, U.S. officials said, a deal sure to anger Beijing.

President Donald Trumps first budget proposal includes a 17.9 percent cut for fiscal 2018 in funds for the Department of Health and Human Services, which provides most of the government support for Meals on Wheels, the organization said. The budget proposal did not say how the cut would affect the Administration for Community Living, the HHS agency that funds nutrition programs for the elderly, Meals on Wheels spokeswoman Jenny Bertolette said.  Meals on Wheels said on its website that it is difficult to imagine a scenario under which the next federal budget would not have an impact on its services. While Meals on Wheels America and local Meals on Wheels programs are seeing an uptick in giving, it does not replace federal funding, Bertolette told Reuters in an email. The White House referred questions about the HHS budget to the department. An HHS representative referred to a statement from Secretary Tom Price released earlier this week. HHS is dedicated to fulfilling our departments mission to improve the health and well-being of the American people. This budget supports that mission and will help ensure we are delivering critical services to our fellow citizens, the statement said.

For many musicians in the ContraBanned showcase that went from Friday night to early Saturday at the South by Southwest music festival, the show put a human face on the countries that have become a focal point of current U.S. politics. I understand the travel ban was done with the impression for securing a place of safety for Americans. I feel it is short-sighted and perpetuates the xenophobia that exists in this country, said Bassel Almadani, frontman and vocalist for the soul and funk band of Bassel & The Supernaturals. Almadani, raised in the U.S. Midwest from parents born in Syria, has relatives who have given up hope on leaving the country ripped apart by a civil war due to Trumps proposed bans.  He has been trying to use his act to raise awareness about the six-year civil war that has set new standards of savagery in its impact on civilians, leaving an estimated half a million people dead. The Trump administration has said its executive orders are common sense approaches that will protect the American people. Attention from the bans has opened the door for Almadani to play in places like churches in Kansas where congregants want to learn more.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department is developing plans to temporarily reassign immigration judges from around the country to 12  cities to speed up deportations of illegal immigrants who have been charged with crimes, according to two administration officials.  How many judges will be reassigned and when they will be sent is still under review, according to the officials, but the Justice Department has begun soliciting volunteers for deployment.  The targeted cities are New York; Los Angeles; Miami; New Orleans; San Francisco; Baltimore, Bloomington, Minnesota; El Paso, Texas; Harlingen, Texas; Imperial, California; Omaha, Nebraska and Phoenix, Arizona. They were chosen because they are cities which have high populations of illegal immigrants with criminal charges, the officials said. A spokeswoman for the Justice Departments Executive Office of Immigration Review, which administers immigration courts, confirmed that the cities have been identified as likely recipients of reassigned immigration judges, but did not elaborate on the planning.  The plan to intensify deportations is in line with a vow made frequently by President Donald Trump on the campaign trail last year to deport more illegal immigrants involved in crime. The Department of Homeland Security asked for the judges reshuffle, an unusual move given that immigration courts are administered by the Department of Justice. A Homeland Security spokeswoman declined to comment on any plan that has not yet been finalized.  Under an executive order signed by Trump in January, illegal immigrants with pending criminal cases are regarded as priorities for deportation whether they have been found guilty or not. That is a departure from former President Barack Obamas policy, which prioritized deportations only of those convicted of serious crimes. The policy shift has been criticized by advocate groups who say it unfairly targets immigrants who might ultimately be acquitted and do not pose a threat.                                 The cities slated to receive more judges have more than half of the 18,013 pending immigration cases that involve undocumented immigrants facing or convicted of criminal charges, according to data provided by the Justice Departments Executive Office of Immigration Review.  More than 200 of those cases involve immigrants currently incarcerated, meaning that the others have either not been convicted or have served their sentence. The Justice Department did not provide a breakdown of how many of the remainder have been convicted and how many are awaiting trial.   As part of the Trump administration crackdown on illegal immigrants, the Justice Department is also sending immigration judges to detention centers along the southwest border. Those temporary redeployments will begin Monday. Former immigration judge and chairman of the Board of Immigration Appeals Paul Schmidt said the Trump administration should not assume that all those charged with crimes would not be allowed to stay in the United States legally. It seems they have an assumption that everyone who has committed a crime should be removable, but thats not necessarily true. Even people who have committed serious crimes can sometimes get asylum, Schmidt said.  He also questioned the effectiveness of shuffling immigration judges from one court to another, noting that this will mean cases the judges would have handled in their usual courts will have to be rescheduled. He said that when he was temporarily reassigned to handle cases on the southern border in 2014 and 2015, cases he was slated to hear in his home court in Arlington, Virginia had to be postponed, often for more than a year.   Thats what you call aimless docket reshuffling, he said.  Under the Obama administration, to avoid the expense and disruption of immigration judges traveling, they would often hear proceedings from other courthouses via video conference. The judges reshuffling could further logjam a national immigration court system which has more than 540,000 pending cases.  The cities slated to receive more judges have different kinds of immigrant populations.  Imperial, California, for example, is in one of the nations largest agriculture hubs, attracting large numbers of immigrant farmworkers from Mexico and Central America.  Bloomington, Minnesota, near St. Paul, is home to a large number of African immigrants, many of whom traveled from war-torn countries like Somalia to claim asylum in the United States.

President Trump has stood by unproven claims that the Obama administration tapped his phones during the 2016 White House race. On Thursday his spokesman cited a media report that Britains GCHQ was behind the surveillance. Richard Ledgett, deputy director of the NSA, told BBC News the idea that Britain had a hand in spying on Trump was just crazy. It belies a complete lack of understanding of how the relationship works between the intel community agencies, it completely ignores the political reality of would the UK government agree to do that?, Ledgett said. There would be no advantage for Britains government in spying on Trump, given the potential cost, he said. It would be epically stupid, said Ledgett, who is due to retire shortly. Current and former NSA officials have described an acrimonious relationship between intelligence agencies and the Trump administration. Trump, who became president in January, tweeted earlier this month that his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama had wiretapped him during the late stages of the 2016 campaign. The Republican president offered no evidence for the allegation, which an Obama spokesman said was simply false. Fox News analyst Andrew Napolitano on Tuesday accused the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) - the British equivalent of the NSA - of having helped Obama to spy on Trump.

The Department of Justice said in a court filing it would appeal against a ruling by U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang in Maryland to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia. On Thursday, Chuang issued an emergency halt to the portion of Trumps March 6 executive order temporarily banning the entry of travelers from six Muslim-majority countries. He left in place the section of the order that barred the entry of refugees to the United States for four months. Another federal judge in Hawaii struck down both sections of the ban in a broader court ruling that prevented Trumps order from moving forward. In Washington state, where the ban is also being challenged, U.S. District Court Judge James Robart put a stay on proceedings for as long as the Hawaii courts nationwide temporary restraining order remained in place, to conserve resources and avoid inconsistent and duplicate rulings. The decisions came in response to lawsuits brought by states attorneys general in Hawaii and refugee resettlement agencies in Maryland who were represented by the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Immigration Law Center. Detractors argue the ban discriminated against Muslims in violation of the U.S. Constitutions guarantee of religious freedom. Trump says the measure is necessary for national security to protect the country from terrorist attacks. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told a media briefing the government would vigorously defend this executive order and appeal against the flawed rulings. The Department of Justice filed a motion late on Friday night seeking clarification of Hawaiis ruling before appealing to the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco.  The 9th Circuit court last month upheld a decision by Judge Robart that halted an original, more sweeping travel ban signed by the President on Jan. 27 in response to a lawsuit filed by Washington state.  The new executive order was reissued with the intention of overcoming the legal concerns. Trump has vowed to take the fight all the way to U.S. Supreme Court. The 4th Circuit is known as a more conservative court compared to the 9th Circuit, said Buzz Frahn, an attorney at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett who has been tracking the litigation nationwide. The government is probably thinking that the 4th Circuit ... would lend a friendlier ear to its arguments, he said.  Judges have said they were willing to look behind the text of the order, which does not mention Islam, to probe the motivation for enacting the ban, Frahn said. Trump promised during the election campaign to ban Muslims from entering the United States. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently split 4-4 between liberals and conservatives, with Trumps pick for the high court  - appeals court judge Neil Gorsuch - still awaiting confirmation. Hans von Spakovsky, from the Washington D.C.-based Heritage Foundation, said the Department of Justice might want to time their appeals to reach the Supreme Court after Gorsuch is confirmed. He said the court would be likely to hear the case. They will take it because of its national importance, Spakovsky said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"
"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican congressional leaders have refused Democrats calls for a special prosecutor or select committee to investigate possible links between President Donald Trumps campaign and Russia, saying investigations by congressional committees are sufficient. U.S. intelligence agencies said in January that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered hacks of the Democratic National Committees and Hillary Clintons campaign chairmans computers to influence the election on Trumps behalf. Russia has denied this. Three U.S. agencies - the CIA, National Security Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation - as well as the Justice Department, launched investigations into the matter under Democratic President Barack Obama. In addition, here are some of the ways that congressional committees are looking into the matter: HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE - The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence began its investigation of potential Russian influence on the 2016 presidential race before Trump took office on Jan. 20. The panels chairman, Republican Representative Devin Nunes, played a leading role in Trumps transition, which prompted some critics to question whether he was too close to the Republican president to conduct a fair investigation. Some of Nunes statements contributed to their concerns, including his confirmation that he had spoken to journalists at the White Houses request to dispute reports that Trumps campaign had contact with Russia.  Nunes has also said he does not want the investigation to turn into a witch hunt like the 1950s McCarthy congressional hearings into some Americans alleged links with communism. The committee members had to push for full access to information collected by the CIA, FBI and other agencies, but more recently they have said their access has improved. The panel will hold its first public hearing on the matter on March 20. FBI director James Comey and the leaders or former leaders of most of the major U.S. intelligence agencies have been invited to testify. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the committee, said he does not know yet whether the panel is capable of conducting a credible investigation. SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE - The U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence is conducting its own investigation. Also started before Trump took office, it is considered the most robust congressional action. Its chairman, Richard Burr, was re-elected in November in the Republican sweep that carried Trump into office and preserved Republican control of Congress. Although he was a Trump supporter during the campaign, he is not as closely linked with the president as Nunes is. But he also made calls to reporters as the White House tried to dispute allegations about campaign contacts with Russia. Senator Mark Warner, the committees Democratic vice chairman, said he had grave concerns about the independence of the committees probe after the report that Burr had helped the White House dispute the stories. Burr and Warner have expressed fewer concerns than members of the House committee about the amount of information that intelligence agencies have provided to them.         The Senate intelligence committee will hold an open hearing on Russian efforts to influence campaigns more generally, on March 30. The witness list includes experts, not current Trump administration or intelligence community officials. SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE - Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, chairman of the panels subcommittee on crime and terrorism, and Sheldon Whitehouse, its ranking Democrat, announced that they, too, would investigate Russian attempts to influence the election. They also have asked the FBI and the Justice Department to produce any information that supports Trumps unsubstantiated claim that his predecessor wiretapped him during the 2016 campaign. The full Judiciary Committee is also investigating. Its chairman, Chuck Grassley, and top Democrat, Dianne Feinstein, have had officials brief panel members. Grassley and Feinstein also sent a joint letter to Comey asking for a briefing and transcripts and documents of calls between Michael Flynn, Trumps former national security adviser, and Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak. HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE - Committee Democrats tried to force the committee to ask the Department of Justice to produce records of its investigation into whether Trump or his campaign had ties to Russia, but panel Republicans blocked the effort. The committees chairman, Representative Bob Goodlatte, said instead that he would urge the government to continue its investigation. However, Goodlatte said he had asked the Justice Department to brief the committee, and had not had a response. HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE - Jason Chaffetz, the committees Republican chairman, has resisted calls to investigate the Trump administration. After Michael Flynn resigned as Trumps national security adviser because of his calls to Russias ambassador, Chaffetz said his panel would not look into the issue. He has, however, signed letters seeking related information, and he was among the first lawmakers to call for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to recuse himself from Russia-related investigations because of his contacts with Kislyak.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - South Dakotas Republican Governor Dennis Daugaard on Friday vetoed a pair of bills that would have loosened restrictions on carrying concealed guns in the state, after saying current laws made sense and were adequate. One measure would have allowed carrying concealed weapons in the state without a permit. The second proposed allowing carriers of an enhanced permit to carry concealed weapons at the state capitol. South Dakota bars convicted felons and those convicted of some violent or drug crimes from obtaining a concealed weapons permit. Eleven U.S. states allow gun owners to carry concealed weapons without a permit, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a gun-control advocacy group. Another 39, including South Dakota, allow concealed carry with a permit.  In a letter accompanying one of the vetoes, Daugaard, who had previously pointed to his own membership in the National Rifle Association, defended the states existing concealed weapons laws as reasonable. I am unaware of a single instance in which a person who could lawfully possess a gun was denied a permit to carry a concealed pistol, Daugaard wrote. By comparison, he added, two counties in the state have turned down nearly 600 permit applicants who were disqualified due to mental illness or due to violent or drug-related crimes. The veto echoed statements Daugaard made in a Feb. 11 editorial in the Rapid City Journal, in which he said he viewed the states laws as effective, appropriate and minimal. Daugaard also vetoed a similar proposal loosening concealed-carry standards in 2012. Rep. Lee Qualm, who sponsored the proposal relaxing the state capitol restrictions, called the vetoes frustrating, and said in a phone interview on Friday that he would try to override them when the legislature returns from recess March 27. An override requires a two-thirds majority in South Dakota, and Qualm said both bills were only a handful of votes short of that threshold in both chambers. Rep. Lynne Disanto, sponsor of the broader of the two bills, did not respond to calls or emails seeking comment. The bills failure at the hands of a Republican governor pointed to a divide in his party over the regulations. Neither bill received full Republican support in either chamber, and the statewide measure was opposed by about one in five Republicans in the House and one in three in the Senate.

Delrahim is expected to move to the Justice Department after finishing up in the White House counsels office, where he is working to steer Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch through the Senate confirmation process. The sources spoke on background because an announcement has not yet been made. As the proposed new chief of the Antitrust Division, he would be in charge of overseeing corporate mergers at a time when many investors and corporate executives hope for a more relaxed attitude toward deal-making after years of tougher oversight by the Obama administration. The department is reviewing a number of major deals, including mergers of Dow and Dupont and Bayer and Monsanto. Those proposed transactions, along with a third deal, ChemChinas purchase of Syngenta, would consolidate six agricultural chemical giants into three. The Justice Department is also assessing AT&Ts controversial plan to buy Time Warner, owner of HBO, Warner Brothers and the news network CNN. President Trump has not criticized the Time Warner deal since the November election but during his campaign he said it was an example of too much concentration of power in the hands of too few. Delrahim must be confirmed by the Senate. Before coming to work at the White House following Trumps inauguration in January, Delrahim was a lobbyist with the law firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, LLP. In 2016, he lobbied for the semiconductor company Qualcomm, Comcast Corp and Zuffa LLC, also known as the Ultimate Fighting Championship, among others, according to the Lobbying Disclosure Act Database. Another client in 2016 was health insurer Anthem Inc, which this year lost a court fight with the Justice Department over whether it would be allowed to merge with rival Cigna. Anthem is appealing the loss. Delrahim, whose family emigrated from Iran when he was young, cemented his loyalty to Trump last summer when he wrote a piece in the New York Post urging Republicans to fall in line behind Trump. Only Trump would be able to win and ensure conservatives on the Supreme Court, the lawyer argued, adding Theres no glory in handing the Supreme Court to a Democratic president. But if we write off Trump, thats what will happen. Delrahim is a veteran of the Justice Departments Antitrust Division, where he was deputy assistant attorney general from 2003 to 2005, under then-President George W. Bush.

The Justice Department filed a brief opposing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureaus appeal of a ruling that its single-director structure does not hew to the constitution. The decision that the bureau appealed also said the president should have the power to fire the agencys head at will. Under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law that created the CFPB to protect individuals against fraud in lending, the president can only fire the agency director for cause. The CFPB director is currently Obama appointee Richard Cordray, hailed by consumer advocates for taking action against payday lenders, credit card companies and debt collectors. Many bankers and Wall Street executives, along with Republican lawmakers, have said his authority to both write and enforce regulations is too wide. The agency can represent itself in court cases except for those before the Supreme Court, putting President Donald Trump in a rare predicament: he cannot direct the Justice Department to withdraw the appeal. Instead, the Justice Department could only file a brief supporting the CFPBs opponent, mortgage company PHH Corp. A single-headed independent agency presents a greater risk than a multi-member independent commission of taking actions or adopting policies inconsistent with the Presidents executive policy, the Justice Department argued, saying a commission must compromise, while a single director does not answer to anyone. The department also said that because CFPB directors hold five-year terms, a president may not get a chance to appoint someone who agrees with him. Cordrays term expires next year. The department argued the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit should allow Trump to fire the director at will, upholding the original decision reached by a three-member panel of its judges in October.  No U.S. president has ever dismissed an independent agencys director for cause. Republican lawmakers say Cordrays history provides Trump with cause for dismissal, although some are seeking a legislative path to fire him. The rare inter-agency legal fight was widely expected.  After Trumps election win, some states attorneys general and Democrats in Congress sought permission to represent the CFPB in the appeal, anticipating Trump would try to undermine the agency.

British Prime Minister Theresa Mays spokesman earlier in the day dismissed the charge against Britains GCHQ spy agency as ridiculous and said the White House had promised not to repeat it. But at a news conference Trump brushed aside a question about whether it was a mistake to accuse British intelligence of eavesdropping. We said nothing. All we did was quote a certain very talented legal mind who was the one responsible for saying that on television. I didnt make an opinion on it, Trump said. He was referring to Fox News analyst Andrew Napolitano who on Tuesday accused Britains Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) intelligence agency of having helped Obama, a Democrat, wiretap Trump, a Republican.  White House spokesman Sean Spicer on Thursday quoted Napolitanos comments about GCHQ during a testy briefing with reporters. But speaking at the White House news conference, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, at his side, Trump distanced himself. That was a statement made by a very talented lawyer on Fox, and so you shouldnt be talking to me, you should be talking to Fox. OK?

House Budget Committee Chairman Diane Black, who attended the Capitol Hill session, said there very likely would be changes to tax credits offered in the bill to do more for older, lower-income people - something Republican moderates have sought. Conservative Republicans who met Trump said he agreed to changes on the Medicaid government insurance program for the poor. These include work requirements for able-bodied, childless Medicaid recipients, said Representative Mark Walker, chairman of the Republican Study Committee, the largest House conservative group. Walker said he now supported the bill. Expected changes also would provide states with the option to receive a federal lump sum block grant for Medicaid and latitude to manage the program as they see fit, Walker said in a statement. In a letter on Thursday to Ryan and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, the Republican governors of Ohio, Michigan, Nevada and Arkansas said the current bill does not provide new flexibility for states but shifts significant costs to them.   Trump met with about a dozen House conservatives at the White House and afterward declared that he had won them over to the plan, known formally as the American Health Care Act.   Im 100 percent behind this, Trump told reporters after the meeting. We made certain changes but frankly very little. Vice President Mike Pence was due in Florida on Saturday to sell the bill to small businesses, the White House said.    But there was no sign of changes to address a top priority of the hard-line conservative House Freedom Caucus, which wants to bring health insurance premiums down quickly. The Freedom Caucus did not attend the White House meeting. Representative Mark Meadows, the chairman of the group, expressed frustration that House leaders were talking about making the Medicaid work requirement optional - which he said doesnt move the ball more than a couple yards on a very long playing field. Representative Justin Amash, another member of the Freedom Caucus, tweeted: Absolutely not true that conservatives have flipped to yes on the health care bill. It doesnt repeal Obamacare. It remains a disaster. Meadows said his group will propose an amendment on Monday. Representative Charlie Dent, a Republican moderate, said the House bill should be crafted to win support in the Senate, where numerous Republicans have voiced skepticism. I dont like the idea of just sending a bill over which they can gut and send back, Dent said. Ryan, the chief proponent of the plan, acknowledged the challenges of winning over lawmakers. There are people from the middle and from the right who have various concerns, he said at a conservative forum. Were trying to make sure that we address as many of these concerns as possible without destroying the bill ... and without losing votes but adding votes. Democrats have roundly rejected the Republicans proposal, saying it harms the poor, elderly and working families while offering tax cuts to rich Americans and companies. In his meeting with House Republicans Friday, Price talked to lawmakers about other changes the department could make through the rules and official guidance it uses to implement the healthcare law. These include possibly altering the health benefits that the law requires insurance plans to cover. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said on Monday that 14 million Americans would lose medical insurance next year under the Republican plan. Obamacare expanded insurance to about 20 million Americans. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is crafting a big new arms package for Taiwan that could include advanced rocket systems and anti-ship missiles to defend against China, U.S. officials said, a deal sure to anger Beijing. The package is expected to be significantly larger than one that was shelved at the end of the Obama administration, the officials told Reuters on the eve of a visit to Beijing by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. The political desire is there to do a substantial sale, one administration official said, adding that internal deliberations had begun on a deal thats much stronger, much more significant than the one that was not accepted by the Obama people.     President Donald Trumps administration is eager to proceed with the sales, but it is expected to take months and possibly into next year for the White House to overcome obstacles, including concern that Beijings sensitivities over Taiwan could make it harder to secure cooperation on priorities such as reining in North Korea, the official said. Completion of a package also could be held up by the slow pace at which the Trump administration is filling national security jobs, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity because initial work toward new arms sales has not been made public. Discussions between Taiwan and the new administration already have begun, according to a person in Taipei familiar with the matter. The White House declined comment. Details of the administrations approach to Taiwan emerged as Tillerson was due to visit China this weekend, where he will seek more Chinese support on North Korea and firm up a first meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping expected next month.  In December, President Barack Obamas administration put the brakes on a Taiwan deal under discussion. That package was worth $1 billion, Washingtons Free Beacon newspaper reported this week, citing unnamed officials, who also were quoted as saying the Trump administration was now preparing new sales. Ned Price, a National Security Council spokesman under Obama, said the previous administration put a relatively modest arms package for Taiwan on hold, in part to let the new administration make the decision. The Trump administration source told Reuters that the new deals under consideration would likely top the $1 billion mark. The new administration plans to focus more than the previous one on enhancing Taiwans asymmetric capabilities, possibly with advanced multiple launch rocket systems, anti-ship missiles and other technologies that would enable Taiwans military to defend against a much larger Chinese force in the event of an attack, the U.S. official said. Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) is the top U.S. manufacturer of multiple launch rocket systems. Other foreign companies involved in the sector include Germanys Diehl and Britains BAE Systems  (BAES.L). A $1.83 billion arms sale to Taiwan that Obama announced in December 2015, to Chinas dismay, included two Navy frigates in addition to anti-tank missiles and amphibious attack vehicles. The United States switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 1979, acknowledging Taiwan as part of one China. But successive administrations have continued providing billions of dollars in arms as part of a congressionally mandated requirement to ensure the island can defend itself. Taiwan has already been a major point of contention between Trump and China, which considers the island a renegade province. As president-elect, Trump broke with protocol and accepted a congratulatory phone call from the Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen in December, angering China. He then suggested he might abandon Washingtons one China policy, which accepts the self-ruled island as part of China. Once in office, Trump reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to the decades-old policy. The White House is mindful that tensions could flare again over new arms sales. But some Trump aides insist they are needed to make clear that the United States, Taiwans sole arms supplier, is committed to upgrading the islands defenses.

The states Joint Commission on Public Ethics on Friday said Fred Hiffa arranged for payments totaling $50,000 over one year to the Westchester County law firm Santangelo, Randazzo & Mangone, which employed Libous son Matthew.

The bill, known as the American Health Care Act, aims to replace the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare.  The bill proposes to shift federal funding for Medicaid, the government insurance program for the poor, from a state-match to a per capita cap, resulting in a greater financial burden on states, Moodys reported. The proposal would also phase out funding for expanded Medicaid by 2020, leaving states to pick up the difference or to drop enrollees from their Medicaid programs.  The Congressional Budget Office estimated the proposed reform would cut federal spending by $880 billion between 2017 and 2026, reaching a 25 percent lower level by 2026 compared to current-law projections. States will face difficult decisions in this regard, Moodys reported on Friday. If states maintain the expansion programs for non-elderly adults with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, they will be on the hook for a larger portion of expenses related to new enrollees. Already, state Medicaid spending is expected to consume a larger portion of state revenues, growing by 28 percent of tax revenue by 2025, up from 24.5 percent in 2017, the rating agency estimated.

The White House had cited the report by a Fox News analyst as it sought to defend President Donald Trumps charge that Obamas administration wiretapped him during the 2016 election. Over the past two weeks, Trump and his aides have pressed the claim in numerous ways, including suggestions that Trump may have been monitored through microwaves and television sets. The White House has provided no proof to support Trumps allegation and the heads of U.S. House and Senate intelligence panels, including from Trumps Republican Party, have rejected it.  Here is a chronology of the administrations assertions: MARCH 4: In a series of early morning tweets, Trump accuses Obama of having his wires tapped and calls him a bad (or sick) guy. Trump spokesman Sean Spicer says the White Houses top lawyer was examining options for pursuing the claim. MARCH 5: The White House cites reports of potentially politically motivated investigations, and says Trump wanted the congressional intelligence committees to examine whether executive branch investigative powers were abused in 2016. MARCH 6: Spicer suggests monitoring may have been broader than a wire tap, might have been conducted under a secret foreign intelligence eavesdropping warrant and that there is substantial reporting out there from individuals and from sources that such surveillance occurred. MARCH 7: Spicer says while there is no new proof of Trumps allegation, the president has absolutely no regrets about his tweets and that he was not walking anything back or regretting. MARCH 12: Senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway suggests in an interview with the Bergen County Record newspaper that the monitoring may have been conducted through television sets or microwaves that turn into cameras. MARCH 13: Conway says her comments the previous day were misconstrued but continues to air the allegation about the president and wiretapping at Trump Tower. Spicer says Trumps charges were based on reporting by a number of news organizations, including Fox, the BBC and the New York Times. Trumps use of the word wiretapping ... spans a whole host of surveillance types of options, Spicer says. MARCH 14: Spicer says Trump is extremely confident the Justice Department would find evidence proving his allegation. MARCH 15: Republican and Democratic leaders of the House Intelligence Committee say they have seen no evidence of wiretapping. The White House defends Trumps allegation, and Trump says in a Fox News interview that, We will be submitting things before the committee very soon that hasnt been submitted as of yet. But its potentially a very serious situation. MARCH 16: The Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and House Speaker Paul Ryan, separately say there is no proof of Trumps charge. Spicer says there is no question that surveillance techniques were used. He cites a litany of news reports to justify the allegation. They include an assertion by a Fox News analyst, former New Jersey Judge Andrew Napolitano, that he had been told by unidentified intelligence officials that Obama obtained transcripts of Trumps conversations from Government Communications Headquarters, or GCHQ, the British agency that monitors overseas communications. MARCH 17: The administration backs away from the Fox News report after the British government said it was assured by the White House that it would not repeat Napolitanos allegation, dubbed nonsense by a GCHQ spokesman.

He has represented Philip Morris International Inc,  Cardinal Health Inc and the National Football League among many corporate clients.  He did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. The White House and Justice Department also declined comment. As head of the civil division, Conway would be in charge of defending government actions, including Trumps revised executive order banning citizens from six Muslim-majority nations from traveling to the United States. This week, judges in Hawaii and Maryland blocked implementation of Trumps order that retains a 90-day ban on travel to the United States by citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen that was part of an earlier order  blocked by the courts. Conway was one of a team of lawyers who drafted a legal brief on behalf of Paula Jones who sued President Bill Clinton for sexual harassment, according to numerous media reports. Conway wrote in a 1994 Los Angeles Times op-ed that Clinton should not have immunity from Jones lawsuit because it would place presidents above the law. It would enable a president to take out a mortgage on a summer home, refuse to make payments and yet be immune from foreclosure for four or eight years.  The civil division defends U.S. agencies against thousands of lawsuits filed annually over government policies, laws, domestic and foreign operations, entitlement programs, law enforcement and military actions, and counter-terrorism efforts.

Both versions would allow the state to borrow money from a long-term investment fund and delay a payment to the Kansas Public Employees Retirement System. But the monetary amounts and plans to repay the cash differ, J.G. Scott, assistant director for fiscal affairs at the Kansas Legislative Research Department, said on Friday. Tax cuts enacted in 2012 have gouged a hole in the Kansas budget as revenue failed to meet monthly estimates, although February marked a fourth straight month that collections met or exceeded projections. Kansas also faces higher education spending in the wake of a recent state supreme court ruling. Scott said the bills to fix the budget will head to a legislative conference committee probably next week. The Senate on Thursday rejected three attempts to amend the bill with across-the-board spending cuts of 2 percent, 1 percent and 0.5 percent. Republican Senate President Susan Wagle contended spending cuts, which would have included primary and secondary public schools, would ease tax hikes the legislature is expected to take up to tackle a $755 million projected budget shortfall over the next two fiscal years. A move in the state legislature last month to boost revenue by raising tax rates and eliminating a business exemption failed when the Senate was unable to override Republican Governor Sam Brownbacks veto. Complicating Kansas finances is a March 2 state supreme court ruling that found the school funding system falls short of a constitutional requirement for adequacy. The ruling, which set a June 30 deadline for the enactment of a constitutional funding method, could require Kansas to increase school funding by more than $500 million each year. Moodys Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings have said the ruling will put increased pressure on the states already shaky finances.  Meanwhile, resolutions are pending in the House and Senate to put a constitutional amendment on the November 2018 ballot that would require a two-thirds vote by both legislative chambers to pass any state tax increase. The measure also seeks an annual cap on state spending and creates funds for debt payments and a budget reserve. Scott said previous attempts to put similar measures on the ballot were not successful. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"
"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trumps first budget outline, calling for a security-heavy realignment of federal spending, drew resistance on Thursday from his fellow Republicans in the U.S. Congress as many balked at proposed deep cuts to diplomatic and foreign aid programs. Conservatives have plenty to like in the White House plan, with its 10 percent increase in military spending next year and beefed-up funding to help deport more illegal immigrants and build a wall on the border with Mexico. It also takes steps to downsize government, a central goal of conservatives. But the gaze into Trumps priorities for the next four years proved too savage for many Republicans taste, foreshadowing an intense battle between Congress and the White House over spending in coming months. Although Republicans control both the Senate and House of Representatives, Congress holds the federal purse strings and seldom approves presidents budget plans. The administration asked Congress for a 28 percent, or $10.9 billion, cut in State Department funding and other international programs to help pay for a 10 percent, $54 billion hike in military spending next year. These increases in defense come at the expense of national security, said Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who has not hesitated to take on Trump. Republican Senator Marco Rubio, who like Graham ran unsuccessfully for president in 2016, leveled similar sentiments, as did some prominent Republicans in the House of Representatives. House Speaker Paul Ryan sidestepped reporters questions about whether he supported State Department cuts, saying the White House blueprint was just the start of the budget process. The budget also drew criticism internationally. The French ambassador to the United Nations, Francois Delattre, warned that cutting funding of global programs could fuel instability. The White House shrugged off concerns about the impact, saying Trump was making good on election promises. The president said, specifically, hundreds of times - you covered him - Im going to spend less money on people overseas and more money on people back home and thats exactly what were doing with this budget, Trumps budget director, Mick Mulvaney, told reporters. Democrats, whose votes would be needed later this year to sign off on the spending bills that implement any budget blueprint given the slim Republican hold on the Senate, attacked the proposed reductions to the Environmental Protection Agency and programs that benefit the poor. The White House proposal would inflict a 31 percent, or $2.6 billion, cut on the EPA. Some veteran Republicans, including Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, a White House budget chief during the administration of President George W. Bush, vowed to preserve the EPAs Great Lakes restoration program that Trump wants to eliminate. Moderate Republicans expressed unease with potential cuts to popular domestic programs. Lisa Murkowski, who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, attacked plans to cut or eliminate programs that help the poor pay heating bills, provide aid for localities to deal with wastewater and subsidize air travel in rural areas like her home state of Alaska. We need to remember that these programs are not the primary drivers of our debt, Murkowski said. In fact, those discretionary programs that must be renewed annually by Congress, account for about $1.2 trillion out of a $3.9 trillion federal budget. The biggest portion of the budget - about $2.4 trillion - is for mandatory entitlement programs that provide Social Security retirement benefits and Medicare and Medicaid healthcare for the elderly, poor and disabled. Conservatives have been clamoring for years for reforms to those programs to save money. Trump vowed, however, to protect them as he campaigned for president last year. Trump was silent on those programs in the plan released on Thursday, but they will be included in a fuller fiscal blueprint due out in mid-May that will project spending and revenues over 10 years. It is unclear if any reforms for those programs will be part of that budget. Other discretionary cuts proposed by Trump included community development grants at the Housing Department and more than 20 Education Department programs. Funding would disappear for 19 independent bodies that count on federal money for public broadcasting, the arts and regional programs. Throwing billions at defense while ransacking Americas investments in jobs, education, clean energy and lifesaving medical research will leave our nation weakened, said House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Trump also asked for $25 billion more for core Defense Department programs for the current fiscal year, as well as $5 billion more for combat operations. A detailed copy of that request seen by Reuters showed some of the funds would be for procurement of technology such as F-35 fighter aircraft and drone systems. About $13.5 billion of the supplemental request was earmarked for aircraft, missiles and ships. It included THAAD missiles, Blackhawk helicopters and F-35s made by Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), as well as F/A-18 warplanes and Apache helicopters manufactured by Boeing Co (BA.N). Also for this fiscal year, Trump requested $3 billion more for the Department of Homeland Security, with some of that money intended for planning and construction of the border wall that he made a major part of his 2016 election campaign. Congress will likely consider the supplemental request by April 28, when regular funding expires for most federal agencies.  The budget outline also does not incorporate Trumps plan for sparking $1 trillion in investments to build roads, bridges, airports and other infrastructure projects. The White House has said the infrastructure plan is still to come. The planned defense increases are mainly matched by cuts to other programs so as to not increase the $488 billion federal deficit. Despite the proposed big cuts to the EPA and the State Department, Mulvaney said their core functions would be preserved.  Reflecting Trumps repeated election campaign pledge to reduce illegal immigration, the Department of Homeland Security would get a 6.8 percent increase, with more money for extra staff needed to catch, detain and deport illegal immigrants. Trump wants Congress to approve $1.5 billion for the border wall in the current fiscal year - enough for pilot projects to determine the best way to build it - and a further $2.6 billion in fiscal 2018, Mulvaney said. The estimate for the total cost of the wall will be included in the upcoming full budget. Trump has repeatedly said that Mexico will pay for the  wall. Mexico has adamantly said it will not. Since Trump took office in January, the White House has said funding would be kick-started in the United States. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - Proponents of government efforts to clean up hazardous waste sites like radioactive soil buried in a St. Louis-area landfill fear the Trump administrations proposed 30 percent budget cut will slow or damage the already struggling Superfund program. The White House budget proposal submitted to Congress on Thursday includes a 31 percent cut in spending for the U.S. Environmental Protecting Agency, including a similar reduction of the agencys Hazardous Substance Superfund Account by $330 million to $762 million. The Superfund program, started in 1980, has been criticized over the years for its slow efforts to clean up hazardous waste sites, which now number more than 1,300 around the country. Proponents argue that the EPA fights with one arm tied behind its back because its budget has been halved from $2 billion in recent years, while critics say what they characterize as a bloated bureaucracy should step out of the way and allow the states and private sector do the job faster, cheaper and more effectively. This is a program that is already a bit on life support, so to take another third out of it is really quite harmful, said Ken Kimmell, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists, which advocates for science-based solutions to problems. Those who worry about the Superfund programs future are angry that EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt is already abandoning newly made promises, citing comments he made earlier this month to U.S. mayors. On March 2, Pruitt said certain EPA programs, including the Superfund program, are essential to protect. An EPA spokeswoman said the focus for the agency has not changed, only how to achieve its mission. This budget helps refocus the agency on being more effective, more focused, and less costly, Julia Valentin said in an email. It is about empowering the states to be primary implementers of environmental programs on the ground, rather than insist that EPA micromanage them. That is cold comfort to some living near Superfund sites, like Dawn Chapman, a 36-year-old stay-at-home mom who co-founded a group named Just Moms four years ago to bring attention to the plight of residents near the West Lake Landfill in Bridgeton, Missouri, about 20 miles (30 km) northeast of St. Louis. The EPA last fall indefinitely delayed its proposal for how to clean up contaminated soil at the landfill, next to another site where an underground fire has been smoldering for several years. Residents complain of higher rates of cancers, bloody noses or asthma. I dont see how this is going to speed up anything, Chapman said of the proposed smaller budget. Chapman, who has three children with special needs, is unsure whether the landfill is the cause of their issues. She wants the cleanup to move ahead, but is not confident the state could handle the matter any better. Michael McKenna, a Republican strategist and energy lobbyist, said asking an organization to do their job with a little bit less is not unusual, and the EPA will find efficiencies. Its a bit premature to declare the sky is falling, he said. Critics of the EPA said the agency needs to operate better with less, and work more closely with the private sector and states to get back to its core mission. The problem I have with the EPA, its turned into more of an ideological group more concerned with spreading a liberal message (President Barack) Obama had, said Republican Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma.  Inhofe has been critical of what he characterized as overreach by the EPA, as well as its rule making and bureaucracy under Obama. However, some environmental groups argue that the shifting the work to the states is not the answer. Mike Scott, a senior organizing representative with the Sierra Club in Montana, said that state got $37 million from the EPA last year for its 16 Superfund sites. He added that the states Department of Environmental Quality gets almost half its annual budget from the EPA as well. Even if they say, Were going to shift this over to the states, I dont understand how the states are going to have the resources to pay for it, Scott said.  Backers and critics of the program agree on one thing: The budget that comes out of Congress will look far different from the Trump proposal and likely will reverse some of the cuts to the Superfund program. Were in the first couple steps of a thousand-mile journey, McKenna said. This is not where were going to end. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The 2018 budget proposal submitted to Congress by the White House on Thursday would cut funds to the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) and the U.S. Economic Development Administration. The Washington-based organizations are charged with diversifying the economies of states like West Virginia and Kentucky to help them recover from coals decline. The proposed cuts would save the federal government $340 million and come as the Republican president seeks to slash a wide array of federal programs and regulations to make way for increased military spending.  But they are perceived by some in Appalachia as a betrayal of his promises to help coal miners. Folks that live in Appalachia believe that the ARC belongs to them, said federal ARC Co-Chair Earl Gohl, bemoaning the proposed cut. Its really their organization. Republican Congressman Hal Rogers, who represents eastern Kentuckys coal counties, said he would fight to restore the funding when Congress negotiates the budget later this year.  Its true that the president won his election in rural country. I would really like to see him climb aboard the ARC vehicle as a way to help us help ourselves, Rogers said. Four hundred of the 420 counties ARC operates in voted for Trump in Novembers election.  The 52-year old agency has run more than 650 projects in Appalachias 13 states between 2011 and 2015 costing hundreds of millions of dollars. Its programs, some launched under Democratic former President Barack Obama, are expected to create or retain more than 23,670 jobs and train and educate over 49,000 students and workers, the organization said. Trump vowed during his campaign that the White House would put American coal miners back to work, in part by cutting environmental regulations ushered in by Obama, mainly aimed at curbing climate change but characterized by Trump as hampering the industry. However, many industry experts and coal miners doubt that rolling back regulation alone can revive the coal mining industry, which faces stiff competition from abundant and cheap natural gas in fueling U.S. power generation. Rigel Preston, a 38-year old former surface miner, said ARC programs helped him land a job as a paid intern at technology company Interapt after he lost his benefits. He said that, while he and many members of his family in eastern Kentucky hope Trump will deliver on his promise to revive the coal industry, he believed the regions future lay elsewhere. From my experience from the coalfield, I know that that is a finite job and coal will run out eventually, Preston said. Preston was among several former miners and other east Kentuckians at an event in Paintsville this week held by Interapt and ARC to announce Interapts plan to hire another hundred people from the region this summer. Interapt last year launched a program called TechHire Eastern Kentucky, supported by ARC, which provides 36 weeks of paid training in code and paid internships.  Interapt Chief Executive Ankur Gopal, a 37-year-old tech entrepreneur, expanded his Louisville-based company out to eastern Kentucky with the vision of lifting that part of his home state out of economic stagnation. There is a skilled workforce and opportunity that can be found here in eastern Kentucky, Gopal said. This is not just a bunch of people that are waiting for coal mines to reopen. ARC has worked on economic development in Appalachia since its founding in 1965 as part of President Lyndon Johnsons war on poverty. In recent years it has focused on helping states in the region deal with the coal industrys sharp decline and the loss of 33,000 coal mining jobs between 2011 and 2016. So far, ARC has had no official contact from the presidents transition teams, said co-chair Gohl, an Obama appointee who remains in the job. The cuts to its funding were recommended to the administration by the Heritage Foundation, a Washington-based think tank. Nick Loris, an energy fellow at the foundation, said the work that ARC and the Economic Development Administration do should be devolved to state and local governments to encourage transparency and reduce duplicative federal spending. States have said their budgets are already strapped. In addition to all of West Virginia and part of Kentucky, the ARC covers parts of Alabama, Georgia, Maryland, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - While he has swallowed a big budget cut and had the White House veto his chosen deputy, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is avoiding a public conflict with U.S. President Donald Trump over his departments budget, six current and former U.S. officials said on Thursday. Instead, Tillerson privately resisted a 37-percent budget cut that some White House officials sought and he convinced Trump he needed more time to identify where savings could be made, two current and one former official told Reuters. As a result, the White House proposed on Thursday a reduction of some 28 percent on U.S. diplomacy and foreign aid. Tillerson isnt opposed to cutting the budget at all, but he figured out that he couldnt win head-to-head battles with the president and the people close to him, so hes pursuing a different strategy, arguing that he cant make wise decisions about what to cut until hes more familiar with his department and its budget, said one of the current officials, a State Department veteran. Tillerson said in Tokyo on Thursday that his departments current spending is simply not sustainable, and that he accepted the challenge Trump had given him. He is making a very sensible calculation, said a former U.S. official, noting that Congress, not the president, holds the purse strings and is almost certain to reject many of the administrations proposed cuts. You state your loyalty to the president, and then you know that you will not actually have to live with the presidents budget. It is not yet clear, however whether Trump and Tillerson have significant policy differences or if he can defend his department against some of Trumps closest aides such as Steve Bannon who want to dismantle parts of the federal government and limit U.S. engagement with the world, said three of the current and former officials.  The former Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) CEO has faced multiple challenges in his first weeks as chief U.S. diplomat, including unpredictable policy pronouncements from Trump.  White House officials vetoed Elliot Abrams, Tillersons choice for deputy secretary, the departments second-highest post, one of the current officials said. With that job still vacant, it has not been possible to fill the departments other senior positions. Despite that defeat, Michael Anton, a National Security Council spokesman, said the White House holds Tillerson in high regard. President Trump has the utmost confidence in the Secretary of State and looks forward to Mr. Tillerson implementing a bold agenda to revitalize American foreign policy, Anton said. A White House official said Tillerson has had good access to the president, including multiple lunches, dinners and meetings. Tillerson dined with Trump on Monday, the night before he flew to Asia. Tillerson has kept a low profile since joining the administration seven weeks ago, spending little time with key State Department officials and only holding his first news conference on Thursday in Tokyo. He has drawn criticism from many State Department officials who believe he has failed to cultivate potential allies in Trumps cabinet and on Capitol Hill.   Chas Freeman, a seasoned diplomat since the Nixon administration, said Tillersons low-key style might be a survival tactic. If he says something, he runs a big risk of getting crosswise with Trump, Freeman said. This may be a Fabian strategy, referring to the Roman statesman Fabius who defeated the Carthaginian general Hannibal by avoiding frontal conflict.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - President Donald Trumps proposal to do away with the federal agency that investigates chemical accidents drew sharp criticism from environmental, labor and safety advocates, who said that  eliminating the watchdog would put American lives at risk. Christine Todd Whitman, the former U.S. Environmental Protection Agency head, on Thursday called the proposal to get rid of Chemical Safety Board (CSB) and cut EPA funding short-sighted, saying both have long been an industry target for advocating greater public information on chemicals.   If you want to put the American people in danger this is the way to do it, she said of the presidents proposal to cut the CSBs funding entirely from the 2018 federal budget. The chemical industry has fought back from the beginning.  The CSB investigates major chemicals accidents to search for their causes and makes recommendations that could prevent a recurrence. It has no regulatory power, but is influential because its recommendations are often adopted by industry, labor, government officials, the EPA and Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The president on Thursday outlined a plan for fiscal 2018 discretionary spending, which exclude programs like Social Security, that removes allocations for 19 independent bodies, including the CSB and Corporation for Public Broadcasting.      The CSB, which has an annual budget of about $12 million, defended its work, saying its work has broadly improved safety. As this process moves forward, we hope that the important mission of this agency will be preserved, the agency said in a statement.  Chemical and energy industry officials offered limited comment on the proposal. Petroleum and refining industry groups, Exxon Mobil Corp, BP plc and Tesoro Corp did not respond or declined to comment directly on the potential phase out. The American Chemistry Council, a trade group that represents major chemicals producers, said in a statement it would work with the administration and Congress to ensure EPA has funding to carry out essential responsibilities. It did not comment directly on the CSB. The American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry trade group, said it looked forward to working with the administration and Congress as all of these issues work their way through the budget process. Michael Wright, director of health, safety and environment at the United Steelworkers union, said the CSBs recommendations generally have been welcome by labor and industry. One such recommendation that stemmed from a fatal 2005 refinery incident  included barring portable trailers that cannot withstand an explosion.  The boards reviews of major accidents have proved significant. Its probes have led to industry standards on worker fatigue, greater reporting of hazardous chemicals to first responders, and have prompted companies to keep workers not directly involved in projects out of harms way.  In California, many of the boards safety recommendations have been drafted into law. For example, the state worker safety agency, known as Cal/OSHA, has doubled its investigative staff based on CSB recommendations. This is one of the best bargains in Washington, said the USWs Wright. If it has prevented even one accident, it has saved far more money than its budget over its entire history. Its probe of the fatal Deepwater Horizon rig explosion was controversial because of its two-year length and extensive need for outside help. The work led to new standards for safety in the offshore oil industry and in well equipment.  But some recommendations have not been yet been implemented. After a fatal 2013 explosion in West, Texas, that killed 12 first responders the CSB proposed facilities that store large amounts of fertilizer be covered by emergency planning laws that give first responders more information. That remains open.  Beth Rosenberg, a former CSB board member and now an assistant professor at Tufts University School of Medicine, said the CSB does excellent work; other countries admire this agency. She said opponents dont know what theyre doing here or how useful this board is.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""HONOLULU/NEW YORK (Reuters) - A defiant President Donald Trump has pledged to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary to fight for his revised travel ban, parts of which were halted by two different federal judges in recent days.  The legal path forward will be challenging, though, as lawsuits work their way through federal courts on opposite sides of the country, in Hawaii and Maryland. On Thursday, a federal judge in Washington state said he was also weighing a temporary restraining order. The Justice Departments first step would likely be filing an appeal in either or both of the cases it lost this week, an action likely to come within days. Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores declined to comment on the administrations intentions. In granting a temporary restraining order against the ban challenged in a lawsuit brought by the state of Hawaii, U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson found on Wednesday that a reasonable, objective observer ... would conclude that the executive order was issued with a purpose to disfavor a particular religion. Trumps executive order would temporarily ban refugees as well as travelers from six predominantly Muslim countries. The president has said the ban is needed for national security.  Early on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang issued a nationwide preliminary injunction in a case in Maryland brought by refugee resettlement agencies represented by the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Immigration Law Center. Chuang ruled that the groups were likely to succeed in showing that the travel ban portion of the executive order was intended to be a ban on Muslims, and as a result, violates the U.S. Constitutions religious freedom guarantee. He did not enjoin the refugee portion of the ban.  To avoid sowing seeds of division in our nation, upholding this fundamental constitutional principle at the core of our nations identity plainly serves a significant public interest, Chuang wrote in his ruling. The court orders, while victories for the plaintiffs, are only an early step in litigation and the government could ultimately win its underlying case. Watson and Chuang were appointed to the bench by former Democratic President Barack Obama.  Trump, speaking after the Hawaii ruling at a rally in Nashville on Wednesday, called his revised executive order a watered-down version of his first. The president said he would take the case as far as it needs to go, including to the Supreme Court, in order to get a ruling that the ban is legal. The Trump administration won a small legal victory later on Thursday. U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle, who last month blocked Trumps first travel ban, ruled that the second travel ban was different enough from the first that he would not simply apply a preliminary injunction he issued against the first ban to the second one. He said he was weighing a request for a temporary restraining order on the new travel ban. The likely next stops if the administration decides to contest the two rulings that it lost this week would be the 4th and 9th U.S. circuit courts of appeal. Both may be frosty venues for Trumps arguments, with majorities of the judges in each appointed by Democratic presidents.  Three judges on the 9th Circuit upheld Robarts order last month on the first travel ban. Rather than appeal further, the administration withdrew the ban, promising to retool it in ways that would address the legal issues. The Supreme Court is currently split between four conservative and four liberal justices, with no ninth justice since the death of Antonin Scalia more than a year ago. Trumps nominee to fill the vacant Supreme Court seat, Neil Gorsuch, a 49-year-old conservative, is likely to be asked about the travel ban next week when he goes before the Senate Judiciary Committee for a confirmation hearing.  Republicans are hoping that the Senate votes to confirm Gorsuch for the court by mid-April, which would likely be too late for him to weigh in on an emergency appeal about the travel ban. Trump signed the new ban on March 6 in a bid to overcome legal problems with his January executive order, which caused chaos at airports and sparked mass protests before Robart stopped its enforcement in February. Watsons order is only temporary until the broader arguments in the case can be heard. He set an expedited hearing schedule to determine if his ruling should be extended.

We did discuss the question of immigration, which is so important to the fabric of our people. And I know that in this country, this is an issue that the administration and the president are reflecting upon...We discussed that very constructively this morning, Kenny said at a lunch event, hosted by House Speaker Paul Ryan at the U.S. Capitol after the two met at the White House. Kennys tone was much more convivial than when he spoke in the Irish parliament in June last year, describing the then presidential candidates rhetoric as racist and dangerous.  Trump has vowed to take a hard line against illegal immigrants, promising to speed up deportations, especially against those with criminal records.  Kenny told reporters after their meeting that he would recommend that any illegal Irish immigrants living in the United States with what he called small issues, such as parking fees or traffic violations, clear those as a way to reduce anxiety about their status in the country. The two also discussed the effects of Britains exit from the European Union, as well as Northern Ireland, where a recent provincial election saw nationalists Sinn Fein gain ground, Kenny said. Kenny has signaled his intention to step down as Irelands prime minister, a move some expect could occur after he returns from his U.S. visit. Trump did not publicly address the illegal immigration topic but he did tout the contributions of Irish immigrants to the United States.

The tweet, which was copied and shared widely before being deleted, came a day after the Twitter accounts of a number of major news organizations, chief executives, government agencies and other high-profile users were hijacked. Based on our investigation, we have determined that our Twitter account was hacked by an external source. We took swift action to secure it, and we apologize this tweet was sent through our corporate McDonalds account, McDonalds spokeswoman Terri Hickey said in a statement.      Corporate accounts are attractive targets due to their large followings and the media attention that errant tweets can attract. Twitter Inc allows for two-factor authentication, a security feature that would deter many attempts to seize an account.  Twitter declined comment on Thursday citing privacy and security reasons. The tweet sent from @McDonaldsCorp on Thursday morning read: @realdonaldtrump You are actually a disgusting excuse of a President and we would love to have @BarackObama back, also you have tiny hands. Trump did not respond to the incident on Twitter.  High-profile Twitter accounts were hijacked on Wednesday to send anti-Nazi messages in Turkish in the midst of a diplomatic spat between Turkey, the Netherlands and Germany. Twitter said on Wednesday that the source of that attack was a third-party app, whose permissions have since been removed.  Trump, one of the more fast-food friendly presidents in recent years, had tweeted pictures of himself eating food from McDonalds and other chains during the U.S. election campaign. A 2002 ad campaign featured Trump and the chains Grimace mascot promoting an amazing $1 deal for McDonalds since-discontinued Big N Tasty burger. The incident came as McDonalds is bolstering its digital capabilities with mobile and kiosk ordering to help modernize the 60-year-old chain.   Analysts said the hack raised questions about security at Twitter, but was unlikely to do much damage to the restaurant chains brand.  As long as Trump doesnt tweet at them directly, which could be pretty disastrous, this will be a short-term thing for them, said Mike Froggatt, director of intelligence at L2, which monitors the digital performance of brands. Twitter trending topics last for maybe 6 hours, a backlash for 10 to 12 hours and then it goes and the herd moves on, said Froggatt. The message from the account of the worlds largest restaurant chain caused a sensation on Twitter, where users shared copies of the deleted tweet and offered jokes and comments.  Vanessa Veasley and other users speculated that Trump supporters could attempt to launch a boycott of the chain, as they threatened to do when Starbucks Corp Chief Executive Howard Schultz vowed to hire 10,000 refugees after Trumps first executive order temporarily banning refugees from certain countries. McDonalds already deleted the tweet? lol Well at least Trump supporters can finally boycott something they can actually afford, Veasley (@VanessaVeasley) wrote. Other users praised the fast-food chain, which has been fighting to reverse two straight years of customer traffic declines.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Deeply divided Republicans squeezed their U.S. healthcare overhaul, backed by President Donald Trump, through a key House of Representatives panel on Thursday despite defections by three conservatives who consider it too similar to the Obamacare law it is intended to replace. Trumps first major legislative initiative still faces an uphill battle in the full House and later the Senate despite ongoing efforts by the White House and Republican leaders to satisfy conservative opponents. The Budget Committee vote was 19 to 17, with Republican Representatives David Brat, Gary Palmer and Mark Sanford - all members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus - joining the panels Democrats in voting against it. The committee brought provisions approved last week by two other panels into a single bill, helping pave the way for a later vote on the House floor. Republicans, who control Congress and the White House, could not afford to lose more than three from their ranks on the committee for it to pass. I dont think we are anywhere near passage, Brat said after the vote, noting that Republican conservatives as well as moderates had problems with the bill. The 2010 Affordable Care Act, the signature legislative achievement of former President Barack Obama, enabled about 20 million previously uninsured Americans to obtain medical coverage. About half of those were through the laws expansion of eligibility and increased funding for the Medicaid government health insurance program for the poor.  The close vote illustrated the problems Republican leaders may encounter in corralling enough votes in their party to win passage on the House floor amid unified Democratic opposition. The measure now goes to the Rules Committee before reaching the House floor. The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan congressional agency, forecast on Monday that the legislation would increase the number of Americans without health insurance by 24 million by 2026, while cutting $337 billion from federal budget deficits over the same period. The bill faces opposition from leading healthcare providers, including doctors and hospitals. We are on track and on schedule, House Speaker Paul Ryan, who unveiled the legislation last week and is its chief champion in the House, said after the committees vote. He added that while the main parts of the bill are going to stay exactly as they are, Republicans were making unspecified improvements and refinements. Ryan told a news conference that Trump was deeply involved and helping bridge gaps among Republican lawmakers to get a consensus plan. Conservatives were unmoved. Theres no natural constituency for this bill, said Republican Representative Raul Labrador, another Freedom Caucus member. The Left is really mad about it. The Right is really mad about it. The middle is really mad about it. And so far it just seems to be a constituency of one, which is Washington insiders, people that are just trying to get something passed so they can get to the next issue.  Trump administration officials and House Republican leaders have said they hope to get the bill to the House floor by the end of the month so it can go to the Senate before lawmakers mid-April recess. Conservatives want a quicker end to the Obamacare Medicaid expansion, which the bill has set for 2020, and want to add work requirements for some Medicaid recipients. They also call the age-based tax credits to help people buy insurance on the open market an unwise new entitlement. The White House said it was discussing changes with House Republican leaders. Trump told a Fox News interviewer on Wednesday that much of the bill would still be negotiated, especially as it moves from the House to the Senate. Conservative advocacy groups praised the Republicans who voted no. Club for Growth President David McIntosh said it makes no sense for Ryan and Budget Committee chair Diane Black to force Republicans to walk the plank and vote for a bad bill that theyve already admitted needs to be changed. Black asked fellow Republicans who had doubts not to cut off the discussion by voting no. After approving the legislation, the panel adopted four non-binding Republican recommendations for changes before it moves to the House floor, including one by the conservative Palmer on adding work requirements for able-bodied, childless Medicaid recipients. The other recommendations called for no longer encouraging people to sign up for insurance through Medicaid, giving states more flexibility in designing Medicaid programs, and changing the bills tax credits to help lower-income people more. Democrats have called the Republicans plan a blow to the elderly and the poor while giving tax cuts to the rich. Representative John Yarmuth, the committees top Democrat, said the legislation was not a healthcare bill; it is an ideological document. He said the bill imagined a fantasy land where young people dont get sick, and apparently they dont grow old either, because they dont have to worry about being priced out of the market.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""NEW YORK (Reuters) - Federal and state prosecutors said on Thursday they would not bring criminal charges against New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio or his aides in two simultaneous year-long investigations into his fundraising practices. But the mayors conduct was criticized by prosecutors, with Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance saying de Blasios fundraising for other Democratic candidates in 2014 appeared to violate the intent and spirit of state campaign finance laws. The decisions are a victory for de Blasio, who was dogged by questions about the probes as he prepared to run for re-election this year. It is unusual for prosecutors to announce the conclusion of criminal inquiries. In a statement, Acting U.S. Attorney Joon Kim in Manhattan said it was done in order not to unduly influence the upcoming campaign and mayoral election. At a news conference, de Blasio said the statements confirmed he and his administration had acted lawfully. He dismissed questions pointing out that prosecutors criticized his actions despite deciding not to pursue a case. I do not agree with some of the characterizations, he said. What matters is the fact that this was extensively investigated for a year, and no charges have been brought. U.S. prosecutors had probed whether the de Blasio administration gave favors to donors who contributed either to his campaign or to a nonprofit organization set up to promote his political agenda. In a statement, Kim said his office had investigated several circumstances in which the mayor or his associates contacted or directed agencies on behalf of donors. The decision not to prosecute, Kim said, was made based on several factors, including the particular difficulty in proving criminal intent in corruption schemes where there is no evidence of personal profit. Vances office separately examined whether de Blasio steered campaign contributions to county committees in order to sidestep New York state campaign finance limits. In a 10-page letter to the state Board of Elections, whose own inquiry led to his investigation, Vance detailed how de Blasio and his allies sought to help Democrats win a majority in the state Senate in 2014. Wealthy donors were encouraged to give to county committees rather than individual candidates because the limits are much higher for the committees. The money then flowed from the committees to individual candidates, often within days. While each individual transaction appeared lawful, the overall effect was to evade campaign finance law by creating an end run around contribution limits, Vance said. But Vance said the transfers were approved by an election law attorney working with the coordinated campaign. Under the law, an individual who acts on the advice of an attorney is typically shielded from prosecution. The conclusion not to bring charges is not an endorsement of the conduct at issue, wrote Vance. Though City Hall was spared, the investigations have previously uncovered multiple unrelated schemes, including some involving high-ranking police officials. The federal probe was initially centered on two businessmen, Jona Rechnitz and Jeremy Reichberg, who helped raise money for de Blasio in 2013 and 2014. Reichberg and several police officials were charged in June with a bribery scheme involving prostitutes and luxury trips. Rechnitz had already pleaded guilty in secret and cooperated with investigators. His assistance also helped prosecutors build a case against the once-powerful head of the citys correction officers union, Norman Seabrook, who was charged alongside a hedge fund financier with secretly investing union pension funds in exchange for kickbacks. In yet another fraud linked to the probe, U.S. prosecutors charged two police officers and a Brooklyn man, Alex Lichtenstein, in a bribery scheme involving gun licenses. He was sentenced to more than 2-1/2 years in prison on Thursday after pleading guilty. Another peripheral figure, restaurateur Hamlet Peralta, was charged last year with running a $12 million Ponzi scheme in a case that grew out of the probe. Several high-ranking police officials have been disciplined as a result of the investigation into Rechnitz and Reichberg. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trumps administration on Thursday proposed a 31 percent cut to the Environmental Protection Agencys budget, as the White House seeks to eliminate climate change programs and trim initiatives to protect air and water quality.  The EPA would sustain the biggest cut of any federal agency in the White House 2018 budget, as Trump seeks to clear away regulations he claims are hobbling U.S. oil drillers, coal miners and farmers. The proposed cuts are a starting point, and Congress could temper them in its budget deliberations. The proposal would slash funding for enforcing regulations, fighting water pollution, cleaning up sites contaminated by toxic waste and promoting energy-efficient appliances. It would eliminate 3,200 EPA employees, or 19 percent of the agencys workforce. It would effectively erase former President Barack Obamas initiatives to combat climate change by cutting funding for the agencys signature Clean Power Plan aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Consistent with the Presidents America First Energy Plan, the budget reorients the EPAs air program to protect the air we breathe without unduly burdening the American economy, a summary of the proposed EPA budget said. Some lawmakers from Trumps Republican party praised the proposed cuts, but some expressed concern about cuts to programs affecting their region of the country. Environmentalists blasted the plan, saying it would return America back to 1977 when smoggy skies and polluted rivers pushed lawmakers to strengthen federal clean air and clean water laws. Scott Pruitt, the EPA administrator, disputes the scientific consensus that human actions are the lead cause of climate change. In his former position as attorney general of oil-producing Oklahoma, he sued the EPA more than a dozen times. Pruitt believes Congress should determine whether carbon dioxide is a pollutant that needs regulation. With both chambers currently led by Republicans, and influential committees headed by lawmakers from oil-producing states, that is unlikely anytime soon.      The budget would also eliminate some $100 million in spending on research and international programs on combating climate change. Trump also doubts the science of climate change and has said the country can reduce green regulations drastically without compromising air and water quality.  Asked about climate change programs, Mick Mulvaney, Trumps budget director, told reporters we consider that to be a waste of your money.  I think the president is fairly straightforward. Were not spending money on that, he said.    The EPA had already faced sharp cuts under Obama. Janet McCabe, a former EPA air official, said Trumps proposed budget would harm the EPAs ability to respond to emergencies and also hurt day-to-day efforts on keeping air and water clean to protect human health.  The proposed cuts would cut $427 million aimed at regional pollution cleanup programs, including in the Great Lakes and Chesapeake Bay. Funding for the Superfund program to clean up the nations most contaminated sites would drop by $330 million to $762 million. The summary said the budget seeks to give local and state governments responsibility for such clean-up efforts. Many states and municipalities also face severe budget constraints in the current fiscal environment.  Trumps proposal includes a 31 percent budget cut for the enforcement division, which fines companies for pollution. It would ax dozens of other programs including the popular Energy Star appliance efficiency program aimed at reducing U.S. energy consumption.  Turning back the clock to 1977 will not Make America Great Again. It will Make America Gag Again, said Conrad Schneider, the advocacy director at Clean Air Task Force.  One area that would see a small boost is for State Revolving Funds, low-interest loans for investments in water and sanitation infrastructure. The plan would add $4 million to the funds, bringing its budget up to $100 million. While employees at EPA headquarters in Washington worried about their jobs, some hoped opportunities might open up at the other side of the country.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The leaders of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee issued a bipartisan statement on Thursday rejecting President Donald Trumps assertion that the Obama administration tapped his phones during the 2016 presidential campaign. The top Republican in Congress, House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, added his voice to a growing chorus of lawmakers saying there was no sign of a wiretap. In a testy briefing with reporters, White House spokesman Sean Spicer forcefully defended the president, citing news reports of intelligence collection on possible contacts between Trump associates and Russia in the presidential campaign. There is no question that there were surveillance techniques used throughout this, Spicer said. The Republican president, without providing evidence, has accused his predecessor, Democrat Barack Obama, of wiretapping him near the end of the campaign. An Obama spokesman said that was simply false.  Based on the information available to us, we see no indications that Trump Tower was the subject of surveillance by any element of the United States government either before or after Election Day 2016, Richard Burr, the Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Senator Mark Warner, the committees Democratic vice chairman, said in a statement. Ryan also said there was no evidence of surveillance. The point is, the intelligence committees in their continuing, widening, ongoing investigation of all things Russia, got to the bottom - at least so far - with respect to our intelligence community that - that no such wiretap existed, the House speaker told reporters. Pressed at the White House briefing on whether Trump would back down from his wiretap accusations, Spicer said: He stands by it. Spicer also chastised the media for focusing so much attention on comments disparaging Trumps claim about surveillance. He said reporters had not focused enough on comments from officials denying evidence of any collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. The Russian government has rejected an accusation by U.S. intelligence agencies that it worked to influence the election in Trumps favor by hacking computer systems, among other methods. Trump has been dogged by allegations that his associates had ties to Russian officials. Trump fired his national security adviser, Michael Flynn, last month after he failed to disclose contacts with Russias ambassador before Trump took office on Jan. 20. An official familiar with the investigations by Congress and intelligence and law enforcement agencies said investigators had looked as aggressively and thoroughly as they could for evidence of any spying on Trump or his associates but had found none. On March 4, six weeks after he took over from Obama, Trump made the wiretap accusations in a Twitter post. How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!, Trump wrote. At least four congressional committees included the startling accusation in their investigations of possible Russian meddling in the election campaign and Russian ties to Trump and his associates. On Wednesday, House of Representatives Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, a Republican, and top Democrat Adam Schiff told reporters they had seen no evidence that Trump Tower was tapped and said they would ask Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey about the issue during a public hearing on Monday. On March 9, Comey briefed Nunes, Schiff, Ryan, Burr, Warner  and three other top congressional officials on the same intelligence.  Trump appeared to back away from his accusation of wiretapping in a Fox News interview on Wednesday night. But wiretap covers a lot of different things. I think youre going to find some very interesting items coming to the forefront over the next two weeks, Trump said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trumps proposal to defund programs to clean up the Chesapeake Bay and the Great Lakes, two of the countrys largest water systems, brought scorn on Thursday from a bipartisan array of lawmakers who vowed to fight the cuts. Members of Congress said the proposal to wipe out Environmental Protection Agency funds to clean up the Great Lakes and the fragile Chesapeake Bay ecosystem threatened the environment as well as tens of billions of dollars in economic benefits. Senator Rob Portman, a Republican of Ohio, rejected the  proposed spending cut for the Great Lakes program. I have long championed this program, and Im committed to continuing to do everything I can to protect and preserve Lake Erie, he said in a statement, referring to the Great Lake that forms his states northern border. Without specifically addressing the clean-up program cuts, White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said the administrations proposed 31 percent reduction in EPA spending reflected the presidents view that a big shift was needed in government policies on the environment.  You can expect reductions in the EPA that dont line up with the presidents view on things like global warming and alternative energies, Mulvaney told reporters during a briefing on the budget plan, which would slash the EPA budget by $2.6 billion. Trump has called climate change a hoax. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about lawmakers criticism of the programs elimination.  Trumps proposal would eliminate $73 million a year that six states and the District of Columbia receive to clean up the Chesapeake, the largest U.S. estuary. The bay is slowly recovering under a federal-state plan to reduce inflows of nitrogen, phosphorus and sediments from farms and urban development. Also on the block is the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, which has disbursed about $300 million a year to help eight states in the region recover industrial sites in harbors, block invasive species like the Asian carp and stem fertilizer run-off from farmland. Trumps budget proposal, released on Thursday, says states and local governments should shoulder the funding burden for such projects, while the EPA focuses on top national priorities. Senator Debbie Stabenow, a Democrat whose state of Michigan borders four of the five Great Lakes, in a statement called the proposed cuts outrageous. The clean-up program, she said, has always received bipartisan support and continues to be absolutely critical to protecting our Great Lakes. A Brookings Institution study last year found that carrying out the Great Lakes clean-up plan would generate $80 billion to $100 billion in economic benefits, including tourism, increased property values and reduced costs to local governments. Portman and Stabenow were among 11 senators who sent a letter to EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt before the proposed budget came out. The lawmakers urged him to keep Great Lakes spending intact. Another 17 lawmakers sent a similar letter to Trump about the Chesapeake Bay program. Senator Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, called the planned cuts short-sighted because the Chesapeake Bay generated millions of dollars in revenue each year and supported thousands of fishery and tourism jobs. I will be working with all my colleagues from the region to urge congressional appropriators to reject the Presidents request and ensure we dont endanger the years of progress that have been made in restoring the health of the Chesapeake Bay, he said in a statement. Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat of Maryland, also said the spending cuts would damage the environment and threaten jobs that depend on a healthy Chesapeake Bay ecosystem. Representative Andy Harris, the sole Republican in Marylands congressional delegation, defended the budget proposal. He said he would work with the Trump administration to prioritize EPA programs that would preserve the bay clean-up, but increases in defense and national spending were needed to keep Americans safe. Amelia Chasse, a spokeswoman for Maryland Republican Governor Larry Hogan, said in an email that if the proposed Chesapeake Bay cuts program went through, Hogans administration would try to deal with them in the state budget next year. He will always fight to protect our states most important natural asset, she said. The Chesapeake Bay Foundation, a conservation group, called on supporters to urge Congress to fight the proposed cuts. Bob Irvin, president of American Rivers, an environmental group, said the cuts threatened the success that had been made with the Chesapeake Bay. I cant imagine that any people of the people in the Chesapeake Bay region, when they voted in the last election, that they were voting to stop the clean-up of the Chesapeake Bay, he said in a telephone interview.

(Reuters) - Florida Governor Rick Scott on Thursday replaced a local prosecutor who declared she would not seek the death penalty in a case against a man accused of killing an Orlando police officer and refused to recuse herself. In an executive order, Scott removed State Attorney Aramis Ayala, the elected prosecutor in central Floridas Ninth Judicial Circuit, and reassigned the murder case to State Attorney Brad King of the nearby Fifth Judicial Circuit. Ayala, at a news conference earlier on Thursday, said Floridas death penalty system was the cause of legal chaos and said she would not seek the death penalty against Markeith Loyd, charged in the Jan. 9 shooting of the policewoman. He was arrested after an intensive manhunt that drew widespread attention. The statement by Ayala, who took office early this year, outraged law enforcement groups, some state lawmakers and State Attorney General Pam Bondi. But several groups, including Amnesty International USA and the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, rose to her defense. She has made it clear that she will not fight for justice and that is why I am using my executive authority to immediately reassign the case to State Attorney Brad King, Scott said in a statement. After a discussion with Scott on Thursday afternoon, Ayala issued a statement saying she offered to have a full conversation about her decision, but he declined to explore my reasoning. Upon receipt of any lawful order, my office will follow that order and fully cooperate to ensure the successful prosecution of Markeith Loyd, she said. Floridas governor signed legislation on Monday tightening state law to require a unanimous recommendation by a jury before judges can impose the death penalty. The law is the states latest effort to restart its death penalty process, which was put on hold twice last year after rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court and the Florida Supreme Court in separate cases. Loyd was arrested on Jan. 7 after a nine-day manhunt that followed the shooting death of Orlando police Master Sargent Debra Clayton. At the time, Loyd was already a suspect in the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon, in December. Florida prisons hold 382 people who have been sentenced to die. Some have been on death row since the 1970s because the process of appealing death penalty verdicts can take decades.      ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The former Exxon Mobil Corp CEO faces multiple challenges in his unfamiliar role as chief U.S. diplomat, including a boss in U.S. President Donald Trump who makes unpredictable policy pronouncements and does not take kindly to criticism or contradiction, said four current officials. Relations between U.S. presidents and their chief diplomats have varied widely in history, but those between Trump and Tillerson are especially important because of potential conflicts between the unsettled state of the world and Trumps America First agenda, two of the officials said. As a result, they said, speaking on the condition of anonymity, Tillerson is trying to keep a low profile, which is his natural instinct, and seeking a way to make his case on foreign policy without being drawn into losing battles. One case in point is Thursdays White House proposal to cut spending on U.S. diplomacy and foreign aid by some 28 percent, a sign that the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development are not Trump priorities.On Thursday in Tokyo, Tillerson said the State Departments current spending is simply not sustainable, and accepted the challenge Trump had given in proposing to cut more than a quarter of his agencys budget. He is making a very sensible calculation, said a former U.S. official, noting that Congress, not the president, holds the purse strings. You state your loyalty to the president, and then you know that you will not actually have to live with the presidents budget. NO WAY TO WIN HEAD-TO-HEAD BATTLES Two current and former officials said Tillerson is no stranger to cost cuts, having lived through waves of them at Exxon, and they suggested that he had convinced the White House to allow him to make many of the cuts himself.  Tillerson isnt opposed to cutting the budget at all, but he figured out that he couldnt win head-to-head battles with the president and the people close to him, so hes pursuing a different strategy, arguing that he cant make wise decisions about what to cut until hes more familiar with his department and its budget, said one veteran State Department official. Michael Anton, a National Security Council spokesman, said Tillerson is held in high regard at the White House. President Trump has the utmost confidence in the Secretary of State and looks forward to Mr. Tillerson implementing a bold agenda to revitalize American foreign policy, Anton said. While he is delaying some of the drastic cuts the White House wanted, it is far from clear that Tillerson can prevail over Trump aides such as Steve Bannon who want to dismantle parts of the federal government and limit U.S. engagement with the world, said three of the current and former officials. The White House veto of Elliot Abrams, Tillersons choice for deputy secretary, the departments second-highest post, drove that point home, one of the current officials said. Despite that defeat, a White House official said Tillerson has good access to the president, including multiple lunches, dinners and meetings. Tillerson dined with Trump on Monday, the night before he flew to Asia. Tillersons low profile - he held his first news conference on Thursday in Tokyo seven weeks after becoming secretary of state - has brought criticism from the media and many State Department officials that he remains invisible and has failed to cultivate potential allies in Trumps cabinet and on Capitol Hill. Chas Freeman, a retired diplomat who served as the U.S.  ambassador to Saudi Arabia and as the lead interpreter for former President Richard Nixons 1972 visit to China, said Tillersons low-key style might be a survival tactic. If he says something, he runs a big risk of getting crosswise with Trump, Freeman said. This may be a Fabian strategy, referring to the Roman statesman Fabius who defeated the Carthaginian general Hannibal by avoiding frontal conflict.

Judge Richard Clifton of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals became the latest in a series of judges to draw criticism from Trump after Clifton and two colleagues refused to reinstate an executive order temporarily barring entry by people from seven Muslim-majority countries. Shortly after the Feb. 9 ruling, Trump tweeted: SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE! He also told reporters that the ruling was political. Its easy to blame the referee when you dont like the result, Clifton said in a speech to the Conference of Western Attorneys General, which is meeting in Honolulu. It is corrosive to the system when a disappointing result, or result disappointing to you, is responded to by blaming the referee, said Clifton, who did not mention Trump by name. He urged the state attorneys general not to blame judges, saying it could lead to a breakdown in law and order. Clifton, appointed to the court by former Republican President George W. Bush, was discussing the executive order case, but did not comment on any substantive issues about the travel ban. The White House had no immediate comment on his speech. Trump has frequently attacked judges who rule against him. Last month, he called a Seattle federal judge who ruled against the first travel ban a so-called judge.

Trump has proposed slashing the USDAs discretionary budget by $4.7 billion to $17.9 billion by halting funding for rural clean water initiatives and rural business services, reducing some USDA statistical services and cutting county-level staff. The president has already vowed to alter trade deals that have largely boosted farm incomes and targeted health care policies that have particularly benefited the rural poor. Americas farmers and ranchers are struggling, and we need to be extremely careful not to exacerbate these conditions, said House Agriculture Committee Chairman Michael Conaway. Farm incomes are down 50 percent from four years ago, he added. Opposition is already building in Congress. I strongly oppose the Trump administrations proposed budget cuts to programs that are critical to farmers, ranchers and families in small towns across America, Debbie Stabenow, ranking member of the Senate Agriculture Committee. The American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF), the countrys largest organization representing farmers, said county-level USDA staffing cuts and reduced statistical services could hurt members. A lot of farmers and growers rely on USDAs statistical capabilities to make a lot of marketing and risk management decisions and planting decisions, said John Newton, AFBF director of market intelligence. The proposal did not give details of which services could be cut. Trumps blueprint aims to save $498 million by eliminating a program that helps fund clean water and sewer systems in small communities. The budget proposal would also eliminate a food aid program, which had $182 million in funding earmarked for fiscal 2017. Its planned $6.2 billion for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children is about $150 million less than fiscal 2016. Under former President Barack Obama, the program was reduced by $273 million between fiscal 2015 and 2016. The plans for USDA spending were part of Trumps budget blueprint, a broad outline of spending proposals for the fiscal year ahead. It does not cover mandatory spending established by law, like farm subsidies, only discretionary programs where lawmakers can adjust spending. The White House has said it plans to release a traditional full budget in mid-May. The USDA oversees agriculture, rural communities and nutritional programs, including funding for school lunches. The agency also publishes closely watched global farming production statistics. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Although Congress must approve the $13.5 bln request and is likely to make changes, Boeing Co would be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the administrations proposal, which included $2.3 billion for 24 F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet jet fighters. This is 10 more than the U.S. House of Representatives approved on  March 8 in its 2017 base spending bill. The Navy will use the additional money to bolster its aging fleet of fighters, Lieutenant General Anthony Ierardi, the director of Force Structure, Resources and Assessment for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Reuters. In a Dec. 22 tweet, before he was inaugurated, Trump had suggested buying more Boeing F/A-18s, which he called comparable to the Lockheed Martin F-35, despite the fact that the F-35 is a stealth aircraft difficult for enemy radar to detect. The 1990s-vintage F/A-18 is does not use stealth technology.  The Navy also proposed $920 million to buy six Boeing P-8 submarine-hunting aircraft. The Army requested $708 million for 20 Boeing Apache attack helicopters.  Lockheed Martin is also one of the big winners in the administrations proposal. Pentagon officials said the request for additional 2017 funds would help accelerate planned acquisitions of F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. The Pentagon budgeted $596 million to buy five  of the stealthy jets, which cost between $95 million and $123 million each, depending on the model.  In the past, President Trump had complained about the  tremendous cost and cost overruns of the F-35 program, which is the Pentagons most expensive weapons program. The Pentagon budgeted $151 million for Lockheeds THAAD missile defense and $376 million for 17 Blackhawk helicopters made by Sikorsky Aircraft, a Lockheed subsidiary. The proposal also requested $433 million to complete the third version of the DDG-51 Navy destroyer being built by General Dynamics Corp at Bath Iron Works in Maine. A General Accounting Office report published on Aug. 4 said the Navy has not demonstrated sufficient acquisition and design knowledge to provide an accurate estimate of the vessels cost. The administrations supplemental request takes the base Pentagon budget for fiscal 2017 to $541 billion, analyst Robert Stallard of Vertical Research said in a report on Thursday.

The lawmakers, including Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, in letters to the White House counsel and to EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, raised concerns about the billionaire investors conflicts of interests. They highlighted his involvement with a potential overhaul of the U.S. biofuels program.  Icahn has weighed in on the issue, which could cut millions of dollars in costs for refiners like CVR Energy Inc, in which he owns an 82 percent stake. We are concerned that his substantial and widespread private-sector investments present perverse incentives for Mr. Icahn in his role as a special adviser to the President, the letter to White House Counsel Donald F. McGahn II said.  Previous letters seeking details on Icahns role have gone unanswered amid signs of Icahns involvement on the issue, the senators said. Efforts to reach Icahn or his representatives were not immediately successful. Oil refiners like CVR Energy and Valero Energy Corp have pressed for a change to the Renewable Fuel Standard to meet annual biofuel standards from further downstream to companies  like fuel retailers.  The Renewable Fuel Standard requires oil refiners blend biofuels with gasoline and diesel, or buy credits from firms that have. Refiners have asked the government to shift those requirements from them further downstream to fuel retailers. The RFS has become a battleground between entrenched farm and oil interests.  A biofuels lobbyist earlier this month said Icahn told him an executive order on the issue was forthcoming, a claim that both the adviser and the White House have denied. The events of the last two weeks have underscored worries over Icahns conflicts of interest, the senators said.  Icahn has taken the first opportunity to leverage his newfound political power for his own personal gain, the letter stated, as the senators pressed for more specifics on his conversations with the Trump and Pruitt on the matter. Icahn has weighed in heavily on this issue as costs for oil refiners hit record levels in 2016. In August, he pressed the EPA under former President Barack Obama to overhaul the market for renewable fuels credits. Prices of those credits tumbled over a third on the day the White House denied any plans to issue an executive order on the matter. Shares of CVR stock jumped as much as 8 percent that day.

At a news conference with German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, Mnuchin said that President Donald Trump views trade as important for economic growth. But when asked whether the Group of 20 finance ministers should explicitly reaffirm their past vow to resist protectionism, Mnuchin repeated his view that some U.S. trade relationships need to be re-examined to make them fairer and more reciprocal.  It is not our desire to get into trade wars, Mnuchin said. The president does believe in free trade but he wants free and fair trade. Differences over trade could become a sticking point for  G20 finance officials at a meeting in the spa town of Baden-Baden, Germany this weekend. Schaeuble told Reuters in an interview that it was unclear whether the anti-protectionism language would remain in the G20 statement to be issued at the meetings close on Saturday.  Given that Trumps America First agenda, trade issues could be set aside for G20 leaders to tackle at a summit in July, Schaeuble said. But both Schaeuble and Mnuchin both said they had a constructive discussion ahead of the G20 meeting and pledged to work together through differences to promote growth. It was a good start, Schaeuble said of the meeting, adding that it was a positive sign for international cooperation and the G20 process. We have found a good basis to talk openly about issues where we dont have the same stance from the outset, Schaeuble said. Mnuchin said the ministers agreed that they should fight currency manipulation. The US Treasury chief declined to comment specifically on the euros current value, but in a shift away from criticism by White House National Trade Council Director Peter Navarro that Germany has benefited unfairly from the euros weakness, Mnuchin acknowledged that the euro is used by many countries and is affected by many factors.  It is different than a single currency controlled by a single country, Mnuchin said of the euro. He also said that for trade, he views the European Union as both a single bloc as well as individual countries. Regarding the U.S. dollar, Mnuchin reiterated his view that a strengthening dollar was good for the long run, but declined to comment on short term movements in the dollar. In recent weeks, he has said that short-term dollar spikes can be negative for the U.S. economy.

Trump is also seeking to upgrade long-underfunded facilities at the U.S. militarys Guantanamo Bay detention center in Cuba that Trumps Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, unsuccessfully sought to close during his eight-year administration. It doesnt seem like we are going to close it anytime soon, John Roth, the acting Pentagon comptroller, told a Pentagon news briefing, explaining the move.  The proposals were part of a $30 billion supplemental request to Congress to add more money to the Pentagons budget during the governments ongoing fiscal year, which began under the Obama administration and ends in September. It includes plans to crank up U.S. funding for the fight against Islamic State militants for items like high-tech bombs and defenses against insurgents drones, bringing overall spending on the campaign to the highest level yet, the Pentagon said. This will likely be our largest request, Roth said. One analyst called the $2 billion flexible spending request a Pentagon slush fund, and many lawmakers were expected to be reluctant to loosen oversight over how the Pentagon spends money. What Trumps additional funding might mean for Americas evolving war strategy against Islamic State in the coming months was not immediately clear.  But the request comes as U.S.-backed forces in Iraq and Syria are entering a critical phase in their campaign to retake Islamic States two biggest cities of Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria. Trumps administration is weighing deployment of more U.S. troops. The heads of the top U.S. congressional committees that oversee the Pentagon have criticized Trumps 2018 budget request, saying even more money was needed. It is clear to virtually everyone that we have cut our military too much and that it has suffered enormous damage, said Republican Representative Mac Thornberry, chairman of the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee.  Todd Harrison at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington questioned whether Trumps budget wish list could muster enough support among Democrats,  whose votes would be needed to sign off on the spending bills given the slim Republican hold on the Senate.        Trump said during the election campaign that he not only wanted to keep the Guantanamo Bay detention center open but load it up with some bad dudes. Trumps $5.1 billion overseas contingency operations request included a provision for $1.1 billion in additional funds for a range of Pentagon projects, including planning and design of construction projects in support of Detention Operations at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The prison, which was opened by Republican President George W. Bush to hold terrorism suspects captured overseas after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks came to symbolize harsh detention practices that opened the United States to accusations of torture. Obama reduced the inmate population to 41, but fell short of fulfilling his promise to close the jail. The 2017 request would also hike spending for the broader Defense Department over the next six months, with $24.9 billion more sought to readiness needs after years of complaints over congressionally imposed spending caps. Lockheed Martin would be one of the biggest beneficiaries of that proposal. Some $13.5 billion would be spent on more military hardware, including five F-35 warplanes as well as Army Blackhawk helicopters made by Sikorsky Aircraft, a Lockheed subsidiary.  Trump also wants 12 interceptors for the THAAD missile defense system. The United States is now deploying THAAD in South Korea in response to North Koreas ballistic missile and nuclear tests. Boeing would also gain with $2.4 billion for an additional 24 of its F/A-18 E/F jet fighters.

Erdogan and the Turkish government want the United States to extradite Fethullah Gulen, a U.S.-based Islamic cleric who Ankara blames for orchestrating last years failed coup. Gulen denies involvement in the coup attempt. Ankara has also been angered by U.S. support for the Kurdish YPG militia fighting Islamic State in Syria. It is adamant that Washington should switch support for the planned Raqqa offensive from the YPG militia to Syrian rebels that Turkey has trained.  For the U.S. administration, nervous about whether the Turkish-backed force is large enough and sufficiently trained, the decision sets Trumps wish for quick battlefield victories against the need to maintain its strategic alliance with Turkey. Ankara views the YPG as the Syrian extension of the Kurdish PKK militant group, which has fought an insurgency in Turkeys southeast since 1984 and is considered a terrorist group by both the United States and European Union. Erdogan believes ties will improve under Trump. A phone call between the two earlier last month was positive, sources in Erdogans office have said.

The move signals that President Donald Trump may consider that nuclear waste solutions could extend the lives of existing U.S. nuclear power plants and speed up innovations in next- generation nuclear plants that backers say are safer than previous reactors.   Congress will debate the budget and it is uncertain whether funds for waste will remain in the plan. While Yucca Mountain would store waste on a practically permanent basis, the budget money would also support programs for storing waste at interim sites before Yucca opens.  These investments would accelerate progress on fulfilling the federal governments obligations to address nuclear waste, enhance national security, and reduce future taxpayer burden, according to a summary of the budget. Yucca has been studied by the U.S. government since the 1970s as a potential repository for the nations radioactive waste and billions of dollars have been spent on it. But Yucca has never opened because of legal challenges and widespread opposition from local politicians, environmentalists and Native American groups. In 2010, then-President Barack Obama withdrew the license to store waste at Yucca amid opposition from then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a fellow Democrat from Nevada. Maria Korsnick, the head of the Nuclear Energy Institute industry group, said the industry was encouraged by the plan for waste projects but that nuclear energy innovators were nervous about cuts to programs that have supported public-private partnerships to bring new nuclear technologies to market. The budget eliminates funding for the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Energy and an innovative technology loan guarantee program that have been popular with both Democrats and many Republicans.    Trumps energy secretary, Rick Perry, told lawmakers at his confirmation hearing that restarting the Yucca Mountain project could not be ruled out, but that he would collaborate with states. I am very aware that this is an issue this country has been flummoxed by for 30 years. We have spent billions of dollars on this issue, Perry told the hearing in January. Ill work closely with you and the members of this committee to find the answers to this issue. The White House proposal for the Department of Energy budget calls for an overall cut of 5.6 percent.

Fifty-one votes were required for confirmation. The only Republican who voted against Coats was Senator Rand Paul, one of the Senates leading privacy advocates, as are several of the Democrats who also voted against Coats.  Democratic Senator Ron Wyden had said he would object to Coats nomination because he felt the office of the Director of National Intelligence had not provided the committee with enough information about how many Americans communication records had been subjected to government surveillance. McMaster was approved as Trumps second national security adviser in an 86-10 vote. No Republican senator voted against him. McMaster had faced some opposition from Democratic senators who cited concerns about his past decision to allow two service members accused of assault to advance their careers while the case against them was open, in violation of Army regulations. The Senate does not normally approve a presidents national security adviser but McMasters reappointment to his new position had to be considered by the Senate because he is an active-duty military officer. McMaster, 54, who is known for speaking his mind and challenging his superiors, replaces retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, who was fired as national security adviser on Feb. 13 after reports emerged that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about speaking to Russias ambassador to the United States about U.S. sanctions before Trump took office.

However, President Donald Trumps first crack at the budget, released on Thursday, took skinny to a new, anemic level as he laid out his plans for boosting military spending, and cutting foreign aid and an array of domestic programs. Spreadsheets are out. Bullet points are in. Weighing in at a mere 53 pages, and containing just four slender tables, Trumps budget had little meat on its bones for experts hungry to dive into the details of the new administrations fiscal policy. That may make it the skinniest skinny budget, by far, compared with the 40 years of presidential budgets in transition years tracked by the Congressional Research Service (CRS). When President Jimmy Carter took office, his first budget document was 101 pages, the CRS said. President George H.W. Bushs first take was 193 pages, and President George W. Bushs was around the same length, at 207 pages. President Bill Clintons first budget document was 145 pages, while President Barack Obamas initial take was a leaner 134 pages. The difference is in focus. Trumps budget looks only at discretionary programs for the year ahead, accounting for only about a third of the overall budget. It makes no assumptions about mandatory spending on programs like Social Security or Medicare, says nothing about spending beyond fiscal 2018, and gives no projections about how promised tax cuts and infrastructure spending might affect the nations bottom line. This is a budget blueprint, not a complete budget, said Trumps budget director Mick Mulvaney, ahead of its release, promising a full buffet of data, forecasts, and details in the full budget in mid-May. To be sure, budget experts were not expecting a hefty document. The Trump administration had hinted it would be on the thin side of skinny. It could be emaciated, Robert Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a non-partisan budget reform advocacy group, said in an interview on Tuesday. At some point, youve got to put your cards on the table, and show some numbers, Bixby said. Maya MacGuineas, head of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said there were too few details to fully understand the larger choices ahead: It is impossible to see the big picture when you only have a few pieces of the puzzle. Kenneth Baer, a former associate director in Obamas Office of Management and Budget, said an overly skinny budget would make it hard to interpret how the Trump administration would spend taxpayers money.  Its sort of like building a house, but only putting up the front door, Baer said.

The budget proposal for the fiscal year beginning on Oct. 1 is a first shot in a battle with Congress - which controls the government purse strings - that will play out over months and may yield spending far beyond Trumps requests. Congress, controlled by Trumps fellow Republicans, may reject some or many of the proposed cuts to the U.S. State Department and Agency for International Development (USAID) budgets for maintaining Americas diplomatic corps, fighting poverty, promoting human rights and improving health abroad. The White House is proposing a combined $25.6 billion budget for the State Department and USAID, a 28 percent reduction from current spending, according to documents the White House provided on Thursday. This is a hard power budget. It is not a soft power budget, Mick Mulvaney, Trumps budget director, told reporters, referring to the presidents desire to prioritize military power over the influence that can flow from development aid. In Tokyo, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson defended the cuts as a necessary correction to a historically high budget for the State Department that had grown to address conflicts abroad in which the United States was engaged as well as disaster aid. Tillerson said there would be a comprehensive examination of how the State Departments programs are executed and how the department is structured. Trumps budget proposes spending $54 billion more on military spending and sinking more money into deporting illegal immigrants. Senator Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he was deeply disappointed and dismayed at Trumps proposal to slash foreign affairs spending.  David Miliband, president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee, said the roughly one-third cut in foreign aid endangered U.S. values and interests abroad. Whats more, the U.S. foreign assistance budget makes up a mere 1 percent of the federal budget -  a tiny category of discretionary spending which saves lives and spreads goodwill around the world, he said. More than 120 retired U.S. generals and admirals urged Congress in a letter last month to fully fund diplomacy and foreign aid, arguing the functions were critical to keeping America safe.    The budget also requests $12 billion in Overseas Contingency Operations, or OCO, funding for extraordinary costs, chiefly in war zones such as Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. No comparison was provided for the current years OCO spending. The White House did not provide many details in its skinny budget proposal, a precursor to a more detailed budget submission the White House has said it will produce in May. The budget would provide $3.1 billion to meet the security assistance commitment to Israel ... ensuring that Israel has the ability to defend itself from threats and maintain its military superiority over more populous Arab neighbors. It would also maintain current commitments and all current patient levels on HIV/AIDS treatment under PEPFAR, the Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the worlds largest provider of AIDS-fighting medicine. The program has been credited with saving millions of lives and enjoys bipartisan support. The budget would also meet U.S. commitments to the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the documents said. Without giving specifics, the documents laid out areas where the White House plans to save money, including by reducing U.S. funds to the United Nations and affiliated agencies by setting the expectation that these organizations rein in costs and that the funding burden be shared more fairly among members. The United States would cut its contribution to the U.N. budget by an unspecified amount, and the U.S. government would not pay for more than 25 percent of U.N. peacekeeping costs, the documents said. The United States is the largest contributor to the United Nations, paying 22 percent of the $5.4 billion core U.N. budget and 28.5 percent of the $7.9 billion U.N. peacekeeping budget. Trump also plans to save money by eliminating the U.S. Global Climate Change Initiative, which among other things seeks to foster low-carbon economic growth, and by ceasing payments to U.N. climate change programs via the Green Climate fund. He proposes cutting funds to multilateral development banks such as the World Bank by about $650 million over three years from the Obama administrations commitments; reducing money for the State Departments Educational and Cultural Exchange Programs; turning some foreign military aid into loans from grants; and reorganizing the State Department and USAID.

The executive order banning refugees and nationals of six Muslim-majority countries from traveling to the U.S. was temporarily halted on Wednesday, hours before it was to go into effect, by a federal judge in Hawaii. Emirates will follow guidance by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, issued after the courts decision, that citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen would be accepted for travel to the U.S. if they possessed the necessary travel documents, an airline spokeswoman said by email. Etihad Airways will continue to accept guests of all nationalities for travel to the U.S. provided they have valid travel documents and, if necessary, visas, an airline spokeswoman said.

It was the first time that Tillerson, who was speaking at a joint news conference in Tokyo after talks with Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida, had taken questions from the media since taking office in early February. Two decades of diplomatic and other efforts, including U.S. aid for North Korea, had failed to achieve the goal of denuclearizing Pyongyang, said Tillerson, a former oil executive with no prior diplomatic experience, at the start of his first trip to Asia as secretary of state. So we have 20 years of failed approach, Tillerson said. That includes a period where the United States has provided $1.35 billion in assistance to North Korea as an encouragement to take a different pathway. In the face of this ever-escalating threat, it is clear that a different approach is required. Part of the purpose of my visit to the region is to exchange views on a new approach, he said. A Japanese foreign ministry official said U.S. officials had discussed potential new approaches regarding North Korea, but he declined to elaborate. As Tillerson presses the Chinese to do more to rein in North Koreas nuclear and missile programs, he is expected to tell them the United States intends to increase missile defense in the region, despite Beijings strong opposition, a U.S. official told Reuters in Washington. An advanced U.S. anti-missile system is being installed in South Korea, and the official said the Trump administration wants to discuss similar improvements with Japan. Tillerson visits South Korea and China later in the week.  Tillerson is also likely to raise the prospects for imposing secondary sanctions on Chinese banks and other firms doing business with North Korea, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. It is among the options being considered in a full review of North Korea policy expected to be completed by late March or early April, the official said.State Department spokesman Mark Toner said on Wednesday Tillerson will have substantive, hard talks on next steps in dealing with North Korea but that his visit was not likely to produce an immediate specific response. In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying repeated Foreign Minister Wang Yis proposal last week that North Korea should stop its nuclear and missile tests and South Korea and the United States should stop joint military drills and seek talks instead. We welcome all parties, including the United States, to come up with their own proposals, Hua told a daily news briefing. As long as these proposals are conducive to ameliorating the present tense situation on the Korean peninsula and are beneficial to maintaining regional peace and stability ... China will have an open attitude. Tillerson made it clear he expected China, North Koreas sole major ally, to do more. We will be having discussions with China as to further actions we believe they might consider taking that would be helpful to bringing North Korea to a different attitude about its future need for nuclear weapons, he said. Tillersons comments in Japan were eagerly watched by international observers for indications as to what they meant for the Trump administrations foreign policy. Japan is seeking clues to Washingtons policies both on North Korea and Chinas increasing military and economic clout  while hoping to steer clear of trade rows. Tillerson also held talks with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and had dinner with Kishida. U.S. President Donald Trump made it a hallmark of his campaign to call on allies, including Japan, to pay more for hosting U.S. forces and other elements of American protection. Tillerson issued a far gentler message at the conference, underscoring the long-standing U.S.-Japanese alliance. While the security environment in this region can be challenging, the United States is committed to strengthening our role, and we welcome an increased Japanese commitment to their roles and responsibilities in our alliance, he said. Tillerson is the second member of Trumps cabinet to visit Japan. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis visited last month, and Vice President Mike Pence is due in April, underscoring U.S. concerns surrounding North Koreas missile and nuclear programs. Abe was the first foreign leader who met Trump after his November election win. North Korea last week launched four ballistic missiles, the latest in a series, and is developing nuclear-tipped missiles that can reach the United States, in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions and sanctions. Washington has said all options, including military, are on the table in its review of policies toward North Korea. In the final months of the Obama administration, U.S. officials warned it would blacklist Chinese companies and banks that do illicit business with North Korea if Beijing failed to enforce U.N. sanctions against Pyongyang. The United States has begun deploying the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile defense system in South Korea, a move China objects to strongly because it sees the systems radar as a threat to its security. Pak Myong Ho, a North Korean embassy official speaking in Beijing on Thursday, said the deployment will destroy the balance in Northeast Asia and the Pacific region. The radar is not aimed at just us, Pak said. It is also aiming for China and Russia. Chinas assertiveness in the East China Sea, where it has a territorial row with Japan, and the South China Sea, where it has disputes with the Philippines and several other Southeast Asian nations, were also on the agenda.

Tillerson, who became the top U.S. diplomat under  Republican President Donald Trump in February, traveled to Mexico and Germany last month with a small contingent of journalists, including a pool reporter who informed colleagues of Tillersons statements or actions. The journalist on Tillersons plane that arrived in Tokyo on Wednesday, Erin McPike of the Independent Journal Review (IJR), was not acting as a pool reporter. State Department Acting Spokesman Mark Toner said in a statement that there was only one seat available on Tillersons plane for media. The department had previously told reporters covering Tillersons trip to South Korea, Japan, and China that he would not be taking reporters on his plane and that they would have to fly commercially, breaking with decades of precedent stretching back to Henry Kissinger. It was decided to take a journalist from an outlet that doesnt normally travel with the Secretary of State, as part of an effort to include a broader representation of U.S. media, Toner said. We will also make every effort to include a contingent of media on the Secretarys plane going forward. The State Department originally said that Tillerson could not accommodate the usual contingent of reporters because of space constraints. It also said the decision to travel without reporters was intended to cut costs. News organizations pay the U.S. government for the cost of their travel. The journalists who reported Tillersons landing in Tokyo on Wednesday evening traveled there on commercial flights. Depending on the number of staff Tillerson chose to take to Asia, the Boeing 737 he traveled on could likely have accommodated more than one reporter. The conservative-leaning IJR said in a statement late on Tuesday that the State Department last week offered the seat on Tillersons plane. McPike is a White House correspondent for IJR, and previously reported for CNN, Real Clear Politics, NBC News, and National Journal, according to IJRs website when she joined in February. She was also briefly part of the team that covered the 2016 election campaign for Reuters. We dont take this opportunity lightly and recognize the controversy surrounding press access for the trip, IJR founder and chief executive Alex Skatell said in a statement. In 2014, Skatell told The New York Times he wanted to start a site after observing a gap in reaching a more mainstream center-right audience. The State Department Correspondents Association said in a statement that it was disappointed Tillerson chose to travel to Asia without a full contingent of media or even a pool reporter and called for access to Tillerson equal to that given by the reporter on the plane during his trip to Asia. Tillerson, a former chief executive with the Exxon Mobil oil  company, faces a tough first trip to Asia seeking to reassure nervous allies facing North Koreas growing nuclear and missile threat and press China to do more on perhaps the most serious security challenge confronting Trump. For decades, secretaries of state have nearly always invited media to travel with them. In rare cases, particularly late in a secretarys tenure, some news outlets have declined, such as former Secretary John Kerrys December 2016 trip to Saudi Arabia. Republican secretaries of state Alexander Haig, George Shultz, James Baker, and Condoleezza Rice routinely took 10 or more journalists on their overseas trips, even to war zones. Before founding IJR, Skatell worked for the National Republican Senatorial Committee and for the Republican Governors Association, according to his LinkedIn profile. Another founder, Phil Musser, was once executive director of the Republican Governors Association and worked in the Department of Housing and Urban Development in the administration of George W.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""DETROIT/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Wednesday ordered a review of tough U.S. vehicle fuel-efficiency standards put in place by the Obama administration, handing a victory to auto industry executives and provoking criticism from Democrats and environmental groups. In a move widely seen as a preamble to loosening fuel standards, Trump told an audience of cheering union workers, he would ensure that any regulations we have protect and defend your jobs, your factories, and promised he would encourage growth in the U.S. auto sector.  The assault on the American auto industry is over, Trump said, standing in front of a banner that read Buy American-Hire American. Trump added that the White House is setting up a task force in every federal agency to identify and remove any regulation that undermines American auto production. The backdrop and message underscored Trumps efforts to lock down support in industrial states such as Michigan that put him in the White House. Trump spoke at the site of the former Willow Run bomber factory in Ypsilanti, Michigan, which won fame for building an operational B-24 heavy bomber every 59 minutes during World War Two. Now, the site is being redeveloped as a testing ground for autonomous vehicles.  At a roundtable with industry leaders Trump made clear he expected automakers to hire more Americans in return, a theme that dominated his election campaign. Were going to do some wonderful work with you, but youre going to have to help us with jobs, he said. Trumps event was attended by around 1,000 people, including automotive executives, United Auto Workers union President Dennis Williams - who sat next to Trump - and workers from Detroits Big Three automakers: General Motors Co (GM.N), Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) (FCHA.MI) (FCAU.N). Automakers lined up examples of vehicles they build in the United States for the president to see. Auto industry executives have said they are hopeful the Trump administration will pursue tax and regulatory policies that would benefit U.S. manufacturers.  Reopening the fuel efficiency rules put in place by Democratic President Barack Obama days before he left office is one of the top items on the industrys agenda. Automakers, through their lobbying groups, have said the Obama rules were too expensive and could cost American jobs. These standards are costly for automakers and the American people, said Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt. After one participant in Wednesdays meetings mentioned environmental concerns, Trump said he agreed but did not want an extra thimbleful of fuel to get in the way of growth. In a meeting with top auto executives from U.S. and foreign automakers, Trump said the government needs to get out of the way of the auto industry building vehicles, a person who attended the meeting said. Automakers are wary of being seen as out of touch with environmental concerns, or unwilling to invest in new technology. Ford, for example, used its Twitter account on Wednesday to highlight previously announced commitments to develop electric vehicles. It could take a year for the review process to play out, and Wednesdays event was effectively a starting gun for intense lobbying efforts over how government policy will drive technology investment decisions in the auto sector.  Critics like Democratic U.S. Senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts said Trumps move could hurt consumers. Filling up their cars and trucks is the energy bill Americans pay most often, but President Trumps roll-back of fuel economy emissions standards means families will end up paying more at the pump, Markey added.  The president is not seeking to revoke Californias authority to set vehicle efficiency rules even stricter than federal rules, including mandated sales of electric vehicles, as part of this move, a White House official said. The official did not rule out seeking to withdraw Californias authority in the future. Pruitt, an ally of the fossil fuel industry, would not commit during his Senate confirmation hearing to allowing California to continue its own clean vehicle rules. A group of 10 state attorneys general led by California and New York said on Wednesday they would fight attempts to weaken the rules. Californias attorney general late Tuesday filed legal papers in a federal court defending the Obama administrations decision to finalize the determination in January. Barclays auto analyst Brian Johnson said in a research note that he expects the Trump administration review will lead to reductions in planned hikes in fuel efficiency standards after 2021. The Obama administrations rules, negotiated with automakers in 2012, were aimed at doubling average fleetwide fuel efficiency to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025, although the real-world mileage figures would be lower.  Automotive industry executives and lobbying groups were quick to praise the administrations announcement. The Trump administration has created an opportunity for decision-makers to reach a thoughtful and coordinated outcome predicated on the best and most current data, said Mitch Bainwol, chief executive of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, an industry lobbying group. Automakers have signaled they want the government to give manufacturers more credit toward achieving fuel efficiency targets for technologies such as stop-start systems that shut down a cars engine at a traffic light.  Regulators should also look at whether ride hailing and vehicle-to-vehicle communications systems designed to prevent accidents and alleviate road congestion could be counted toward the industrys greenhouse gas emissions goals, the automaker group proposed in comments to the EPA last year. The group represents a dozen automakers, including GM, Ford and FCA.  Under the 2012 agreement with the industry, the EPA was given until April 2018 to decide whether the standards were feasible under a midterm review, but the agency moved up its decision to a week before Obama left office in a bid to maintain a key part of his administrations environmental legacy. An EPA analysis indicated that compared with previous rules, the 2025 standards would result in savings of between $1,460 and $1,620 over the lifetime of a vehicle and payback for new technology required to meet the new standards of around five years. The Obama administration said the rules would cost the auto industry $200 billion over 13 years, but save motorists $1.7 trillion over the life of the vehicles.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump will propose beefing up military spending and slashing domestic programs and foreign aid in his fiscal year 2018 budget to be released on Thursday.  Here are the highlights: The budget calls for an increase of $52 billion for the Defense Department above the 2017 base budget of about $522 billion, enacted under the Obama administration. There is an additional $2 billion increase in defense spending in other departments, including Energy and State. That is still less than some of Trumps fellow Republicans in Congress have called for, including the heads of the committees in the Senate and House of Representatives that oversee the U.S. military. But at a time of broad cuts elsewhere in the budget, the Pentagon is unlikely to complain.  The plan earmarks the new funds to accelerate the fight against Islamic State militants, reverse Army troop reductions, build more ships for the Navy and ramp up the Air Force  including by purchasing additional F-35 fighter jets, built by Lockheed Martin (LMT.N). The Department of Homeland Security would get a 6.8 percent increase, with more money for extra staff needed to catch, detain and deport illegal immigrants. Trump wants Congress to shell out $1.5 billion for his promised border wall with Mexico in the current fiscal year - enough for pilot projects to determine the best way to build it - and a further $2.6 billion in fiscal 2018. The combined budget for the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, would fall by 28 percent, with funding cuts for the United Nations, climate change and cultural exchange programs. The plan preserves $3.1 billion in security aid to Israel. The budget also requests $12 billion in so-called Overseas Contingency Operations, or OCO, funding for extraordinary costs, chiefly in war zones such as Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. No comparison was provided for the current years OCO spending. Current commitments on HIV/AIDS treatment under PEPFAR, the Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, will be maintained. PEPFAR is the worlds largest provider of AIDS-fighting medicine and enjoys bipartisan support. The Environmental Protection Agencys budget would be cut by 31 percent, eliminating its climate change programs and trimming back core initiatives aimed at protecting air and water quality. The proposal would eliminate 3,200 EPA employees, or 19 percent of the current workforce, and effectively erase former Democratic President Barack Obamas initiatives to combat climate change by cutting funding for the agencys signature Clean Power Plan aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Healthcare companies such as drug makers and device makers will pay more than twice as much in 2018 to have their medical products reviewed for approval by the Food and Drug Administration under the proposed budget. The proposal budgets over $2 billion in fees to be collected from industry, twice as much in 2017. Oversight of air traffic control would move from the federal government to an independent group under the proposals, which include a 13 percent cut for the Department of Transportations discretionary budget. The plan also calls for cutting the U.S. space agency NASA budget by 0.8 percent to $19.1 billion.  The budget for the Department of Energy would include $120 million to restart licensing for the proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste dump in Nevada, a project that has been stalled for years because of lawsuits and local opposition. The Agriculture Departments discretionary spending would be cut to $17.9 billion, a 21 percent drop from the temporary 2017 funding levels approved by Congress late last year.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is proposing to shift oversight of the U.S. air traffic control from the federal government to an independent group, according to budget documents released on Thursday. Trump, who called the U.S. air traffic control system obsolete in a meeting with airline executives last month, is proposing $16.2 billion for the Department of Transportations discretionary budget for fiscal year 2018, a reduction of 13 percent. Some Transportation Department budget items are paid through the highway gas tax fund. The document says Trumps plan initiates a multi-year reauthorization proposal to shift the air traffic control function of the Federal Aviation Administration to an independent, non-governmental organization. Privatization advocates argue that spinning off air traffic control into a non-government entity would allow for a more efficient system and rapid, cost-effective improvements of technology, in part by avoiding the government procurement process. Opponents, including some airlines, say the U.S. system is so large that privatization would not save money, and would drive up ticket costs and could create a national security risk. There also are concerns that airlines would dominate the private-company board and limit access to airports by business jets. The budget would eliminate $175 million in annual funding for the Essential Air Service, a program to support commercial air service to rural airports and end subsidies for Amtrak to operate long-distance train service. Amtrak would then focus on better managing state-supported lines and service in the busy Northeast corridor, the budget document said. The Trump budget would also eliminate the Obama administrations TIGER grant program, saving $499 million. That program has been used to fund a variety of transportation projects, including high-speed and intracity rail, highway construction and transit bus systems. The budget calls for cutting the budget of U.S. space agency NASA by 0.8 percent to $19.1 billion. The budget proposes cancelling the multi-billion-dollar Asteroid Redirect Mission, but funds development of the Orion crew vehicle and Space Launch System.  The budget calls for expanding public private partnerships. NASA has partnerships with Space Exploration Technologies and other companies.  The budget funds a mission to fly by Jupiter moon Europa, but cancels a multi-billion mission to land on the moon. It would also fund a Mars rover mission in 2020. The FAA is spending billions to implement NextGen, a system that would utilize satellites to monitor aircraft instead of radar and make other changes and has faced implementation challenges. The FAA said it has spent $7.5 billion on NextGen over the past seven years, which has resulted in $2.7 billion in benefits to passengers and the airlines to date, and is expected to yield more than $160 billion in benefits through 2030. Last month, Trump criticized spending on NextGen, saying the system was totally out of whack, over budget and behind schedule. The FAA handles more than 50,000 flights a day and more than 700 million passengers each year. It spends nearly $10 billion a year on air traffic control funded largely through passenger user fees, and has about 28,000 air traffic control personnel. Since 1987, several countries have moved responsibility for air traffic control from national civil aviation authorities to independent self-financed providers. The Government Accountability Office said in a 2016 report that the United States is generally considered to have the busiest, most complex and safest ATC system in the world.

The FDA has been criticized by lawmakers for not being quick enough at approving drugs, and President Donald Trump told Congress earlier this year that he aimed to speed up the approval of drugs.  The FDA has been charging companies to review their products since 1992.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump used his barnstorming strategy on Wednesday to try to build momentum for his first legislative initiative, a healthcare overhaul, by holding a massive rally in Nashville, Tennessee, reminiscent of his campaign events. Back on Capitol Hill, Republican leaders negotiated behind closed doors, held media conferences and gave cable-news interviews as they tried to push forward their plan to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, commonly called Obamacare. After Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan unveiled the new plan last week, fault lines appeared within the party as some conservatives said it did not go far enough and others rejected it entirely.  Trump used campaign-like language in his Wednesday night speech, pledging to repeal and replace horrible, disastrous Obamacare. Speaking to reporters aboard presidential plane Air Force One after the rally, Trump expressed optimism about his plans chances in Congress.  Were going to come up with something. We always do, he said. Republicans control both Congress and the White House for the first time in a decade, but the overhaul still faces political battles to be fought by a president new to governing. White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters before the rally the Trump administration had been in talks with Ryan and congressional leaders and was flooding the media with interviews with administration officials to help advance the plan. Ryan, the top Republican in the House of Representatives, also continued to champion the legislation, saying on cable news he was open to making improvements and refinements, but also adding the major components are staying intact. He told a news conference later in the evening the House would hold votes on repealing and replacing Obamacare but refused to provide a timetable. Two House committees approved the bills provisions with no changes last week. The Budget Committee will try on Thursday to unify the plan into a single bill for consideration on the House floor. Republicans cannot afford to lose more than three from their ranks on the committee for it to pass. Three committee Republicans are members of the hardline conservative House Freedom Caucus. Signs emerged on Wednesday that the White House was winning over reluctant conservatives who initially questioned the legislation on the grounds that it too closely resembled Obamacare, the signature domestic policy achievement of former President Barack Obama. The administration indicated it was open to revisiting the plans treatment of Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor, during a meeting with a conservative wing of the party. Specifically, conservatives want Obamacares expansion of Medicaid to end sooner than proposed in the Ryan plan, and want to introduce Medicaid work requirements for able-bodied adults without children. State governments run Medicaid with reimbursements from the federal government. Obamacare expanded its eligibility and increased funding for it, which enabled about 10 million previously uninsured Americans to obtain medical insurance.  Vice President Mike Pence advocated for the plan earlier on Wednesday behind closed doors with the Republican Study Committee, a large group of House conservatives. Republican Representative Phil Roe said after the Pence meeting the bill would probably be changed to move up the end of the Medicaid expansion by one year, to 2019. The conservative groups members were very close to signing off on the legislation, its leader, Representative Mark Walker, told reporters. Speaking on CNN, Ryan mentioned giving states better chances at more flexibility with Medicaid, but provided no details. Just as the partys conservatives began expressing optimism about the proposals fortunes, Republican moderates raised concerns that tax credits currently in the bill intended to help people buy health insurance were not sufficient. Representative Charlie Dent, following a meeting of moderate Republicans with Pence, told reporters that speeding up the termination of the Medicaid expansion was a non-starter. Senate Republicans have also voiced rising unease. As written, the House bill would not pass the Senate. But I believe we can fix it, Senator Ted Cruz told reporters. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told NBCs Today show: It is mortally wounded. The conservative advocacy group FreedomWorks held a rally amid snow flurries and a frigid wind outside the Capitol, where several House and Senate Republicans, including Cruz and Senator Rand Paul, voiced dissatisfaction with the bill. Paul later told reporters: The White House has been much more open to negotiation on this than House leaders.  A libertarian, Paul posted an op-ed on the Breitbart News website later on Wednesday calling Ryans plan Obamacare Lite and suggesting smashing it to smithereens. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released data showing enrollment in the individual insurance plans created under Obamacare has declined to 12.2 million Americans. Enrollment in these individual insurance plans was down by about 500,000 people from 2016 by the end of January, it said. It is about 1.6 million people short of Obamas goal for 2017 sign-ups, the government said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

A legal brief filed in federal court in Hawaii on Tuesday on behalf of Silicon Valley companies listed the support of 58 companies, less than half the 127 signatories to a similar brief filed in an appeals court last month after Trumps first executive order banning travel from a number of countries the administration said posed a security risk. Airbnb Inc, Dropbox Inc and Kickstarter are among the companies that did sign the brief.  Major tech companies that signed on to the earlier effort but not this week included Microsoft Corp, eBay Inc, Intel Corp, Netflix Inc and Twitter Inc. The lawsuit may succeed despite losing the overt support of such big names. U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Honolulu on Wednesday ordered an emergency halt to Trumps executive order that aimed to temporarily bar entry to the United States of most refugees as well as travelers from six Muslim-majority countries. The halt is temporary.  Trump says the ban is necessary for U.S. national security, and called Watsons order unprecedented judicial overreach. Tech companies, which generally rely on skilled workers from overseas more than other industries, played a large part in the legal effort to halt the first version of Trumps executive order, which was put on hold by a Seattle judge in early February.  It was not immediately clear why fewer of them signed on to the friend-of-the-court brief this time around.  Companies will have an opportunity to join the effort as it moves through the court system, said Robert Atkins, a New York lawyer and co-author of the brief. We do expect the group to expand.  Ride-hailing company Uber Technologies Inc was in the process of adding its name, a spokesman said.  Box Inc, a file-sharing service, said that although it did not sign the brief, there had been no change to its position.

The action was the latest legal blow to the administrations efforts to temporarily ban refugees as well as travelers from six predominantly Muslim countries, which the President has said is needed for national security. Trump lashed out at the judges ruling, saying it makes us look weak.  Trump signed the new ban on March 6 in a bid to overcome legal problems with a January executive order that caused chaos at airports and sparked mass protests before a Washington judge stopped its enforcement in February. U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson put an emergency stop to the new order in response to a lawsuit filed by the state of Hawaii, which argued that the order discriminated against Muslims in violation of the U.S. Constitution.  Judge Watson concluded in his ruling that while the order did not mention Islam by name, a reasonable, objective observer ... would conclude that the Executive Order was issued with a purpose to disfavor a particular religion. Watson was appointed to the bench by former Democratic President Barack Obama.     Speaking at a rally in Nashville, Trump called his revised executive order a watered-down version of his first. I think we ought to go back to the first one and go all the way, which is what I wanted to do in the first place, Trump said. Trump called the judges block unprecedented judicial overreach and said he will take the case as far as it needs to go, including to the U.S. Supreme Court.  The Department of Justice called the ruling flawed both in reasoning and in scope, adding that the president has broad authority in national security matters. The Department will continue to defend this Executive Order in the courts, it said a statement.     The nations highest court is currently split 4-4 between liberals and conservatives with Trumps pick - appeals court judge Neil Gorsuch - still awaiting confirmation.  Paul Ryan, the Republican Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, said the ban was needed to improve vetting of people entering the United States in order to prevent attacks and said he had no doubt that it would be upheld by higher courts.  Watsons order is only temporary until the broader arguments in the case can be heard. He set an expedited hearing schedule to determine if his ruling should be extended. Trumps first travel order was more sweeping than the second revised order. Like the current one, it barred citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen from entering the country for 90 days, but it also included Iraq, which was subsequently taken off the list.  Refugees were blocked from entering the country for 120 days in both orders, but an indefinite ban on all refugees from Syria was dropped in the new one. The revised ban also excluded legal permanent residents and existing visa holders. It provided a series of waivers for various categories of immigrants with ties to the United States. Hawaii and other opponents of the ban claimed that the motivation behind it was Trumps campaign promise of a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. The government, in its court filings cautioned the court against looking for secret motives in the executive order and against performing judicial psychoanalysis of a drafters heart of heart.   Watson said he did not need to do that, because evidence of motive could be found in the presidents public statements. He said he did not give credence to the governments argument that the order was not anti-Muslim because it targeted only a small percentage of Muslim-majority countries.  The notion that one can demonstrate animus toward any group of people only by targeting all of them at once is fundamentally flawed, the judge wrote.  The case was one of several moving through U.S. courts on Wednesday that were brought by states attorneys general and immigrant advocacy groups. In Maryland, refugee resettlement agencies represented by the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Immigration Law Center argued in court for a restraining order.  In Washington state, a group of plaintiffs applying for immigrant visas asked U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle - who suspended the first ban - to stop the new order. Robart was appointed to the bench by Republican former President George W. Bush. Both Judge Robart and U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang in Maryland said they would issue written rulings in their cases, but did not specify a time line. Washington state, joined by California, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York and Oregon, said in court filings they supported the plaintiffs in Seattle. If more judges side with Watson, the governments case may be harder to make at higher courts. The 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals upheld Robarts ruling against the first ban and Watson referenced that decision in his order. Various groups and companies said they would be harmed by the travel restrictions. A group of 58 technology companies, including Airbnb Inc, Lyft Inc and Dropbox Inc, filed a friend of the court brief in the case saying the order hurt their ability to recruit the best talent from around the world.  A longer list of companies, including Apple Inc , Facebook Inc  and Alphabet Incs  Google - filed a brief opposing the first ban in a different court challenge brought by Washington state, which is ongoing. It was not immediately clear why fewer tech companies signed on to the brief this time around.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

We dont have any evidence that that took place, House of Representatives Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes told a news conference. I dont think there was an actual tap of Trump Tower. Trump made the claim on Twitter on March 4 without providing evidence. Nunes congressional committee is one of at least four that have added the startling accusation to investigations of possible Russian meddling in the election campaign and Russian ties to Trump and his associates. James Clapper, the director of national intelligence under Obama, has said he knew of no warrant to wiretap Trump Tower. Nunes said if Trumps tweets were taken literally, then clearly the president was wrong. With his statements, Nunes, who served on Trumps transition team, joined other lawmakers, including some of his fellow Republicans, who have been skeptical about the presidents claim, and frustrated with what they see as federal law enforcements failure to provide them with information. The top Democrat on the House intelligence panel, Adam Schiff, said at the news conference with Nunes that Comey would be asked about wiretap evidence at a rare public hearing on Monday. It deeply concerns me that the president would make such an accusation without basis, Schiff said. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia  conducted cyber attacks on Democrats in an effort to influence the 2016 U.S. election on Trumps behalf. Russia has denied this. At the same time, Trump has been dogged by allegations that his associates had ties to Russian officials. Trump fired his national security adviser, Michael Flynn, last month after he failed to disclose contacts with Russias ambassador before Trump took office on Jan. 20.   Trump seemed to back away from his accusation of wiretapping in a Fox News interview on Wednesday, saying wiretap covers a lot of different things. Without providing details, the president added, I think youre going to find some very interesting items coming to the forefront over the next two weeks, according to excerpts of the interview, which will air later on Wednesday. Schiff and Nunes said they sent a letter asking Comey, Rogers and CIA Director Mike Pompeo to provide by Friday information on leaks of classified information, including names of any Americans that might have been gathered. Schiff said he expected the Federal Bureau of Investigation to cooperate. The committee leaders said they were prepared to issue subpoenas if they did not. In Richmond, Virginia, Attorney General Jeff Sessions told reporters that he never gave Trump any reason to believe he was wiretapped by the previous administration, according to a transcript provided by CBS News. While White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters Trump feels very comfortable that information existed regarding surveillance conducted during 2016, a number of Trumps fellow Republicans in Congress remained unconvinced. Spicer told reporters traveling on Air Force One on Wednesday that Trump had not meant wiretaps specifically. He was very clear that he used the word wiretap generally, he put it in quotes to mean that it counts for surveillance and all types of activity of that sort, Spicer said. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said he had no reason to believe a judge ever issued a warrant, which would have reflected there was probable cause that the Trump campaign was colluding with the Russians. If it is not true, he said, the FBI should confirm that.

Graham said on Wednesday that the FBI had responded that it would provide an answer to him and Whitehouse at a future classified briefing. The bottom line is a lot of Americans are wondering whats going on here, Graham said at a subcommittee hearing, titled The Modus Operandi and Toolbox of Russia and Other Autocracies for Undermining Democracies Throughout the World. Whitehouse said he would prefer an unclassified briefing. Comey met on Wednesday with the Judiciary Committee chairman, Chuck Grassley, and its top Democrat, Dianne Feinstein.

Tom Bossert, in remarks that were among the first he has made publicly since becoming the White House homeland security adviser, characterized cyber security in the U.S. government and around the world as being in general disarray. We need to find the people who do it and hold them accountable and be absolutely unwavering in doing so, Bossert said in remarks at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington, D.C.  People who have taken things that they should not have taken, like Snowden and others, are absolute enemies to our state. Period, Bossert said. They need to be caught, punished, and treated as such. He was referring to Edward Snowden, the former U.S. National Security Agency contractor whose leak of classified information in 2014 triggered an international furor over the reach of U.S. spy operations. Bossert, whose role includes special emphasis on cyber security, made his remarks a week after WikiLeaks published documents related to secret CIA hacking tools.  Investigators believe the documents were likely provided by a contractor or CIA employee, two U.S. officials told Reuters last week. It would be the third high-profile public case in recent years in which an insider pilfered a large tranche of secrets from a U.S. intelligence agency. The recent CIA leak shows that intensified U.S. government efforts to prevent leaks by insider threats have largely failed, according to cyber security professionals and intelligence officials. In January former President Barack Obama shortened the prison sentence of Chelsea Manning, the former U.S. military intelligence analyst who leaked hundreds of thousands of State Department cables to WikiLeaks in 2010 Manning, now due for release in May, had served seven of her 35-year sentence, and Obama defended his leniency by saying justice had been served. But he drew criticism from Republicans who said the move could embolden other potential leakers. Bossert said agencies and companies have a responsibility to institute controls and continuous employee screening and monitoring systems to guard against insider threats.  As he characterized cyber security as being in general disarray, Bossert said the Obama administration did not do enough to forcefully combat and deter growing criminal and nation-state threats. I feel like I have re-awoken from a long eight-year nap and I found a world that is on fire, Bossert said. President Donald Trumps annual budget proposal, expected to be released on Thursday, would reflect the White Houses plan to prioritize cyber security across the federal government, Bossert said. He also confirmed media reports that Rob Joyce, the National Security Agencys top hacker, is joining the White House as cyber security coordinator.

Republicans Elise Stefanik of New York, Carlos Curbelo of Florida and Ryan Costello of Pennsylvania introduced the legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives, pledging to study and address the causes and effects of measured changes to our global and regional climates and seek ways to balance human activities that contribute.  Several Republicans who signed the resolution, which is non-binding, represent parts of the country most affected. Curbelo hails from Miami, where streets regularly flood at high tide due to rising sea levels.  This issue was regrettably politicized some 20 or so years ago and we are in the process of taking some of the politics out, reducing the noise and focusing on the challenge and on the potential solutions, Curbelo said in a call with journalists on Tuesday. A spokesman for the White House declined to comment. Jay Butera, a congressional liaison for the non-partisan group the Citizens Climate Lobby, called the resolution an important step toward getting both parties focused on finding solutions. A similar resolution was introduced by Republicans in the previous Congress, with 17 signing. Some of those lawmakers lost their re-election bids.  Trumps newly confirmed Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Scott Pruitt, said in a CNBC interview on Thursday that he did not believe carbon dioxide was a major contributor to climate change. The Sierra Club on Tuesday asked the EPAs inspector general to investigate whether Pruitt violated agency policy by making the comments. The head of the EPAs comments were disconcerting, Curbelo said. What he said was akin to saying the earth is flat in 2017. We must insist on evidence-based and science-based policies. Curbelo said some Trump allies were ready to work on fixing climate change but he declined to identify them. The resolution came amid growing concern and confusion over the way Trumps environmental policies were taking shape. After calling climate change a hoax and vowing during the 2016 presidential race to pull the United States out of Paris climate accord if elected, Trump asked energy companies for advice on whether to indeed withdraw.  And his call on Wednesday for a new review of U.S. vehicle fuel-efficiency standards put in place under former President Barack Obama drew criticism from Democrats and environmental groups who accused him of risking more carbon emissions and higher fuel costs. Two sources told Reuters the administration has been contacting U.S. energy companies about the climate agreement and would consider their input in making a decision on it shortly.  An overwhelming majority of scientists say human activity - including the burning of oil, gas and coal - is the main driver of rising global temperatures. Most Republicans either dispute that or disagree that it is an urgent problem. Melinda Pierce, the Sierra Clubs legislative director, said her group would keep an eye on how Republicans who signed the resolution voted on more impactful legislation. Weve seen that many of the Republicans sponsoring this resolution have voted against climate action in the past, so their real commitment will be measured by how they vote on legislation that undermines climate progress or promotes fossil fuel projects moving forward, she said.

White House National Economic Council Director Peter Navarros comments on Bloomberg News helped boost Mexicos peso to nearly its highest level since Trumps election last November. The comments indicate that Navarro, a strong voice behind Trumps calls during the campaign for steep tariffs on goods from Mexico and China to help reduce U.S. trade deficits, was now seeking to cooperate with Mexico to the benefit of both countries. Navarro said he wanted to strengthen manufacturing in the three countries through renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Navarro said the 23-year-old trade pact could be transformed into two parallel U.S. bilateral deals with Canada and Mexico, or a modernization of the current trilateral deal. We have a tremendous opportunity, with Mexico in particular, to use higher rules of origin to develop a mutually beneficial regional powerhouse where workers and manufacturers on both sides of the border will benefit enormously, Bloomberg quoted Navarro as saying. Its just as much in their interests as it is in our interests to increase the rules of origin. In automotive products, the biggest area of manufactured goods trade between the United States and Mexico, vehicles must have 62.5 percent North American content to qualify for NAFTAs tariff-free benefits. Navarro has said that rule allows North American manufacturers to use too many Asian parts. Both Mexican and Canadian officials say they want to renegotiate and modernize NAFTA.  U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said he would trigger notification to Congress to start the NAFTA renegotiation process by late March, with substantive talks beginning later this year.  The Mexican peso, which had fallen sharply after Trumps election on fears that trade between the two countries would be disrupted, had strengthened to below 19.5 to the dollar at midday. With the Trump administration filling out with more voices on trade issues, it is unclear how much influence Navarro will have. Ross has been designated to take a leading role on trade issues, while U.S. Trade Representative nominee Robert Lighthizer told senators in his confirmation hearing on Tuesday that he would have full statutory authority to negotiate trade deals.

Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told reporters that the burden is on Gorsuch, a conservative appeals court judge from Colorado, to prove at the hearing starting on Monday that he is an independent judge and not a pro-business activist. Judge Gorsuch may act like a neutral, calm judge, but his record and his career clearly show he harbors a right-wing, pro-corporate, special-interest legal agenda, Schumer said.  Schumer appeared on Capitol Hill with several individual plaintiffs that Gorsuch ruled against in his position as a judge on the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.  He expresses a lot of empathy and sympathy for the less powerful, Schumer said, but when it comes to time to rule, when the chips are down, far too often he sides with the powerful few over everyday Americans just trying to get a fair shake.  Conservative legal activists who support the nomination say that Democrats are cherry-picking a small number of rulings that distort Gorsuchs 11-year record as a judge. President Donald Trump nominated Gorsuch on Jan. 31 to fill a yearlong vacancy on the nine-justice Supreme Court. The Republican-controlled U.S. Senate has to approve the appointment for it to take effect. Last year they refused to consider Democratic former president Barack Obamas nominee to fill the vacancy caused by the February 2016 death of conservative justice Antonin Scalia. Trumps fellow Republicans control the Senate 52-48, but Schumer repeated his view that Gorsuch would need to win 60 votes, rather than a simple majority, to move toward confirmation. Democrats can seek to use a procedural maneuver to block a confirmation vote if Gorsuchs supporters cannot muster 60 votes, although Republicans could change the Senate rules. If a nominee cant get 60 votes, you dont change the rules, Schumer said. You change the nominee. Among the plaintiffs who spoke out was truck driver Alphonse Maddin, who was fired after he disobeyed a supervisor and abandoned his trailer at the side of a road after the brakes froze. Gorsuch wrote a dissenting opinion as a three-judge panel ruled last year that Maddin was wrongly terminated and had to be reinstated with back pay. This was a seven-year battle, Maddin said.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON/BOCA RATON (Reuters) - The top U.S. derivatives regulator laid out plans on Wednesday for a sweeping overhaul of the agency that will include everything from cutting regulation to restructuring the unit that conducts surveillance for market abuses. In a wide-ranging policy speech that drew a rare standing ovation from more than 1,000 industry participants, Acting Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo, who was nominated by President Donald Trump as permanent chairman late Tuesday, said it was time for the CFTC to reinterpret its regulatory mission by focusing on fostering economic growth, enhancing U.S. markets, and right-sizing its regulatory footprint. In prepared remarks before the Futures Industry Associations annual conference in Boca Raton, Florida, he outlined plans to create a new initiative to help streamline regulation known as Project KISS and said he intends to restructure the CFTCs market surveillance branch in an effort to strengthen how the agency polices the marketplace. That unit, in charge of searching for manipulation and other abuses, is currently housed in the CFTCs Division of Market Oversight. Giancarlo said it would be relocated inside the agencys enforcement division to bolster how the CFTC polices the marketplace.   A new chief market intelligence officer position will also be created, he said, to help oversee a new branch that will be tasked with keeping pace with new trends and technology. DODD-FRANK CRITICISM Giancarlo often has been highly critical of the way the CFTC has implemented rules stemming from the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation. In his speech, he pledged to fix what he called flawed swaps trading rules which he blamed for driving business away from the United States, and added that the he hopes to work more effectively with international regulators while still looking out for American interests. He also promised to soon release the results of a review launched in January into the financial technology or fintech sector that seeks to understand what the CFTCs role should be in regulating the sector.  Giancarlo, a Republican, has been acting chairman of the CFTC since Jan. 20 and first became a commissioner of the agency in 2014. Throughout his tenure, he has been critical of the way the CFTC has implemented many of the new rules for over-the-counter derivatives that were mandated by the 2010 Dodd-Frank law. Going forward, he promised to take a much more active role in his position as a member of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), a body of regulators created by the Dodd-Frank law that reviews large financial firms to determine whether their collapse could pose broad systemic risks.  Once designated, a company faces an extra level of regulations and oversight.  Giancarlo accused the FSOC of failing to weigh the cumulative effect of regulations, particularly stricter bank capital standards which he said are harming market-making and economic growth. The CFTC must use its authority and influence to address the question of whether the amount of capital that bank regulators have caused financial institutions to take out of trading markets is at all calibrated to the amount of capital needed to be kept in global markets, he said. His new Project KISS initiative, which stands for Keep it Simple Stupid, represents an effort to follow the guidelines set out last month in an executive order by President Donald Trump which calls on agencies to conduct regulatory reviews. As an independent agency, the CFTC is not bound by the order. Nevertheless, Giancarlo stressed the need to follow it, saying the project will entail a review to make them simpler, less burdensome and less costly. Any efforts to make changes to rules, however, could take time. The five-member CFTC is down to only two commissioners - Giancarlo and Democrat Sharon Bowen. U.S. Senate Agriculture Chairman Pat Roberts, who will be convening the confirmation hearing, praised Giancarlo on Wednesday as an exceptional member of the CFTC who is well suited for the job.

Lawyers for the Sierra Club wrote to the EPAs Office of Inspector General on Tuesday asking the independent watchdog to check whether Pruitt violated the EPAs 2012 Scientific Integrity Policy when he told a CNBC interviewer on March 9, I would not agree that its a primary contributor to the global warming that we see. The request ramps up tension between the U.S. environmental movement and the administration of President Donald Trump, who has called global warming a hoax meant to weaken the U.S. economy and has packed his Cabinet with people who question the science of climate change. An overwhelming majority of scientists think that carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels is a major contributor to global climate change, triggering sea level rise, droughts and more frequent violent storms. Its pretty unprecedented to have the head of the EPA contradicting basic scientific facts, Sierra Club Senior Attorney Elena Saxonhouse told Reuters on Wednesday. In the letter, the Sierra Clubs lawyers said Pruitts comments contradicted a comprehensive review of scientific research on climate change and appeared to be politically motivated. The EPA website says its policy is meant to maintain a culture of scientific integrity for all its employees, and requires EPA officials and staff to ensure the agencys work respects the findings of the broader scientific community. Administrator Pruitts comments are perfectly in keeping with the scientific integrity policy, EPA spokesman John Konkus said in an email. There is an ongoing scientific debate on climate change, its causes and its effect. That debate should be encouraged as the Administrator has done, not discouraged as Sierra Club is attempting to do.  A spokeswoman for the EPAs inspector general said in an email the IGs office could neither confirm nor deny investigation requests.    As Oklahomas attorney general, Pruitt sued the EPA more than a dozen times while accepting campaign donations from the energy industry. Emails released on Feb. 22 by an Oklahoma Court showed Pruitt also used language provided by an energy company in one of his challenges of the EPA over methane emissions regulations. Sierra Clubs Saxonhouse said the group believed that the EPAs scientific integrity policy applied to political appointees as well as career EPA staff, but said it was unclear how the agency could enforce it. It shouldnt just be a piece of paper or some words on a website. Its intended to protect the public from bad decision-making thats not based on real facts, she said.

The sources, who asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak publicly on the subject, said many of the companies reached by the administration had said they would prefer the United States remain in the pact, but would also support reducing U.S. commitments in the deal.  The accord, agreed by nearly 200 countries in Paris in 2015, would limit planetary warming in part by slashing carbon dioxide and other emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. As part of the deal, the United States committed to reducing its emissions by between 26 and 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. The sources did not name the companies contacted.  One of the sources said the companies were publicly traded fossil fuel companies, and added the White House would consider their input in making a decision on the Paris accord shortly. The source said the White House has been leading the discussions with the fossil fuel companies and the State Department, which represents the United States in climate negotiations, had not taken part.  A White House official declined to comment. Trump has called climate change a hoax and vowed during his campaign for the White House to cancel the Paris Climate Agreement within 100 days, claiming it would be too costly for the U.S. economy.  Since being elected he has been mostly quiet on the issue. In a New York Times interview in November he said he would keep an open mind about the Paris deal. He and members of his family and inner circle also met with climate change advocate and former Vice President Al Gore in December.     Officials for Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips, Chevron, Peabody Energy Corp and others did not immediately comment when asked about whether they had been contacted by the White House about the Paris accord. But several, including Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, have expressed public support for the pact. The World Coal Association, which represents Peabody and other miners, has also said it supports the deal. Exxon Mobil Chief Executive Darren Woods recently called the pledges that came out of the Paris agreement an effective framework for dealing with emissions, and pointed to Exxons own work to cut its carbon emissions. In comments on Exxons website, Woods wrote: I believe, and my company believes, that climate risks warrant action and its going to take all of us  business, governments and consumers  to make meaningful progress.  Rex Tillerson, Exxons former CEO and now U.S. Secretary of State, also supported remaining a part of the climate change discussion during his confirmation hearing. He said he did not see climate change as an imminent national security threat but said the U.S. would be better served by being at that table and remaining a party to climate change negotiations. Conoco CEO Ryan Lance similarly said he favored the U.S. remaining in the Paris agreement, during CERAWeek comments last week, in part because it could create opportunities for its natural gas operations and its investments in carbon-capture and storage.  Benjamin Sporton, the president of the World Coal Association, had a similar stance: With a number of well-developed carbon capture and storage projects, the United States is already a global leader in cleaner coal technology. Given the role given to low emissions coal technology in the Paris Agreement by many developing economies, there are clear benefits to remaining within the agreement.  J. Robinson West, former chairman of Magellan Petroleum Corp., and now a managing director at Boston Consulting Group, said President Trumps anti-Paris accord sentiments probably reflected his dealings with the CEOs of smaller companies that operate only in the U.S. The independents are anti-climate change ... all this stuff costs them money. The global companies operate all over the world. They have to operate at one standard - the highest standard - wherever they operate, he said.  Global oil companies have spent heavily on environmental initiatives in recent years. Exxon Mobil, for example, logged $4.9 billion in environmental spending in 2016, about 2.24 percent of total revenue, according to its annual report with the Securities and Exchanges Commission. ConocoPhillips spent $627 million, or 2.57 percent of revenue. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Senator Sherrod Brown, the ranking Democrat, said the panel should look at increasing sanctions. Russia remains a hostile, recalcitrant power, deploying its military, cyber-enabled information espionage activities and economic tactics to harm the United States and drive a wedge between it and its allies, Crapo said.

MSNBC host Rachel Maddow said she received the documents from journalist David Cay Johnston, who said on her show that he received them in the mail. The returns, which MSNBC posted on its website, showed Trump paid an effective federal tax rate of 25 percent in 2005 after writing off $100 million in losses.  The White House said in a statement that Trump took into account large scale depreciation for construction. Trump has repeatedly refused to release his tax returns, drawing criticism throughout his campaign last year and speculation from his political rivals he was hiding something. A New York Times report in October said Trump, a New York real estate developer, declared a $916 million loss on his 1995 income tax returns. The newspaper said the large tax deduction could have allowed him to avoid paying federal income taxes for up to 18 years. But the returns posted by MSNBC on Tuesday showed that he did pay taxes in 2005. The returns do not indicate whether he paid taxes in other years or how much he might have paid. The Washington Post reported last year that Trump paid no federal income taxes for at least two years in the late 1970s. The White House said in a statement on Tuesday that Trump, as head of the Trump Organization, had a responsibility to pay no more tax than legally required. Presidents and major candidates for the White House have routinely released their income tax returns.  Trump says he has not released his tax returns because they are under audit by the Internal Revenue Service. Experts say an IRS audit does not bar someone from releasing the documents. During a September presidential debate, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton criticized Trump, a Republican, for paying no federal income taxes. That makes me smart, he responded. Trump has feuded with the media since his inauguration, often accusing it of promoting fake news intended to undermine his presidency. The dishonest media can continue to make this part of their agenda, while the President will focus on his, which includes tax reform that will benefit all Americans, the White House said on Tuesday.

It will happen, Republican Senator Richard Burr told reporters after a closed committee meeting. Asked if he knew when, he said, I dont yet, but soon. The House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, which, like the Senate panel, is conducting its own investigation of the possible Russia ties, will hold its first public hearing on Monday. Congressional Democrats have called for a special prosecutor or non-partisan select committee to investigate the matter. But Trumps fellow Republicans, who control majorities in both the Senate and House, say the various probes by congressional committees are sufficient. U.S. intelligence agencies said in January that Russia had conducted cyber attacks on Democrats in an effort to influence the 2016 U.S. election on Trumps behalf. Russia has denied this. Burr also said he did not now plan to follow the lead of other congressional committees that have requested any warrant applications or court documents related to Trumps assertion that former President Barack Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower. Trump gave no evidence to support his charge, which former Obama administration officials have denied. When asked to explain why he had not asked for such evidence, Burr said he felt it was unnecessary. Weve had sufficient conversations and gotten answers that we find to be satisfactory from the appropriate folks, Burr said, when asked to explain why he would not request. The leaders of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committees Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism have requested evidence about the alleged wiretapping. The Justice Department has asked for more time to respond. Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told reporters after leaving the closed committee meeting on Tuesday that he had still not seen any evidence to back up Trumps wiretapping claim.

The meeting on Tuesday appeared to signal a meeting of the minds on many issues between Trump and Prince Mohammed, in a marked difference from Riyadhs often fraught relationship with the Obama administration, especially in the wake of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. This meeting is considered a historical turning point in relations between both countries and which had passed through a period of divergence of views on many issues, a senior adviser to Prince Mohammed said in a statement. But the meeting today restored issues to their right path and form a big change in relations between both countries in political, military, security and economic issues, the adviser said. Saudi Arabia had viewed with unease the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama, whom they felt considered Riyadhs alliance with Washington less important than negotiating the Iran nuclear deal. Riyadh and other Gulf allies see in Trump a strong president who will shore up Washingtons role as their main strategic partner and help contain Riyadhs adversary Iran in a region central to U.S. security and energy interests, regional analysts said. The deputy crown prince viewed the nuclear deal as very dangerous, the senior adviser said, adding that both leaders had identical views on the danger of Irans regional expansionist activities. The White House has said the deal was not in the best interest of the United States. Iran denies interference in Arab countries. The meeting was the first since Trumps Jan. 20 inauguration with the prince, who is leading the kingdoms efforts to revive state finances by diversifying the economy away from a reliance on falling crude oil revenues. Under the plan, which seeks to promote the private sector and make state-owned companies more efficient, Riyadh plans to sell up to 5 percent of state oil giant Saudi Aramco in what is expected to be the worlds biggest initial public offering. The two leaders, who discussed opportunities for U.S. companies to invest in Saudi Arabia, kicked off their talks in the Oval Office posing for a picture in front of journalists. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, Trumps senior adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, chief of staff Reince Priebus and strategist Steve Bannon were also present at the Oval Office meeting with Prince Mohammed. The meeting also appeared to illustrate support for some of the most contentious issues that Trump has faced since taking office on Jan. 20. On a travel ban against six Muslim-majority countries, the adviser said Prince Mohammed did not regard it as one that was aimed at Muslim countries or Islam. Earlier this month Trump signed a revised executive order on banning citizens from Yemen, Iran, Somalia, Syria, Sudan and Libya from traveling to the United States but removed Iraq from the list, after his controversial first attempt was blocked in the court Trumps travel ban has come under criticism for targeting citizens of several mainly Muslim countries. The senior adviser said Prince Mohammed expressed his satisfaction after the meeting on the positive position and clarifications he heard from President Trump on his views on Islam. The senior adviser said the leaders discussed the successful Saudi experience of setting up a border protection system on the Saudi-Iraq border which has prevented smuggling. Trump has vowed to start work quickly on the barrier along the nearly 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border to prevent illegal immigrants and drugs from crossing to the north. Obama late last year suspended the sale of U.S.-made precision-guidance munitions to the Saudis, a reaction to thousands of civilian casualties from Saudi-led air strikes in Yemen. U.S. officials said Trump was considering ending that ban and approving the sale of guidance systems made by Raytheon Co. The State Department has approved the move, which awaits a final White House decision, the officials said. A source close to the issue, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said a main topic of the meeting would be Saudi investment in the United States, which could help the U.S. president fulfill his promises of job creation. Its the creation of jobs through investments - President Trump wants results and statistics matter for him, said Ingrid Naranjo, an expert in U.S.-Saudi relations. It makes a lot of sense for the diversification strategy of Saudi to invest abroad and especially in the U.S. Gregory Gause, a Gulf expert at Texas A&M University, said that while Saudi Arabia might find the atmospherics of its relations with Trump better than those with Obama, it might find less change than it hopes on key issues.  For example, he said, Trump is unlikely to mount a major, costly effort to counter Iranian influence in Iraq, or to launch a full-scale campaign to oust Syrian President Bashar al Assad, as Riyadh might wish. I think theyre going to find rhetorically that the new administration says things and uses language they like more, said Gause. But I think on the ground, were not going to see an enormous difference. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Christopher Giancarlo to lead the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the regulator tasked with policing the massive over-the-counter derivatives market, the White House said on Tuesday. Giancarlo, a Republican, has been acting chairman of the CFTC since Jan. 20 and was widely expected to be tapped for the permanent position of chairman. He became a CFTC commissioner in 2014. The nomination comes just one day before Giancarlo is expected to give a major policy address at the annual Futures Industry Association conference in Boca Raton, Florida, where he plans to lay out his regulatory vision for the agency. The CFTC won broad new powers from the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law to regulate the swaps market, which until then had been largely unpoliced. Giancarlo previously served as executive vice president of financial services group GFI Group Inc. Throughout his tenure as a CFTC commissioner, Giancarlo has been critical of the way the agency has implemented many of the new rules required by Dodd-Frank. He issued a white paper in 2015, for instance, which accused the CFTCs regulatory framework of driving global traders away from the United States, fragmenting the marketplace and increasing liquidity risk. He has dissented on a number of other major policy areas, including a proposal requiring automated traders to hand over sensitive code without a subpoena - something Giancarlo said would strip owners of intellectual property of due process of law. As chairman, Giancarlo is likely to focus his energy on scaling back rules that he believes are overly burdensome to help boost economic growth - a vision that is also shared by Jay Clayton, Trumps pick to head the CFTCs sister regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission. In a speech Monday before the Institute of International Bankers, Giancarlo criticized those who have dwelled heavily on preventing a repeat of the financial crisis, saying the impact has been to sideline capital from productive uses. If confirmed as chairman, however, Giancarlo could face some initial challenges getting his agenda adopted. Currently, the five-member panel is down to two commissioners - Giancarlo and Sharon Bowen, a Democrat. If the two disagree on a decision, the measure cannot pass.  Giancarlo acknowledged this challenge in his speech Monday, saying the agency cannot proceed on a controversial position limits rule without a full commission.  Trump has not yet nominated anyone for the remaining three positions.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""NEW YORK (Reuters) - A group advising U.S. President Donald Trump on infrastructure has proposed an arbitration-style pilot program to slash the current 10 years it often takes to break ground on projects, without short-changing environmental standards. The group, led by billionaire New York real estate developers Richard LeFrak and Steve Roth, made the suggestion to Trump and others in the White House last week, LeFrak told Reuters on Monday. Builders, unions and others often rue a permitting processes that can last a decade or more  a potential snag in Trumps plan to launch a 10-year, $1 trillion infrastructure building program to create jobs and bolster the worlds biggest economy. LeFrak said the advisory council is looking at a pilot program comparable to the arbitration process used in bankruptcy court to speed up proposals, reduce red tape and halt litigation that can tie up infrastructure projects in court for years. Somebody in authority would make the decisions, all the mitigation that should be coming out of it, whether its environmental mitigation, other mitigation, gets decided at that moment and thats it, he said. Its just a proposal. Were asking them to try it. The council is not empowered to pick projects or make decisions about how to streamline the project permitting process for projects, he said. Any pilot program would be up to state and federal officials and Congress, he said. LeFrak added that the proposal would not allow projects for bridges, roads or airports to side-step regulations, such as environmental rules. The idea would be to hammer out differences and objections faster in an arbitration-like setting so that projects could get underway in less time.  Australia, Canada and Germany typically take two years to approve infrastructure projects compared with 10 years in the United States, he said. A shortened review process could leave projects open to worries from environmentalists and others that an expedited permitting system could short-change environmental protections. Environmental groups are skeptical of Trumps promise to overhaul government regulations without jeopardizing Americas water and air quality. When Trump unveils his budget on Thursday, he is expected to slash the budget of the Environmental Protection Agency by 25 percent. The Sierra Club, Nature Conservancy and other environmental groups as well as the office of House of Representatives Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi were not available for comment.  Permitting and other regulatory hurdles can delay projects for years, a potential liability for a program that seeks to put money  and people  to work immediately. Theres got to be some way without abrogating anybodys rights to get all this on the table much more quickly, said LeFrak, who is chairman and chief executive of the LeFrak Organization, a leading developer and property owner in the New York metro area and South Florida.  LeFrak pointed to the replacement within 14 months of a bridge that collapsed in Minneapolis in 2007 killing 13 people as an example of how projects can get done without compromising standards. LeFrak also said the committee wants to use private funds to soak up cost overruns and keep projects maintained after completion. He suggested, as well, one possible solution to the key question of how to pay for Trumps infrastructure program: a higher federal gas tax.  If not, funding will have to come from general tax revenue, he said. Local and state government pay for about 70 percent of infrastructure projects in the United States, with the remainder funded by the federal government.  The American Society of Civil Engineers last week recommended an 18.4 cents per gallon federal tax on gasoline be raised at least to 25 cents per gallon to fill a funding deficit for infrastructure it said was $2 trillion. Im saying somebodys going to have pay for it. It doesnt come for free, LeFrak said. I wish I was powerful enough to impose a gas tax, but Im not.

Robert Lighthizer, the U.S. Trade Representative nominee, told senators at his confirmation hearing that Trump chose him because of his trade enforcement background. I expect that were going to have a very rigorous enforcement policy, Lighthizer told the Senate Finance Committee. This will be the point of emphasis. Lighthizer said he would bring as many trade enforcement actions as can be justified under World Trade Organization rules, bilateral trade agreements and U.S. trade remedy laws.  As a deputy USTR in the 1980s, Lighthizer, 69, negotiated Japanese import quotas. As a veteran trade lawyer in more recent years, he pursued dozens of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases against imports of steel and other products. Lighthizer said he would seek to increase trade while making it freer and fairer to the benefit of U.S. workers, farmers, ranchers and businesses. An outspoken critic of China, Lighthizer said Beijings industrial policies have supported vast amounts of uneconomic production capacity that would not survive without state support. He said this was particularly true in the steel and aluminum sectors, leading to the dumping of products into U.S. markets. Lighthizer told senators that he would engage with China in multilateral forums to reduce that capacity, but said trade enforcement actions may be more effective by raising the costs of keeping such factories alive.  It has to be more difficult for them to maintain non-economic capacity, and that means enforcing our trade laws, and it means encouraging other countries where they can ship their products to enforce their trade laws. Lighthizer said he believes China was a substantial currency manipulator in the past, but that it was unclear if Beijing was continuing to do so.  The comment was in line with more neutral statements on the subject from Trump administration officials more recently after the president threatened during his campaign to declare China a currency manipulator. Lighthizer also pledged to fight for strong protections for intellectual property rights and for digital trade access. In renegotiating the North American Free Trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, he said it was important not to lose gains in agricultural exports to those countries while encouraging more production to return to the United States. Regarding Canada, he said finding a solution to a long-running trade dispute over softwood lumber would be his top priority. Trumps cabinet already is crowded with senior trade officials, including Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and the director of the newly created White House National Trade Council, Peter Navarro. Lighthizer said that if confirmed, he would have the USTRs full statutory powers and would play a lead role to sort out U.S. trade policy, working closely with other agencies.

The move could alter how U.S. agencies weigh regulations on  a broad array of industries, from drilling, coal mining and auto manufacturing to refining. The official on Tuesday confirmed a Bloomberg News report that the executive order will instruct the Environmental Protection Agency and other agencies to overhaul their use of the social cost of carbon, an Obama-era policy that seeks to quantify potential economic damage from climate change for the purposes of drafting regulation. White House spokeswoman Kelly Love declined to discuss the timing of an executive order on energy. We have nothing to announce at this time, she said. Under rules put in by place by former President Barack Obama, the current cost of carbon in policy decisions is $36 per ton, which will rise to $50 by 2030. The Trump order would direct regulators to use a discount rate that would dramatically reduce, or eliminate, that cost. Discount rates are used to come up with a net present value of something whose benefits and costs will be distributed over time. In the case of carbon, the impact of emissions on the earths climate can take several years to appear. Under some scenarios referenced in the executive order, carbon could have a zero or negative value, the source said. The source said that the order may be an initial step to ultimately phasing out the carbon evaluation entirely. The executive order could be issued as soon as this week, the source said, and may include other energy-specific measures, like a requirement for the EPA to conduct a review of regulations that could harm energy production.  Reuters and others have reported previously that Trump planned to target Obama-era green regulations, including a federal coal mining ban and an initiative forcing states to cut carbon emissions. The Department of Interior under Obama had issued a moratorium on coal leasing on federal land in 2015 as it sought to review the program and evaluate whether the government adequately priced the value of coal extracted from public lands on behalf of taxpayers. The Clean Power Plan was Obamas centerpiece initiative to combat climate change, requiring states to slash emissions of carbon dioxide. But it was never implemented due to legal challenges launched by several Republican states. The new head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, said last week he is not convinced that carbon dioxide from human activity is the main driver of climate change and said he wants Congress to weigh in on whether CO2 is a harmful pollutant that should be regulated. The Obama administrations carbon cost estimates were first issued in 2010 and have been used to analyze rules directly targeting carbon dioxide emissions, like car and truck emissions standards. They have also been used to cover rules on indirect emissions, like one to control mercury and other air pollutants from power plants. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The Washington Post first reported that Patterson, who had previously served as the top U.S. diplomat for the Middle East and as ambassador to Egypt, Pakistan, Colombia and El Salvador, was no longer a candidate. The newspaper reported that Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, both Republicans and members of the Senate Armed Services Committee that would have reviewed her candidacy, opposed her selection.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is investigating whether Exxon misled shareholders and the public about climate change, wrote to a judge on Monday accusing Exxon of not previously disclosing the alias and Tillersons climate-change communications through it. Exxon denied trying to hide anything.  This was not an alias used to discuss only climate change, Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers said on Tuesday. It was an account used for everyday business by senior executives who needed to reach Tillerson, who left the company at the end of 2016 to become secretary of state. Tillerson received thousands of emails a day from climate change activists and others at his regular address - Rex.W.Tillerson@ExxonMobil.com - and that made it difficult to parse which messages were important to promptly address Exxons business operations, Jeffers said.     Tillerson used the email alias for eight years and sent thousands of messages. Sixty-four of those sent and received met the parameters for Schneidermans climate change subpoena and were turned over to New York officials, Jeffers said.  The email alias was Wayne.Tracker@ExxonMobil.com. Wayne is Tillersons middle name and Tracker is likely a reference to his past involvement in the Boy Scouts of America. Although Trump has vowed to reverse climate-change steps taken by former President Barack Obama, Exxon has said it believes it must address climate change. On Monday, it said: ExxonMobil believes the risk of climate change is clear and warrants action. Darren Woods, who succeeded Tillerson as Exxons CEO in January, does not use an email alias, nor does any other Exxon employee, Jeffers said. Use of the email alias was seized upon by environmentalists on Tuesday, who said it revealed a pattern of deception.  If they had nothing to hide, than why the secret email account? said Jamie Henn of 350.org, an environmental group.      Exxon plans to respond to Schneiderman in a court filing within the next several days, Jeffers said.

(bloom.bg/2nkDvKo) The directive will urge the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to undo the Clean Power Plan, the Bloomberg report said. The Clean Power Plan is Obamas centerpiece initiative to combat climate change, requiring states to slash emissions of carbon dioxide, but it was never implemented due to legal challenges launched by several Republican states. According to the report, the measure would direct U.S. regulators to rescind Obama-era regulations limiting oil industry emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. The order will also involve a reconsideration of the governments use of a metric known as the social cost of carbon, which weighs the potential economic damage from climate change, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday. Trump has long signaled his intention to reverse Obamas climate-change initiatives, but the Republican president has vowed his planned overhaul of green regulation would not jeopardize Americas water and air quality. Reuters reported earlier this month that the White House had proposed to slash a quarter of the EPAs budget, targeting climate-change programs and those designed to prevent air and water pollution like lead contamination.

Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg was among those who signed a letter to Republican and Democratic leaders in the U.S. House and Senate that was dated Friday and due to be released publicly on Tuesday, according to the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA). The support comes as congressional Republicans are developing measures to alter the U.S. tax system, a task they plan to tackle after addressing healthcare, according to several people familiar with the matter.  We urge you to enact legislation that modernizes our tax system, allows Americas businesses to better compete in the global marketplace and encourages job creation and innovation in the United States, said the AIA letter, also signed by the groups CEO, David Melcher. The changes are based on a blueprint released in June by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, a Texas Republican. Among its key elements, Bradys proposal would cut the U.S. corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, permit immediate deductions for capital investment and introduce a border adjustment tax system that would tax imports into the United States but not tax revenue generated by exports out of the country. The push on taxes by aerospace companies comes as they face some uncertainty under the administration of President Donald Trump.  The new president lost no time in publicly pressing Boeing and Lockheed Martin Corp to lower costs on planes bought by the U.S. government. As they source parts and sell many of their products overseas, aerospace companies also stand to suffer if Trumps aggressive trade policies cause friction with other countries.  Trump has voiced support for the tax reform plan, and spoke favorably about a border tax. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross later said Trump had not endorsed the House Republicans specific border adjustment tax plan. Drafters of the plan say a tax on imports would increase the value of the dollar, helping offset the cost of imports to U.S. manufacturers by giving them more purchasing power. A stronger dollar would, however, make U.S. goods more expensive for foreign buyers.  Boeings Muilenburg is AIA chairman this year and was joined in signing the letter by Raytheon Co CEO and AIA vice chairman Thomas Kennedy. Other companies involved in aerospace manufacturing also signed, including Lockheed Martin, General Electric Co, Northrop Grumman Corp, Honeywell International Inc, Rockwell Collins Inc, Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc, General Dynamics Corp, Harris Corp, International Business Machines Corp and L3 Technologies Inc.  The signatures were gathered at a supplier meeting in Seattle last week, Boeing said. AIA said it has more than 330 members.

Among the hospitals, HCA Holdings slipped 1.6 percent, Tenet Healthcare fell 4.2 percent, Community Health Systems shed 1.5 percent and LifePoint Health was down 1.3 percent.  The S&P 500 healthcare sector was off 0.4 percent, while the benchmark S&P 500 index slipped 0.5 percent. The Street is reacting to the uncertainty around (the bill), and the possibility of more challenges ahead, said Ana Gupte, an analyst with Leerink Partners in New York. Theres uncertainty about the potential downside, and whether the plan will become tougher for hospitals before it gets passed, she said. The Affordable Care Act of 2010, often dubbed Obamacare, expanded medical coverage, aiding hospitals by reducing the number of uninsured patients who could not pay bills.  Hospital stocks fell after the Nov. 8 presidential election of Donald Trump, who vowed to repeal the ACA, former President Barack Obamas signature domestic policy legislation. The CBO forecast that 24 million people would be uninsured in 2026 if the plan being considered by the House of Representatives were adopted.  Some health policy experts and Wall Street analysts said the report was more draconian than expected, with the uninsured rate declining more quickly than foreseen. While the CBOs estimate... is a negative headline for hospitals, we believe that in its current form, the bills chances of passing are slim, Jefferies analyst BrianTanquilut said in a research note.  Tanquilut said he believed legislators will eventually draft a more palatable, diluted version of repeal and replace that would have a smaller impact on the number of uninsured.  Health insurer stocks also fell. UnitedHealth Group Inc was down 0.8 percent, Aetna Inc also shed 0.8 percent and Humana Inc fell 0.7 percent.  What that means basically is lower volume for the health insurers. It looks like its going to be the dismantling of the individual insurance market, which again means lower revenues and the loss of the individual market for the most part for the insurers, said Vishnu Lekraj, an equity analyst at Morningstar. The Republican proposal would end Obamacare expansion of the Medicaid insurance program for the poor and would replace Obamacares income-based subsidies with fixed tax credits for the purchase of private insurance. Medicaid-focused insurers were particularly hard hit. Centene fell 2.2 percent, Molina Healthcare was down 2.5 percent and WellCare Health Plans was 2 percent lower.

The U.S. Congressional Budget Office forecast that 24 million more people would be uninsured in 2026 if the plan being considered by the House of Representatives to replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act were adopted. Obamacare, as President Barack Obama's signature piece of domestic policy is commonly called, expanded insurance to about 20 million Americans. (bit.ly/2mkdeYA) Hours after the CBO report was released, the House Budget Committee postponed its consideration of the Republican bill to Thursday from Wednesday. Prior to the report, Republicans had been planning to vote soon on the bill in the House, where it is likely to pass, and send it to the Senate, where its outlook is uncertain.  The CBO projected that 52 million people would be uninsured by 2026 if the bill became law, compared with 28 million who would not have coverage that year if the law remained unchanged. Two House of Representatives committees have approved the legislation to dismantle Obamacare that was unveiled by Republican leaders a week ago, but it faces opposition from not only Democrats but also medical providers including doctors and hospitals and many conservatives. The CBO reports findings could make the Republican plan a harder sell for lawmakers, particularly in the U.S. Senate. The CBO, however, said federal deficits would fall by $337 billion between 2017 and 2026 under the Republican bill. Some health policy experts and Wall Street analysts said the report was more draconian than expected, with the uninsured rate rising more quickly than foreseen. Doctors groups and patient advocates said the bill must be abandoned. The AARP, a nonprofit advocacy group for aging Americans, said Monday that the CBO analysis showed the financial burden of the Republican plan would fall disproportionately on Americans 50 to 64 years old. In a five-page letter to House members last week, the AARP has also criticized a tax cut it said would threaten the solvency of Medicare, the government health insurance program for the elderly and disabled, cuts to Medicaid and said the bill does nothing to lower drug costs. Some Republicans worry a misfire on the Republican healthcare legislation could hobble Trumps presidency and set the stage for losses for the party in the 2018 congressional elections.  The Trump administration defended the healthcare plan, which they say will have a second and third phase that will entice consumers. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said at the White House that Trumps plan would cover more individuals at a lower cost and it was virtually impossible to envision that 14 million people would lose insurance coverage by next year. Democratic leaders in Congress said the bill could result in elderly people being kicked out of nursing homes as it simultaneously gives tax cuts for the richest Americans. How can they look their constituents in the eye when they say 24 million of you no longer have coverage and those of you who do have it, will have less coverage at more cost to you, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said. Trump himself made no comment on the report. The Affordable Care Act aimed to help restrain U.S. healthcare spending, which is about 17 percent of the nations economy, but it has continued to grow faster than inflation.  The proposal would end the Obamacare expansion of the Medicaid insurance program for the poor and would replace Obamacares income-based subsidies with fixed tax credits for the purchase of private insurance. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center on Monday said the Republican plan would benefit the wealthiest U.S. households far more than middle-income families. A family making $51,600 to $89,400 a year, including fringe benefits like employer-provided health insurance, would get a tax cut averaging $300. The top 0.1 percent of earners with incomes of at least $3.9 million would get a tax cut of about $207,000, the study said. The CBO estimated that insurance premiums would rise 15 percent to 20 percent in both 2018 and 2019 because fewer healthy people would sign up after the repeal of the Obamacare penalty for declining to obtain insurance. But it said the hikes would be offset after 2020 by a $100 billion fund allocated to states in the bill and deregulation in the insurance market.  By 2026, average premiums for single policyholders in the nongroup market under the legislation would be roughly 10 percent lower than the estimates under current law, in part because insurers will be able to offer plans that cover a lower share of healthcare costs. While the federal government would lose revenues through the repeal of Obamacares individual and employer mandates tax penalties, CBO said the loss would be surpassed by savings on insurance subsidies and Medicaid payments that Washington would no longer have to provide for people who lost coverage.  At the same time, CBO said the repeal of the individual mandates tax penalties would mean higher health insurance premiums for those who retained coverage, because insurers would still have to cover any applicant without being free to raise premiums for older, sicker people, despite lower numbers of younger, healthier customers who are cheaper to insure. Craig Garthwaite, director of the healthcare program at Northwestern Universitys Kellogg School of Management, said the CBO estimates made it harder for Republicans to sell their proposal.  Overall, this is a really bad number for the AHCA. Far more people are predicted to lose coverage than many estimated - and these losses are going to happen more quickly than we would have thought, he said. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, a key backer of the plan called the American Health Care Act, said the CBO estimates showed it would ultimately lower premiums.  Our plan is not about forcing people to buy expensive, one-size-fits-all coverage. It is about giving people more choices and better access to a plan they want and can afford. When people have more choices, costs go down, Ryan said. Vishnu Lekraj, an equity analyst at Morningstar, said the bill is a net negative for insurers, who would be helped by the elimination of a tax, but hurt by the shrinking individual insurance business. The headline number will be viewed as a shock to the system tomorrow, Brian Tanquilut, a stock analyst at Jefferies said of the 14 million losing insurance next year. The reality of this is that the number being big makes it harder for the bill to pass in its current form. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Earlier this month, without offering evidence, the Republican president accused his Democratic predecessor of wiretapping him, a charge that Obama spokesman Kevin Lewis said was simply false. In response, the leaders of the House Intelligence Committee sent a letter to the Justice Department requesting proof for the allegation by Monday. A department spokeswoman said it needed more time to review the request in compliance with the governing legal authorities and to determine what if any responsive documents may exist. The committee replied in a statement that it wanted a response by the time of a planned hearing on March 20, suggesting it would use a subpoena if that did not happen. If the committee does not receive a response by then, the committee will ask for this information during the March 20 hearing and may resort to a compulsory process if our questions continue to go unanswered, a spokesman said. The Justice Department is not required to respond to the representatives request for evidence or meet its deadline.  Trump declined to comment on Monday when asked by reporters about the wiretapping issue. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Trumps original statement, which he released on Twitter, referred to other types of surveillance besides wiretapping. The president was very clear in his tweet that it was wiretapping - that spans a whole host of surveillance types of options. The House and the Senate intelligence committees will now look into that and provide a report back, he said. In fact, Trump only referred to wiretapping in his tweet, which read: How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy! Under U.S. law, presidents cannot direct wiretapping. Instead, the federal government can ask a court to authorize the action, but it must provide justification. Republicans have distanced themselves from the president over the issue. Republican Senator John McCain on Sunday called on Trump to provide evidence for his allegation or retract it. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the committee, has said he plans to question FBI Director James Comey over Trumps wiretapping charge.  Comey has called on the Justice Department to deny the allegation, according to law enforcement sources. The issue may also come up at hearing set for Wednesday by a Senate Judiciary Committee subcommittee on the methods used by Russia and other authoritarian governments for undermining democracies throughout the world. The chairman of the Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism, Republican Lindsey Graham, and the senior Democrat, Sheldon Whitehouse, wrote to Comey and acting Attorney General Dana Boente last Wednesday asking for any warrant applications and court orders  redacted as necessary to protect intelligence sources and methods that may be compromised by disclosure, and to protect any ongoing investigations  related to wiretaps of President Trump, the Trump Campaign, or Trump Tower.

(tpc.io/2n1Mdwi) The expected benefits equal 2.6 percent of a wealthy familys after-tax income, but only 0.5 percent of the income of a middle-class household making $51,600 to $89,400 a year, including fringe benefits like employer-provided health insurance, the center estimated. The top 0.1 percent of U.S. families have income of at least $3.9 million. The proposed changes are part of a plan backed by Republican President Donald Trump to repeal and replace the law officially known as the Affordable Care Act, former Democratic President Barack Obamas signature domestic legislation. All told, the tax portion would eliminate levies worth $600 billion in revenues over a decade.  If adopted, the plan could be the first in a series of tax cuts promised by Trump, who has vowed to lower taxes further through separate legislation to overhaul the U.S. tax code. The Congressional Budget Office, which provides official cost estimates for legislation, on Monday said 14 million more people would be uninsured in 2018 and 24 million more in 2026 if the plan being considered in the House of Representatives were adopted. The Republican plan would also reduce federal deficits by $337 billion between 2017 and 2026, the office said. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, the Republican healthcare plans top backer in Congress, and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosis office had no immediate comment. Trump defended the Republican plan on Monday, telling a group of Obamacare opponents that the replacement would offer more coverage choices at lower costs.   Obama raised taxes on the wealthy to fund healthcare benefits for middle- and low-income Americans under his healthcare law, which has extended coverage to 20 million previously uninsured people through subsidized private coverage and the Medicaid program for the poor. Democrats charge that Republicans would now help the rich at the expense of families who depend on Obamacare subsidies. The repeal of just two ACA taxes - a 3.8 percent investment tax and a 0.9 percent Medicare payroll tax on people earning $200,000 or more a year - would return about $275 billion to taxpayers over 10 years, the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, or JCT, said in a report last week. About 60 percent of that sum would go to those with incomes of $1 million a year or more, according to a Reuters analysis of JCT data released only to Congress. In addition to the investment and hospital taxes, the Tax Policy Center also included the effects of repealing Obamacares tax penalties for the uninsured and employers that offer no insurance, and excise taxes on healthcare providers and insurers. The researchers found that 40 percent of benefits from the proposed tax changes would go to households earning more than $772,000 a year in 2022, when the cuts would be fully effective.

A study of the Republican healthcare measure released on Monday by the nonpartisan U.S. Congressional Budget Office found that 14 million Americans would lose medical insurance by next year if the program is approved. It said 24 million more people would be uninsured by 2026 under the program. Price told reporters at the White House that the administration strongly disagreed with the findings, saying the CBO had not looked at the full plan to reform Obamacare.  If the Republican healthcare bill passes the House and Senate and is signed into law by Trump, Verma will play a major role in implementing the law, called the American Health Care Act.  Verma worked in Indiana to expand Medicaid to include thousands of additional low-income residents. Those residents are required to make small monthly payments toward their care through health savings accounts.  Vermas confirmation was not without controversy early on. In an initial committee hearing, Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon said that while helping manage the state of Indianas health program, her firm was being paid by companies that were providing services and products to the program.  Verma has denied wrongdoing and said she would divest her financial interest in SVC within 90 days of confirmation. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""NEW YORK (Reuters) - Puerto Ricos federal oversight board voted unanimously on Monday to certify the governments fiscal turnaround plan, on the condition it be amended to eliminate Christmas bonuses, impose employee furloughs, and further reduce pension spending. The plan, a cornerstone of the federal Puerto Rico rescue law known as PROMESA, will serve as the baseline for looming restructuring talks with holders of some $70 billion in debt that has pushed the U.S. territory to the brink of economic collapse. The government can avoid some of the austerity measures, which have sparked protest among Puerto Ricans, if it presents alternative cost-saving measures by April 30, the board said. PROMESA required Governor Ricardo Rossello to present a turnaround blueprint that would require sign-off by the board. The board rejected an initial draft last week, saying it relied on overly optimistic economic projections. The latest version rolled back those numbers, boosting the islands 10-year projected funding gap to $67 billion from $56 billion, and contemplating $39.6 billion in new cash flows from spending cuts and revenue initiatives, up from $33.8 billion in the last plan. The new version forecasts the island would have $800 million a year to service debt, down from $1.2 billion in the draft. The new plan is modestly worse than the old plan for creditors, as it implies larger haircuts, Puerto Rico credit analyst Chas Tyson, of KBW Inc, said in a note on Monday. Approval by the board came with conditions: the government must reduce pension spending by 10 percent beginning in 2020, cut Christmas bonuses and implement employee furloughs as soon as July 1 to stave off a short-term cash crunch. The austerity push drew protests outside the meeting in lower Manhattan on Monday, including from teachers who claimed the furloughs would shorten the public school year by the equivalent of two months a year. The government can avoid the furloughs and bonus cuts if it presents the board with a plan by April 30 to shore up liquidity by $200 million. Rossello said he was confident the cuts would not be necessary. Im very confident well have $200 million in reserve cash, so that we can jump over that obstacle, Rossello said in an interview with Reuters after Mondays meeting. The board said it will negotiate over the next 30 days with the government on how to cut pensions, a contentious issue on an island where retirement systems are already borderline insolvent thanks to decades of mismanagement by governments that routinely made overly generous promises to workers. All stakeholders have been forced to sacrifice, and no one is exempt from that, board member Andrew Biggs, a pension expert, told reporters after the meeting. He added the cuts will be orchestrated in a way that would spare the lowest-income people from any reductions. Rossello said he will not pass public policy that would hurt the poorest pensioners. I dont see any way I can reduce pensions of people already having a hard time getting medications and things. In another controversial move, the board said it supported government efforts to seek additional concessions from bondholders of Puerto Ricos power utility, PREPA, which is more than $8 billion in debt. The utility and its creditors have had a tentative restructuring in place for more than a year, but Rossellos administration has said it would seek new terms, sparking concern and frustration among PREPAs creditors. A subcommittee of the U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources announced it will hold a hearing on March 22 on the status of the PREPA deal, the current version of which sees creditors taking 15-percent cuts.

The G20 can play a helpful role in advancing U.S. interests. The secretary will be pushing hard to make that come to pass, whether its on macroeconomic policies, exchange rate policies etcetera, the official said. The official said it was important to the Trump administration that previous G20 commitments to not target exchange rates to gain a competitive trade advantage be reaffirmed and fully implemented.  But that explicit pledge, which has long been a part of past G20 communiques, was not included in an early draft of the statement to be issued at the Baden-Baden meeting. The early draft, which is subject to more revisions, simply stated we reaffirm our previous exchange-rate commitments. The early draft also dropped language to resist all forms of protectionism in favor of a pledge to maintain an open and fair international trading system. The U.S. Treasury official declined to discuss the language that would be in the final communique but said that the Trump administration was committed to fair and open trade. I think that means a trading system that has a level playing field for our firms and our workers globally, and well be encouraging policies that lead to that level playing field so that our firms and workers are not disadvantaged, the official said. Trump officials have criticized China on a host of trade-related fronts related to its $347 billion trade surplus with the United States last year. These include President Donald Trumps own charges that Beijing manipulates its yuan currency and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross complaints about Chinese excess industrial capacity, unfair subsidies for state-owned enterprises and a lack of access for foreign firms to major sectors of Chinas economy. The U.S. Treasury said in October that none of the U.S. major trading partners was manipulating its currency to gain advantage for its exports. Mnuchin has said he would not pass judgment on Chinas currency practices until Treasury issues its semi-annual currency report in mid-April.    China has announced plans to reduce some capacity in its steel industry in recent months and has urged the United States to move cautiously in pursuing anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases. The countrys ministry of commerce has denied U.S. charges that Chinas aluminum industry is receiving unfair subsidies.  Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro last week also said Washington needed bilateral engagement with Germany to reduce its $65 billion trade surplus with the United States. The Treasury official said that countries with a trade surplus have a role to play in helping to achieve the G20s goals of maintaining strong, sustainable and balanced growth.

Rossello said in an interview that he was invited to Washington for a U.S. congressional hearing on March 22 to discuss the fate of Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, also known as PREPA. The new governor said he is aware that his unwillingness to rubber-stamp the existing deal, whereby PREPAs creditors would take a 15 percent cut on their $8 billion in debt, has vexed stakeholders who thought they were close to a resolution.

If I didnt care, I would have just blown the deal up, Rossello told Reuters. Im not here to destroy a deal, Im here to get a better one, based on the reality that things have changed.  PREPAs fate is one of the most contentious issues on an island facing $70 billion in debt.

Killing people equals killing people, Republican state Senator Steve Fitzgerald said in a phone interview when asked about the comparison on Monday, referring to abortion.  Planned Parenthood is killing more people than they did in Nazi Germany, he said.  The Nazis were responsible for the systematic killing of 6 million Jews, as well as others such as homosexuals, Roma people and political opponents during World War Two. Planned Parenthood provides abortions as well as other womens health services, including birth control and cancer screenings. It has long been a target of conservative Republicans. Fitzgerald has been in the spotlight since Planned Parenthood on Friday made public a letter from the senator in which he wrote that finding out that a donation had been made to the group in his name was as bad - or worse - as having ones name associated with Dachau. Dachau was a Nazi concentration camp estimated to have been the site of nearly 32,000 killings.  In his letter, Fitzgerald castigated the organization and the donor, Kansas City, Missouri, resident Ali Weinel, calling the move an attempt to blacken his name by associating him with a heinous group. Weinel said Monday that she made the donation in the senators name about a month ago after a contentious email exchange with Fitzgerald, in which he expressed disgust over her views on abortion. I was so frustrated by the email exchange that the only thing I could think to do was to donate to Planned Parenthood in his honor, Weinel said. Making donations to the organization in the name of conservative elected officials has become a tactic among some on the left as a way to make a political statement. Planned Parenthood Great Plains spokeswoman Bonyen Lee-Gilmore called Fitzgeralds concentration camp comparison inflammatory. We obviously condemn this extreme ideology, Lee-Gilmore said in a telephone interview on Monday. Lee-Gilmore said that after receiving Weinels donation, the organization had last month sent Fitzgerald a form letter, which his Friday letter was apparently a response to. Fitzgerald called the events political theater on the part of Planned Parenthood.  The letter they sent me was strictly a poke in the eye, Fitzgerald said. And I responded to it.

The move by Trump would be a victory for automakers after months of pushing the new administration to reconsider the rules, which they say would be too expensive, could cost jobs and are out of step with vehicles consumers want to buy. Trump will visit an autonomous vehicle testing facility in a Detroit suburb on Wednesday and meet there with chief executives of several U.S. automakers. His administration has decided to review the feasibility of the vehicle emissions rules, which apply to the years 2022 through 2025, sources told Reuters last week. Former President Barack Obama moved to keep them in the final days of his administration. Reuters reported on the planned announcement on March 3. A formal notice by U.S. regulators to restart the review is expected to be made public on Wednesday.  White House spokesman Sean Spicer said on Monday the trip is focused on job creation and automobile manufacturing... highlighting the need to eliminate burdensome regulations that needlessly hinder meaningful job growth. The chief executives of General Motors Co (GM.N), Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) (FCAU.N) will meet with the president in Ypsilanti Township, Michigan, along with senior officials from Japanese and German automakers, including Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T), Nissan Motor Co (7201.T) and Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE). Trump will hold a roundtable with CEOs and then make a speech to autoworkers and others. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had until April 2018 to decide whether the standards were feasible under a midterm review, but moved up its decision to a week before Obama left office in January. Automakers argue the vehicle emissions rules, which would raise the fleet average fuel efficiency to more than 50 miles per gallon (mpg) by 2025 from 27.5 mpg in 2010, will impose significant costs and are out of step with consumer preferences. They argue they need more flexibility to meet the rules amid low gas prices. Environmentalists, who favor the standards, say the rules will reduce fuel costs and greenhouse gases and have vowed to sue if the Trump administration weakens them. Trade groups representing automakers, including General Motors, Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and Toyota, have asked the EPA to withdraw the determination finalizing the rules, which stem from a 2011 deal the industry reached with the U.S. government. Changing the 2022-2025 fuel rules will require a lengthy regulatory process and environmentalists and Democratic state attorneys general are likely to sue if the Trump administration significantly weakens the requirements. The Obama administration said in 2011 the changes would boost fuel efficiency to a fleet-wide average of 54.5 mpg, save motorists $1.7 trillion in total fuel costs over the life of the vehicles and cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years. The fuel standards were a central part of Obamas legacy on addressing climate change. In July, the EPA estimated the fleet would average only 50.8 mpg to 52.6 mpg in 2025 under the rules because Americans were buying more sport utility vehicles and trucks and fewer cars. Automakers briefed on the meeting do not expect the EPA to take action this week to attempt to prevent California from setting its own vehicle emissions rules. A Trump administration official confirmed it does not intend to address Californias authority this week. Reuters reported last week the EPA is considering taking steps to reverse Californias waiver under the Clean Air Act that allows it to set its own vehicle greenhouse gas emissions standards. Trump has repeatedly met with automaker CEOs since taking office and made boosting employment, especially in the auto sector, a top priority. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"
"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - A group of states renewed their effort on Monday to block President Donald Trumps revised temporary ban on refugees and travelers from several Muslim-majority countries, arguing that his executive order is the same as the first one that was halted by federal courts. Court papers filed by the state of Washington and joined by California, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York and Oregon asked a judge to stop the March 6 order from taking effect on Thursday. An amended complaint said the order was similar to the original Jan. 27 directive because it will cause severe and immediate harms to the States, including our residents, our colleges and universities, our healthcare providers, and our businesses. A Department of Justice spokeswoman said it was reviewing the complaint and would respond to the court.  A more sweeping ban implemented hastily in January caused chaos and protests at airports. The March order by contrast gave 10 days notice to travelers and immigration officials. Last month, U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle halted the first travel ban after Washington state sued, claiming the order was discriminatory and violated the U.S. Constitution. Robarts order was upheld by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Trump revised his order to overcome some of the legal hurdles by including exemptions for legal permanent residents and existing visa holders and taking Iraq off the list of countries covered. The new order still halts citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen from entering the United States for 90 days but has explicit waivers for various categories of immigrants with ties to the country. Refugees are still barred for 120 days, but the new order removed an indefinite ban on all refugees from Syria. Washington state has now gone back to Robart to ask him to apply his emergency halt to the new ban.   Robart said in a court order Monday that the government has until Tuesday to respond to the states motions. He said he would not hold a hearing before Wednesday and did not commit to a specific date to hear arguments from both sides.   Separately, Hawaii has also sued over the new ban. The island state, which is heavily dependent on tourism, said the executive order has had a chilling effect on travel revenues. In response to Hawaiis lawsuit, the Department of Justice in court papers filed on Monday said the president has broad authority to restrict or suspend entry of any class of aliens when in the national interest. The department said the temporary suspensions will allow a review of the current screening process in an effort to protect against terrorist attacks. There is a hearing in the Hawaii case set for Wednesday, the day before the new ban is set to go into effect.  The first hurdle for the lawsuits will be proving standing, which means finding someone who has been harmed by the policy. With so many exemptions, legal experts have said it might be hard to find individuals who would have a right to sue, in the eyes of a court. To overcome this challenge, the states filed more than 70 declarations of people affected by the order including tech businesses Amazon and Expedia, which said that restricting travel hurts their revenues and their ability to recruit employees.  Universities and medical centers that rely on foreign doctors also weighed in, as did religious organizations and individual residents, including U.S. citizens, with stories about separated families. But the Trump administration in its filings in the Hawaii case on Monday said the carve-outs in the new order undercut the states standing claims. The Order applies only to individuals outside the country who do not have a current visa, and even as to them, it sets forth robust waiver provisions, the Department of Justices motion said.  The government cited Supreme Court precedent in arguing that people outside the United States and seeking admission for the first time have no constitutional rights regarding their applications. If the courts do end up ruling the states have standing to sue, the next step will be to argue that both versions of the executive order discriminate against Muslims.  The Trump Administration may have changed the text of the now-discredited Muslim travel ban, but they didnt change its unconstitutional intent and effect, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement on Monday. While the text of the order does not mention Islam, the states claim that the motivation behind the policy is Trumps campaign promise of a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. He later toned down that language and said he would implement a policy of extreme vetting of foreigners coming to the United States. The government said the courts should only look at the text of the order and not at outside comments by Trump or his aides. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

At least nine Republican senators have expressed concerns about the plan, which is moving forward in the House without a clear assessment of its impact on the federal budget or how it would impact the level of health insurance among Americans. The plan would roll back much of former Democratic President Barack Obamas 2010 Affordable Care Act, retain some parts of it and substitute other new parts. Democrats say it goes too far. Some Republican conservatives say it doesnt go far enough. Republicans dominate the House, but have only 52 seats in the 100-seat Senate. Supporters of the Republican plan would need only a simple majority to pass it, under current plans. Here are some Republican senators who have raised questions about the House plan, or outright opposed it: Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky: He has called the plan Obamacare Lite, saying it stops short of full repeal. He has reintroduced a bill to repeal Obamacare that was approved by Republicans a little over a year ago, but was vetoed by Obama. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas: Cruz reportedly said on March 8 that he had significant concerns about the plan and that it could pass the Senate in its current form. But he added he would work hard to improve it. That night, he and his family dined at the White House with Republican President Donald Trump, who has expressed support for the House plan. Senator Mike Lee of Utah: He said on March 7 the plan was a step in the wrong direction and expressed concern that it was not known how much it would cost and whether it would make health care more affordable. Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas: On March 9 he urged the House to pull back, saying the plan could not pass the Senate without changes. Senator Susan Collins of Maine: She has concerns about the House bill. She voted against repealing Obamacare a little over a year ago because it would have taken federal funds from womens healthcare provider Planned Parenthood, which also provides abortion services. The current House bill would strip funds from Planned Parenthood. Senator Rob Portman of Ohio: He and three other senators raised concerns in a letter last week about a Feb. 10 draft of the House plan, saying they wanted to be sure it will protect people enrolled in Obamacares Medicaid expansion. Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado: He signed the letter of concern about the plan. In a March 9 telephone town hall, Gardner reportedly did not say whether the current House bill met his standards on Medicaid. Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska: She also signed the letter of concern about the plans effect on Medicaid. Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia: She, too, signed the letter of concern about the Medicaid impact. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

He is a wealthy real estate magnate from New York who shoots from the hip and enjoys the spotlight. It is hard to imagine two leaders more different, in style or substance, than Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and Donald Trump, the new president of the United States. For months, they have been engaged in an uneasy long-distance skirmish over policy and values. On Friday, they meet for the first time - a high-stakes encounter that will be watched by governments around the world for clues about the future of the transatlantic alliance, a partnership that has helped shape the global order since World War Two but which Trump is threatening to upend. Do I think they are going to become good friends? Probably not. They are very different personalities, said Charles Kupchan, who advised Trumps predecessor Barack Obama on European policy as a member of the National Security Council. But I do think they have a strong interest, both politically and strategically, in learning how to work together. It is arguably the most important meeting with a foreign leader of Trumps presidency. German officials say the detail-oriented Merkel, 62, has been preparing assiduously for her trip. The meeting, initially due on Tuesday, was postponed until Friday due to a severe winter storm expected in Washington. She has watched Trumps speeches and pored over his interviews, including a lengthy Q&A with Playboy magazine from 1990 in which he floats many of the controversial ideas he is now trying to implement as president, they say. Members of her entourage have also analyzed Trumps encounters with other leaders - including Britains Theresa May, Japans Shinzo Abe and Canadas Justin Trudeau - and have had exchanges with some of their counterparts on how to handle the unpredictable former reality-TV star, the officials added.  We have to be prepared for the fact that he does not like to listen for long, that he prefers clear positions and does not want to delve into details, said one senior German official.  On both economic and foreign policy, the divide between the two leaders appears vast. Trump, 70, has called Merkels decision to allow hundreds of thousands of refugees into Germany a catastrophic mistake. He has threatened to impose tariffs on German carmakers that import into the U.S. market. And he has criticized Berlin for not spending more on defense, a longstanding U.S. complaint that Merkel has promised to address. Another source of tension is Germanys 50 billion euro trade surplus with the United States. Trump adviser Peter Navarro has accused Germany of gaining unfair trade advantages through a weak euro. Merkel and her ministers have pointed out that the European Central Bank - and not Berlin - controls the fate of Europes single currency. Russia will also be on the agenda. White House officials have said Trump will seek advice from Merkel on how to deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin.  For her part, Merkel has been critical of Trumps travel ban targeting the citizens of several mainly Muslim countries. In a phone call in January, she explained to Trump that the Geneva Convention obliges signatories, including the United States, to take in war refugees on humanitarian grounds. Merkel is also concerned that Trump, who has repeatedly praised Britains decision to leave the European Union, might continue to undermine the bloc with his rhetoric at a time of deep crisis triggered by the rise of anti-EU populist parties. Europe is in a very fragile, precarious state and Germany is trying to ensure that the European integration project holds together. I suspect the chancellor will want to make this clear to the president, said Anthony Gardner, who served as U.S. ambassador to the European Union until January. This is an opportunity to sketch out areas of common interest, to define a positive agenda, he added. But one meeting wont change the atmosphere on its own.  Trump is the third U.S. president that Merkel, Europes longest-serving leader, has worked with. She established a good rapport with George W. Bush, who was keen to repair ties with Germany after his clash with Merkels predecessor Gerhard Schroeder over the Iraq war. And although relations with Obama got off to an awkward start when Merkel rebuffed his request to speak at the Brandenburg Gate during the 2008 presidential campaign, the two grew close over time, cooperating on sanctions against Russia and launching negotiations on a transatlantic free-trade deal. The parting is hard for me, Merkel acknowledged when Obama visited Berlin in November, a week after Trumps victory. The German leader will be walking a fine line in Washington. With an election looming at home in September, she must avoid offering her political opponents ammunition by cozying up to Trump. Neither can she afford an open confrontation that might damage German interests. One of the biggest concerns in the chancellors camp before the visit is the potential for surprises. Japans Abe had an awkward 19-second handshake with Trump, while May was criticized in some sections of the British media for holding hands with Trump during a stroll at the White House, apparently after he reached out to steady himself. When Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met Trump last month, he and his team spent the day before running through endless scenarios, lines of questioning and role-plays to ensure they were prepared for any scenario. But in the end, they were still taken aback when Trump spoke off the cuff at their news conference on the sensitive issues of settlements and a future Palestinian state. Merkel has admitted to being so uncomfortable with surprises as a child that she drew up her Christmas wish-list months in advance to avoid being caught off-guard by an unexpected gift. With Trump, she might have to expect the unexpected. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

President Donald Trump and Tom Price, Health and Human Services Secretary, have promised to begin transferring more power over health insurance to the states in a three-part process. This would include rule-making to tweak the guidelines under the ACA, the healthcare overhaul bill currently being considered by Congress, and then further legislation. As the administration seeks to repeal Obamacare, it says it will aim to replace the federal oversight on insurance plans with state control. Former President Barack Obamas national healthcare reform law, often called Obamacare, had originally laid out a roadmap for states to have more power in deciding how to implement the law as long as they met four key criteria for so-called state innovation waivers. But in 2015, the Obama administration issued new regulatory guidance that would have tightened the use of such waivers, which were able to be used as of Jan. 1, 2017. However, the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid said in a news release on Monday that the section 1332 waivers could be used to help states receive funding to help offset costs for high-risk patients and premium stabilization programs related to the individual marketplace.   More sick people signed up for insurance in that program than health insurers had anticipated, driving premiums up 25 percent this year on average and raising questions about whether insurers will remain to offer insurance in 2018 during the transition to the new Trump plans. UnitedHealth Group Inc and Aetna Inc largely left the market this year, while Anthem Inc has stayed in for 2017.

A spokeswoman for Ryan, AshLee Strong, said, The speaker clearly disagrees (with King) and believes Americas long history of inclusiveness is one of its great strengths.  King, an early supporter of Donald Trump in last years presidential election, defended his tweet in an interview on CNN on Monday. He pointed to Western Europe, where he said low birth rates were harming civilization, culture and values. Id like to see an America that is just so homogenous that we look a lot the same, he said. I think theres far too much focus on race, especially in the last eight years. I want to see that put behind us. Pressed on birth rates for different groups of Americans, King said: They contribute differently to our culture and civilization. Some of Kings House colleagues appeared to take his tweet personally. What exactly do you mean?, tweeted Republican U.S. Representative Carlos Curbelo of Florida. Do I qualify as somebody elses baby? #concernedGOPcolleague. Democratic Representative Ted Lieu, who immigrated to the United States at age 3, tweeted a picture of his two sons, writing: Dear Representative Steve King: These are my two babies  Representative Ted Lieu. Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush said, America is a nation of immigrants, and added that Kings sentiment doesnt reflect our shared history or values. Bush was one of Trumps Republican rivals for the White House. The tweet also drew fire from the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. The head of the civil and human rights law firm, Sherilyn Ifill, said Kings remarks were an explicit call to return to the shameful period when white supremacy was the norm in American public life.  Ifill said Kings remarks were particularly dangerous at a time when violent hate crimes have reached dangerous levels. King is from a rural state where nearly 92 percent of the population is white, compared with 77 percent for the nation as a whole, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Jeff Kaufmann, head of the Republican Party in Iowa, said in a statement that he disagreed with King, also calling the United States a nation of immigrants and saying that such diversity was its strength.

Republican Sonny Perdue was tapped to head the department the day before Trumps inauguration. Progress on his confirmation has been slow, with media reports suggesting that undoing his various business entanglements caused the delay in the ethics filings. Representatives for Perdue did not immediately respond to calls seeking comment on the delays. The divestiture plan was disclosed in filings posted online over the weekend by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics. Submitting the ethics filings is a key step toward possible confirmation. Perdue, the former governor of Georgia, also said he would resign his positions from the National Grain and Feed Association, the Bipartisan Policy Center Governors Council and the Georgia Agribusiness Council. Perdue has received strong support from agricultural trade groups. The Senate Agriculture Committee has not yet released a schedule for his confirmation hearings.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Aides to U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday attacked the credibility of the nonpartisan agency that will analyze the costs of a replacement for Obamacare, as the White House sought to quell opposition from many conservative Republicans. The Congressional Budget Office, which provides official estimates of the budget impact of proposed legislation, is expected to issue a report as soon as Monday that will assess the healthcare legislation put forward by Republican House of Representatives leaders. The report could influence sentiment toward a bill already under fire from Democrats and some Republicans, especially if it suggests the legislation would reduce the number of Americans with health coverage or worsen U.S. budget deficits. Republicans have long opposed Obamacare, formally called the Affordable Care Act, on the grounds it was government overreach and led to higher insurance premiums. The 2010 law, Democratic President Barack Obamas signature legislation, provided 20 million previously uninsured Americans with health coverage. Trump has called Obamacare a disaster and made its repeal and replacement a key campaign pledge. Several Republican lawmakers said on Sunday the replacement bill was unacceptable in its current form, including  conservative Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, who said the plan could not pass the Senate and could put the Republican House majority at risk in 2018 congressional elections. I believe it would have adverse consequences for millions of Americans and it wouldnt deliver on our promises to reduce the cost of health insurance for Americans, Cotton said. In a series of television interviews, White House budget director Mick Mulvaney and top White House economic adviser    Gary Cohn said the CBO was focusing on the wrong metrics with the estimates it will provide on the number of people who are insured. Cohn and Mulvaney said the CBO should instead should analyze whether patients can actually afford to go to a doctor. I love the folks at the CBO, they work really hard, they do, but sometimes we ask them to do stuff theyre not capable of doing, and estimating the impact of a bill of this size probably isnt the - isnt the best use of their time, Mulvaney told ABCs This Week program. Speaking on Fox News, Gary Cohn, director of the White House National Economic Council, said: We will see what the score is, in fact in the past, the CBO score has really been meaningless.  Theyve said that many more people will be insured than are actually insured. But when we get the CBO score, well deal with that, Cohn said. The Trump administrations criticisms of the CBO are unusual. Prior administrations, both Republican and Democratic, steered clear of attacking the credibility of the agency, which many lawmakers regard as a neutral arbiter. The CBOs current director, Keith Hall, was appointed by Republicans in 2015. The credit rating agency Standard & Poors has estimated 6 million to 10 million people could lose health insurance coverage under the Republican plan. Senator Bernie Sanders, who ran for president in 2016 as a Democrat, said it was cowardly for Republicans to proceed with a healthcare bill without CBO estimates, telling CBS Face the Nation show: This is a disgrace. In recent weeks, Trump administration officials and Republican lawmakers have criticized what they said were overly optimistic estimates from the CBO of the number of Americans who would sign up for health insurance on government-run exchanges. The CBO estimated in 2013 that 22 million people would be purchasing insurance through the exchanges in 2016. Only 10.4 million were signed up for those plans by the middle of last year, according to Department of Health and Human Services data. The House Republican legislation would scrap tax penalties for Americans without health insurance, roll back an expansion of Medicaid insurance for the poor, and replace Obamacares income-based subsidies with a system of fixed tax credits to help people buy private insurance on the open market. Cohn also disputed the notion that millions of people on  Medicaid would become uninsured as Obamacares expansion of the program is rolled back over a period of years. He said many of these people would be transitioned into new private and employer-sponsored plans that would become more affordable under the Republican plan. House Speaker Paul Ryan, the Republican plans top backer in Congress, said he was certain the CBO would show a reduction in the number of Americans with coverage. You know why? Because this isnt a government mandate, Ryan told NBCs Meet the Press. Conservative Republicans said, however, they could not support the plan without significant changes. Republican Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, a founder of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said it did not go far enough to meet Republicans promise to kill Obamacare. We told them we were going to replace it with something that would bring down the cost of insurance. Thats what we told them, Jordan told Fox News Sunday. This legislation that the speakers brought forward doesnt do that. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Two days before U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara was fired, Trump tried to call the high-profile New York prosecutor in what a White House official says was an effort to thank him for his service and to wish him good luck. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is controlled and cautious, a physicist from East Germany who takes her time making decisions and has never relished the attention that comes from being Europes most powerful leader. Trump is a wealthy real estate magnate from New York who shoots from the hip and enjoys the spotlight. On Tuesday, they meet for the first time. When Trump unveils his budget for the 2018 fiscal year on Thursday, conservative Republicans will be cheering proposed cuts to domestic programs that would pay for a military buildup. But more moderate Republicans are less enthusiastic and worry they could be forced to choose between opposing the president or backing reductions in popular programs such as aid for disabled children and hot meals for the elderly.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When Johnathan Smith resigned from the U.S. Justice Department on Inauguration Day, he looked forward to spending time with his infant son, but that plan unraveled a week later when President Donald Trump unveiled his explosive foreign travel ban. Within two weeks, Smith had a new job as legal director of civil rights group Muslim Advocates and was drafting briefs for a successful court challenge to the ban, joining other former top Obama administration lawyers now fighting Trump. It is not surprising that Smith and some of his colleagues, political appointees of Democratic President Barack Obama, would leave the Justice Department now led by Republicans. What is unusual is how fast they have signed up to be Trump adversaries. Some Republican lawyers say they were less hasty in moving into oppositional roles post-election. George Terwilliger, a senior Justice Department official under President George H.W. Bush, described the Obama lawyers actions as unprecedented to my memory  and really bad form. One reason for the Obama lawyers quick moves, some of them said, was Trumps aggressive use of executive authority from day one, which was guaranteed to attract court challenges. Obama faced legal fights over executive power and some of his challengers were formerly lawyers for President George W. Bush, over issues such as immigration and Obamacare. But those came later in Obamas presidency.  Besides Smith, other lawyers who have jumped into the fray include former Attorney General Eric Holder, who is advising Californias legislature on challenging Trump over immigration, environmental regulations and healthcare; and former acting solicitor general Neal Katyal, who is helping Hawaii contest Trumps revised travel ban. Influential Manhattan prosecutor Preet Bharara and another 45 Obama-era U.S. attorneys are out of jobs after the Trump administration asked them to resign on Friday. Many of the Obama lawyers keep in touch, but reject the notion, proffered by some Republicans, that Obama is behind resistance efforts. Some of the lawyers credit their rapid transition to Trumps hardline positions on key issues and to ethical concerns about his presidency and business interests. Theres a unique threat to our democracy and Constitution that we see in the assault the president is mounting on the Muslim community, said Smith, who worked on religious discrimination issues at the Justice Department. Norman Eisen, who was Obamas top ethics lawyer and later ambassador to the Czech Republic, had expected to focus on his work at a think tank after Trumps election. But instead, he said, the ethics emergency of constitutional dimensions has galvanized me back into my initial Obama role.  Eisen is now also chairing Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a watchdog group he co-founded. The group has already sued Trump over alleged ethics violations. Other Obama appointees taking on Trump include former White House lawyer Ian Bassin who has founded United to Protect Democracy, a new group probing Trump over ethics; and James Cadogan, who worked with Smith at the Justice Department, and is now at the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, a civil rights group already clashing with the new administration. Some career government lawyers, who are not political appointees and normally do not resign in power shifts, have also resigned to oppose Trump. One is Sharon McGowan, who worked on LGBT issues at the Justice Department. On Inauguration Day, she was offered a job as director of strategy at Lambda Legal, an LGBT advocacy group. McGowan said she decided to leave Justice when Trump named Jeff Sessions, a hardline conservative Alabama senator, to be attorney general. That was a game-changer, she said. I knew there would be no chance for me to preserve what Ive been working on so hard. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

U.S. President Donald Trump has already withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement, which was seen as an economic pillar of the strategy.     A Trump administration official told Reuters: The vice president is going to Asia next month I believe. The tour will include South Korea and Australia, the Nikkei Asian Review reported, with North Koreas missile and nuclear programs and South Koreas political crisis likely topics for discussion. China has been infuriated by South Koreas plan to deploy a U.S. missile defense system targeted at the North Korean threat. South Korea is also going through political turmoil after a court removed President Park Geun-hye from office over a graft scandal. Pence is also expected to visit Tokyo for a U.S.-Japan economic dialogue, according to a source familiar with the matter. The visit will come as North Koreas latest missile launches and the assassination in Malaysia of North Korean leader Kim Jong Uns estranged half-brother add urgency to the regions security. It will also follow this months trip by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to Japan, South Korea, and China. The TPP had been the main economic pillar of the Obama administrations pivot to the Asia-Pacific region in the face of a fast-rising China. Proponents of the pact have expressed concerns that abandoning the project, which took years to negotiate, could strengthen Chinas economic hand in the region at the expense of the United States. Indonesias chief security minister said Pence would meet President Joko Widodo to discuss terrorism and other security issues. Indonesia has the worlds largest Muslim population and has recently grappled with a series of low-level militant attacks inspired by Islamic State. We discussed the planned visit of U.S. vice president Mike Pence to Indonesia and the strategic problems that can be on the agenda to discuss with our president, chief security minister Wiranto told reporters after meeting the U.S. ambassador to Jakarta. He added that no dates have been finalized. In Indonesia, Pence is also expected to discuss a brewing contract dispute between the government and American mining group Freeport McMoRan Inc, said two Indonesian government sources. Freeport has threatened to take the Indonesian government to court over newly revised mining regulations that have prompted a major scale-back in its operations in the eastern province of Papua.
